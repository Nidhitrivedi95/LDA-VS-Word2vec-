HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ Ginbu has great Sushi and dishes in general, also love their lettuce wraps. It's definitely casual and good for take out as well- but I love that it's reasonably priced and they just do a good job overall. I've been here many times and have never had a bad experience, it's one of our favorites!
