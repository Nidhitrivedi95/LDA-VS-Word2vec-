W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ The service was outstanding.  From the host greeting to the servers' attentiveness and pleasant demeanor, it makes it a little difficult to rate the restaurant so poorly due to the food.

I had the braised ox tail, fiancée had the Logan poser ramen.  Chef came by and said the ox tail would take a while to cook so gave us a pickled vegetable dish to help pass the time.  Like I said earlier, great service.

The pickles were crunchy which I like.  The pickling sauce was on the salty side....too much soy sauce?  

The ox tail only took 15 minutes so that wasn't long at all.  It was on the rubbery side and was very bland.  I braise ox tails quite often, I think sushi needs to revamp the sauce and maybe employ the use of a pressure cooker...I make ox tail dishes and they always come out with meat falling off the bone.

The poser ramen was also bland.  The noodles tasted like they were the dry noodles that come out of the bag.  The broth was also very bland....tasted like hot water.  

I want this place to do well because I saw how hard the staff was working and the service was great.

But based on the offerings I ate, I don't think the food is up to vegas' standards.
