U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q I just read some reviews that completely match my experience of Beijing Noodle # 9--great service, great decore, but very average food, and insanely inflated prices. This may be why we had no wait for a table, at all. The Beijing style hand pulled noodle with beef was fine but really it did not possess much depth of flavor. I loved the Spicy fish the waiter recommended, and I also liked Buddha beer, which I hadn't tried before, but neither was different from what I'd find elsewhere for half the price.  So, if you're here and you really want this food and you can't just drive over to Spring Mountain, i guess go here, but be warned.
