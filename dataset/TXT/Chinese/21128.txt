68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw First time here. Tried to come 5 or 6 times and either had just missed or they were closed days off. This place is amazing everything was just perfection . I had the traditional Hainen chicken and rice poached egg on rice with Chinese sausage. THE BOMB! Worth every drive over here to find a closed shop. I find poached chicken can end up either bland or rubbery this was not. Truly will share the word thus place is a must try.# new favorite!
