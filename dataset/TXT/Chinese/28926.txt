A few years ago, the restaurant renovated their decor (lots of gold accents), changed their plates and bamboo steaming baskets, and has a menu that is constantly evolving. The changes were beneficial in making the restaurant feel upscale to match their quality of food.

Some highlights were the: 
Deep fried short ribs
Huge har gow (shrimp dumplings) that came with a sweet shrimp in each basket
Shrimp and beef steam rice rolls
Deep fried taro with quail eggs. 

Overall, the dishes came out hot and beautifully presented, with dumplings presented in square bamboo steamers.

The only disappointment during our visit was the egg custard bun. Before the renovations, Dragon Boat fusion used to make the best duck yolk custard buns that I have ever eaten, as the fillings were salty and sweet, and the egg custard would flow out of the bun when opened.

As for the service, I have had a hit and miss at each visit. We have had rude servers that had forgotten our requests frequently, and then we have had stellar service where our requests were taken care of immediately. At our most recent visit, we only waited about 15 minutes for our reserved table and had a wonderful server who was attentive.
