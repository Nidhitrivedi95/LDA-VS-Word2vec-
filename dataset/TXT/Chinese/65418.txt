EbgUkmDxPUa2fr0rc8EFJQ I wasn't impressed with this experience at all. The lettuce wraps were great but that's about all that was positive. The chicken and broccoli was ehh and my husbands order of chang's spicy chicken was really sweet. The most underwhelming part was the incredibly small portion of rice they give you!
