W8xPHUqL088jdcmNZyH-eA I'm happy to see an authentic Chinese place has opened in Henderson. The atmosphere is basic like you'd expect to see in a Chinatown strip mall noodle spot. Makes sense since this is restaurant #2 for the original Noodle Pot in Chinatown. 

The noodle dishes were fairly good. I like more spice so I loaded up on the chili paste on the table. They serve boba drinks here too so the kids will get their happiness fill too.
