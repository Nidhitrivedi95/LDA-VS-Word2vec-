1DkpdmcxLCRXAdEi6TdOFw Hit and miss, food are very flavourful, lamb skewers <U+7F8A><U+8089><U+4E32>, cold noodles <U+51C9><U+7C89>, sometimes good, other times, they out too much salt, too much sesame oil, the preserved vegetable fish stew was a DISASTERS, the vegetables <U+9178><U+83DC> had no flavour, it was borderlining gross. Hot sizzle pot <U+5E72><U+9505>was good, but I suspect they use packaged flavouring because I had same package before
