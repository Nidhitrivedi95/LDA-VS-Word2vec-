z_XUh5ep_Fj8s95SlriNZw Dr. Brookman is the best. She is very attentive and talks to you about where your pain is and once she is done getting you setup checks on you but other than that leaves you to relax.  I was worried about acupuncture and she has made me a believer.  I highly recommend her to everyone looking for a acupuncturist.
