rntKF4Dm9JIJoSNi5XqRsQ Environment -  not much to say on this front.  What you see is what you get. Only reason why this place got 4/5 stars

Service - okay, nothing to complain about

Food - Great dumplings!! And lots to choose from.  Noodles are always very good and very hot, my pet peeve is soup that gets cold after 5 mins of being served.  Must try their cold dishes too, spicy port or drunken chicken.

Pricing - great cheap food. I always want to over order because of how great the pricing is.  Your money goes a long way here!
