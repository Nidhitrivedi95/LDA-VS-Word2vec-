This is a authentic Yunnan style noodle house. What's specially about yunnan noodle is they are made of rice. So similar to Vietnamese pho, but the broth and ingredients are very different. Super flavorful and the price is very reasonable. 
My favorite dish is the shredded chicken and traditional noodle soup. But try as many dishes as you can, you won't be sorry,
