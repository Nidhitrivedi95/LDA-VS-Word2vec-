bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug I checked out this Scarborough hole-in-the-wall based on it's rating and good reviews here on yelp...

It did not live up to expectations.  

Staff was unfriendly and dismissive.  The fact that they do not speak English, and I do speak English only does not excuse rude and dismissive treatment of customers.

Food was unimpressive.  I ordered the chili chicken and the crispy shrimp, both dishes that were reccomended by yelpers.  The chili chicken arrived lukewarm.  which makes me suspicious that it was reheated, rather than freshly made.  The shrimp were more in line with what I would expect from Mandarin, doughy batter and rubbery, overcooked shrimp.  In addition, the rice that was supposed to accompany my chili chicken did not arrive until the end of the meal -- regardless of my many pleadings attempts to flag down passing staff.

Not impressed.  Take all positive reviews with a grain of salt, and do not expect fireworks.  More like run on the mill food.
