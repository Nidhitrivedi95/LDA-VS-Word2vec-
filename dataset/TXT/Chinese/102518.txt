kIaqY45GaVX136dXomREcg Pretty good place for some hot "Americanized Asian" food. I can't give it a 4 star because it's definitely a really standard Americanized Chinese food location, nothing close to authentic. However, I still enjoy my hot Asian food once in a while. The taste of the food here is not bad, and it's a popular takeout place. You do have the option of sitting down if you want, but they only have a few tables available.

We tried the Singaporean Noodle and the Malaysian Style Beef - both came out very hot, which I really like. They were both very flavorful as well, except I wish Malaysian Style Beef had more veggies in them and not just all onions. Portions were okay.

If you happen to be in the area and is looking for some hot food, this place is worth a try, but I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat here.
