bK7DXRrvaoJbivr4y0pH7A Filthy! filthy! filthy! Brought the fan in at 4pm and I guarantee it hasn't been cleaned since opening. Had to sweep off (let alone wash off) our table, there were no forks. I'm sure I'll have explosive diarrhea as soon as I get home! What a mistake. This will be my last $40 spent at this site for sure!!!
