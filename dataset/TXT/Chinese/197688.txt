ztcdHj6EpUD7EemcntSsrg Been here twice, so far pretty good.  Lunch specials are good price (~$5.55), and fairly good portion of food.

(lunch) Kung Pao chicken here is amazing, love the flavor and variety. Quite spicy (though from what I hear you can request it not to be spicy).

(lunch) Tried a little of my friend's orange chicken, the sauce and texture of the chicken was good (crunchy/crispy, if I recall right).

(dinner) Teriyaki Chicken was just alright though, the sauce seemed strong.

Plan on coming back again, maybe for more that non- or light spicy kung pao
