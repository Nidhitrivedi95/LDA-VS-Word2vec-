Fj0zObYm5McHcbtE6MSU0A I live in the area so I stop by this place all of the time. The staff is lovely, boba is always delicious, and the food is always fast and good! Their egg corn flower soup is just what I need when I have a cold. My go to menu item is the eggplant and tofu dish, it's so delicious! Definitely do yourself a favor and stop by this delicious restaurant.
