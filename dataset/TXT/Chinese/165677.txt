The Moo goo gai pan is sooo delicious.  And don't get me started on the Won TON soup. So freaking good. And the sizes are big, especially for the price. I love their homemade pepper and oil melody for the soup.  And I must have an egg roll everytime I visit.
The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because I have tried a couple other menu items that I could totally pass on for the rest of my life
