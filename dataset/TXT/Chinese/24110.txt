6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ I'm totally a fan of this place!

Reading the less than stellar reviews .. I was wary- but when a number of people mentioned that it was an "above average" establishement.. I was willing to give it a try. I'm very glad I did. 

While it's true that there is nothing over-the-top, or stand out about what they do .. What they do offer, is well executed and really delicious. 

Since it was my first try I stuck to favorites like Singapore style noodles, Bok Choy, and Pork Dumplings. All delicious and served up hot! 

I highly recommend it for good, fresh eats - and open until 2 am! All factors in what I like about a quality and delicious Asian style restaurant :)

I will be back - Happy Eating !
