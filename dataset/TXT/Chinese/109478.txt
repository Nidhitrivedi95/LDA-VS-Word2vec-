LoB-Ho9DRsNcWkoz_a_vJA This place is super tacky , the menu is in disarray stuff crossed out with pen . The pho is poor quality , refer to my pic I posted . There's hardly any meat and what meat there is turned out dry and very poor quality . The spring rolls where good . The water had a funny taste . I was really disappointed .
