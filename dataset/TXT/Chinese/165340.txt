uZZnIe0KJEpFlJlYedrQsg Food was okay, but the service was terrible. The waitress took a long time to get our order, then we waited close to an hour for food to arrive. Entrees came out separately and the last person to be served (there were three of us) had to wait another 5-10 minutes. Other parties who came after us were served and finished their meals before we even got our food. Won't be going back there anytime soon.
