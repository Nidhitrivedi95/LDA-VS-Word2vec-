VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ I used to come here a long time ago when I worked up here on rain tree and the 101.  It's been atleast 5-6 years. Best thing about this place is that it has not changed a bit with the quality of food and service. I really enjoyed this place, atmosphere, friendly service, quick food. We got here when it opened so it was not busy yet, but people started rolling in right away. I ordered my all time favorite teriyaki chicken and some crab puffs. Both were exceptional. I will be coming back regularly since I work in the area again. I recommend trying it out, it might not be your kind of place. But see for yourself, you shouldn't be dissapointed.
