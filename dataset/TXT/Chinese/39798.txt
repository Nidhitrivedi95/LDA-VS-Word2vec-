If you like Chinese adaptions on western-style foods, I would definitely recommend! Come at lunch though because that's when the lunch specials are very friendly for your wallet! 

I got the baked teriyaki chicken, and others with me ordered baked chicken breast with tomato sauce on rice, the pork cutlet/ fish filet duo on rice, and the picked vegetable noodle soup! All choices were very good but lacked vegetables. We ordered an additional place of steamed cabbages that tasted absolutely AMAZING!
