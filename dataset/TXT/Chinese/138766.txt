Qqu_MRaus17-4VVmzXq1_g Ming Ming, every time I come around yo city Ming Ming.  You would think this is your typical Chinese restaurant located in Richmond Hill, but you are wrong my friend.  No matter what time of day or day of the week, this place is rammed to the brim.  Yes people that want to get their egg coated lobster on, or people simply coming to gaze at their Chinese porcelain decor head to Mings.

I came here with the GF and fam, and they loved it.  The food here is not only fresh, it's delicious.  Probably the first place I have ever tried egg battered oysters or fried yellow-fin Garoupa cooked to perfection.  In fact the Garoupa here is the best I've had in Tdot, and I stand by that!

Service here is typical for this part of town, but the food comes out mega quick and their dishes and utensils are spick and span.  Order with caution though, the dishes are ginormous and super rich.  Expect to loosen up your belt a bit after a session at this joint!
