t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA Honestly, this place is great. Has extremely authentic Chinese food. The restaurant has moved multiple times from being a extremely small shack in a nearby small town to a much bigger location, where it is now. 

Extremely good, but sometimes the food is definitely not as good because of the number of customers.
