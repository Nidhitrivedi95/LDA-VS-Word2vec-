z01_gDUfmedOuX2UZYF33w DO NOT EAT HERE! The food isn't fit for human consumption. It was all very old, and greasy. A friend of mine claimed this was her favorite place to eat, and took me here for lunch one day. Absolutely disgusting food. I left this place with the most excruciating headache-I'm assuming from all of the MSG in the food. I ended up throwing up for several hours that day from eating here.
