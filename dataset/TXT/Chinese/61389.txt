DQMaUSbKsRtB5lJD3egqxQ My order: Pad Thai with Chicken, crab rangoon, and pot stickers. All were awful! The pad thai was NOT pad thai. It was a mess of broken noodles, a couple bean sprouts, and some boiled chicken. It had no flavor - none of that great sweet/sour/spicy that I love about pad thai. It couldn't be rescued either with the ingredients I had at home.

The crab rangoon was flavorless cream cheese in a thick wonton wrapper. I took a couple bites and threw it out. The sweet and sour sauce came in packets.

The pot stickers were wrapped in THICK wrappers which made them gummy and unappetizing. The dipping sauce was plain soy sauce in a cup.

Worst dinner ever. I'll never order from here again.
