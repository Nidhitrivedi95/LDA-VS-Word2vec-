2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q 5/17: Located in Gold Coast casino. I had passed by many times before, but never bothered to try it. My good friend introduced me to this place, and I have been back repeatedly since! 

Friendly, beautiful staff, and awesome food! The Minced Beef and Fried Egg is excellent (super huge portion, and I usually finish my plates clean!). And you have to try the Beef Medallion! The Chrysanthemum Tea is a nice, sweet balance to your meal. 

The only downside is the pricing, which can be expected since it's located inside a casino. I'd still say it ranks in my top 5 Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. A must try!
