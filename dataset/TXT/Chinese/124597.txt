oTBKmF-wFyq5k7fEXdkAuQ Ordered steamed spareribs at this place. It was 80% fat and 20% tough meat that I couldnt even bite through. Keep in mind this was pork, not beef. Also took ridiculously long to arrive. Its healthy because there's really zero flavour. If you didnt add seasoning to your cooking Im sure you could cut down a lot of calories too.
