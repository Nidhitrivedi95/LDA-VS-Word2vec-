0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA After reading some of the reviews about Cylco I had to come back to write my own. Cyclo was highly recommended by several colleagues and I had to try it for myself to see what the buzz is about. 

First off, for all you who come from somewhere else...Like "The Bay" or "New York" or wherever you come from...? Just as a reminder you currently live in Arizona! I'm from Louisiana where there are also a lot of great Vietnamese restaurants, but who cares...I live here. 

My most cherished dish here is the X.L. Beef Noodle Pho Soup. It includes braised brisket, rare sirloin, rice noodles and all the fixings so be prepared with a huge bowl if you get this to-go. If you think 12 bucks is too much for this bowl, go to some fast food franchise. The location is relatively small and intimate with ambient lighting in the evening. Additionally this is a BYOB establishment so feel free to bring your own wine or spirits...Try that at other Vietnamese restaurants!

Justine is mind-blowing and awesome in her own way! She's the owner and also works at the establishment. She's straight forward and not afraid to speak her mind so she's not for the weak hearted. When dining in, she makes her way to every table to ensure your dish suits your desire. 

I hope this was informative and most importantly...Enjoy your meal.
