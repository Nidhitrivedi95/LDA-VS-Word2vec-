yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Now open 24 hours. If you're hungry after partying on the strip or in downtown, try this place. The place is always jam packed and very noisy. It gets rowdier in the wee hours of the morning. There's always a wait period of about 15 minutes because it's one of the places locals frequently go to. However, the place needs a makeover...dirty floors and outdated decorations. We usually order the spring roll, crispy fried noodles and the bun bo hui. The food is good, the price is reasonable, and the service is fast. I gave it a 3 stars because there's no 3 1/2 stars choice. If you're not after ambiance and you don't mind the rowdiness, go for it for the food and the fast service! Besides, how can you go wrong with the name!
