FanQrSh9QTDytonKHt9C6Q Very scrumptious!! dishes come in small size so you can try more different plates. The sushi imitation are awesome! so real and so yummy. Everything is more than I expected. I personally like the fried tofu, squid, shrimp and the Thai and general chicken, and more i just cannot remember the names lol if you are a vegetarian you should go try at least once! highly recommend!
