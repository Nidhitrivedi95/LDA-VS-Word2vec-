ceuvH6NpDhpT1p4q1w93pA This place has a sprawling menu (far too much for just one trip) but after two months traveling in China--this is the only place I've found that has food that feels as good. The first time I went in, only one other table was occupied (and there are lots of tables); the second time, every table was occupied or being turned around.

It's family run and the service is polite. The beef roll is very good; this time I tried their spicy pulled pork flatbread creation and ordered two more to take home.

It took a sec. to find at the tip of Monona--I doubt you'll regret tracking it down.
