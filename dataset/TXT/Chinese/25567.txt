Another Portlandia type restaurant in Vegas. It's crazy! Can hipster really take over the over-the-top Las Vegas? Maybe.

I ordered the Loco Moco with fried rice. I ate during the lunch hour. Luckily, I had leftovers to enjoy later. I don't want to over-review this place because I think they're still growing in to their niche and figuring things out. I'd like to go back in three months. I enjoyed my food greatly. The staff was nice. The place fashionably decorated.

Don't eat there if you have high sodium levels! Or just drink lots of water to offset.
