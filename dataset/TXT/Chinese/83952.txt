He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw I went to this restaurant because I wanted to try the Mango Special Golden Toast. Knowing that it takes a long time to prepare (menu says 30 minutes), I ordered it right away after I got seated. I told the waitress that I want it right away...not after food items.  The little ordering ticket even said "serve first". I patiently waited (not just for my dessert but all food took a long time to be served). When I finally saw the Mango Golden Toast came out, the waitress took it to another table which clearly came after me. By this time, I have already waited 50 minutes.  the waitress didn't apologize or admit her mistake and just said it will be a few more minutes.  That's awful!!!! It doesn't matter what the food tasted anymore. The experience was awful. The service is bad. The food took a super long time and the restaurant wasn't even full. I am definitely not going back again!!!
