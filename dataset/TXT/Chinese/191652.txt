I got the orange chicken and asked them to spice it up. They brought it out really quick, almost frighteningly quick. With it came a side of rice.

I went there on a date and really enjoyed the experience. My only concern was that the walls were plain, but that's just a little hurdle to get past.

Thumbs up!
