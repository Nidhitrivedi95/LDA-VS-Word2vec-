NSGFzlDGs71v43Y7a1XH0A Came here on a Saturday for lunch over the long weekend... decided to give this place a try after seeing all the flyers and lawn flags they had in my neighborhood over the past few months.

This place seems to have a little bit of everything from bubble tea to bbq items (duck, pork, tofu) to fried rice and noodles to oysters/fish/lobster; a rather odd mix.

We ordered 3 dishes between 4 adults (fried vermicelli, fried rice and a noodle with meat sauce). They have a introductory promotion where you can add a dish of bbq of your choice for $1.. they give you a small plate as a sampler, not bad.

The food here is decent, one of my complaints would be the portions for the price. The fried rice/noodle dishes average to be about ~$10 each and the portions are really quite small, enough for each person to have 1-1.5 bowls.. something similar at Congee Queen you would get 1.5x more! Additionally, they do not have breakfast/lunch combos like most other places...as I would have expected. They have afternoon tea but the menu is quite limited.

We were one of two tables there on a Saturday lunch hour..which is a little concerning. The service was great, very friendly and helpful staff.
