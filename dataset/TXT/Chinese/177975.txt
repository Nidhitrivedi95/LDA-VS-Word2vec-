x-H-2BYL2XoDDLiub950Ag I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for authentic spicy Chinese food! The taste of most dishes here can even beat some local restaurants' in Hunan. After traveling across U.S. and having tried dozens of other Sichuan/Hunan cuisine restaurants, my parents and I all agree that this one has food that's both most delicious and cheap.
