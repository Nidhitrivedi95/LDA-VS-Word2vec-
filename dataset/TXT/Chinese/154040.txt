td-NOo-k4xhfVmO5X92uAg Definitely the best noodle joint on the east side.  I am so glad to have a good place to grub so close to my house as I often find myself driving great lengths to grub something nice.  I'm a big fan of the black mushroom noodle and usually opt to indulge in that.  But, if I plan on deviating at all, I usually go with the egg and tomato noodle soup.  Soooo goooddd!  Definitely a fan and definitely coming back for more whenever I get the urge to noodle up.
