t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA Yes, the incredible number of choices can be daunting- but oh the fun you will have trying things out!  Food comes out straight from the stove (be careful with that first bite) and is well worth the wait.

One of the reviewers mentioned a review in the Champaign Taste blog that might give you ideas of what to order. Another blogger has been posting pictures and descriptions at http://goldenharborchineserestaurant.blogspot.com/. 

I was inspired by one the pictures to order #896 (Snow pea leaves with King Mushrooms) - which included the greens and two kinds of thinly sliced mushrooms in a savory brown sauce (with lots of whole garlic cloves). Wow. In Hawaii, we would say "broke da mouth"!

A warning - we arrived at 5:30 PM on a Saturday, and a lot of the tables were already reserved (which meant not a lot of tables left for walk-ins). If you have a party of more than 2-4 you might want to call ahead on a weekend.  Even if you have to wait, it will be well worth it!
