X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Horrible place. Unless you pay for a table expect to be squeezed into a tiny dance floor with everybody else with 3 tiny entrances to squeeze into. Extremely overpriced, expect to pay even for water and soda. The bouncers are especially bad, they act as if they own the place even though you payed a hefty amount just to get in
