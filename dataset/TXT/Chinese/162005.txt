ujBk7cdEvo5FkD1e0Gzq1Q If I had written this review when I initially started going to Dragon Wok about 6 years ago, this might have been 4-stars. At the time, I was really happy there was a decent Chinese place for quick eats and pick-up close-by.

Over the last few years, the quality (and quantity) of the ingredients has been going downhill.  Years ago the chow mein was made with good-quality, thick noodles - which are now much thinner and (tonight) over-cooked.  I ordered Shrimp Chow Mein (which I used to love) for pick-up - when we got it back home we received a pound and a half of over-cooked noodles (I actually weighed it) along with approx. 1/4 cup of veggies comprised mainly of onions, a little carrot & some cabbage and literally 7 medium-small sized shrimp (I counted). Ridiculous noodle-to-anything-else-ratio. 

I'm pretty easy-going and I don't get miffed about my food much - but this kind of presentation and lack of quality just irritates the heck out of me. Come on Dragon Wok - you're my local Chinese place and I'm in your corner!  I would gladly love you if you gave me something to love!
