Nvd7jbpKcFhpFlWOivEH6A My personal go to fast food chinese buffet. $8 for all you can eat lunch special. 

Good selection. Place is dated and food quality so so. But price can't be beat. Egg rolls are the best I've ever had. General Tao is good, and they even have deep fried spare ribs, which I have not found any where else. Not a place to bring a date! Service is fast and friendly. 

Located on dorval Ave, adequate parking in the back. Have had take out , but prefer the buffet. Dessert selection is ok , but I don't go for the desserts. Supper is about $12. Good crowd on Sunday's, which is the cheapest day for the lunch buffet.
