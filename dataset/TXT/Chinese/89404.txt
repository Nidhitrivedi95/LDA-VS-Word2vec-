I7eqTdTmRTWYwF9HNZAHxw Great decor, good food, generous portions, and good service. Loved the pick 4 appetizers and papaya salad platter - wasn't too sweet and was served with chicken and sticky rice. We tasted the chicken larb and didn't touch it again. If we lived here we would come back again (and we would have told them their larb was off).
