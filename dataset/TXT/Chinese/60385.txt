I asked nicely for a refund, and was refused. After a huge argument, the owner told me I had to come in for a refund. Ubering there and back would cost me half the price of my meal. They finally agreed to send the driver back, yet I'm still waiting. The food was 45 minutes late as well, and after a single bite, I feel sick to my stomach. Never order food from here.
