Q-IhOXiYdyB3BQ-NR5XEWA Don Matesz's Barefoot Health Care Center is an amazing place of healing.  Don combines his expert knowledge of Traditional Chinese medicine with an expert knowledge in holistic nutrition to offer services that will change your life.

The clinic is centrally located in Phoenix near 32nd and Indian School and is centrally located to most of the valley. 

His pricing is incredible and so cheap you don't need to worry about the hassles of medical insurance.  He works on a sliding scale based on your current financial situation.... basically you pay what you can afford, based on the honor system.  Don's goal is to help you get better, not to get rich.

I can not recommend this place enough.... if you are in pain, taking medications, or are facing surgery, go here first.
