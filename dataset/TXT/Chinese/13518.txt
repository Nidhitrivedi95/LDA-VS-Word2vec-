2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q In town for the '13 WSOP event 18, getting out to the Chinatown of Las Vegas was difficult with a heavy poker itinerary and large group but luckily the Gold Coast casino hotel has a couple of choices for Chinese food.

I ordered the beef and onion flat rice noodle. It is basically just that as the flat rice noodles had a decent wok-seared flavor and the beef was seasoned well. It's similar to the beef flat rice noodle dish at Ping Pang Pong (in same casino) but without the bean sprouts.

My friend ordered what ended up as a 'house special lo mein'. It's not on the menu but they made something that ended up like it. The chicken, beef, and shrimp had only a few pieces and the lo mein was more on the wet side.

This is a sort of place that's between a fast food sort and a sit-down. We hit the spot around 3pm and it wasn't busy at all. Service was okay and our refills were pretty well taken care of. If Ping Pang Pong hadn't been closed between 3-5pm I wouldn't have gone here. But we just drove into town and didn't feel like going too far.
