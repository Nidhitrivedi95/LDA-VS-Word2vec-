TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ This used to be my fav spot 3 years ago. don't know what happened to them but last month i ordered lemon chicken and found a piece of glass in it.  I called to complained but suddenly no one spoke english. Today:
I ordered cashew chicken.  I found a shrimp tail in it.  At first I thought it was a cockroach wing, but no after totally examining it, I have decided for the sake of my sanity and health its a shrimp tail.  I hate seafood. I will not be eating here anymore.
