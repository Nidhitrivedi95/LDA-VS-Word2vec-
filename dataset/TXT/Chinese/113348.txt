mofOjB6flg-eAWOFbOkHfQ This place stinks! The service was lousy and food was below par.  The floors seemed to be sticky in some areas and wet in others which might cause an injury.  We went for dinner service and made a reservation for this place and was charge a reservation fee (not disclosed).  

We had hot tea at our table and yet we were charged per cup.  If a single person orders tea, the customer would get a pot and a cup.  But we were charged 7 teas for only 2 pots and 7 cups.  A huge markup on tea!  Also, we were told that they ran out of hot tea (which was found to be untrue later on).  How hard is it to have boiling water and tea leaves?  We were told that the tea was made in a large pot made in the morning to be served throughout the day. So not fresh tea is served to customers.

When we complained and ask for the manager, a manager was not brought to our table and instead the staff was deciding who wanted to be "the manager."

Large selection of food, ranging from sushi to stir fry.  The food was some warm at best and some of the sushi was not fresh.  I suggest doing the stir fry if you want a hot meal.

Finally, what was disgusting is the employees were wrapping napkins to the eating utensils after servicing guests and touching the fork and spoons heads without washing their hands.  This is unhygienic and extreme unprofessional.  If you want clean utensils, I suggest the disposable chopsticks or bring your own fork and spoon.

The only reason why this only given one star was that the ice cream machine misspelled "swirl" with "swril".  I had the "swril" =)

Please look elsewhere for Chinese food.  Your stomach will thank you and you will definitely have better service than this dump.
