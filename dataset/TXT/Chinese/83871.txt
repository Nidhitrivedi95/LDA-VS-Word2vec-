He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw Petit Potato is a good place to go if you want to grab a bite to eat with friends or SO. I find that the decor is very cute and reminds me a lot of the cafes back in Asia. The two seaters can be quite uncomfortable and small if you order multiple dishes so if you can go into a booth definitely request for it. I found the food be quite mediocre. I've eaten multiple times and I was never wowed away by the food. I've had the omirice, the seafood ramen and durian pancakes. All dishes were a 6/10, I felt like I could've made it at home or I could've gone to another restaurant. Also if you try the toast dessert please make sure you have an appetite and sharing with atleast 4-6 people. 

Pros:
- cute decor 
- a lot of seating 
- fair amount of parking 
- great food presentation 

Con:
- Price isn't bad but it's not exactly cheap either 
- food quality could be better
