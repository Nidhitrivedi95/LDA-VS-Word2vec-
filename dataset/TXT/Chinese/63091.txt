DwmAsemahJywywhuqv5J1Q Sichuan Gourmet is a really incredible authentic restaurant as long as you plan to eat off of the Chinese Menu rather than the American one.  There are so many authentic options that makes it easy for everyone to find something.  For those who want something on simpler side, the basil chicken is sweet and flavorful, however, the authentic kung pao chicken is one of my personal favorites.  The restaurant is not very formal, but it is still a friendly atmosphere. The service is alright, but can sometimes be a bit slow.  

Overall, this is great place to find authentic Chinese food that can't really be matched by any other place in Oakland.
