lcSsIw_oC-OT2veksCtRwg It's taken me 8 years to try China Way.  Looking back I see it as lost time.  What impressed me was the quantity of freshly cooked veggies and proteins served.  
i ordered take out Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, a dish I have come to love when I lived in NYC. Instead of making the sauce with egg whites, they used the whole egg which appeared like scrambled eggs in the sauce.  I do not like scrambled eggs.  The sauce was very tasty, the onions fresh and crunchy and a least a half pound of good sized shrimp sweet and fresh tasting, perfectly cooked!  Bright green, crunchy broccoli was in the dish as well as some mushroom slices.  The best dish was Mongolian Chicken with white and green onions, ordered extra spicy.  I couldn't believe the quantity of sliced chicken breast and the great and not too spicy sauce.  Truly a 5 star dish.  All the above came with 4 very large scoops of white rice.  Fresh crunchy fortune cookies ended the meal.  Eighteen dollars and change for more food than my wife and I could actually eat.  We plan to check out many of their menu options.  How can you beat quality fresh ingredients in large quantities?
