-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg A buddy and I dined here on a Saturday night while in town for a meeting.  It was easy to get a table though all of the booths were taken.  We both had a "33" to drink, which was my first Vietnamese beer since visiting Hanoi in '99.  We had a couple of great apps, mine was bo nuong la, and I had bun saigon for my entree.  Everything was tasty and seemed very authentic.  The sevice was great too.  Next time I'm in Cleveland I'll try to pay another visit.
