ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ I've been here many times because my family keeps choosing this place for birthdays and get-togethers. They like that there's plenty of choices so everybody finds something to eat, including picky children. 

I prefer dinner here because they serve peking duck at night. There's a fresh dragon noodle station, and lots of traditional Chinese dishes. They have a small dim sum station. My family likes the various sea food options they serve, including crab legs at the cold bar. They have sushi as well; the sashimi is served to you by someone behind the counter but you can grab the maki and nigiri yourself. 

The dessert station has a decent selection, which included a sugar free cake amongst the other baked goods the last time I went there. There are cookies and waffles and ice cream and Nanaimo bars. There's fresh fruit at the cold bar.

The place is mainly decorated in black, red and gold. Currently, there's a giant Christmas bear that gives hugs to take pictures with at the front. Come here if you don't want the headache of trying to choose a place with food everybody can agree on. And for the peking duck.
