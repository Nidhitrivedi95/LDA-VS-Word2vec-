jKN4-aY6DEeAXNeL6CNLJQ Yeah, okay. So, we've lived in NDG for over a year now, and we've been wanting to get Chinese from somewhere for a while. This seemed like the best spot. I stopped in once before to get a menu, and tonight, we ordered.

We got the dinner pack #1. 3 spring/egg rolls each. 1 chow mein. 1 sweet/sour ribs. 1 vegetable fried rice. 1 hot and sour soup. (Small adjustments are possible). Total was $33 with tip, which was really amazing we thought. But we figured out why eventually.

Spirng/egg rolls were amazing, never had bad ones before to tbh. Chow mein was meh, just bland flavored noodles. As was the vegetable fried rice, just very nothing flavored and soggy. Even adding salt didn't help.

But the ribs were actually revolting. Bits and pieces of pork bone chips covered in flour and water and fried. Little balls, not even shaped like ribs. You bite into a dough balls to find little shards of bone in your mouth. So disgusting. But covered in this mega tasty red syrup. I threw out the last 50% :( Also, the soup was pretty bad, no flavor at all. Like floating mushrooms and sprouts in red colored water.

This is not good at all. I'd never order again or go back. I still feel a bit gross thinking about the texture and shards of bone and uncared for flavors.

Such a shame. We were kinda excited that this would be good.
