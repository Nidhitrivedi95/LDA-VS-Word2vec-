Rd6Nk0rYburd6G21QUxa8Q Found this place online, as I was at work, looking for cheap Chinese food in Etobicoke. I remember going here when it was Ho Li Chow, many years ago. I found that they had $6.99 lunch specials that included an egg roll and pop. So for the price, I figured why not? 

I went in, it's only a place for take out, which didn't bother me, as that's what I was there for anyway. I ordered the Lunch special #2 - szechuan chicken, and got them to make it extra Spicy. Didn't take too long to make, I waited about 5-7 mins at most. 

So I got back to work and dug in. There was a ton of food in the styrofoam container. It looked good. The food was average, it's typical greasy chinese food. But I did like the added spice, it had a nice kick to it. I was impressed that they offered Chicken fried rice with the meal, and that there was plenty of chicken in the rice. For the price though, it was great. I had 2 meals out of this, and that makes me happy!

I have been back a few times since my original visit. Li's is a good bang for your buck. Decent food at a great price.
