X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Huge mistake and waste of $$$. 

If i could give this "club" zero stars I would.  Hakkason missed the mark big time.  Was just there last Friday night to see Calvin Harris.   My wife and I have been to every big club in Vegas, and this was our worst experience.  As regular EDM listeners and Vegas fans, we were super disappointed in every aspect at "Hakkashit".

Like 90% of all the other Yelp reviews, I have nothing new to add, just want reinforce that this club is made to make the maximum amount of money in the shortest time.  If you don't have a super-over priced table, then don't plan on having a place to stand or set up camp.  For example, here are the table prices as quoted by one of the shady-assed "promotors":

Pavilion 2K-3500$ 
Mezzanine/Skyboxes 2500-4K$
4th row 3500-4500$
3rd row 5-6K$+ 
2nd row 6K-10K$ 
1st row 10K$ 
Owners 10K$+ 
Stages 10K$ 
LLC 1K-2500$
Lounge 1K$+ 
Goes up with bigger DJs like Hardwell and Tiesto. 

It's really too bad that the best DJs are contracted there, thus giving the audience the short end of the stick.  Hakkaslum better change their style for Omnia unless they want to embarrass themselves once again on Yelp.
