X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Do not trust the VIP host named Nate. He mislead and lied to me. My friends and i were planning on going there but when I met Nate I changed my mind. Claimed he left his phone somewhere blah blah, then he said he was on his way and never showed or returned my text. A man is only as good as his word and his word is no good. Going to go blow my money somewhere else.
