xVHzCbDWCwmyavF5PgJRmg Well, you think I would have learned from previous visits NOT to return to Not Just Noodles.

Haven't been there for more than a year due to previous dislike, but wandered in today...  Should have wandered out.  It is still dirty, staff still have contempt for customers, prices have once again increased steeply, uneaten food from tables is still going back to the kitchen instead of into the garbage, and today, the last straw...

I ordered something that was $7.50.  I noticed that the cashier rang up $7.55.  On being questioned about the incorrect price, she explained that the extra 5 cents was for a bag to put the food in. Are you kidding me???  Who does this?

Your dishonesty and greed have finally gotten to me, Not Just Noodles.  I am finished with you.  Make your money on some other sucker.

Oh, I almost forgot, my friend who used to go there told me to count my change.  He has been over-charged or short-changed several times, and in spite of the fact that he caught them every time, they kept doing it.  I was not short-changed, just over-charged.  I guess they knew I was going to carefully count my change.
