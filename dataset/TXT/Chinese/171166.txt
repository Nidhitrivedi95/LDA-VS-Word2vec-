vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA First time here and I'm so impressed! Not only is it open late but the food is actually amazing. The honey walnut prawn and fried rice was the best. Our server was a bit negligent but the busser named Juan saved the day. He was very consistent and polite. He was the reason i didnt walk out and settle eating TGIFridays. Thank you juan!!!!! Give that man a god damn raise!!!!!
