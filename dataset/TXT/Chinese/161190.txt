ud45YT67UCbtNfRxNeR2Yg The food was nasty all of it was hard as a rock. It was old and cold.  We got up to leave we didn't even eat then the woman Nicole at the desk still had us pay when I asked to speak to the manager she said the manager was not there after giving me my receipt I asked her her name and she gave it to me then when I asked for the managers name so I could call the next day she just looked at me so I asked again she again staired at me so I said one more time what is the managers name and she said she was the manager so I asked her why she lied to me and she said because I lied to her and wasted her food . So I said that her food was nasty yet again and I then asked for the owners name she refused to give it to me. So I called the other place that I know is a sister store with them and asked them who the owner is they gave me the name raymond. I called the store I just left back and asked if raymond was the owner she knew right away it was me and said why do you know him. I will be calling to talk with the owner about the service I received at his restaurant if that's what they want to call it. Please take it from me DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!
