X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Okay the music was cool..and I like how they have two clubs in one. Tiesto is the resident DJ, and he plays EDM.  So if you're into EDM you will love the club.  The problem comes with the capacity. They pack it in.  It's REALLY ridiculous and you can't move.  I don't know how the Fire Marshall doesn't shut them down.  If you don't have a VIP area you're gonna be mad, that's for sure.  Even though we had VIP it was SUCH a headache to get over to it.  I was just about ready to leave.  There are stairs everywhere.  I'm not sure how they expect tipsy and drunk people to walk around ha ha 

It's very festive as well if you're celebrating something. The bar girls will come out with a drummer beating his drum and the sparkling bottles.

I suppose IF you like that type of crowd you will be happy to be in.  I was waiting for people to crowd surf.  I don't have an anxiety issue but I certainly was looking for the nearest exit in case I had to leave for whatever reason.  I had a plan mapped out in my head, because if any sort of emergency occurred this would be the place you would SURELY get trampled.  

There is also another club upstairs and next door if this isn't your crowd or music. BUT the overcrowding continues next door as well.
