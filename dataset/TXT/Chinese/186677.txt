YBk7SLJ7WUfalpJ82yXJ4Q First time here.  Ordered a couple of spring rolls, General Tso chicken and Singapore noodles to go.
It was much better than I expected.  Staff were friendly and I waited for my food where I could watch the kitchen. 
They were very busy in the kitchen. They also very clean. 
Recommend with no reservation
