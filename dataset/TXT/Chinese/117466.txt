NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ I love coming to this restaurant because the ambiance is beautiful. It was spacious, zen, and tranquil.

I came for a lunch and ordered the xiao long bao and beef pancake roll. The xiao long baos were way smaller than I expected and didn't contain a lot of soup even considering its size. Our waitress said they put green tea flavor inside but I didn't taste anything. The beef in the beef pancake roll was melt-in-your-mouth tender but didn't have any "meat flavor" and they slathered it in hoisin sauce. The pancake was soaked in oil and not crispy.

Lastly, for dessert, I ordered the green tea soft serve. It was more bitter than sweet and was not the sugary dessert I hoped for. The size was slightly smaller than Costco's cone yet double the price - $3.99. It was absolutely not worth it, unless you want the bitter tea flavor.
