SbwUKzeMlSZs-mQt0lOGQw I'd been going to Casa Imperial for a while now, so I decided to try out Casa Victoria, but I was very disappointed. I'd made a reservation before, but we still end up waiting 45 mins. Usually when a reservation is made, the next table free is given. We checked in with the hostess when we track her down. She was walking around the restaurant acting like she was extremely busy. Seats were given out with no system. There was so  many people waiting & she wasn't position in the front. Numbers were given out, but I didn't hear any callouts. There were also 3 other managers who were given out seats at the same time. The tables were given to people with relationships or more aggressive. Supposedly, there was one who seems to be in charged of the tables, but she wasn't doing her job.
Finally we got a table, then looked at the dim sum menu & some items were not the same. There was no bbq pork pastry with pine nuts, instead they replace the pine nuts with almond, which is less expensive. So we ordered it anyways because I loved how it taste at CI. However, when I ate it it was another disappointment. It was extremely greasy & it wasn't flaky. It was just gross! The siu mai was not the same as well, it was average, but not worth the price. The har gow, was average too, the outer skin was tasteless, dry & hard.
The fried dumpling was under cook & extremely greasy. The dough was also extremely sticky on the inside. CI makes this dumpling so much better. Overall, this place is not good & I wouldn't go again even though it's the sister restaurant. In terms of dim sum restaurants, there are many more which I enjoyed going to like Legend chinese restaurant.
