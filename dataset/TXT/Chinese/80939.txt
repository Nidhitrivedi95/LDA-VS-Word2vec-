GWNmYFQw3WitfTPt5uGMvQ First thing that grabbed my attention was the very friendly staff... That eventually turned into awkwardness throughout our meal. 

Came here on a whim, on a Thursday night. There was a few other people inside, just enough to see that it wasn't doing terrible with business. Sat down and was greeted by a nice Asian lady, we ordered the veggie spring rolls, teriyaki chicken, and after much confusion with a language barrier, also ordered the Singapore noodles. 

The food was fine, nothing special, and actually the sweet & sour sauce was actually terrible and extremely artificial tasting. Like kool-aid or something. But the thing that stuck with me the most was the staff, and probably not a great way. I don't know if he was the owner, manager, or what.... But there was this older white man walking around to tables asking how everything was and confusing many people like me. He wasn't in any sort of uniform or anything- just your average Joe. 

Also, our waitress was hovering around our table watching us like a hawk to see if we needed anything else at all, and wasn't afraid to share her opinion on the food we were eating (at one point she almost touched our food during her excitement to explain everything). That's where all the awkwardness comes in. But besides that, it's not bad, not really that great either, but... Not bad.
