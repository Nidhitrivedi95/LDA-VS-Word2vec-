dN3-yXUI6ybiLhO-lF5oQg Ordered delivery. Chicken curry and rice as well as fried wontons.  Told them to specifically make the chicken curry extra spicy.  

Order arrived in good time, and it looked to be decent portions in styrofoam containers.  Mind you, delivery must be at least $25.00.  

Fried wontons were crunchy and had some random piece of pork at the centre. I have only had it one other time and it didn't have this at this other establisment where I ordered.  Still yummy though.  1 star for this.  

Curry chicken had much left to be desired.  Wasn't spicy at all and had a watery consistency.  I had actually anticipated the dense curry flavour, but was left wondering where it all was?  The chicken looked to be all dark meat, when you picked through the mqss array if skin and bone.  Skin! Ew! No preparation needed to make this meal.  I just opted to eat the friend wontons.  

Thankfully I ordered the fried wonton as it made up basically the entire meal.  

Next time I will take the advice of fellow yelpers more seriously.
