IqUKgj5hd3iUdQX80kw47g We took our food home and were very happy with our choices. Egg rolls were large and delicious. The price was only one dollar. Delightful! We had cashew shrimp. The shrimp were large and there was a delicious variety of vegetables . The chicken with mushrooms was outstanding. The portion was large and the sauce was superb. Best Chinese we have had in Madison.
