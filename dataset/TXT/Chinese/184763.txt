There are three bowel sizes. Which is fine.  No eggs now, which is not.

Those aren't big problems, but it's little annoyances.  This makes me less likely to go out of my way to come here.  There is YC's and others, and they are closer to my home (and my office, for that matter).  If Genghis isn't going to set itself apart it removes incentive to visit.

The ingredients seemed fresh and good.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  So overall I will go with three stars here.  But I won't drive all the way to Tempe anymore.  If I'm nearby, fine.  If not, there's a YC's just down the road.
