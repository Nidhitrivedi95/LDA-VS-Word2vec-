Dzm3_K2lnLLcGPVLZBZtog When I lived in the East Valley I used to love this place so its hard post a negative review.
My daughter ordered from Empire Bistro recently (4:30 pm 7/3/16) and the order was delivered to the wrong address and I'm not sure where fault lies for that.
My daughter called Empire Bistro when her order failed to arrive, she was told that the order was left at the doorstep of a similar address a short distance away and that she should walk or drive there to pick up her order.

I called Empire Bistro at 6:45 pm and asked to speak to the owner manager on duty the person taking my call said neither were available and asked me why I was calling.
I explained why I was calling, the lady became argumentative and belligerent telling me it wasn't her problem.
My response was that I'd leave a review of mine and my daughters experience and the poor customer service we'd received.
The person from Empire Bistro said she didn't care and that I couldn't file this review........
