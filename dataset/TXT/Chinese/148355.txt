sfd19Wo_7g2TwaoJmA9B8A Hunan is one of the only actual Chinese places on the street, surrounded by other asian restaurants. Also, you need to know how to order and when to go. Their hours are odd, so you need to check before going. Also, many of their dishes have a lot of sticky sauce that I'm not crazy about. I do like their bourbon chicken and their chicken and cashews, not to mention they do a good job on basics like beef and broccoli. They do take out as well! The servers are very attentive too!
