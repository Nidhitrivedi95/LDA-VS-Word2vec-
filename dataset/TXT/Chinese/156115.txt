tQ9BtMUHFr8rdpmjmayUcA I personally like this place more than Deer Garden (Hwy 7 and Leslie), fish soup tastes slightly fresher and never really a line up. It is my to go restaurant when I'm not sure what I want to eat since you can mix and match the soup bases and ingredients. Theres a special (cheaper price for a smaller bowl) if you go after 8:30pm.
Service isn't great though. It's some effort to get their attention.
