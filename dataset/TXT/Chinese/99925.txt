You can order a large or a small bowl... which I think you still can get as much as a large bowl if you pack enough into a small bowl. But anyway, you go through a buffet style line, stuffing meat, veggies and noodles into a bowl before they stir fry it for you. At this location, you start with the meats. There are beef, white chicken, dark chicken and Alaskan Cod. Compare to other places, the meat selection is quite limited. Even though vegetables which include tofu, baby corn, carrots, broccoli, bean sprouts, etc., are also a limited selection. There are a variety of sauces that you can mix or you can follow the recipe on the menu.

I guess the good thing is for $11, you can get a huge bowl of food. And there's free soup, which is ok... but you do also get a free drink (tea, soda) and you can buy yogurt for one dollar! So for the amount of money you pay, you get a lot of food. So I would say it's a good place to go for food. Just do it when it's not busy so you have more time to pack your bowl with ingredients. Be sure to make a mountain, get a lot of meat, a small portion of vegetables and keep piling whatever else on until it literally starts falling out of the bowl. LOL. And then you'll get your money's worth.
