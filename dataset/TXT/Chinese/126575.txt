p2OOk46G_AOO0nCWl-eVlg I have been to this Pei Wei multiple times and it never fails I am always disappointed! I have dined in and they lose my ticket and I have to show my receipt to get my food. For take out they forget my sauces and utensil and just tonight I called to order take out the girl was very rude and it was an hour and a half wait! My recommendation go somewhere else...
