Surprisingly quiet at lunch time. Food was very good-especially the egg custard tarts-like others said best I've ever had. We live in Seattle so know good Dim Sum. So why just 3 stars?  Because the Pan Fried Vegetable & Pork buns had shrimp in it which I can't eat.  I had just eaten 1 bite of this when my husband luckily noticed the shrimp, not a good surprise because shrimp makes me really sick. Luckily I had so little I was ok, but it could have been a disaster.
