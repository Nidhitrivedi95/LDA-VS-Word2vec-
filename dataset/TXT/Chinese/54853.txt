CuIPocteo1F3LEn1OqUoHg By far the best Chinese food I've had. I remember this place whenI was growing up in Cleveland,  and it's still there.  So good in fact,  we travel from Medina to get it. Something about their egg roles.  They are so delicious!! My fav is the sweet & sour chicken. Hubby gets Pepper Steak or General Tso Chicken. Our daughter lives in Ashland and misses our trips to China Jade. It's definitely comfort food. Helpings are generous in size. We've taken friends here and all have just loved their food. Service is always good, friendly people. I highly recommend it!
