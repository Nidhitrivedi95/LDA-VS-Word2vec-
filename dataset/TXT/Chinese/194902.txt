zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I can't believe the 3 star average! I am a ramen enthusiast and I hate to admit the 'just ok' Yelp reviews kept me from trying Momofuku Noodle Bar until now. Goes to show that you have to go see for yourself.

I had the signature ramen and loved it. Yes, it is more expensive than other ramen joints at $15, but it has a lot going on: pork belly and pork shoulder (the shoulder was falling apart tender instead of being tough like I've had elsewhere), a perfectly poached egg, nori, pickled cabbage, and fish cake slices. Honestly, if you ordered at, say, Kinton and added extra meat, an egg, nori, etc the price would be the same.. but the quality would not.

The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the Tonkotsu Black ramen at Sansotei which remains my favourite. But hey, not everyone can be number 1.
