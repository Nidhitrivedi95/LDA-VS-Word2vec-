qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ First off, this place offers a free eggroll, ice cream or soda for a yelp review..so i wasn't sure how accurate the reviews we're for this place when reading the reviews prior to coming. But decided to give it a try...

Being korean, I was craving for some good korean chinese food. Found this place and thought I'd give it a try. Korean chinese foods most popular dishes are jjajangmyun, jjampong, and tangsuyuk.

I ordered their lunch special which had all 3 of the dishes I listed above. And it only costs $23.95..which ia a pretty good deal for all the food you get...but the food was a major disappointment. 

First tangsuyuk came out. It was crispy on the outside, meaty on the inside. However, i don't think they seasoned the meat prior to cooking. The tangsuyuk sauce was given on the side (which is to help the meat be crispier). Sauce was not good. It was a bit watery than the usually ones I've had else where and it had a strange taste to it. Also a bit bland. Usually the sauce should be a little thick than watery. 

Second the jjajangmyun. Consists of noodles with a black bean sauce poured on top. You mix it all together and eat. Sauce was wayy too overly sweet for me and also watery. Sauce should also be somewhat thick but it wasn't. 

Third item is the jjampong. It's a spicy seafood noodles. This had a kick of spiciness which i loved. Noodles were cooked well, but the soup could have used a bit more flavor. 

Overall i was not blown away. Everything was just too bland for me. I probably won't ever return.
