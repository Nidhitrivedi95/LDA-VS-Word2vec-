6iqN2D0Dp_9_i-GD2l2s2Q Tonight I arrived 20 mins before they closed. The staff was very courteous. The sweet tea was amazing. My wife had the four happiness and her only complaint was that she only got 3 shrimp. Other than that she was impressed. We had the dumplings as an appetizer. They were steamed and amazing. I tried the garlic and ginger shrimp. First time trying it ever at any restaurant. Plenty of shrimp and already de-tailed and de veined. Plenty of peppers and onions. Fried rice was great as well. Will go back to eat there.
