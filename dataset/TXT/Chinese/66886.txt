eIO1Gj0MX29aQXTIEdCpqA Very fresh dumplings. I had steamed dumplings (half porc & shrimp, and the other half nappa cabbage & mushrooms). I preferred the porc & shrimp.  There were 15 in total.

Then I ordered fried dumplings (half chicken & coriander, half pork & mushrooms). They were also very good. But I preferred the steamed ones. See attached pictures. 

This place is a bar. I was alone here on a Halloween night, waiting for some friends to get ready to go for a party. On the back, there were a couple of video lottery machines, with some old ladies playing quietly non stop. It was a weird place. I felt like in a movie. Loved it.
