TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ Good solid Chinese (Taiwanese) cuisine.  We ordered the fish head hot pot and it was filled with all kinds of tasty treats. The only item in the pot we did not care for was the tofu.  It was grey, spongy and bland.  We ended up picking it out of the pot.  The rest of the pot was delicious. It was more food than we expected. 

We also ordered the beef noodle soup which was fantastic and authentic. The noodles were made in house, the beef was tender and the broth was full of flavor.  

We stayed away from the specialty dishes on this trip but will definitely try the fried onion noodles and the green onion pancakes next time we visit.  

The decor is a bit odd with model airplanes hanging from the ceiling, these funky round booths that are bright red, Chinese videos playing on a huge screen and this funky bar filled with bottles.  Although it was odd, it was very clean and well kept.  

We were a bit annoyed that they charged us for white rice when we ordered three dishes with one of them being $30.00!   Who charges for rice when you are ordering multiple main dishes???

This place should be on your radar if you are looking for Taiwanese food.  Just be leery of ordering white rice with your dishes......,,
