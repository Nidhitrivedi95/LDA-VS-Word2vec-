VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Went for lunch after main rush was over at about 12:45. Place was half empty but got seated in far corner table.Service was terrible. The waitress appeared to want to be anywhere but there. Salad came and was swimming in dressing. Every table had won-tons but we were not served any. We had to ask and were served them part way through our main dish. My wife's orange chicken arrived and was cold, tasted like fish and was chewy. My entree arrived 10 minutes later. The Mongolian beef was chewy and poor quality. Wrong rice was brought and had to be exchanged for our ordered brown rice. We have eaten here many times and it was okay. Today was a radical departure for even classifying it as good. We won't be back. Flo's has gone way downhill and the service which was never stellar was terrible.
