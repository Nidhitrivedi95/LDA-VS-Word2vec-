6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ I love this little gem inside the hard rock. Every year I stay at the hard rock for a convention and there's only a few places I enjoy eating regularly at the hotel and FU is one of them. The Kalbi tacos on the magic mike menu are so flavorful. Other favorites are the duck salad, the tuna salad, garlic green beans, and lettuce cups. Oh and the hot and sour soup!!! So good! The service is very friendly and they even have a vegan menu option. I will definitely be back next year!
