R-EGIdIgtoFzl--OudANtA I've been eating in this area since forever and have only recently discovered this gem of a place. It makes me sad for all the bad bowls of congee and crappy rice rolls that I've had to consume in my long life. The congee is made by the bowl, so it might take a moment for it to get out to you but it will be guaranteed to be hot and delicious. The usual combinations are all available, and the one bowl can easily feed two people. The rice rolls are a bit different because the folds aren't all neatly rolled up, but I figure it's just because they make it fresh there. No complaints, especially when drowned in sesame sauce, sweet sauce, hot sauce and sesame seeds. 

Let's clarify that this isn't the classiest of places. They ran out of actual chairs so I got a plastic stool to sit on. When our table ran out of sesame sauce, the table next to us offered us theirs because there was a mutual understanding of the importance of sesame sauce. It's just that kinda place. Don't bring your dates here unless they are awesome and know how to appreciate the taste of a well made Cantonese breakfast.
