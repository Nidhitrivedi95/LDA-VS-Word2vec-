HV3Q2JYwK9AvMHPYXcxzag Excellent Chinese food. Real Chinese. (Get the Chinese Menu) Bitter melon soup is sooo good and just feel free to explore. You can bring your friend who is not adventurous as well, they have good Americana Chinese. Definite hole in the wall, however like so many good food AND good service.
