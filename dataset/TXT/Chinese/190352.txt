YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g Came here for winterlicious dinner and I was super underwhelmed by their food. 

We got the chilled soba noodle salad, dim sum basket, luckee duck (Beijing duck wraps), cod wrap and their trio of desserts (mango panna cotta, chocolate sponge roll and sesame rice donut). The soba salad tasted pretty bland except for a tiny bit of spiciness. The cod was crispy but the lettuce wasn't big enough to serve as a wrap so trying to eat it became this messy ordeal. I tried a bit of the luckee duck and it was on par with most other duck wraps I've had, with just a little extra tartness from the apple. I was hoping the dessert trio would be the one saving grace but it was just as mediocre as the rest of the meal. I also don't think the dark chocolate sauce paired well with the sesame rice ball. 

The servers were nice enough but I don't think the food warrants a return visit, especially considering the prices.
