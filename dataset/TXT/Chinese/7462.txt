0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Found this place on Yelp on my recent visit to Sauga. Small place in a plaza surrounded by other chinese restaurants. Good friendly service, awesome food. Wanted something mild so server suggested non-chilli chilli chicken. Sounded wierd and funny but I thought let's give it a shot. Chicken pakora was good. Fried rice was good (which it normally is at all chinese restaurants) but the non-chilli chilli chicken was amazing. Kids loved it and so did I. Will definitely be coming here again on my next visit to the west end.
