Se63tFm5tLlO5wuUlyww8Q Never eat at this place.
Sign says closes at 9:30, we walk in at 8:59, plenty of time for sushi but are told they close at 9:00, to which I say no...you close at 9:30...she goes outside to look at times and comes back in saying you can look and see what's there is as we started shuting down......Hmmmm no thank you.
