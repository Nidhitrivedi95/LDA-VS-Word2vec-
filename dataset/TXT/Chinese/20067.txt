5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ You are perhaps wondering why I am only giving this joint two stars, well let me tell you why... after a long drunken day of walking up and down the strip we came back to our hotel and decided sushi sounded delightful. We noticed also that on Sundays they have happy hour starting at 5 p.m. Well we arrived at 4:51 p.m. and the dumb bang waitress would not let us even sit down until 5 p.m. if we wanted to order off the happy hour menu. Mistake numero uno. So we watched the tail end of the Raiders game and then finally were allowed to sit. Not sure if the idiots here cannot understand english or what but every question I asked just proceeded a confused expression and an attitude. 

Come to find out it is half off appetizers and sushi for happy hour BUT you have to sit at the sushi bar to get half off sushi and you have to sit at the regular bar to get half off appetizers. We ended up just getting sushi and what a mistake. For being only one of three groups in the place my rolls took so long you would think there was a fisherman out back reeling in my spicy tuna. And not only that but exactly when I picked up my last bite the dumb bang waitress comes over and takes my plate away before i could even dip it in soy sauce. Then it took us another ten minutes to hunt someone down for the damn check. 

The food in general was okay. Nothing special. I was very disappointed with the service. It was down right miserable and literally put my entire group in a bad mood. I will NEVER eat here again due to the horrific service.
