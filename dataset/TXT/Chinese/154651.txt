tEfvf1cznLZUIeTcKKpAIw Taiwanese vermicelli was pretty good, they add some minced/paste garlic on top which is quite strong but I really like. 

Their appetizer platter is so not worth it - half of it is peanuts!

Both the koo koo chicken bites and crispy chicken skin are pretty oily...could not finish them. 

They have a tray of spices/powders that are truly Taiwanese and reminds me of night market street foods. I think some of them menu items are good and other not so great. Might have to try to find out, but overall it's decent. Would come back to try other food items only if I'm nearby.
