tnvZOd2vNCLPQS1KEZxqog Yay we may have found a new Chinese place! Isn't it strange that Phoenix is a pretty large metropolitan area, but it seems starved of decent Chinese places? Thank goodness for this little restaurant!

We weren't very hungry, but had been wanting to check this place out for a while so we stopped by at lunch. We were seated and ordered right away. We tried the soup dumplings, scallion pancake and the black sesame buns. I have seen that some of the other patrons mentioned a long wait time for food, but ours came out very quickly (10 minutes). Everything was hot and tasted delicious! We can't wait to come back and try some of the other dishes on the regular menu. Ever since C-Fu was sold, decent dim sum has been so hard to find, so we'd like to see this part of the menu here expand a little. Maybe include some egg tarts?
