Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg I was there two days ago.   The service was so bad.  The guy name was De and it would bother him if I ask for something.  He brought two dishes and after half an hour he brought our third dish.  The service was very bad.  The food wasn't that great.  Too salty.    I would not recommend the PF Chang in lis vegas Blvd at all.
