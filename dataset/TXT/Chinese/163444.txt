My daughter had (as always) beef chow fun. Fat rice noodles, tons of scallions and onions. Just a big ol' plate of comfort food. Sweet & sour chicken for her friend, who loved it. We shared a delicious salt & pepper shrimp dish, some hot & sour soup and crispy that was as good as I've had anywhere. Bonus points to the server for taking the time to speak in Mandarin with my daughter's friend, who is 2 years into learning to speak the language.
