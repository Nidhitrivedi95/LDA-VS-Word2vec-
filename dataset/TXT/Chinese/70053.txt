We waited 20 minutes before we were acknowledged and given menus since we did not want the Dim Sum option. The fire emergency exist was deadbolted shut and stacks of chairs and high chairs crammed in front of it.  The Dim Sum cart ladies were annoying and kept circling and grunting if we wanted whatever unidentifiable item was on their cart. Also English is not the first second or third language used here.  After ordering they brought  our entrees separately 15 minutes apart! No fortune cookie.  Also this in an authentic Chinese restaurant so some of the menu items are interesting to say the least.
Now the good.  The portions were large and the food was good.
