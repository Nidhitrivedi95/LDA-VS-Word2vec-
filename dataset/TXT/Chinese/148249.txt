SEURrw7032BR15PKZ_aleA The food here for dinner is very consistent.  I've never been here for dim sum so I cannot comment on that.  However for dinner, it's the same quality every time.  The service is very good and the place is clean.  Price is reasonable and the taste of everything was just fine for us. There were four of us and we ordered 4 dishes...lobster, chicken, beef with veggies and a mushroom with veggies.  It was the perfect amount of food.  There was a soup to start off with like most Chinese restaurants and an assortment of dessert (red bean, tapioca, tofu dessert) to pick from.  Overall the experience is really good for a Chinese restaurant.  The negative is the there is not enough parking spots in the plaza.  You're pretty much parking at the community centre that is 5 minute walk down the street if you come here after 7pm.
