lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA This is the new and improved Zine from before with most of the same menu items from Zine (dim sum items, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, ect) and many new items to die for. 

My favorite dish is the truffle chicken breast on baked pasta wth cream sauce. Aside from the pasta dish, the clay pot rice dishes are to die for! Te dish comes in authentic clay pots and is mixed right at your table before serving. My favorite part of this dish is the crispy rice parts. 

Hong Kong cafe also offers new drinks like Hong Kong style milk tea (served both hot and cold), lemon Hong Kong tea, blended taro drink, and also macha milk tea (most served with boba!). I'm very glad to have finally find a place on the strip that serves boba. 

With the amazing food, the staff is also equally amazing in helping you decide on what to eat and providing outstanding service. 

Take some time and give this place a try!
