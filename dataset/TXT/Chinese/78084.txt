GibwaDiqJJ_62x0h3oCyxA It's 10:55 and they open at 10:30 today. I have worked in fast food/restaurants before and know that the staff does not get there RIGHT before it opens so there is no reason that steamed rice shouldn't be ready by almost a half hour into the establishment being open, in addition there are 7 empty entree dishes in the serving windows
