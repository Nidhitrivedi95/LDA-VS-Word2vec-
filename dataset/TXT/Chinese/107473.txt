l9vx-OTdDPU-oHZ17aVxdg Great food, nice ambiance, service was very decent too. I hear complaints about line ups but we escaped that mess. The food is hakka Chinese. So if you are craving fried, heavily sauced, spicy hot Indo/Chinese. This is your spot. They have their staple dishes but don't be scared to try some of the other ones. We tried a fish it was light compared to the other dishes and tasted great. Wish they would open a branch in Hamilton
