Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Upon arrival, I was surprised to find out that Everest Indian Cuisine has split into two restaurants, with the location serving the Indian food now a couple blocks down the street. This is now a Hakka restaurant, or more of an Asian-fusion style menu. I was a little disappointed to find that out, but I still like food, so I wasn't about to leave on account of not understanding any of the words on the menu. I daringly ordered what I believed to be a vegetable dish. What I imagined would come out as a pile of tasty veggies in a spicy sauce looked like a plate of meatballs. Oops. But then I tried them... the veggie-balls in spicy sauce were great! The warm tap water I was served with dinner was not so great, but the server was able to procure a glass of lukewarm tap water, so I was able to drink that while the other glass cooled. All in all it was a great dinner and the portion sizes were more than I could comfortably consume in one sitting. An explanation of what the dishes are would have been very helpful.
