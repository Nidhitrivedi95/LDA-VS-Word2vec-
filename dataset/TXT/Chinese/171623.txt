VZ7rS4awhk5iWiji6OuY-A Best pakoras EVER. Made to order....so crispy and fresh.
Menu items from southern & northern India with Hakka dishes as well.
Butter chicken is a tad spicy, but makes it the best in Toronto. So tender and nice large pieces.
The calm atmosphere and super friendly staff make this place a keeper. Kids meal available as well, and we always have lots for lunch the next day.
