prHnRsgY-PuM7vxe8-RwEA My partner and I were exhausted from a long day of work and really did not feel like cooking. Rather than order in we decided to take a drive and see what our options were. As we  pulled into subway we saw Ho Ho Ho Chinese gourmet. We had recognized the place from previously ordering delivery. We decided to order the family dinner A. Lemon chicken and general tso's chicken, hot and sour soup and chicken fried rice. The lemon chicken was breaded fried chicken with a yellow sauce on the side. It was dry, and far from lemon anything. The general tso's chicken was just ok, not real tasty, the hot and sour soup was not sour or hot it's greasy and slimy soup. Needless to say we are both still hungry and threw most of this meal in the trash. Should of went to Subway. We will not be returning and threw out all mailers for this sad excuse of a gourmet Chinese restaurant.
