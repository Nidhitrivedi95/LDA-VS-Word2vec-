ynlfZ7_8rNjT0w5TNAMimA Looking for some Chinese buffet, came across this place. Wandering in it was not busy and the buffet was depleted of everything. Finally the kitchen staff started bringing out items and filled up the buffet, only good thing about this place. Pretty bland, not worth visiting!!!
