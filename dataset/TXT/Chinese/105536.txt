KWTv8elo9HiN9sIKvN0_bQ I'm so glad that I found this place using yelp mobile.  I happen to be in a part of town that I am not normally in.   I looked at the reviews for it, but there weren't very many.  But I decided to take a risk.  When I drove up, I was a little scared.  It's not a fancy place by any means.   

My husband and I go to the counter to order.  It's one of those places where you order your food first then sit.  We chose the lo mein, cashew shrimp,  Mongolian beef, fried rice and beef egg foo young.  We got free cheese crab won ton for spending over $20.  

I was nervous to try this food.  You never know what you are going to get!  Well, it was soooooo good!  I finally found a great Chinese restaurant on the way home from work.  The egg foo young is a must and so is the lo mein.  I would order the cream cheese won tons again as well as the Mongolian beef.  I can't say anything good or bad about the shrimp.  Wouldn't order it again.  But I am very excited about which other items I might love.
I will be back!
