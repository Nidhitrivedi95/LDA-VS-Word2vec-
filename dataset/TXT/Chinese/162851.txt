uoV4aDfXbRmvyHSezdn--w We discovered this restaurant yesterday while shopping in the Whitney Way area in Madison, WI. 
Great food at reasonable prices. We had Sushi and shrimp tempura.
This is informal dining where you order your food at the counter. You can see the cooks/chefs making the food right there.
Their menu is extensive.
