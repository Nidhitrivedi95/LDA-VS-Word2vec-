CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw The service is very slow and not good. After all other people completed their meal and I have asked for a couple of times, we finally found out that my order was massed up and was not placed. While waiting I asked for water for a few times, I finally got a pot of water put on the table without any service. The place is not recommended.
