Qn_mBXvKnn9VeOKym0Ussw We've been looking for a new Chinese place and we found it. The food was super fresh and fast. The combination dinners are a great deal if you like soup and appetizers with your meal. The waitress was nice and filled our glasses when the cups were only half empty. We will definitely be back.
