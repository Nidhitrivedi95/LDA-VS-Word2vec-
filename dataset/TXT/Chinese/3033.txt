_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA I have eaten at Noodle Asia probably over 20 times.  I have had everything from the shanghai style rice cake and noodle, beef chow fun, beef szechuan noodle soup (Mama Wu's special), spicy cucumber, jelly fish, seafood curry noodles,  and at least three of the fried rice dishes.  This is my favorite noodle place in Vegas and is one that I usually go to at least 2-3 times when I'm out there.  Its open from the 10am till 3am so you can get your favorite chinese food whenever you want.  The line is usually long, however, they do have a carry out.  The people that work there are pretty much the same people for the at least the past three years or so.  The service is excellent and they know what they are doing.  Whenever someone asks for good chinese food, I always recommend Noodle Asia.  The dishes lean more on the real chinese dishes.  Which means you won't find dishes like general tso's chicken or sesame beef on the menu.  However, it should be a must-try if you are serious about food.  Can get slighly oily at times but that should be expected.  Oh, did I say the portions are large?  Slightly more expensive than say chinese off the street but well worth it for a noodle house in a great hotel next to the sportsbook.
