W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g I used to love this place but the last three times it has not been good at all. Tonight's take out was awful... my cashew chicken was literally all celery and peppers even with red peppers and taste like kungpao... the crispy spring rolls I love were awful missing something definitely.. even the fish sauce no good... my house noodles were not fried well still rubbery and greasy... unfortunately I was a weekly customer that won't be back and will never refer. Bye Susie and Chris.
