-M9S1wlZTvv6T9EOo5X2Yw I totally agree with the first post. If I could give this place a -5 stars I would. The service is soooooo slow and frustrating. 

1. We made reservations, and when we arrived they said they didn't have our name down. 

2. The waiters were not attentive. Took 10 mins to wave one down to take our order. The place is very understaffed that the hostess took our order.

3. We waiting about 40-45 mins for our food - we ordered 5 dishes. All the tables around us ordered around the same time and they had 2-3 dishes on their table. 

4. The hostess who took our order forgot to put the order in for one of dishes plus the bowls of rice. 

5. We were a table of 6 and was crammed for a tiny round table meant for 4 people. When we asked one of the waiters to transfer food from our massive dish to smaller ones to save table space, his reply was "Im too busy and can't do it".. and then reluctantly go gets us smaller plates for us to transfer the food ourselves. 

6. When we asked them again for our bowls of rice, the waiter looks blankly like it was his responsibility to check up on the missing order.

The service here is extremely shitty. Had to ask them repeatedly for the same thing. This place is so bad that I felt I had to post my first review here to save all of you from the irritation I experienced. 

Stay away. This place is not worth the hype.
