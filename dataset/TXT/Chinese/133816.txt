PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg Homey place with bad lighting. It adds a little twist to normal American Chinese fare. Different, yet tasty flavors than the average Lo Mein parlor. Well prepared. Not deep fried goop like most strip mall Chinese joints.I would go back again if I'm in the area.

Very friendly staff. Watch out for Karaoke night on Fridays....Very, very loud. However, the pregnant lady DJ sang the most  hauntingly beautiful version of Fleetwood Mac "Dreams" which made it alright. Brought me to the brink of tears it was so good.
