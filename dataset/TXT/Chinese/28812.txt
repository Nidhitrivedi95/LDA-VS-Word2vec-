8xPmlVJy2o6x0J04CBpEMQ Came here on a whim after work around 10pm and the owner was waiting for his wife to pick him up. He was happy to make me a few waffles. 

I ordered the original, green tea, and apple cinnamon waffles. All were so delicious. They were all crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The apple cinnamon was my favourite one and every bite had pieces of apples in it. There is an option to add ice cream to the waffles, but I was taking them home to share with my family. They seemed to really enjoy it as well! 

The owner is very friendly and humble. We had a bit of a conversation during the wait for my waffles and he is happy to talk about anything you throw at him. 

All around pleasant late night experience here. I'll definitely be back to try the other flavours.
