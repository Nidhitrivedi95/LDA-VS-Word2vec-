1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Came here with a group of 5 in the early evening before the dinner rush. Ordered a bunch of things on the menu including the Hainan chicken and rice, braised beef, salt and pepper shrimp, steamed fish fillet, and wonton soup, as well as various stir fried veggies.

The food is good for the value, there is no doubt. The least impressive item was the braised beef, which featured small pieces of beef drowning in bland beef sludge. 

The service is some of the worst I have seen, and I am no stranger to the curt, no nonsense style that is typical to Chinese restaurants. The lady who was working the counter and taking orders was just plain mean. I saw her yell at a group of customers for wanting to sit at a different table...she literally glared at them for a minute and then finally brought them their menus. We wanted to order more food halfway through the meal. After failing to get her attention we went up to the counter, and were told that our order would be placed at the very end of the queue in this crowded restaurant. Fine! No more food! So we asked for more rice, which was brought over in a huff and slammed on our table. Kind of made for a tense dining experience, if you ask me.

Might be worth it if you love hole-in-the-wall joints like this and have thick skin to boot!
