pyZkGdnTwpRh5tFWfdmQEg I'm confused why anyone would choose to go here.  
To be clear, my expectations were that it would be an all Asian version of Noodles & Co.  Cheap, decent, fresh food.  
Cheap - yep
Decent - no
Fresh - maybe at one point
I ordered the Thai curry noodles.  Not impressed.  I've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor.  My vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish.  Yuck.  My boyfriend ordered the teriyaki udon, and the noodles were too skinny to be udon with the same flavor issues.  Not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it.  
Chin's - good concept, but a waste of money even at $6.
