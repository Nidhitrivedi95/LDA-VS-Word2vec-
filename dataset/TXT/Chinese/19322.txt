5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g Seriously the best beef noodle soup I've ever had...and I just got back from a two-month trip to China.  There's no compromise in between: Best broth, best noodle, and absolutely the most tender beef I've ever had.  It will leave you craving for more -- guaranteed!  The owner is from Nanjing from what I've gathered and he sure knows beef noodles!!!  Going back there again tonight.  The pig ear appetizer is a nice addition, too.
