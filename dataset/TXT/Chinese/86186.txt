HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I have postponed writing this review far longer than I should have; really wanted to like this place, as did so many others but::

THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES!

First I went alone and had both of the Bao and the bone marrow. The Bao were pretty good but the bone marrow was not cooked properly and I swear as God is my witness the grilled bread that accompanied it was half of a HOT DOG BUN!

Still, gave it another try with my Girlfriend. We again ordered both the Bao and they were pretty good, the potstickers were very greasy and under filled, better to buy the frozen ones from Trader Joe's.

Then the sandwiches:  She ordered the short rib grilled cheese and I the Fat Choy burger with crispy fries. It was not busy but they took forever to arrive. The grilled cheese was dry with very little flavor except for a slightly rancid odor and taste, my burger which was ordered medium rare was also dry and overcooked, the fries were limp and greasy. Every dish was highly oversalted as well.

Our server, I believe her name was Emily, was charming and very efficient but she could not make up for the slowness of the kitchen. I was given a properly cooked burger to go and it was marginally better but there is a limit to what can be done with a cheap ready-made patty.

There must have been a fair amount of Kool-Aid drunk by many Fat Choy reviewers and it helps no one, not the owner/chef or the potential customers. This place could be fixed, it's a good concept and menu but the execution and cooking are pretty dreadful as are some of the ingredient choices.

As it stands now, Fat Choy is a 1.5 star experience, sadly it's less than a mile from my house. Bachi Burger is more expensive and over 15 miles from my house, we choose Bachi every time.

CAVEAT COMESTOR!
