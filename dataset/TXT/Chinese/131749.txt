PlP0c_u3g-3LiWHpb2XnOQ I am of Chinese heritages from Taiwan and have been in the US for 14 years living in Texas and Virginia. This is hands own the most authentic Chinese restaurant I have been to. 

I literally stuffed my face and had a tummy ache b/c I could not stop myself. It's hard to say what dishes are good because everything we ordered was amazing and so did all the dishes on other peoples table seem.

I still drool just thinking about the food there. I canst wait to go back on my next road trip down there.
