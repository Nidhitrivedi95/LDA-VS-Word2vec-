3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug Came here with a group of 3 looking to try the lobster dinner. When we arrived, we were a bit discouraged, as most of the workers didn't speak english, and supposedly only the "good food" is on the chinese menus... 

However we asked for an english speaking server, and was able to order the lobster dinner we were looking for.  (Lobster 4 ways dinner : steamed, fried with maggie sauce?, spicy fried, fried rice style) + desserts.

Obviously it was too much food for a party of 3, however the meal IS on the pricey side (well it is lobster of course!). I would suggest a party of 5 or more, to help split the bill, and depending on how much lobster you'd like to eat per person ;)

PROS: The lobster was HUGEEEE!! very meaty and delicious in all the various methods that it was cooked. Our favorite was the fried lobster with maggie sauce. The lobsters were cut into decent sized pieces, so the big chunks of meat came out easily to eat! (We definitely enjoy our meals more when there's less work involved trying to get the meat pieces out.) We had lots of leftovers which still tasted great the next day. 

After our meal, we were served complimentary desserts: Red bean soup, Mochi balls (with sesame/peanut filling?), mango mochis (AMAZINGG!!), we asked the server how much the mango mochi balls cost, and they asked us how many we would want? asked for 6 more balls, and they gave us more for free! (I guess after spending almost $300 on the meal, giving out a few extra dessert balls is nothing for them).

To be honest, the service was actually really good for a chinese restaurant, maybe its because if the super expensive meal we ordered. 

CONS: expensive meal, messy to eat some of the dishes

But overall had a good experience there, would only go back with a larger group of people, or for a very very special occasion.
