nt4u1wSGcvxZL6e15oViWw Absolutely can always count on shit service here. Horrible attitude. Only reason I go here is because it is  the only dim sum place in Vaughan. The price is expensive compared to dim sum in markham, sauga and Toronto. Food is decent. The grumpy old male waiters here are absolutely horrendous and are especially rude to females. Probably sexist. I cant wait until there is another dim sum in the area to shut this restaurant down. Not sure what their managers are doing but training staff is not one of them.
