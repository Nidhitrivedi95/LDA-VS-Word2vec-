M-rqZ56wTGSNoIIsBSlhDA agree with TE Y., the food is decent.  This place was recommended by a friend, therefore we went there as we donno where to eat one day

soup is OK, however is a bit heavy on the MSG, ordered steak with spaghetti ( one of the above avg steak place compare to other Chinese steak restaurants IMO), the portion is huge, I do have a above par appetite  but it's still too much for me to handle, price is cheap and comes with hot drinks or free pop

The place itself is not packed at night, decoration is decent, has a TV playing fairchild all the time, staffs and service are ok, and refills tea for you periodically

Overall a quit decent place to head to if you want cheap and large portion HK Tea restaurant meal, I would definitely go there
