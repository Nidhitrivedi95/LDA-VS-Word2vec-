8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA Yes, I realize I'm probably risking my health by coming here but I just can't help but like it anyway.

It's cheap & there are lots of options food wise. They even have basic sushi rolls. That's a major plus in my book! Everyone seems to go for the crab, but I don't. If you want crab I suggest sitting where you can watch them put it out. Hustle your butt to grab choice pieces before everyone else.

Keep in mind the people seating you barely speak English. There's always a language barrier. They're really only there to clear plates away.

You shouldn't look around too much while there. The whole place is pretty divey but the food is good & replaced often enough. If decor is important to you don't come here. If you just want to chow down on all sorts of cheap food goodness then drop by. You'll leave stuffed & happy.
