S6dARuOrrOXd4xSiTHti8g We ordered off of grub hub on their western menu and it was solid! Nothing blew me away, but Western Chinese never does. The meal seemed reasonably healthy for Western Chinese. Will be ordering from them again!

Recommendations off the Western menu:

Honey Walnut Chicken for something sweet.
Braised Tofu for a lighter fare.
