mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w I really like it here and its my first at this dim sum. Its perfect because its in my neck of the woods. I don't have to drive all the way to spring mountain. It's very clean and open spaced. I get that movie theater lobby feel (the way they showcase their main dishes) but its nice.  The music is on point! (Songs my aunties and uncles would sing on kareokee, where my Filipinos at!?!) And I mean karerokee style too. No problem here. The food is good, its dim sum! Price I dont know, my boo paid for it.  

I will be back!

YUM!
