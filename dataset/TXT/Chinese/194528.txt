zG3GJiIrF01bwgP0tQdkZg I ordered the shrimp tempura bento and it was delicious. I did get some unexpected tempura veggies like a slice of green bell pepper, egg plant and a red chili pepper. The tempura dipping sauce was perfect! The miso soup was also really good and had both tofu and seaweed.

I have it 4 starts because for dessert I had the mojo and it was terrible. The mochi's outside case was thick, hard and lacked flavor. The ice cream inside was okay.
