aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg Asian BBQ & Noodle is one of my go-to spots when I want something delicious and cheap. Being Chinese, I've grown up on Chinese food and am very familiar with many restaurants across town. This place is my absolute favorite spot in Las Vegas to eat Chinese food. I've had AMAZING Chinese BBQ in Hong Kong and this is the closest to it in quality and taste (very authentic).

I always get the #7 combo (2 BBQ meats with rice and vegetables). The duck skin is consistently crispy, which is hard to find in a lot of Chinese restaurants. The roast pork is so delicious and flavorful. I like the sauce they put on the rice. The BBQ pork is delicious and saucy, but not my favorite out of the three types of meat. 

This place is always busy and packed with Chinese locals (good sign btw). Most of the time I get seated right away. It is a cash-only establishment. This place is a gem and I will always come here when I crave for Chinese.
