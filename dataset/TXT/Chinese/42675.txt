BEB_jRY-Zh7neYfHks8w2w Nice to find a new place (especially a hot pot restaurant in downtown) to eat after a disastrous final exam (uhhh). It's been only 2 weeks since they opened, according to the staff there. The space is quite big - two floors with 30-40 seats on each floor. They also have large tables that can seat as many as 6-8 people.

There are more than six different flavors of fondue soup to choose from, and I chose to have a Yin-Yang pot with royal spicy soup and mushroom soup. The spicy soup is not that spicy, and I don't eat spicy food (Tabasco sauce will burn me to death lol). 

One point that will make me to dine here next time is that meat or vegetables taste so fresh, and you can order as much meat as you want for free!!! Since it's included in the combo (wonderland for meat eaterrrrrrs!). 

Will come back with my friends! Also hope to try their new dishes of spicy stew next time!
