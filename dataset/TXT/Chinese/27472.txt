1: They answer the phone "hello" because they are not telemarketers. They are a family owned business who cooks and sells Chinese food.

2. The menu cannot be faxed to you, it's not 1995. There are however PDF's and pictures of the menu available online. 

3. The crab puffs suck. Order something else.

4. You are paying $6-12 for food. It is not going to be high end Chinese cuisine.

5.The egg rolls are the best I have ever eaten. They are amazing.

6.Delivery is always ontime, and my office is in the middle of nowhere, unmarked, and is often missed by other businesses.

7.Lunch specials are almost free at $5.25-$5.75 each and the portion is very large.
