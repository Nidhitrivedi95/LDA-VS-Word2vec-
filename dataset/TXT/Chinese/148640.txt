SLH_6FIjptg5BEJbYNld6w So, we came into this place for a quick bite before seeing a show at the Panasonic Theatre. I've seen this place many times before but never went in. It was a surprisingly nice experience. The beef bulgogi was good, but my sushi platter was even more amazing. It tasted really fresh. The roll was to die for. Our meal came to $30 for two, which is dirt cheap for a good dinner!

That all being said, maybe I should have read the reviews first. The picture of the bug on the plate that was posted here made my stomach turn. And given that two people have wrote about issues with roaches in their food, I'm thinking I won't be back. Very unfortunate!
