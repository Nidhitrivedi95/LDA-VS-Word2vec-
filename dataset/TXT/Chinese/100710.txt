k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA The general food was decent except the pork in garlic sauce. But overall dishes are quite bland.

Lately I've been ordering to go. Every single time I went, I end up missing 3-5 dishes and some of the ones I received was the wrong dish. 
It's ridiculous how they manage to always forget to pack a few of the dishes I ordered. 

Not one time, have they gave me all the dishes I ordered.
I won't be eating here again.
