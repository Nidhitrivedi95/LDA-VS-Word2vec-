k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA New favorite Asian restaurant. Has authentic dishes as well as more "Americanized" dishes that are suitable for all. Had the crispy shrimp with lemon sauce (it was amazing) and the honey pepper garlic beef tenderloin (also amazing). Hot pots are a favorite among the Asian clientele. I shall try it next time. Looking forward to yet another wonderful meal here! Highly recommend.
