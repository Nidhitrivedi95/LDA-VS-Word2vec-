0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA I was at a wine tasting recently with a group of friends and we began to talk about Vietnamese food. Someone swore that this was absolutely the best in the valley so I had to try it. Suffice to say I was disappointed. I ordered the seafood pho and while it was okay it definitely lacked flavor. I will admit that the black pepper shrimp was delicious but everything else we had was subpar and much more expensive than any other Vietnamese spot I have been to...I'm going back to Pho Van.
