PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Truly enjoyed our visit today. The dim sum was tasty and only a couple of dishes were Americanized but they were still great. Their authentic Chinese food and Dim Sum that we tried were truly tasty!!! If you are unsure of what to order, ask! The people are super friendly! If you truly enjoy Chinese food you will enjoy Yum Cha. We will be back
