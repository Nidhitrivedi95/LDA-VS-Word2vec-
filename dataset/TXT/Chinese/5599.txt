0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA I like the atmosphere. And the server lady is great. But, I had the pho which was good, however loaded with msg - to the point I had a wicked msg hangover for hours afterward. Massive headache, sick stomach- like the worst hangover for a few hours post. I won't be eating here again because of this, unfortunately. If the food wasn't loaded with msg I'd eat here again.
