7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew The best dim sum I've ever had was in Los Angeles at Empress Pavillion.  This is a pretty close second.  I was surprised to find this in Arizona.  

I had a Sunday morning hankering for pork buns and sesame balls (that sounds so naughty!) and had heard that this place is about as good as it gets.

My husband and I arrived pretty early and were the first ones there.  As a result the service was great; the only problem was that it was a bit too attentive.  Okay, I can suck down the dim sum but I'm not proud of it!  I don't need five waitresses with carts standing over me.  I'd probably complain of course if the service sucked...but that's the American way!

So, they had the obligatory "what the ?$^@ is that?" to complete the experience.  And it was a bit tired and not as clean as it could be.

I love dim sum!  You'll be happy you checked it out.

Cheers!
