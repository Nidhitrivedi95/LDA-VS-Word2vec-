eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g This was my first time coming here and we had 2 large tables within the Yu Seafood private room for Mother's day.  I found it necessary to write a review on Yelp to share with the public audience:

- on the pricey side (style and food is no different from a typical seafood comparable competitor in Toronto at easily a 15% premium)
- they ran out of DESSERT! (in my 25+ years of eating in Toronto restaurants) I have never been to a mid-high end Chinese restaurant for dinner where they ran out of dessert.  Note that the dessert was part of the set menu and no explanation or alternative was provided
- meal was poorly timed and started coming out after 1 hour of our original start time (we had to ask them if the food was coming before it actually came)
- towards the end of the meal, one of the servers came in and asked who was paying for the bill.  It should be mentioned that one of the veggie dishes for one of the tables did not come at all and we had to remind the manager of this.  Even before this missed dish came, 3 of the servers were within the private room asking and waiting for us to pay.  What was the rush???  We felt a bit overwhelmed by this like we were going to run off and not pay.

This is general feedback for Yu, thank you for reading.
