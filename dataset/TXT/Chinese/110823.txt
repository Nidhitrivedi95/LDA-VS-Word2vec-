lXZvgVmIz-ko1OiCG-VDTw this is one the favorite restaurant in arizona.  if you like hot noodle soup, this is the place.  you get to choose from a variety of soup base, then you get to pick 2 main ingredients ($1 for the 3rd ingredient and so forth) and there are 6-8 different kinda noodles you get to choose from!  my daughter loves its chiu chow soup base and me is fish soup base.  expect a big bowl of noodles filled w/mushrooms, tofu skin, naper, and cilantro.  yum and healthy!  no msg and not salty soup base.  average cost for our family of 3 is about $25-30.  :)

update (june 18, 2014): dg is still one of our favorite restaurant.  we always bring our out-of-town guests here and they are impressed w/the soup noodles (most of our guests come from chicago).  just beware of the the slow service when most patrons come at the same time...because they have a small kitchen (a waiter shared this information to us).  the last table has to wait a long time before your orders are prepared.

highly recommend...
1. the szechuan spicy soup base if you enjoy spicy food
2. hk style wonton is one of the best we have ever had
3. 5 spices wings (my kid's favorite)
4. try the clay pot rice!  our favorite is squid, minced pork, and preserved vegetable

conclusion: we love this place so much that we don't mind the once-in-a-while wait or "bad" service.
