I2rXQTNxmy9HDXsLcJ3yxA We had a table of 12. The place is very nice and the air is very open and clean. The meat look fresh. The service was good. This is about the good as it get. 
The down side now is the stove that we use really stress is out. There are 8-9 level of heat. Once you put it to level 3 the water boil out of the pot. We had individual hot pot. If you out it in level 2 it too slow . So everyone we cook something we had to watch and adjust the switch. It just a pain while eating and cooking. The vegetable greens wasn't really fresh. I wasn't happy with the soup base. Beside clear soup everything cost extra. Lot is other choices cost extra. You get one drinks and then it cost money. So really this isn't a cheap place to hot pot.
