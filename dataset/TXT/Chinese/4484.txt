_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Visiting from the US, I heard good things about this restaurant, serving Hong Kong style fried lobster and King Crab. This place is not for the faint of heart and best to come with a large group. The dining area is hectic, packed, full of energy and seafood. The prices are definitely on the higher end, especially for a place that is cash only. 

Once you can bear the crowd, the servers and the price, what you get is a once in a lifetime experience. You order family style pre-fixed dinners, their speciality as many have noted in other reviews is the mountain of lobster and King crab. When you make your selection your server will bring out the lobster and crab still alive, ready for you to inspect (and snap a pic or two). 

After you're done and sending it off its way, what comes out minutes later is perfectly carved, mountain of shellfish that is cooked to perfection. This is not the cleanest of dinners as the restaurant will leave a box of plastic gloves for you to get down and dirty with your food. Don't worry about making a mess, everyone else is doing it. If you are a shellfish lover this is a once in a lifetime experience, and it'll help if you can bring a Cantonese friend to translate for you ;)
