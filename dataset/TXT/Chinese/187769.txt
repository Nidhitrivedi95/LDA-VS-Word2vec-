yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA So convenient to have this place open 24/7. I freaking love this place. My bf brings me to all the good places here in vegas, and this is my place for pho! It sucks it's all the way across Vegas to get to though, but it's totally worth it! 
I usually get the combination pho, and you get a plate of sprouts, lime and mint leaves on the side so you can add as much as you like. I wish they had more options like a seafood combination pho like the pho place I used to go to when I lived California, but this place will do. Coming from the Bay Area, you have an array of Vietnamese restaurants that are bomb. This place came close, but no cigar. That's why this place didn't get 5 stars because I have tried better, and once you get a taste of the good stuff, none can compare. Also, the staff aren't welcoming, and I always feel rushed to order something when the waiter takes our orders, but eh. Whatevers.
