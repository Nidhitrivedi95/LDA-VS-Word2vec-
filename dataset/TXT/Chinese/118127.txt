NKMkvLWatV9v7zbMNS6D3g Jackie Chen's serves good honest Chinese food for the American palate. It wasn't high end; the decor was so-so but it's a step up from a take-out place. For a quick lunch I don't mind stopping in but it's not the sort of place I would take a date or decide to go after thinking "Where should we go for lunch". It was good enough to go back, though.
