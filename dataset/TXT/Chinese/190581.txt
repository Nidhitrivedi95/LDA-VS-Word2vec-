Made in China is not the place you go to if you're expecting high end hot pot, but for the price you pay here it's of excellent value.

I came here for hot pot on a cold day with my family, and was welcomed immediately by employees who look like university students (Ryerson is adjacent to this restaurant and U of T is also not very far). Despite their relative lack of experience, the students really do try to provide good service, and I do give them credit for it.

AYCE hot pot here amounted to about $20, but depending on the soup base you order it may cost a little more. Regardless, the price for hot pot here is less than other hot pot places in the city, and it should be taken into consideration when ordering your protein and veggies. Their meat selection is not too wide, but their meat quality is actually very good for the price you pay. There's also a decent seafood selection consisting of squid and octopus, and they tasted decent too. I believe you also get a free seafood platter on weekends that consist of lobsters, mussels, etc.

Service, as I mentioned, was excellent and remained great the whole way.

Overall if you're expecting high quality hot pot, this isn't your place. However if you're expecting high value food at affordable prices, this is definitely a place to consider if hot pot is something you like.
