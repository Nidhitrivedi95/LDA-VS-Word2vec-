EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ This has become my favorite noodle house after tonight. Good service, tasty food and great price. What more can one ask for? The dish that is marked as spicy really isn't too spicy, but you need to eat slowly due to quite a bit grease in the soup. The amount of noodle they put in your bowl is more than enough. You won't walk away hungry.
