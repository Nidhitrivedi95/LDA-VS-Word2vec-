CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ I had an absolutely wonderful experience here. The staff was nice, friendly but real enough that it wasn't a fake experience. the food came quickly despite the place being somewhat busy, and the free unlimited soft drinks were a great perk! Meats, veggies and noodles were plentiful and fresh. We were brought everything we ordered. The only downside to this place is how you have to get up and walk to the front desk to fill your glass with water. Water is ice cold with lemon in it though so it's not all bad. Wish we could get a pitcher on the table though, that would really make this place 5 stars. Thinking of perhaps coming back to this place for my anniversary.
