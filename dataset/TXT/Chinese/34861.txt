Fact:
1. They are cash only business.
2. If u are looking for a place to eat. Where u can contemplate and consider the merits of each mouth watering dish in a calm and zen like environment. "This is not the place" 
It is pure chaos, noise (chatter) and movement all the time.  "I Love it". Chinese food with a show! 
3. Expect to be greeted and seated with a menu when they can get to you! 
4. Expect to be asked for your order 20sec after u have been seated. You have 10sec to respond with ur full order, or they will move on to the next customer. (Saw 2 different hostess do this)
5. Some of the best prices and menu options.
6. A non complex menu. It is what it is! With gravy or dry is all u need to know for your noodle dishes.
7. 5 star:  must tries
     The duck, so good.
     The soup, seafood dumpling with noodles. The broth was rich, salty. 
     4 Star:  delicious
     The crispy pork belly and BBQ pork rib combo. I personally did not try this (gave up pork products for lent) but trust the people I was having lunch with. That it was good.
      Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. I know not original. But this is always a must order dish for me .
     3 Star: good but not great .
      Combination crispy noodle. The noodles were off the hook. The gravy was good, that's it just good . 

Fiction:
1. The best service you will ever have. 
2. A nice quiet place to contemplate your day.   "Lol, not here"

I will deffinately come back here to try the many different dishes here , especially the soups.
