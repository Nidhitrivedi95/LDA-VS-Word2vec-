vsi_PMRgyFy4_vVfQErtCA All the Chinese restaurants in East Chinatown are in my opinion disgusting, even by generous Asian working-class standards, and I avoid them like the plague. Pearl Court, practically the only Dim Sum left on the block now, isn't the absolute worst I've seen, but it is right up there in the terrible experiences department.

The front window and vestibule is plastered with framed restaurant reviews and awards from the 1980s and 1990s. Maybe this place was the shit back in its heydays, enough to earn a Zagat recommendation. But the Pearl Court of today is a skeleton of what it supposedly once was.

I am guessing the ancient reputation was why Pearl Court was my family's go-to restaurant whenever we have guests and want to take them out for dinner. That is, until the time when we showed up as a group of ten. We were completely ignored, all standing at the front waiting for somebody to accommodate us. Fuck that shit; we left after five minutes of getting no attention. (Since then, we go to a nearby Viet joint. Lest I digress.)

But let's assume you managed to snag a table. You will find that there are two floors of operating dining space (who knows what the third floor leads to), and I often find the non-Asians are seated together on one floor. The decor is dated, dim and dirty, heightened by the grimy chairs and tables. If you think the service is bad and unapologetic, wait until you try the shit food. A lot of it is bland, too oily or cold when it shouldn't be. I have tasted frozen jacked-up-on-MSG grocery dim sum that taste better than Pearl Court! So much for quality; I think I have even gotten sick from it once.

The one star rating is earned for that one time they had a server named Justy. That's what his name tag said, and that's what I remember best after all these years.
