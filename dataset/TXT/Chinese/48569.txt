C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ So bad I am calling the health department! It's hot and humid in here - and the place is filthy. The floors are beyond dirty,- food stations filthy - and clear that this place is fallen below any sort of safety standard. The manager doesn't speak English and seems non responsive to pointing out areas of improvement. The staff couldn't be any worse too. Terribly disgusted and dissapointed. Do not eat here!
