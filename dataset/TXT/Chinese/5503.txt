0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA Have been to Cyclo twice. Both times the food was very good.  Ate both times in the late afternoon. Good service...an unanimated, but effiicient staff. 

Start with the pork and shrimp spring rolls, move on to the crisp lemongrass chicken or pad thai, end it with one of their unique desserts...and you have a meal that is sure to satisfy! 

Beware the plum soda! LOL That's all I have to say about that...
