I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg I don't normally write reviews but I figured I needed to just get this out there as it really has bugged me...

My friend and I walked in there (we had came over from next door), to see what this place was all about. We got a long drawn out explanation as to what it was and we were really pressured to buy one to try and not just that, but to get a large!!! I was really put off by the salesman "pushing" of the product so much so that we just decided to leave! I really wish they would at least give a sample to try rather then some overly-dramatized-your-life-will-be-forever-changed-just-buy-it speech..I hope that maybe in the future this place learns to be a little more laid back with how they first present themselves to new customers, otherwise this stuck up intimidation is going to just turn away a lot more customers. 

Ill stick to Tea Snow in Mesa (you are not the only Asian shaved ice place in Az as your pompous salesperson claims either)...
