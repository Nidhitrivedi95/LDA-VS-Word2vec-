iuIkzvQRb4DVWOMhE4GI3g the service was good and prompt.  the appetizers and hot tea were tasty and satisfying.
the fried rice was rather lacking in vegetables (for a veggie fried rice)
and the veggie/tofu dish did not have hot and fresh fried tofu (it was served a bit on the warm side).
would return to explore the menu a bit more...
