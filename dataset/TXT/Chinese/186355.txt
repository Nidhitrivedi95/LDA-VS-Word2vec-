yAkaDc6MWX3dy8bnEcCrRQ Our group tried the Imperial Garden for dinner this week.  It's a large space with multiple rooms.  They had a lazy Susan on our table so it was easy to pass sauces and dishes to share.

Our server was friendly and prompt.  She made suggestions on our orders and explained the different sauces.  She and the rest of the wait staff were good about refilling our water and beverages and checking up on us.

I thought the grilled dumplings were excellent.  I enjoyed my lamb which was very tender and had good flavor.  I tried a couple of different shrimp dishes, one with a creamy garlicky sauce, and one with a sauce which was too sweet for my taste.  Our group also had a variety of other beef and chicken dishes.  Although not all of the flavors were to my taste, I would say this was one of the best Chinese restaurants we've been to in the area.  I thought the prices were reasonable, the portions fine, and most of the flavors and textures quite good.  The service was very good.

If I was in the area and wanted Chinese, I would definitely go back.
