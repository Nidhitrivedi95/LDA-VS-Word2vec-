drIFrAyZnyismS1ArZlmAg We are so happy to have recently discovered Loving Hut...a real treasure!   The selections -which are many- are full of flavor and so very tasty!  Our server Linda was a true sweet heart and was very hospitable and welcoming.  The light and bright atmosphere of the place added to the wonderful experience we had.  Can't wait to go back!
