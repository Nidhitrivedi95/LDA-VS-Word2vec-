ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ Update: my new go-to is Steak and Fries (afternoon tea menu, add $1 after the afternoon tea hours)

The Baked Portugese Chicken Rice and Curry Beef Rice is not bad.

I've been going to New City for years, whether for breakfast, dinner or afternoon tea. On a recent visit, I've noticed it's much quieter now; probably a lot of customers flocking to neighboring HK-style cafes. 

Dinner: Baked Pork Chop Rice - The pork is the best - 2 large pieces, tender and juicy with a hint of peppery taste and not overly salty. The fried rice is fragrant and egg-y. The one thing that I'd have to take points off for is the sauce - too red and thick that it looks unappetizing. In general, all the baked rice dishes are quite heavy.  Dinners come with a soup and drink. They recently raised the prices so I believe it starts from $8. 

This place has the best cold HK-style milk tea and iced lemon tea!
