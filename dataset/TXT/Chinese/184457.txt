xUUKtG0E-qAv3RyeOV20rg Came this afternoon for dim sum. Not bad at all. Their car booths are a tad squishy, but I survived. Most of their stuff is average, and their prices are not bad ($2 something for size small). 

An odd thing is that their hot sesame jellyfish option (slightly spicy with sesame oil) had jellyfish pieces that weren't very long. They chopped up the jellyfish. It make it awkward to eat, but it was tasty. Their deep fried taro puffs (wu gok) were piping hot, which is the way they should be. They have duck feet, which should make Grandpa happy if I bring him here. Their boiled veggies were pretty good. Their lava salty egg custard steamed buns were definitely lava, but slightly runny lava. I tried to break my bun in half to see what the inside looked like. I pressed down, and the lava squirted out onto the table. Thankfully, there was still lots inside. 

We had a number of dishes that I have not specified, but for $13 after tax and tip per person for three people, this was not bad. Nice to have another dim sum option.
