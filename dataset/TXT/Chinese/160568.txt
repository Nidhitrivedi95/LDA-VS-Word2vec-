U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Sure the place is expensive for Chinese food, but what a good experience we enjoyed.  The hand-stretched noodles were not only fun to watch when they were made but tasted great too.  All of the dishes were on the smaller and somewhat expensive side, but all were freshly made, quickly delivered, and so good we were literally finishing the sauce by swiping our fingers across the plate.  OK, that's an exaggeration... we're much more polite than that... but it was tempting!  The menu is very large and here is enough to make any one, even the pickiest eater, satisfied.  We wish we could have sampled more of the dishes offered!  Service, BTW, was fantastic.  Why not five stars, one might ask -- the price, that's all.  But considering that it is Las Vegas and inside a major hotel that is to be expected.
