Sf2g8hq8l1iSgvK39kJBDA I have been going to this spot since i moved to Brampton 9 years ago.  It has been taken over by new management and it's definitely not the same.

I went in for a pho soup today and it was very bland and kind of unappetizing.  Last month I ordered the typical pad thai and again, big disappointment.  

After today, that will be the last time I eat there.  Need to find a new go to spot.
