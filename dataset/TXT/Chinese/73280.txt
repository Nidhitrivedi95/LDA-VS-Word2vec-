Fj0zObYm5McHcbtE6MSU0A I got 2 boba drinks. Coconut milk tea and a honeydew melon smoothie. The smoothie tasted like blended ice with a hint of melon flavor. The coconut milk tea was good and I can't complain about it. But this place can not prepare boba for shit. The boba was so hard in the middle and they sweetened them as well. You are adding them to a sweet drink, more sugar on the boba is the last thing you need. The boba was actually sweeter than the watered down smoothie actually. I am willing to still try their food one day but if you are looking for good boba on the east side, don't stop here.
