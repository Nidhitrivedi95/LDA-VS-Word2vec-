X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg The venue was nice. 
The line was manageable. 
The drinks were super expensive. 
It was extremely crowded, there were so many tables that there was barely any free room around. Towards the end the security guards had to section off some sections so you're technically stuck in one spot. 
The reasons for the two stars was because the security guards were very kind and the restroom was extremely clean and neat. The restroom is very important when it comes to the club so I was extremely happy about this.
