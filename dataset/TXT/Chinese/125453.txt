OXyPh_Jm159lwMlebtDeeg I just had to update my review because I finally made it to Jade Palace for dinner.   Lunch was always great but dinner was even better.  The dishes came out piping hot to the table and I have to say I was sure surprised at the portion sizes.  One definitely gets what one pays for here!  

We ordered lemon chicken, an orange sauced shrimp dish (can't remember the name and their website is under construction so I couldn't check), a beef stir fry with veggies, panfried dumplings and Yang Chow fried rice (not 100% sure of the name).  Everything was so, so good.  The lemon chicken was so crispy and perfectly cooked and the shrimp dish was absolutely delicious and a very ample portion.  The dumplings were crispy and flavorful and the fried rice dish was something that I couldn't wait to delve into because it looked so good and different from most I've had at other restaurants.  They didn't stir fry it in soy sauce but instead left it alone and simply combined it with plenty of shrimp and veggies so it was still white and not oily at all.   There were two of us so we ordered too much food but the leftovers fed us again no problem.  We wanted variety - what can I say?!

We're returning again this weekend with a party of six and I can't wait to introduce our friends to this restaurant as they were complaining that they just couldn't find a decent Chinese food restaurant.  I can't wait to get back!
