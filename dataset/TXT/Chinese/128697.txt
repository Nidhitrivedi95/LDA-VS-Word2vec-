PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Haven't been for Dim Sum in a while and before heading out the the usual Orchid ran a quick check on Yelp and found Ym Cha. Really glad I did. We did arrive right at opening and every Item we had tasted so fresh and well above any we have had in Las Vegas. Haven't had this good of Dim Sum since last in San Francisco. 
They have carts going around with the usual items and you can go up to the counter to order others. I do recommend doing that right away. One of the best things we had was the chive dumplings ordered at the counter. You don't have to wait they will bring you what you order. 

Service was great place was clean and food the best.
