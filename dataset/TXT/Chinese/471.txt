-7EwIdxcRC5McO35DVfeSQ Really nice clean restaurant, with great food and decent service.

Tried the lamb skewers and theyre the way I enjoy with lots of meat and cumin and minimal fatty pieces. I would come back for these but pricey at $2.50 for one.

Also tried a chili oil fish. So much chili you would never know there's a fish underneath. A little spicy for me but I still enjoyed the soft fish underneath.

Overall would definitely come back.
