hlDcfzRGfmSmL5LpYcRqKA My boyfriend and I go to China Wok every time we visit Scottsdale. It's a 30 minute drive from where we stay but it's definitely worth it. The crab angels are AMAZING and they make Honey Garlic Chicken which I have never seen at another restaurant. I've tried quite a few of the menu items and I've never been disappointed. They have average pricing and the restaurant itself is nothing special but it's all about the food.
