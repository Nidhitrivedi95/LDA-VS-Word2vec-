BJW6rCMoWcn8fDFhbMVyEQ Great authentic Chinese food. Visiting from Toronto, we were looking for some decent Chinese food and didn't have high expectations. Tried several places in Scottsdale and found Jade Palace. The food may be a tad pricey but the food is good and the owner and staff are friendly and attentive.
