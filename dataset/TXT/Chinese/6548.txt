0kag5JGemji05P3oxx4lpg 20+ year customer who won't ever be back. Ordered carry out tonight, asked for pea pods to be added to a dish, and was informed they no longer carry pea pods. Upon pick up, the nice clerk was making conversation and I informed her that we were unhappy with the unavailability of pea pods in a Chinese restaurant. She said their supplier had raised their prices. I told her I'm not sure its right to call yourself a chinese restaurant if you stopped preparing chinese dishes with traditional igredients.  The guy who appeared to be the manager went onto explain about it costing too much and the spoilage was too great. I told him that blaming the supplier on pricing (I never asked the cost and would have paid whatever they charged -- within reason) was strange and that there are better and creative ways of managing inventory, and he just smirked at me. On our way out the door, to our backs he said "I've been at this 20 years and have been doing pretty well."  I let it go, but this guy is a jerk and we will never be back here again. BTW, the place was almost empty at dinnertime.
