yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A What a great surprise and a gem of a find! While some of the servers are quite young and clearly learning the ropes (we all learn somewhere, sometime), the service was excellent and the food was great. It is shocking that this place was a McDonalds for many, many years, you'd never know it,...and I know it! They did a fantastic job remodeling and rebuilding to make it very open, lively, warm, welcoming and a fun atmosphere.

The food was excellent!  All the ingredients were clearly fresh and each plate made to order. Spices were alive and spot on. Drinks were excellent! We went during happy hour and the value was incredible!! We had 4 or 5 appetizers, where were all good size and 2 drinks and the bill was less than $30,...and we were both stuffed and very, very satisfied! The manager stopped by to say hi and he was a super friendly, knowledgeable, caring guy, that was great.

This is seriously one of the best restaurants in the area. We only had appetizers and drinks but the entrees on the other tables looked delicious and huge and steamy hot!! I can't wait to go back and try them. If they are as good as the apps and drinks we had, I may need to "up" my review to even higher.  Really, stop in and try this hidden little gem, you won't be sorry!!!
