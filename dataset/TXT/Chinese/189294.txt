yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Going to be quite honest- I was fairly inebriated when I ate here, so I can only go off from my memories from that night. However, I do have amazing taste inebriated or not! 

Definitely think that the broth here is quality. The service was by far the best coming from a pho shop and I was impressed that they were so attentive even when there were so many people going in and out of the restaurant. They even called us a cab for when we were ready to go home!

Would definitely go there again.
