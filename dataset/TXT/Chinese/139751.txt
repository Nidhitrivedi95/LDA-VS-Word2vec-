qy6RM3qsgXTanVH-TlJaXQ My first time eating here, and all I can say is it a fantastic place. The entrees are delicious, the hosts friendly and attentive. The boba is the best ! The super large sized boba is $4.95 which is phenomenal. Definitely trying this place again, and eating my favorite BBQ pork chops (:
