u540gB8nSBDZez-Kb76G9w Went for lunch with my daughter & it was very good! It's a mix of Asain food, but mostly Japanese & Chinese. There was pho and some Thai dishes though. I got a bento box with chicken & broccoli, and my daughter had crispy dumplings (appetizer). It was a bit pricey, but it really was a TON of food, and everything was very, very tasty. Choice of soup (I had the best egg drop soup I've ever had) 2 crab rangoon, 2 crispy dumplings, salad, 8 good-sized pieces of California roll, and my main dish. I wish there would be better-priced lunch specials, but it was very, very good.
