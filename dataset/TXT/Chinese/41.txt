--SrzpvFLwP_YFwB_Cetow This is pretty much a neighborhood institution by this point. It's been around for as long as I've lived in this area..... which is pretty much all my life. A large menu of Cantonese food that is traditional, made with quality ingredients and has some hidden gems. 

The chicken with rice in a pot is the usual go-to choice. The rice is actually fried rice so there are cubes of taro sprinkled throughout which is nice. Pro tip, if you let the rice sit in the bowl a little longer, it will form a slight crust that you can scrap off the sides of the pot. It gives an extra textural element, and makes it even better. The chicken is even good on it's own, not the tofu soft mushy meat that you usually encounter.

We've been coming here more in the recent months since they are open late and provides all the comfort food needs. Came here recently for a late dinner and there was plenty of busy tables happily tucking into dishes. I watched the table across from us get a large hot-pot bowl mounded full of veggies and chunks of meat. Some at the table even proceeded to suck the marrow out of the bones with a straw. Don't know what it was, but will look for it next time.
