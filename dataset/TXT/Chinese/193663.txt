ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ OMG!!! This place is wonderful. First note, get there early or make sure you have a reservation as you will have to wait because this place is always packed. However I will say the wait is definitely worth it. I had the pleasure of meeting my friend Kathy for some nibbles and drinks before going a to watch her lovely brother sing in a holiday concert. We sat at the bar, which was also a treat because you get to watch and interact with the chefs. I will say watching them work their magic was memorizing. Oh before I go any further, I also got a nice surprise treat as I ran in to my fabulous former coworker Sam, whom I had not seen in person in YEARS! Now that alone was worth it. (thank you again Sam for treating Kathy and I to a round of drinks)

Kathy and I shared the pork belly buns along with the chicken and waffle buns. My lord who comes up with this stuff? I swear I could have had about 3 of each of them they were that good. The pork belly was nice and crispy on the outside and melted in your mouth with every bite. The chicken was also cooked to perfection and had the chili maple syrup gave it the little kick that you needed.

Needless to say I will be back again as I want to try EVERYTHING on the menu. You know for research lol.
