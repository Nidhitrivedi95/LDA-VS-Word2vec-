Fyuotg1ShiQZLtV5Dmjakg The food is HORRIBLE! We ordered General Tso's chicken and it was over cooked chicken with hot sauce. GROSS! The chicken finers were overcooked and chewy. The crab rangoons were mini frozen from the grocery store...the scorpion bowl cost $10 and had no alcohol in it. WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE. 
AND...we were both sick when we got home.  :(
