OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I've been here for dim sum one time with a large group and was pretty impressed with the quality and price here. We had about 12 people in our group and on a Sunday, this place was packed. Luckily they were able to seat our large group and we started to order away - we go the usual staples of dim sum - haw gao (shrimp dumplings), sew mai (pork dumplings), chicken feet, pork buns, and more. We must have ordered a lot since we were all stuffed by the time we finished eating, but to our surprise when we got the bill, it was only $10 a person (including tip). Definitely will have to come back again for dim sum and also try out the chinese food for dinner.
