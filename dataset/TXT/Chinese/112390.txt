mHcfv-cdbx1LtR3n3FoooA If you are looking for awesome Chinese food at a great price then look no further than Hong Kong Kitchen!! I am a frequent take out orderer and love this place. You cannot beat their lunch specials for $6 you get a full meal with soup, egg roll and crab puff included. Staff is very friendly and accommodating also. General Taos chicken is my favorite :)
