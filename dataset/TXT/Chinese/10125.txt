1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Big Wong is a great restaurant for the broke college kid who needs decent food to eat on a budget.  Service is just fantastic with the most monotone no expression waiter, but super attentive.  No real silverware here, just plastic forks and spoons.  Food is ridiculously cheap, but I think i've grown up to where I can afford food that is better than this.  Ask me 3 years ago if I love Big Wong? I'd probably say yes.
