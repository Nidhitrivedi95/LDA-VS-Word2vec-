PlP0c_u3g-3LiWHpb2XnOQ This is probably the best authentic chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area. I got the sweet and sour pork and the eggplants with garlic sauce. They are absolutely delicious. The pork is crunchy on the outside, and so moist and tender in the inside. The eggplants are seasoned perfectly. They are not too garlicky and have the right amount of spiciness. I will definitely come back here.
