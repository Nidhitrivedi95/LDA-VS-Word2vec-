SktLID5_ywSlgVE-h3NB3Q For carryout Chinese food, China a Go Go is the best. Everything is always freshly made, and hot. We use the Beyond Menu app; orders are always correct and ready in 10 minutes when we get there. For years we have been ordering the Family Meals, which includes  one large soup, two entrees, a choice of fried rice or chow mein, and an appetizer of two fried shrimp and two crab Rangoon. Recently we discovered that if we order the Individual Dinner, it's just as much food with more choices. It's the same menu of course, but there's no argument over which soup to order as we can each have our favorite...mine is the Hot and Sour...and we can split the fried rice AND chow mein. With plenty of leftovers. Seriously, the Individual Meal is enough for two people. And it's cheaper to order this way, too!
