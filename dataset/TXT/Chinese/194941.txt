zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Players gonna play, haters gonna hate... If I had read the reviews on here before I went to partake in some buns and noodles I would have missed out on one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time.

First it's an amazing building that the 3 level restaurants are located in. Simply stunning. We opted to eat in the Noodle bar as our first foray into David Chang's food. We ordered pork and shitake buns, one of the noodles, and the corn side dish. All were simply stunning. So stunning that we immediately talked about if we should eat anywhere else the rest of our stay. As for beverages- I had the Strawberry Field's cocktail, it didn't disappoint- strawberry deliciousness is more like it.

We also happened upstairs to check out the newly opened Milk Bar. Had to try the Crack Pie... We got a slice and it was good. Not outstanding, not addictive. Glad I tried it once.

Just to warn people who plan on eating here-
 You are going to a restaurant that is very hip, trendy, and pricey. If you can find cheaper more "authentic" asian food, that's not the point.  Chef Chang is doing his versions of dishes- not churning out the classics.
