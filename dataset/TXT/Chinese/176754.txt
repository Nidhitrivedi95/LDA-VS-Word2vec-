wR71mnXAJMVmgMBrHevndQ I had an afternoon tea special Guilin Rice Noodle with milk tea for $5.75.  It was pretty good, along with other dishes I have had in the past.

The location has changed names several times in the past.  Still has good selection of chinese food and friendly staff.  The lady at the front cash seems grumpy though, need some cheering up.
