VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg I actually haven't really been to this place, BUT I've ordered from this place so much, I LOVE it.
They're boba drinks are super duper good, and their sizes seem bigger than what they say it is (imo). I love the egg pudding with their brown sugar milk tea, absolutely delicious on the buds.
They're food is just as delicious, and for a boba place they have a lot of options on their menu (from Hawaiian to American) it's really awesome.
Highly recommend to people who are trying boba, and take a stretch and try their other jellies, boba, pudding, etc. :)!
