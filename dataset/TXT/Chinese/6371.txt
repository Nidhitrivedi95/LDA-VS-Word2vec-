0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ The delivery is very slow. Don't be surprised after 7 PM to wait 2 hours for your food to show up. (I live 1 mile away) For the wait, the quality isn't impressive. The shrimp are never cleaned properly, so avoid if you can. Anything with the lobster sauce is un-edible. Your best bet is the chow-fun or the fried rice. Anything breaded is usually a bad bet as the food sits over an hour waiting to be delivered. The vegetables are usually overcooked as well because of the assumed time it sits being over steamed en route to your door. My biggest complaint? They never have chopsticks.
