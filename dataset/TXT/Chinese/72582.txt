fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA My partner and I frequent this place quite often.  We like things that are tasty that doesn't really cost too much.

We've tried many things on the menu.  Obviously if you've never been here before, I would try both the steamed and fried dumpling.  Its up to you to get whatever filling you desire!  I like the shrimp and pork/ Lamb.

Other things to try are Zha Jiang Noodle, House special noodle, Ten ingredient fried rice.  Lastly, I would say that the General Tao chicken here is the best in China town!

most things range between 8-10 dollars per dish.
