AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw I used to frequent their old location in Mississauga so was excited to check this one out. Serves typical HK cafe food like baked pork chop and Portuguese chicken with rice or spaghetti. Tasty sauces, hot (temperature) food and quick service. I like they have many options for drinks like Presotea, HK tea and even alcohol. 

I don't have high expectations for service at this type of restaurant, but they have quite a few younger ("high school age") wait staff who brought the wrong food (twice!) and spilled hot drinks. Two of the older ladies kept things in line. 

Deep fried items seem to be their specialty: chicken wings, pork chop, fries etc. 

Quite busy on a Saturday even at 5:30pm. Good thing we made a reservation. 

Washroom both men's and ladies had broken sinks and stalls. Not great when the restaurant is so full and busy.
