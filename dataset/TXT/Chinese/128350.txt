PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ I was craving some Dim Sum and I looked at all the Yelp reviews.  We were so glad we decided to give this place a try yesterday.  The place is nice and clean.  The staff was so helpful and nice and they came by to see if we needed anything.  Since I was there for Dim Sum, we picked delicacies from the cart and we went up to the window case and ordered some more food.  The food was tasty and fresh.  We particularly liked the pork rice porridge.  We are going to come back and try the dishes on the menu.  Their lunch menu looks like a real good deal.  The prices were really reasonable.  It is very close to Highway 215.  Give this place a try!
