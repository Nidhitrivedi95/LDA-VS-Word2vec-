S-RaYhvlDg8rgEOxaFeLHw Wow, that was some tasty grease-laden food.  

The Highlights:

- Lemon chicken (I'm imagining it was triple deep fried...in crack)
- Singapore noodles (very tasty, but yes, greasy)

The Let Downs:

- Chili chicken (just some fried chicken pieces with some spicy mystery powder, do not order this one)
- BBQ Pork (it looked steamed...can't recommend)
- Thai Fried Rice (poorly mixed, there were big clumps of unseasoned rice in there)

If you're going to order from here, consider the first two and explore the menu a little deeper.  Needless to say, $45 here (incl delivery, not including tip) will feed two people for at least 3 meals.
