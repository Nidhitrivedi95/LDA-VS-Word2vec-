7rh29SPJMkyeI2BJcjqzLQ After living in South End for almost a year, my wife & I finally decided to give our neighborhood Chinese joint some love. I'm glad we did.

We placed an order for takeout, in the restaurant, which was ready in about 10 minutes. Our order consisted off: egg drop soup, egg rolls, chicken & broccoli with fried rice & scallion chicken with lo-mien noodles. The egg drop was about average, I'd say --- I've definitely had better but I wouldn't hesitate to order theirs again. Egg rolls were pretty substantial and had a good taste to the filling. The brown sauce on the chicken & broccoli was bomb.com. My only complaint would be to maybe throw in a little more chicken & a little less broccoli. The scallion chicken, for me, was the showcase winner of the night. It wasn't your typically chewy/breaded mess that is Chinese fried chicken. This was lightly breaded white meat and had an amazing sauce to it. The le-mein were good, but I'm not sure I'd pay the $1.50 upgrade again to get it over the fried rice.

Overall, this place is a solid option for your Chinese cravings. The chicken dinner combinations (soup, egg roll, entree & rice) range from $8.95-$9.50 or so. Well worth the price.
