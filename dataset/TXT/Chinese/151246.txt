szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A Omg the DIM SUM !! So we came here for lunch not realizing that they have Dim Sum everyday until 3pm, and it was amazing!!! Literally everything we tried from the Dim Sum carts was so incredibly tasty. We also ordered from the menu and got Sweet and Sour Chicken and Chicken with Broccoli. The sweet and sour chicken had a perfect crispy texture and the sauce was not too sweet, it was a great balance. And the sauce of the Chicken and Broccoli had such a rich depth of flavor that very few Chinese restaurants are able to achieve. I will be a frequent customer here from now on. Ohh and by the way, don't expect much in the dining room, this is literally a hole in the wall and the dining room could use a makeover. BUT every table gets a fresh table cloth upon cleaning it. Run down doesn't bother me in the least as long as the food is fresh and delicious and they keep the place clean
