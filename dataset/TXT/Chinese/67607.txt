eMTE-wqpk_YWaV3mf7Ii3A Went here for Friday dinner.  Had the AYCE menu ($30/adults and 1/2 price for kids)

Service rating 5/5.
Food overall rating 1/5.  There were a lot of inconsistencies.  As simple as the eggplant dish with tofu, which I had 2 helpings. The first order was seasoned but the second was definitely not.  All the food was overly oily.  Not sure what was going on, I felt like they poured a bucket of oil into every dish that came off of the wok! The fried rice, the pad thai, the bok choy, salmon, green curry...etc.  Not good for a restaurant that is trying to distinguish itself from other take-out Chinese places.  
The mango salad needs to be dressed.  You can't call it salad just by slicing strips of mangos onto a plate.  
Restaurant décor rating 3/5.
Washroom rating 0/5.  There was 2 stalls in comparison to the capacity of the restaurant which does not make any sense.  For a small washroom, there HAS to be continuous maintenance.
