pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Despite all the hype, I'm a sushi lover. Made reservations for 6, had super fast service. They do tell you it's family-style. Weird. Nevertheless, the sushi is awesome! Loooove the Rainbow Dragon roll. The restaurant was full, even though it was a Sunday night, yet it did not take any time for the food to arrive. Nice! Food is awesome so I'd definitely come again when in Vegas.
