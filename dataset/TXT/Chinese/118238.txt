NKYirjjTpzezUi4Rhj64bA Great lunch spot with lightening fast food service at peak hours. 

I often come for the 01 Pho (Classic/Special/Whatever you call it), which comes to under $10 tax and tip included. The satay broth add-on is definitely worth it (+$2.50) and is a great twist on pho for those loving, but tired of the standard broth flavour.

I also love the Beef/Spring Roll Vermicelli, which has great flavour an is $10 pre-tax. 

It's not the best pho in the world, or the fanciest place. But it's great for lunch hour rushes, and is comfort food at a great price.
