URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg Good location off your choice of major arterials. Parking isn't abundant but isn't bad for a near downtown restaurant. Spacious, neat and clean dining area with some window seating. 1:00 Saturday afternoon we were seated promptly and as hide bound water drinkers, we were given our drinks pronto. All the servers seem to work together so there are no time gaps. 

We looked over the menu and ordered a seafood soup, salty fish and chicken fried rice and Kung Pao seafood. The excellent seafood soup came first and fast. It was very tasty and was entirely consumed by the time our entrees showed up. The other two weren't bad but weren't great either. We ate our fill and took the remainder as carry out. Our server boxed and bagged it at the table. My opinions on the food are a matter of detail regarding fish not salty and squid overcooked...I've had both these dishes at other places and I'll stand with my opinion.

I think that with a few visits to identify  the cooks best talents, this  could be a fine neighborhood Chinese restaurant, worthy of regular patronage.
