OYfXGMEwcMKj_gty5e_Udg So I went there on a weekday I believe at around 10 am..and yes there were a lot of people but they sat my friend and I down right away..which was great.  We ordered the beefe satay noodles and this other breakfast item with noodles and ham.  They are would normally take 15 minutes max to make...but after 25 minutes we were still sitting at the table with nothing.  So I asked one of the waitresses and she told me that the take out takes priority and there were a lot of take out orders so ours will need to wait.  I was pretty annoyed when she said that but she also told me that they were making it so I believed her and said okay.  

15 minutes later....our food were still not at the table..but the funny thing is that the table in front of us sat down way way way after us but the mother and her kid were already pigging out on the instant noodle and sausages or whatever else were in the bowls.  So at that point i was pretty furious and I asked a male waiter where our food was and that we were waiting for 45 mins already.  The waiter looked at me, said "I don't know" and was about to walk away..but obviously I did not let him way away.  I told him about the other table and how their food arrived before ours.  While I was talking to him, he ROLLED HIS EYES AT ME!!!!!....I was so shocked that he actually ROLLED HIS EYES AT HIS CUSTOMER!!!  So i called him out for that and he had nothing to say so this other waitress came over and tried to sooth everything out.  She told us she will bring the food out asap..which she did.  

I will never ever ever go back to that restaurant ever again.  I can't believe that man!!...AND the looooong wait time!!
