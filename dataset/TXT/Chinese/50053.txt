Cdywb13_07M1_g3U85VKTA I have eaten here a few times and this will be the last time. The buffet is very limited in selection and when they do not bring out new hot food it is terrible. I waited for over 20 minutes for them to bring out any type of hot food and it never happened. The owner and bus women both noticed there were empty buffet items but they did nothing. More important stuff on their phone. What a waste of time and money. This sucks because in the past I did like the hot and sour soup and spicy shrimp. Never again!
