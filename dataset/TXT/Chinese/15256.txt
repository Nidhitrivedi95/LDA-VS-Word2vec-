3PhF188adiC8ZutKRP9gyQ i do not recommend the cocorn dessert. heavy for my sweet tooth.  mango sago pudding was good with the herbal jelly. YUMM. overall, was a decent place. wasn't that fond of the atmosphere, empty and bland. but the menu selection was awesome, could not decide what to get! it all looked good. would def return to try their other items! btw, the tofu dessert is amazing. comes in a wooden pail. must try if you're there.
