GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw Authentic Chinese food.  Luckily I went with two Chinese friends who eat here regularly.  The flavor profiles were complex and amazing.  We shared the lamb, chili chicken, fish, dry pot, and eggplant.  I do not know what any of the official names are and am worried about having to order myself.  But the food was incredible and if my friends aren't available my plan is to show the waiter pictures of food so can dine here quickly again.  Best Chinese food in Cleveland.
