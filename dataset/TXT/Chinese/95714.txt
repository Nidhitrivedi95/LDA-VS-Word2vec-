JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA I love this place.

I went there 2 times in 2 days because I loved it to much.

Their soy milk is awesome.... I would recommend getting one sweet and one non sweet and mixing them (I like a little sugar...but not a lot).

Their "rice balls" or more like "rice burritos" is amazing... get the salted one.  It has a chinese donut and pork sung (dried pork) inside.

Other things I would recommend is the vegetable and pork buns, their beef wraps and also their egg pancake for breakfast.
