-FlrlELIGmCqdt_JxbdFgg This was the worst Panada inside a Vons I have ever seen.  The fried rice seems like it had been sitting there for hours.  There was only 1 egg roll (even though they are supposed to be sold it sets of 2), no wantons and the orange chicken looked like it was made in the morning.  Plus maybe the prices are higher here or they went up, it was over 8 dollars for a 3 entree meal, but I was willing to pay had it not looked so bad.  Pretty sad when frozen chinese food was better looking.
