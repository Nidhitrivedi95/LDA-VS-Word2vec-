C16dsL_IEOb5UzRWYhxiKw Got lunch take-out. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour (didn't really have a flavor). The Mongolian pork lunch special was also extremely bland. I wish I had looked around for some condiment packs, as I was looking forward to some spicy food today.
They forgot to include my drink.
