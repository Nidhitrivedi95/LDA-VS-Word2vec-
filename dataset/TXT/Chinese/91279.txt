iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A I order here alot because my girlfriend says so.  So last night my girlfriends mom was in town from New Jersey and we decided to order.  After about an hour an a half she called to see we're our order was. The person on the phone told her they would call the delivery driver and tell him to deliver our food next. About 30 minutes later the driver comes to the door he quotes us  the wrong amount my girlfriend told him this is the wrong order he said no it right.  Since we ordered online she pulled it up and showed him. Turns out it was the right order just half of it was missing.  So she asked him to bring the rest.  He told her you will have to re order.  I came to the door and explained what she was saying he then said in as rude a voice as he could.  You wanted the food not me.  So I handed it back to him and told him we did not want it.  Honestly if my girlfriends mom. Was not there I probably would of thrown his ass off the balcony.  Anyway the food usually is not that good anyway.  The chicken usually is hard as wood. I will never order from this place again.  And I would not recommend anyone to order there.  Food quality I give it a 1 customer service 0.  I only gave it one star because I had to.  And if you look at my other reviews you will see this is my first one star.
