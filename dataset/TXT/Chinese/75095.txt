fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg It's a cute but overpriced Chinese / Taiwanese restaurant with slightly better than mediocre food.  We tried a variety of items including their XLB (juicy pork dumplings), shrimp fried rice, scallion pancakes, Taiwanese beef noodle soup, bbq pork and spicy wontons.  Everything was ok but not great, definitely not worth the price tag.  There was barely 10 tiny, thin slivers of pork for the $10.88 price tag. We're big foodies and it was such a disappointment.
