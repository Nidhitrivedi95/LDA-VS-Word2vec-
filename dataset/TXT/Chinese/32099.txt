It's got the basic menu and they're more than willing to augment a dish to suit your preferences.
For example, I like Moo Goo Gai Pan, which is not normally spicy, but I ask them to spice it up, and they comply.
They have family specials, but on those, they are not too keen on changing the choices.
They deliver really fast, and have never made me wait more than 15 or 20 minutes for delivery.
I would recommend ordering from the regular menu, and stay away from the family specials.
They may seem like they're a good deal, but I don't like when my choices are made for me.
I love their pot stickers (although they are pretty expensive), and I like their beef and broccoli, War Wonton soup, and spicy shrimp w/vegetables.
The food is pretty good, and the delivery is fast, but the prices are a little high.
