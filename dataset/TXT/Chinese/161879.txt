ui33pIJmkW0s8HddH_ZZ9A Danielle and i really like Wild Fusion. 

my friend Jeff introduced me to it years ago, telling me it was the same people who used to run the kitchen at The Dragon. not sure that's true or not, but their Black Pepper Chicken is the same and i love it. 

D and I normally order the hibachi dinners (she'll get chicken and i get chicken and shrimp). these come with salads which are really good. I'd go so far as to say the hibachi dinners are better than the ones we've had at a nearby "Japanese" restaurant (ahem... Samurai)

i think this place is definitely worth checking out. it's better than nearly every other takeout style Chinese restaurant i've been to.
