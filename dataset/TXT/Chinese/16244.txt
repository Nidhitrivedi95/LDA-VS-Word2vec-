410NJLoLryd-vYNwRA58pw If you are looking for a traditional dim sum restaurant. Look no further, Ruby Rouge hits the spot! While it is situated in an older mall, once you go up the stairs you will notice that this restaurant is full of regular Chinese OGs (Respectable older Chinese people) that are regular guests. They are usually found reading newspaper and sipping Chinese tea! The point mentioned above outlines the authenticity of this spot.

Now to the food. Growing up Vancouver, I would say I had better dim sum for sure. However it's average and meets my expectation for the most part. The Shrimp Dumpling Har Gou is descent, and their beef rice rolls are tasty! As stated in other reviews, the prices are extremely competitive and dim sum are priced at 2.30 - 4.25 per dish.

If you are looking for an average dim sum spot to fulfil your Chinese taste buds - at a bit of a run down location - here's the spot!
