NSGFzlDGs71v43Y7a1XH0A Newly open so does not feel very organized. I came on a Friday night. There was a lineup for 8pm but it was just 15 minutes. We got sat down but the servers seemed to either not care or not able to care.

We ordered soon after we sat down. Combo B. The food took forever to come and they completely forgot to punch in a fried rice we ordered. We had beijing duck. It was slicked really thin and slightly cold. It seemed like there was only half a duck on the plate. They gave us 11 wrappers for the duck. The duck was very tasty. I would go back for the duck.. but the service really needs to improve.It was quite difficult to get anyones attention. Let alone, waiting 30 minutes for the first dish of our combo to arrive.

The portions in general are really small. We ordered a combo that supposedly would fill 6 people. We had 5 and were JUST full. No more, no less.
