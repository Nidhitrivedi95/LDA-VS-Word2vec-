K0VNhFhaOrO3CypCqofjwA Ma Ma Wok used to be a Chinese American fast food place. Since it went vegetarian, the food has been great! The dishes are freshly made with a variety of great tastes. They are actually better than many vegetarian dishes we had in China!  We are actually meat lovers.  We have eaten here twice since it became a vegetarian restaurant and will come back more trying out new dishes.
