AKMvsVr_9meoSmawkEBe4g My go to place in the evenings when other places are closed, or when I feel like eating well for cheap. The food qualify is good for the price,  but they could do better.  This place has the traditional tacky 1980s Chinese restaurant decor, and I am cool with that. The service is acceptable, even though not all the servers have a mastery of the English language.  I usually get the 9.99$ steak special, a noodle dish of some type,  or their 4 course Lobster meal for 24$ when I feel like it.  Overall,  this place is worth coming to eat at, but do not expect to be overwhelmed.
