Happy Hour wines this time (or in general) were passable but not outstanding. The Grenache was fairly decent, but the Cabernet had a distinct impression of incense, lol. Interesting. Enjoyed the spicy tuna roll and the hand-folded crab wontons were, in my opinion, excellent. This is a solid choice for your asian fix, even for a chain. It's worth a stop.
