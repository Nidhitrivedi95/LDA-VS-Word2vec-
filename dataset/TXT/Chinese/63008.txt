dwgeEOAcPuR-GhpMBaJmjA My usual go to hot pot fix in Toronto is my home. However when I'm too lazy I usually go to Kim Tao! On this occasion  I decided to give China Hot Pot a chance as I'm usually very picky about where I go for it. The last time I wanted a new hot pot backfired as the place we had gone to (Mongolian hot pot) gave off a dirty ambiance and not so fresh meat. Even Morals Village was incomparable. Must be all hype.

Made in China turned out to be a lot better than I expected. Lunch menu (11-4PM  was as great as dinner, went for $17.99 and had everything we wanted.  Service was kind and friendly and the table came with an assortment of sauces for us to test out what we wanted to dip our meat and veggies in. Great hot pot spot and just a delicious as Kim Tao.
