K6AKMjAdCSe8xllsbyeL9Q Went here for dinner, got the Tofu in Curry sauce, vegetable spring roll, and fried rice. The curry sauce was not as spicy as I would have liked, but was fine after I added Sriracha. The fried rice was nice, nothing extraordinary, but the vegetable spring rolls are delicious. You get a large amount of food for an amazing price, excellent for college students. The food itself is average nothing special, but a great value for the price. In terms of spice I had to add Sriracha to everything to add some spicy flavor to the food. 

Overall great place and you definitely get your money's worth.
