eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ Ugh. The service. Is it a joke? I want to give zero stars but can't, & I guess that's alright because the saketinis are great and the buns are good. (Although newsflash: the "spicy bomb" is a plate with a dollop of sriracha on it for an extra $1). The dumplings and ramen are decent but what does it matter when you're just sitting, with your menus, without even a glass of water for *20* minutes? The service (during restaurant week no less) is so bad that the last time we were there (I had been planning this for over a week; it was my birthday), my husband and I just got up and walked out. Once the hostess seated us she told us our server would explain the restaurant week menu to us shortly. So we waited. And waited. And waited. Because I really wanted a white ice saketini. But my husband and I decided that 20 minutes of being treated like we were invisible was just too damn long. What a bummer. It was our third and last time there. With each visit the service has been worse. And if your server is an older dude with a beard and a manbun? Run. You're not getting served unless it is by dancing youths. Grumble grumble grumble. What a disappointment.
