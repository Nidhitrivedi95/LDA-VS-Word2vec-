zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Im a pork bun bandwagoner, it really is that good. I had the momofuku ramen and friend had the winter ramen with the smoked chicken and I liked the pork one better. I thought the milk bar desserts were a little overrated but the food was delicious and very satisfying. The atmosphere is pretty trendy/hipstery, not usually my thing it was worth it.
