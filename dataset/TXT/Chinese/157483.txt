TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA Adding my love for Golden Gate.  I live just on the other side of the 101 so it's either GG or Wong's for Chinese options (and Lychee Inn but I've yet to venture in). I strongly prefer GG after trying each a few times.  My faves at GG are the sesame chicken, the crab angels, and the house chicken.  The beef and broccoli is a family favorite as well. Takeout service is uber fast - usually about 5 minutes so it's good I live only a quarter mile away :)
