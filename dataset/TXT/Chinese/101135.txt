K6AKMjAdCSe8xllsbyeL9Q My favorite place in Oakland to get Chinese food takeout. I love their teriyaki chicken with fried rice! The chicken is cooked well and covered in their sweet teriyaki sauce. There is also a lot of rice. The steamed broccoli is pretty standard. I drizzle some sriracha on it and then take it to the library across the street. This meal will for sure keep you full for a while. I also have had their spicy bourbon chicken and lo mein which is pretty good too. Reminds me of classic chinese food in the mall.
