pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA AMAZING doesn't begin to describe the experience my boyfriend and I had here the other night. We wanted to grab dinner before checking out Frank The Man The Music and decided to pop into this location at The Palazzo. The entire staff was so attentive, from nonstop refills on our soda to very customized suggestions on different menu items. We had Carmine and he was awesome! We went with a three course approach for two and couldn't have been happier with what we chose (beef gyoza, neo roll, the duck, filet mignon, and Chilean sea bass). The manager Jeff came over to speak to us and brought over some additional items to try - such a great touch to our experience.  Can't rave about this place enough - we will definitely be coming back here on our next trip to Vegas! Thank you for a great experience! :)
