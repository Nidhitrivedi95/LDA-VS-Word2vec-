-I7Vz5eDjc63xKmmt4Qx4g This has become a regular lunch spot for me!  Conveniently located with ample parking outside and seating inside.

Food is quite good and they have a lot of variety to offer.  Have tried several different lunch sets and other food items, so far everything has been great!

Nice interior decor, not crowded at all during lunch hour.  They have afternoon tea set that is very good value, I'd like to try that next.
