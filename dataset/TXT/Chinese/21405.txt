So I dragged the family to Asian Legend yesterday for lunch.  Noteworthy point one - we didn't have to wait for a table!  I had been concerned about the lines I have experienced in the past, but for no reason.  After a couple minutes we were shown to our table.

My parents aren't the most adventurous when it comes to ordering, so I stuck to dishes they are familiar with such as hot and sour soup, General Tao chicken, lemon chicken, Cantonese Chow Mein and so on.  Everything was cooked well and totally satisfied.  The portions were so large that we ended up taking a lot home. My favourite dish was still the beef pancake.  Even my parents who were a little apprehensive about the words beef and pancake being thrown together, after trying it totally dug it.

In total, we ordered seven dishes and the bill was around a hundred dollars with a generous tip added in.  Considering there was enough left overs for another meal for two, I would say that is pretty good value!
