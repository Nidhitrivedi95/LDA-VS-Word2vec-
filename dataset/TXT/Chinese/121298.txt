O7_rXHN_-cFp0TgiMaNulw While other food are decent, Please don't waste your money on their Xiao Long Bao.As a native Chinese, I can say there are no aspects of their Xiao Long Bao comparable to traditional ones. The waiter even told us their Bao is handmade by someone from NY. Come on, it is even much worse than some frozen products that you can buy from Chinese markets at a much lower price. We may feel better if the Waiter didn't lie to us.
