Q3UkgxNNInsPcUFhsQFcrg I come here at least once a week. Its a take-out kind of place. Dont expect any fancy seating. If you looking for classically cooked "chinese meats hanging in a window", then this place is for you. The quality is always good and always reliable. Its like the mcdonalds of chinese cuisine; its the same anytime you go!
