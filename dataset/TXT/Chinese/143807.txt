rROHsa0BQsKjxNnfYjBF9g Very good for a small Chinese place.

Portions are good and the food has been consistent in my 20+ visits. Lots of full dinner plates for $5-$8 on their late-night menu.

There are about 10-15 tables if you want to eat in (4-5 seats per table). Table covers are one big sheet of cheap plastic. 

Decor is simple and plain. They have a fish and crab tank.

Good place to satisfy late night hunger on a budget.

Just don't be shy about asking for the late night menu if you're there at night. Sometimes they have a habit of only giving you the regular (more expensive) menu.
