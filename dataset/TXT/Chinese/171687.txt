VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Boy, were we underwhelmed. Went there for lunch with my mom and was disappointed in the service. They forgot our appetizer and then, when we were almost finished with our entrees, they brought it out. We sent it back. They never asked us if we wanted something to drink other than water. Food was very, very average. Having not been here for many months, I think I'll stay away.
