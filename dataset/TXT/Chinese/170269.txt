VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q The food here is great! However the service not so much.    When I don't receive good service I normally don't tip, so when I didn't tip one of the ladies there said "you know the price doesn't include tip". Thought that was a little desperate and unnecessary. I was put in a weird situation and tipped her even though I was not satisfied with the service provided by anyone working there. Reluctant to go back.
