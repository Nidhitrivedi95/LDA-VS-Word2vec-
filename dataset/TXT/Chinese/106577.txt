l-nL4BmhzpZjcavooO48PQ Ordered a hot and sour soup and Szechuan beef for delivery to a nearby hotel. Delivery was fast and the guy was friendly. Food arrived pretty hot. Soup was not good at all. Neither hot, nor sour. More like a tofu and tomato soup. Beef was completely boring and faaaar away from tasting like Chinese food. Last but not least, the rice that I paid for came with a piece of plastic in it.  Overall a waste of money.
