SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ Used the Yelp check-in discount for 40% off sushi; tried Pho for my first time. Both were enjoyed experiences. The sushi was fresh and well made. Pho was very subtle in flavor great for influencing the taste you would prefer. Definitely a good place to eat; the seating may be awkward and the booths are kinda small but they did the best they could with the given floor plan!
