URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg I had heard so much about this being the best Chinese in town, so disappointed!!The people very nice friendly as can be. They get five star's it was the food. I got one of the lunch specials egg drop soup came with it, I added crab cheese puffs.  First there was NO crab in the crab cheese puffs, just cream cheese. (one of my biggest pet peeves when ordering this dish) The soup bowl was not even half full and the soup had no taste. My main entrée was o.k. nothing I would order again Its clear they have a loyal customer base. It may take another try, but for me that wont be anytime soon.
