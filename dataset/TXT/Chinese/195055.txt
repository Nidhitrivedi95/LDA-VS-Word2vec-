zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ A disappointing experience.  The ramen noodles had good texture but the broth wasn't all that flavourful.  The toppings were decent in variety and quality (especially the soft, poached egg).  The buns...  What the heck happened???  I expected tender, melt in my mouth pork!!!  Instead, the lean part was dry and not good.  So sad.  The spicy noodles had pretty tasty sausage pieces, but the random spinach and lack of sauce left the noodles kind of dry.  I guess the cashews were a nice touch.  Spicy chicken wings were the best part of the meal.  The rice cakes had good flavour and a nice chewy texture.  I also had the seven spice slush, not bad.  I doubt I'll be going back anytime soon.  I bet the opening week kinks haven't been sorted out yet.  However, if this is it, I'm definitely in no hurry to revisit.
