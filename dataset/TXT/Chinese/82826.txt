hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q So we ordered take out from Everyday Noodles to try it for the first time about two weeks ago.  My wife got flour noodles with chicken and I got rice noodles with beef and we had a side of broccoli.  First off, the noodles weren't bad but the chicken was quite greasy and I was surprised it was on the bone with skin...so it was a lot of work to get to the meat.  The big problem was the broccoli.  We were about halfway through our miniature green trees when my wife noticed something - worms!  YUCK!!  Our cruciferous goodness was ruined!  Probably half the broccoli had worms in it.  Extra protein?  Hmmmm, maybe.  But I called the next day to tell them about it and the woman I spoke to apologized and took my number and said a manager would call me back.  No one ever did.  I was disappointed, to say the least.  We won't be going back to Everyday Noodles.
