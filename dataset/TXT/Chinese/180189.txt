X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Similar to other reviews, the venue is "meh." Mixed drinks are typically overpriced, and I smelled like an ashtray by the end of the night. You can't see the DJ area from the second floor unless you have bottle service. Dance floor at the bottom is disgustingly packed. 

Perks - even though you can get guest listed from the dudes on the strip, we bought tickets anyway. It came with a $100 bar card! I think that's totally worth it! People are gonna drink $100 worth of booze anyway, right? I highly recommend this option, unless you don't drink. 

I also saw lots of dudes in sneakers and tshirts. Dress code not strongly enforced?
