CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw Best meal I've had in Vegas on this trip. 
Had the wings appetizer and the spices and texture were fantastic. Even better was the crispy bao - true to form was cripsy and the spices were excellent. 
Had the Golden Mein pork and sampled the wife's ants in a tree. Both were good. ants in a tree - awesome. 
Service was top notch!!!
