AR1w3ragHgRvnU71A7aaZA Soga shabu shabu is the worst chinese food I've had in years. As an orange chicken enthusiast I was excited to try their orange chicken and Lo Mein. The orange chicken tasted worse than a microwaveable version. The Lo mein was drenched in butter and lacked flavor. One of the worst establishments I've dined at in a long time. Not going back!
