BJ9GwNMo8vIgSuKc6B_mOw Downtown dim sum spot. Came here for team lunch as an asian group before the holidays.

We ordered quite a variety and the majority were very delicious. It included fried squid, bbq pork buns, beef balls, spring rolls, chicken feet, ha gao, siu mai, curry octopus and mixed pork livers. I thought their fried foods were well made. Others were still pretty good. The only poorly made dish was the beef balls. The colour didn't look right - red in tone, and the texture wasn't exactly normal.

Everything was served fast despite the packed restaurant. As per usual dim sum places, it was really loud but I have always been used to it already. The overall appeal of the restaurant was quite nice with wooden theme paired with purple curtains. Service was good. Price may be on the higher end of normal dim sum places, but again it's Yorkville.
