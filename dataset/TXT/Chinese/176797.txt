wrRxFrnUucvR4dlG6Q9fKA Need to have staff scheduled more effectively.
For example, the people in front of us placed a HUGE to go order.
There were three people covering the floor, and I just think it would have been more effective if another employee could take the next customer in line instead of have them decompose a few hundred lightyears behind the ppl with a mega to-go order.

Orange chicken at this place was dry, lacking sauce, and way too crunchy with a slight hint of burn.

Sweet Fire Chicken (?) was pretty good though. Seasoning, sauce, freshness, and texture felt just right.
