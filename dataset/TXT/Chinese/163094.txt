UPF6nUKB_kbMM44xiEc66g Went for Happy Hour a few days ago. Great deals - half off bottles of wine (but not glasses!), half off import beers and half off their specialty drinks. Appetizers $3 - $5, and good quality for the price. They will steam dumplings, and I kept inhaling seafood ones. Service very attentive - don't forget to tip on the pre-discounted amounts. Very empty at 5-6PM on a Wednesday, which seemed almost strange.
