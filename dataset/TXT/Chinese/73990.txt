FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ Your standard fare for traditional Chinese cuisine. This is definitely my go-to spot for dim sum and dinner if I am feeling like a fancy Chinese dinner in the Sauga area. I can't say this stuff will change your life but you will leave feeling pretty good on a full stomach. The prices are actually on the low side compared to similar Chinese restaurants in the city.

The dinner menu is vast with a lot of great varieties. Their dim sum menu is pretty large too with a lot of pictures of items which is quite nice for those who can't read the language or don't know what the items are.

The space is open, inviting and clean for Chinese restaurant standards. The service is definitely better than most similar places.

I would recommend this place for dim sum and dinner if you are looking good Chinese food and great value.
