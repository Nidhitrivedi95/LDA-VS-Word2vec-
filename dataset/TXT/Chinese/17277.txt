4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA Checked out this place last Saturday with the family and it was goooooood! We were shocked at the portions, but it's okay because the leftovers were even better the next day. We ordered garlic chicken, orange chicken, lo mein, etc. All were excellent. I'm a huge fan of their garlic chicken and will need to go back soon because even as I write this I'm craving it. 
A nice touch is that the combo meals are served in a bento box type try. Love this because I hate my food touching.
