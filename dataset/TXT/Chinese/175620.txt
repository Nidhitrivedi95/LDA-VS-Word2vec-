wJnhUJCOYkncLPZAwaMffA I've wanted to try Room 112 for lunch, but every time I went on my break there  was a wait. I ventured there today with coworkers and made sure to arrive at 11:45 to avoid the rush and a wait. We started out with steamed Gyoza, which was so good! Following, we ate 12 (yes 12) rolls because there were so many choices! We got two of each of the staples...Cali roll and Spicy tuna roll. The California roll was good and the spicy tuna roll was okay. Following 8: (2) Cherry Blossoms...AMAZING so good. The Spider Roll is typically my fave and it was soooo good. The Pink Floyd and Salmon Dream were also really great and total hits. I can't remember which other three rolls we got (sorry) but those were also great. One of us got a ginger salad and a couple of cokes brought us in at $140 plus tip... not bad. Its worth the price because the cheaper stuff at KO down the road is terrible. I will be back! (Doesn't beat New Zealand Cafe but comes darn close!)
