gyDTYm_NDWXEHBPGnL-oRQ Noodles...what could possibly go wrong at noodles?
Well first they need more staff (roommate worked here for three months) and a better way to order without people standing outside or with the door open. 
Waited in line 25 minutes; yes it was trick or treat on State St. night but then maybe have on call staff to call in to help out.
This time we left and went elsewhere. 
But another visit wasn't so busy. We ordered beef stroganoff and some kind of pesto chicken penne and a couple of beers.  The beef from the stroganoff was really gristly and chewy had to put it in my napkin... Couldn't get it down.  The chicken pesto penne was great! As was the beer.  
But don't think Noodles is going to be a regular spot for us since I'm Italian and can make really good homemade pasta cheaper and tastier at home.  
It's a cute place to go eat if your younger maybe and don't enjoy cooking at home or just enjoy any pasta/noodles.  There are lots and lots of choices... And beer, wine, and soft drinks. Something for everyone!
