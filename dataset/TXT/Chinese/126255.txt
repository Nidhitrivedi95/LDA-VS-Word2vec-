Ozf92eEJSwwb3LbO50cvag I also disagree with the first reviewer. After seeing that Suzanne C wrote a nice review my husband and I decided to give TKAB#2 a try. Being that we live just down the street from them (and I couldn't find the phone #: here it 623.516.8886, plus the website for the menu www.tao-kitchen.com)...I drove down there to get some take-out. I asked the waitress what she suggested and she said the garlic eggplant and orange chicken. I went with her suggestion with fried rice with the orange chicken. 

As I waited, she offered me some fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard. A nice gesture as I waited. The wontons were good..I mean I'm not sure what Greg B. expected from just tiny pieces of fried dough...but they were a nice little crunchy snack.

The waitress that was behind the bar was very nice to me, made small talk and was nice to other customers as I observed her interactions. Sitting there for about 15 minutes or so, I notice that MANY take-out orders came in over the phone...and many individuals walked in to pick up as I was there (many of them ordered General Tso's Chicken...maybe we will get that another time). 

Onto the food...

I TOTALLY agree with Suzanne...the Orange Chicken was GREAT! Very lightly breaded...all white meat and just really really tasty! The Garlic Eggplant was also super great especially over brown rice YUM! 

My husband and I would for sure go back there! I hope that they have a longer survival than the previous restaurant b/c we truly lack in decent eateries in this part of town.
