9sFPbD1PUGmyg0CNdkBEew I dined at Fortune House many times before my Yelp time.  I liked it previously because of the wok air and the low prices.  A friend of mine called it his "canteen".  I would have rated it 4 stars before.  I revisited lately.  Food tasted good.  You won't be disappointed with any dish you order.  The wok air was the same.  The combo still represented good value, but a la carte didn't.  The prices had been increased quite a bit.  I can't call it an economical meal anymore, despite the venue looking that way.  Services remained the same, too.  Fortune House is now a 3 to 3.5 stars on my book (I can't decide which way).
