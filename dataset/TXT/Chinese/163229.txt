UPSzbM6D2SkarWAINq1I9A I stopped in here after seeing what was close and cheap and absolutely did not expect what I got to be as good as it was. I got the pho with the beef in it, I think it was the #30, and it was absolutely delicious. I went to another place downtown and got pho before, it wasnt bad but Tay Do blows it out of the water. I will definitely be coming back here anytime I want pho and especially to try as much as I can from their menu which is loaded with all sorts of stuff.
