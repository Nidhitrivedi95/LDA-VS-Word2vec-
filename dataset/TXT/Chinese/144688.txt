Okay listen up Yelpers. The bubble tea you will be lucky enough to encounter at this establishment is the tried-and-true BEST bubble tea in this entire damn city. The tea itself is a bit sweet, be prepared, but nothing over the top (I always go for the leechee green tea), but the real kicker is the bubbles, which are not only always cooked to perfection, but are also given to you in the appropriate quantity so that you don't run out of tea/bubbles.

The only other thing I have had at Rose Tea is the egg drop soup, which has pieces of corn and is decently delicious.

But mostly...BUBBLE TEA
