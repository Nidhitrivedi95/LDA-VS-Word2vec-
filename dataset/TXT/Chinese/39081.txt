AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw 2.5 stars. I've been eating at Hollywood for over 1/2 a decade and was skeptical to try this new location. It's been open for quite a while but tbh, food isn't anything special and the prices are more expensive then their original location. Basically upgraded the price and image but with bleh food. The service was also kinda okay. Only a few tables were seated and yet service was slow as a snail, though one of the male servers was quite nice. If I'm going back, it'll probably be because of the preso bubble tea bar. Gotta rate that too.

Ordered: 
Chicken curry with rice: the curry was very watery and the taste was quite mediocre but the portion was alright. The rice itself wasn't too impressive either. But have to admit, the chicken was quite tender. 

Bibimbap (they called it Korean rice something...): let's just say nothing about it was Korean except the look of it. The veggies and the stone pot... the beef was over cooked and marinated with soy sauce (clearly not Korean). They could've at least used Korean rice but nah. It was regular rice. Again. Nothing Korean about it. Portion was larger then my face so I'd give them that much. Overall, i would've gone easier on this item if they didn't claim it to be Korean... it's a shame.
