O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw I'm not a torontian so I can't compare this place to other dim sum joints. We came just before midday on a week day. No gossipy ladies pushing carts: you fill in your order and hand it to the waiter. 

The food is pretty damn good, we ordered shu Mai, zha liang, mushroom dumplings and Cha shao su. Of which I would at least recommend the first three. 

Atmosphere and service goes as any other cheap Asian restaurant: not amazing.
