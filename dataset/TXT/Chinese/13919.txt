The food is good if you're in the mood for some Chinese food. I went here after my boyfriend recommended this place because he used to go here when he was a kid with his family. The only place around that makes some tasty Pineapple Chicken and the portions are generous. The prices are reasonable and if you're looking to come to dine in, I wouldn't recommend it since this is merely just a take out place. Luckily, this place had some authentic dishes so it's convenient for those who don't want to take the drive downtown. Their Singapore style pan fried noodles was good and plentiful for just one person. If you know what's authentic, then you have no problem picking out the ones that are. 

We went there to order in person since we were coming back from our day of shopping so I'v never experienced their take out so I can't say if that is bad. If I'm in the area visiting the boyfriend's parents place, I'll try and see since it's not that far away.
