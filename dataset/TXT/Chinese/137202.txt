qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA came here with a few coworkers. had a pretty fun time as there were a couple of people in our group that were sushi noobs and weren't comfortable eating the raw stuff.
the food itself was pretty standard, nothing really stoody out to me. what i did notice on the menu though was a lot of chinese dishes and some korean stuff as well. 90% sure this was a chinese owned and operated restaurant.
service at times was good, and at times was quite bad.
when we first arrived, we asked for a table for 7 and the server, in a very annoyed tone, said that we should make reservations for a big group next time cus they may not have a table for us without one... the restaurant had PLENTY (80%) of open tables, so i don't see why she was making a big deal out of it.
in many ways, the servers just seemed very stuck up.
but yea, like i said the food was standard and the tea pot is heavy.
