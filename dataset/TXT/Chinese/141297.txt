rEAFZFziiOWxSLsOLohccQ My family had a wonderful experience at ANN's.  Food was delicious and authentic - I grew up in Asia and my family had restaurants; so I am qualified to say this.  Service was very friendly and warm.  The ambiance is very pleasant and relaxing.  They even have a diaper changing table in the restroom and a fountain area where active kids can expend some energy while waiting for the food to arrive - a family-friendly restaurant.  Unlike most Asian restaurants, the choice of beer, wine and spirits is extensive.  Looking forward to going back.
