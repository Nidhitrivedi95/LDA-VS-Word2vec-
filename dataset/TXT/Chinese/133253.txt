PV1lnCp6_OVsR93El679BQ This is a family eatery that serves up savory and authentic Chinese food. As someone spoilt by the rich offerings of Chinese dishes in  Asia, I came away highly satisfied today. In fact, you can probably guess from the almost exclusively Chinese / Asian diners that Papa Jackies hit the spot. 

There is an extensive menu that runs to several pages. We tried the more standard fare such as orange beef, dry noodles and porridge - all delicious!  In addition, there are some dishes with unique names that we've yet to try. We will be back!

The place is new and clean, and the food are reasonably priced. 

Service is fast. Waitresses are knowledgable about the menu and help to make recommendations. (However typical of such eateries, one does not normally expect the waitresses to make enquiries to diners about whether everything was ok etc.)
