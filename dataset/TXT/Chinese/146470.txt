s3AG8m6Pzq-vON729pf0gw Love the Singapore Noodles, it is now my favorite!  My wife had sushi, it was fresh and generous portions.  We sat at the bar and watched the Orioles stomp the Red Sox,  The bartenders/server (Jennifer and Aurora) were refined and nice.

What a great way to spend an afternoon!
