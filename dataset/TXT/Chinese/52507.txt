cI7k9zqs_pl3byUDE4cpdA I had high hopes for this place but unfortunately we won't be coming back. We ordered the basics to test this place out. We got the orange peel chicken and beef chow mein. The chicken was crispy, orange flavor comes through but not enough for me to want to come back. The beef chow mein was way below average. Thenoodles were mushy, reminded me of overcooked spaghetti. It did not look appetizing, we took a bite and that was it. They give you a big bowl of white rice, also of poor quality and texture. I will say the ladies who waited on us were on the ball, you take one sip of water and they're already rushing to fill your glass. The interior of the place was almost too dark for a restaurant.
