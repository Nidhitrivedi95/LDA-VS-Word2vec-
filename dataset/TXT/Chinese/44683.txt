bK7DXRrvaoJbivr4y0pH7A Food is good, but two days in a row I've came in at lunch time and had to wait for mixed vegetables to be made.  I asked two employees why they don't have vegetables ready.  One said they don't make them unless someone orders them, the other one said they go bad fast. 

I would think at lunch time they would have vegetables ready.
