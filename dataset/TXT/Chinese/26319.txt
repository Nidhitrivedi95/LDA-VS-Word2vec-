7Ry-hEfZwaDXe8u-n6v15A I have no complaints in terms of the food and the freshness of it. My biggest gripe with this place is the service. I'm not quite sure how they manage their guest but this place definitely sucks at it. We arrived there and waited for 15 minutes. A lady walks up and waits in front of us, but thinking nothing of it we stood there. Funny part was there wasn't a person there to help manage the tables and who came first. So this middle aged biatch took our spot. We were pretty disappointed with that, but I figured I won't be bothered with it.. Because after a minute, we got a better spot.. Beside the biatch's table. Asides from this turd, the food was good! We ordered 3 dishes and all 3 came out perfect! I don't have pictures, but next time I go I'll remember to snap some up! :)

Make sure you don't go on a busy night because you won't be greeted when you go in.. Neither will you be seated in an orderly fashion.
