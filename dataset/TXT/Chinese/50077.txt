Cdywb13_07M1_g3U85VKTA As someone who is Chinese and eats out a lot, I feel I need to defend this place. Sure service is not the best here and the American-Chinese food leaves a little to be desired, this place does authentic Cantonese the best in the valley. 

A few things to try (don't know the official name but description should help waitress) out are the lamb hot bowl, stuffed duck, their mellon soup (actually cooked in a mellon and very tasty), and the fried breaded fish. Very authentic and very good. If you can live with the service and experiment with the food the experience is very rewarding. Just look at the customer base. You know they are doing something right when the restaurant is 90% full of Chinese people and the consensus among local Chinese is this place rivals the best Chinese food found in NYC, LA, SF, etc.
