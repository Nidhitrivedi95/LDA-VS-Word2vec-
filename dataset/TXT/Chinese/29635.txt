966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA came here after reading the great reviews on yelp.  a great place to go if your craving asian food rather then the vegas strip food.  decor of the restaurant is your typical chinese noodle restaurant.  it was also pretty clean so they really take care of the place.  we ended up ordering seafood porridge, seafood noodle soup with egg noodle, and some green vegetables.  food came out pretty quick and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the taste.  we both felt there wasn't a difference between the tastes here compared to the places were familiar with here in the bay area.  the noodle soup was hot and fresh, and what really makes this place 5 stars is the large amounts of seafood inside the bowl and the price that they charge.  the noodle soup was around 7 dollars and the porridge the same.  this place is a great place to check out for lunch, dinner, or late night dinner as there open late.  next time were in Vegas we will definitely check out again!
