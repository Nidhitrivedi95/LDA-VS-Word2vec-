UPSzbM6D2SkarWAINq1I9A This is by far the best Vietnamese food in the area.  We have since moved to Chicago, and as great as Chicago fare is, we have not found food that comes close.   We miss going to Taydo.  They are a delightful couple. They work so hard and take such care to create food that is fresh and delicious.  If they still have the crepes, that's definitely one to try. But, everything we have ordered was exceptional.  Yes there is a waiting time, yes it's an older place and nothing fancy in appearance, but it is worth every minute and every dime, every time.  Fond memories of a great place.  Miss it dearly.
