Q9veWOu7mFj881o3nqB4bQ We were in Pittsburgh for business and we wanted to try something different so we ended up here. Parking is not easy to find.  It is located in a college area and we thought the prices were decent. They offer sushi and hotpot.  We had the hotpot ( all you can eat) for approximately $23.00pp.  You make check marks on all the items that you want on the paper menu and they will deliver all the items to your table.  The food was delicious and we enjoyed the experience. This is a dinner that takes time so don't go if you are in a rush.  We were there for about 2 hours.  They also have a full bar. Enjoy!!!!
