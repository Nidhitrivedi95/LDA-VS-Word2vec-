BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ Came here during a weekend visit, and was mildly disappointed. Things started off well. We ordered edamame and shrimp egg rolls. You can't really mess up edamame and the egg rolls were good...loved the sauces they came with.

Also, i a few really tasty cocktails...so nice job there.

The ladies with me ordered pad thai and a fried shrimp dish. I ordered of the appetizer menu for lunch, a seaweed salad topped with seared tuna. and our food took FOREVER to come out. Several parties were sat, ate and left before our food arrived. The waiter assured us it was coming and almost an hour later, it finally did. The food was good, but an hour?? It was not busy. And although the waitstaff apologized, they didn't offer anything for our wait. I think we were too nice. I f i lived in the area i MIGHT come back because its a nice place to get a healthy meal...but for that wait? i think not!
