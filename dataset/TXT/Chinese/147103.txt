sA_CAFTrAn5g7-7DE2xMNw What happen to this new location?
Places got bigger but the waitress got angrier @.@...

This new location is around 3 times bigger than the old location. It looks like a banquet hall that people have wedding. They use white chair covers for the chairs and those covers looks kind of dirty with oil grease on them.

We were greeted in with an angry waitress. I thought maybe one of us have owed her money. We sat down and told her that there was still a person coming. We sat down for 45 min waiting for our friend to come with only 5-6 tables occupied. The waitress kept on asking us when we will be ready to order. We told her there was one more person coming and the restaurant wasn't even half full and she was already pushing us around, very bad service...

There was no water provided for the meal like the old location. You have to buy drinks from them instead. 

We ordered a big plate of chicken and lamb noodle soup. The noodles at the bottom of the chicken plate tasted excellent. For both of the meals, they were all super salty. I remembered back in the days, they weren't that salty. The soup tasted horrible because of the salt and after we had a piece of chicken we couldn't taste anything afterward because of the salt. However, we weren't the only table complain. The table behind us complained the same as well.

We also ordered the lamb skewers. They were a bit expensive because it was $3 a skew. 

As we were leaving, and walking to the hallway, we were greeted out with the same angry waitress again. Interestingly, how we got greet in and out with the angry look on her face.

EXPENSIVE FOOD WITH FAST FOOD SERVICE.........................

I probably won't go back again and won't recommend to my friends anymore.
