The GOLD borders, frames as well as the Chandeliers very reminiscent. Obviously it is much newer decor so has that comfort feel. It helps that the seats are new and nicely cushioned. 

If you notice CLOSELY, the whole space can be separated in 5+ sections by removable dividers and if you can imagine it then you will notice each section has it's own WEIRD theme but it's only the wall setting that makes it so. One of them is some Maple Leaves of sorts. 

$2.60 for PRIME(11-1:30) Dim Sum period while $2.30 at off peak hours(8-11, 1:30-4(?)) is definitely something to pay attention to but the food is A-OK. The menu is pretty standard Dim Sum items nothing unusual or creative. 

Har Gow(Shrimp Dumping) is all SHRIMP didn't taste any other ingredients or flavourings and the skin is acceptable I guess. 

Siu Mai(Pork & Shrimp Dumpling) is nicely sized with COOKED and normal Tobiko on top with whole Shrimps inside and the Pork mince is very smoothly grounded. 

Steamed Beef Tendon with Chu Hou Sauce is fine as well as there is still good bite back at the center so it's not just PURE soft gelatin. Lots of noticeable Chopped Garlic on top but didn't taste Garlicky at all. 

Steam Rice Roll with Dough Fritter is SO-SO. Kind of hard to separate the pieces even with my expert Chopsticking. The Dough Fritter was kind of flat. It is what it is? 

Definitely not my FIRST choice or even second but if some friends or relatives wants to try I will go along for the ride.
