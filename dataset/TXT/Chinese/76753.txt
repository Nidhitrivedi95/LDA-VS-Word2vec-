gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw Love their kindness before anything. Ive been here about 5 times now, and they remember me by my face. Its something I appreciate more than anything.
Besides the welcoming feeling, their food always have 50% discounts. I actually have no idea if its all day long or just during lunch time because I come in during lunch. But their deals are great! I try to taste different kinds of rolls everytime time I visit. But i can never say no to the Dragon Roll! Its amazing and tasty! 
I recommend this place! Try it out!
