AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA My family loves Veggie House. Generous portions and all vegetarian fair that feeds my family of 4 (2 kiddos and 2 adults) for about $30-$40. We usually shoot for the Crispy Eggplant, General Tsao's, Sesame Chicken or the Orange Chicken. You really can't go wrong. If you're craving Chinese style takeout without the meat or the grease...this is your place!
