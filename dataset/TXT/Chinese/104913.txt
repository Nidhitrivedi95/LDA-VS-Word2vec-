KRoJhHyPWORMJn1UO5kAkA My family and I came here for lunch. We ordered 3 dishes in total: seafood tom yum noodle, black pepper chicken rice, and chicken fried rice wrap in lotus leaf. Overall the food was OK. The black pepper chicken rice was really salty and the fried rice wrap in lotus leaf was just Yeung Chow fried rice wrap in lotus leaf. The portion size was a bit small compared to other HK cafes. 

The service definitely needs improvement. They messed up one of our order and we had to wait for like 20 mins. It seems that we were not the only one who had a messed up order. We saw several dishes going back to the kitchen from other tables. They won't refill tea unless you ask them to.
