dblGQtHAzNy1ACis1m2shw Ordered NY chinese last week, and now again this week. this time with some friends who are always ordering chinese takeout. I figured i wanted to see their opinions.

We called ahead and asked for the broccoli and beef (large).  

Beef and broccoli was good, nice amount of beef. they didnt skimp. It had a little too much sauce for my liking but everyone else loved it. I'm not a saucy person. 

The lemon chicken had such a light and fresh batter on it. It came on a huge bed of lettuce with fresh lemons. The lemon sauce was on the side and it was a ton! The chicken was very tender, not over cooked at all. I didnt like the lemon sauce, it was very sweet and thick so i skipped it. 

Orange chicken was same as last time. I'm still a sucker for the orange chicken at Panda Express but this is a nice second place. I liked that this time it had pieces of broccoli. Got to get those veggies in! Just shows that they arent consistant though.

OOOH and we also ordered a side of the crab ragoons and they were so crispy and perfect. I was impressed with the amount of crab/creamy cheesy stuff on the inside. 

They told me it would be ready in less than 20 mins and when we went in 15 mins later it was ready to go! (and they were super busy too, so glad i called ahead!) Quick and fresh, cant complain!

It was really cheap, less than 30 bucks for four people and we had left overs for the next day! The entrees were 8 bucks each and all came with steamed rice. Winner!
