6s7uduX1Q1KSjOKvwxYkRA I have only had one dish here, but each time, including last night, it was delicous. It was the Singapore Rice Noodles, an item that can be hit and miss almost everywhere. These noodles are almost always served with a light curry flavor, but what was great about Koji is that they give you a no-curry option and I took advantage of that in a late night to-go order. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the chicken and shrimp and onions and peppers were cooked perfectly and tossed in the noodles. One of the top Singapore noodles dishes I have eaten. They also include a colorful red dipping sauce that can bring the heat if you douse too much on there. No soy sauce should be used on these noodles. A side porder of steamed rice was only .50 cents which might be the best deal at the Orleans. Noodle up.
