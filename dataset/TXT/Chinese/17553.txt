4STzP1q1uM8ONkKookifsw Nan Zhou is nothing to write home about, however, I feel very conflicted giving this place just an A-OK. What I find most appealing about this place is that this is the type of food that reminds me of family and a humbling meal. 

As a temporary transplant into Arizona, finding Asian food, let alone food that reminded me of my family back in California was difficult. However, with Nan Zhou's simple bowls of food it really tugs at my heart strings and is somewhat nostalgic.

I had lunch here and had the Beef Noodle Soup. It was simple as the menu item, noodles, broth, tender beef, some spinach and garnished with a sprinkling of cilantro. You can definitely tell when noodles are hand pulled and these were and cooked well. The broth though clear, was simple but flavorful. Nothing too complex, but warming. The pieces of beef were tender and made the bowl of noodles more hearty and savory. The greens added more to the dish and brightened up the flavors. For more flavor, dip your beef into the black vinegar with a little chili if you'd like.

Service is typical of most Asian restaurants, but decently clean and priced. Lots of Asians dining here, which indicates this place must be good. The only draw back is that this just feels like a dish you could make at home. Perhaps if I had tried their other dishes or appetizers I would bump it up to a 4, so Nan Zhou will sit at a 3.5 for me for providing a heart warming bowl of noodle soup.
