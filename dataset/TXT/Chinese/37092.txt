AMM3qOH9DUQzJHm9Q3vHag I love Chinese food buffets. I have been Pokemon-ing them around Phoenix for years. Needless to say there are some bad ones. This is a good one. They had soooo many types of chicken.

Okay, so I was pregnant and craving chicken. That doesn't make my review any less valid. I had three plates. I would have kept going but my husband looked bored.

Nothing seemed stale and there were many options. It seemed clean for a Chinese Buffet.
