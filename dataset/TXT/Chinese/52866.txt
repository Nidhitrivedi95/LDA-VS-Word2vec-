Alan, the owner is always present with warm greetings. Love the crispy noodles & duck sauce. The crab Rangoon so so good large & fresh & crispy. Vegetable egg rolls terrific. Everything's always great. They deliver also which is nice . We appreciate the elegant table linens ,a nice touch that most small Chinese  restaurants have given up on!
