fjMCpoHsXKLerXiLW9ChKg As usual they did not disappoint.  They're Ma Pao Tofu is awesome.  In my opinion.  
My husband loves there sweet and sour chicken.  As well as there egg foo young. The patties are thick and very moist not dried out. 
They also have a great kids meal for the littles that don't like Chinese food.  We've always ordered to go. Pick up is fast. Delivery takes about 30 minutes.  Depending on your order. 

I really love there food.  And the owner is also really nice.
