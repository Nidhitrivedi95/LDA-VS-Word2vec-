6sATfFam9_q9uod0I2aCsg I used to like this place a lot as I found their dishes were less salty and oily compare to other Chinese restaurant. However I was very disappointed when I went there for dim sum recently. The dim sum menu has very limited selections, I remember they used to have more unique dim sum dishes. And we ordered the fried rice with avocado. It used to be one of their best dishes. It tasted okay;however, the avocado was rotten and they looked blackish but they put quite a lot in to the rice. The fried rice was 20 dollars and consider how cheap avocado is and they rather sacrifice the food quality to save cost.

The other dishes we got were either too salty or greasy...

Summary: Overpriced for average quality of food. Although the seating is comfortable, I will probably not go back. Don't waster your money there. You are better off go to a regular Chinese restaurant and order vegetable dishes for half of the price.
