I feel like this place don't have a bad dish. Thousand year old egg porridge is decent, but not good. I don't understand why they put ginger in porridge. Dessert - black rice with coconut syrup is a bit way to sweet and cost the same as a dish. Not that great. But, overall, I really like their food here.
