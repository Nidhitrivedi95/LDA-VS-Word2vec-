m3tNor-GTl-aAST5AmEqYA Had lunch with 35 of my closest friends today. The restaurant was very packed but we were still seated very quickly. There was a large selection of food. It all seemed very fresh. There was a continuous stream of employees replacing food or replenishing food at the buffet. I had no problem getting a new drink (I had 4 iced teas...). Employees were constantly clearing the table and making sure all was well. I only had one complaint.... lets just say the men's room was dirrrrty. Other than that good food, fair price.
