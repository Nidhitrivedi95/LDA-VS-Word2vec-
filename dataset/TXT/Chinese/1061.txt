-H1-IzxW6CXmjhmF5F6iMA Tried this new place for the first time Jan 2, 2016. Ordered over the phone and food was ready when we got there.  The place was nice & clean. There were several people waiting for food & a few that were waiting to order. A good sign I thought. We got beef & broccoli with white rice,  veggie Lo mein, and egg rolls. We liked all of our food. The only weird thing was I thought I smelled a fishy smell on my beef. As if it was cooked in a same pan with fish. Hmmmm. Not good if u don't really care for fish.  We will be back for sure.
