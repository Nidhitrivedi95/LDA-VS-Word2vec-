u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ Kj Kitchen is my authentic Chinese place. My family does routine family outings to our favorite spots depending on whose birthday it is and usually Kjs is picked by 2 or 3 members of our family. So we start off with my dad's favorite soup. Sizzling rice soup. Octopus, fish filet, shrimps and scallops in a light broth with crisped rice added on top. Pretty good. Then we get the crispy noodle chow mein with shrimp. Salt and pepper pork chops are amazing. My brother gets a half fried chicken, combo fried rice. I try to get the xo green beans and beef with American broccoli. The shrimps with candied walnuts are my wife and dad's favorite. And my son loves everything we put on his plate. Great authentic Chinese and the people who work there know us and treat us really nicely. Be nice people, tip well and people will treat you nice back.
