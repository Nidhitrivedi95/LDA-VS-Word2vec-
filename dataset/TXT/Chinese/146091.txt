S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A Amazing food by a great staff. We have been looking for a decent  noodle house since we left the culturally diverse Bay Area and we stumbled upon this gem.  I had the Beef Noodle soup and it was perfect, not too salty or too bland.  We also had the dumplings and they were not your tiny little frozen steamed and fried version these were obviously hand made and were full of meat. I would highly recommend this place and look forward to my next visit.
