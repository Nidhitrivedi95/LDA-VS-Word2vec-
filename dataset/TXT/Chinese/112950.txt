Mkpg9S2j0ZrZc3q-VjfLsA It is really nice inside, and I got a hoot from the place mat which told you precisely where to place the plate and bowl (not that the wait staff followed its directions).

We ordered several dishes to share -

Chilli Turnip Patties $5.50
Minced Beef Congee $4.25
BBQ Pork R.N. Roll $2.99
House Super Congee $9.95 (Large)
Pork & Preserved Egg Congee $4.25
Soya Sauce Chow Mein $6.25
Fritter $3.20

For me, the stand out dish was the turnip patties (more like cubes) with its creamy inside and crispy outside.  Another diner however voiced that he would have preferred it fried up with more ingredients (ie. shrimp), instead of the mini tidbits that arrived adorning the turnip cakes.  Actually, that also caused me to deem this a four star spot.

Everything else was fine.  Oh, and the large congee is indeed LARGE.
