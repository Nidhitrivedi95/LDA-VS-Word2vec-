xdphjWZymq-3dqOWmA_wwA I thought the good was very good when it just opened. However, it seems like the food are reluctantly prepared and cooked nowadays. The service is very slow and seems like the servers there are inexperienced. Recently, I ordered  rice plate that comes with an unpeeled egg (that usually come with the rice entrees). So I asked the owner about it and he said if I want the egg to be peel then the price of the entrees would increase. And that additional increase would go into labor. I was confused because the eggs were peeled before and the price remains the same. So, since they are not peeled anymore, can I request for a lower price of the entree? I feel like the owner is making up an excuse since most of their entrees that come with eggs are not peeled anymore.

Oh by the way, the cups are not clean and I see stuff floating around in the water. So it forced me to order a drink from the menu. However, most of the drinks I tried to order are not available. So why are there options on the menu? There was no indications that some of the drinks are seasonal. 

There is no reason for me to return to this crappy place.
