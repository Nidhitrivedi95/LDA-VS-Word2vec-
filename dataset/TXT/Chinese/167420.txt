VGxJbglGlx-a7Gdc55Q6jQ I bought a groupon to try out this place. I went with two friends. We sat down and gave the waitress our groupon. We had to track her down to get our waters refilled even tho we were one of two tables in the whole place. They were out of a lot so we would order and then have her come back saying we couldn't have that many times. We ordered seconds to make sure we ordered enough to use the groupon. After we had spent $100 the waitress said we couldn't use the groupon bc we asked for separate checks. When we said we would do it together she said no bc someone had ordered all u can eat and that can't be on the same check. She sent a manager over that got really rude as said they won't accept them bc spmeone got a discount by ordering AYCE at the same table. The sever then said she never saw the coupon qe had on the table during the whole meal. The one that she talked to us about. I've worked in restaurants for years and never saw management or servers treat guests like this. I will meet go back there.
