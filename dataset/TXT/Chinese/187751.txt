yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Went for dinner last night with my BF and daughter. Once we got inside there was a pretty good amount of people waiting. There was no one at the front desk so I couldn't even ask how long the wait would be. Finally once a large group got seated I was able to see that there was a sign in sheet. After that we waited about 10 min to be seated. Once we were seated no one seemed to want to take our order. For the amount of people there, you would think there would be more workers. We sat there for a good 10 min before anyone even came to ask us if we would like anything to drink. The only good thing was that the food came out pretty quickly. Which isn't too surprising considering it was just soup. We had the steak pho. Super good and the portion was huge. my BF and I could have literally ordered one to share. We also ordered the chicken fried rice which was really bland and didn't have a flavor at all. The pho was good enough to maybe come back But for the lack of customer service I might try a different pho spot next time.
