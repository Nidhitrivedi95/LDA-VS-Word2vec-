eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ We ordered here for two day straight. We had the pad Thai which was not good. Lack of flavor and it seemed dry. The yellow curry medium was amazing on the other hand. The second day, we ordered pad see eaw (spelling) and it had a lot of meat. The beef was tender and had a lot of flavor. The vegetables in the noodles was cooked perfectly as well. Then, we also got yellow curry again medium. This time around it was way too spicy for our taste and killed the curry. Food came in 20-30 mins and it was boiling hot still which was awesome.
