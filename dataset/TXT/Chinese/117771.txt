NIjZNZCeMwILmFGzXdTLkg My favorite Chinese place in AZ.  It took me five years but I found my cheap take out Chinese restaurant!  My son and I order from here regularly and it just seems to get better and better.  We like the green pepper beef and their crab puffs are good.  Their appetizer mix is good also.  Try the spring rolls with their real hot mustard which you have to request.  Very good!!
