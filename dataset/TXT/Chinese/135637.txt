I come to vegas almost annually and these restaurants change frequently.
Simply put:
They have taiwanese food, bad taiwanese food.
There were four of us and we ordered 2 of the same things, and 2 different dishes.
Portions were too small and taste was only average.

My noodles came out really quick.....the other same order of noodles didn't come out until everything else came out.
Everything else including dishes that came out and were taken back and then brought back out again because the order was confused.
when eating the noodles, there were a ton of corn starch clumps in both bowls.
Corn starch is an ingredient, not a garnish.
We were actually told that after my bowl came out they ran out so thanks for telling me i got the old soup and they were making a fresh pot.

Here's the temperature problem. It was only about 10 degrees higher in the restaurant than it was outside. So if you're looking to sweat like a pregnant nun and overpay, proceed. I wouldn't be surprised if they were gone by our trip next year.
