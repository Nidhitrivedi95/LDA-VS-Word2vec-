oAngC9V69vyzBVYwKEJQaw There are so many options when it comes to Chinese food but finding this place has eliminated that worry for me. Every dish I've tried is great. I especially like the chicken dishes here. The service is fast when you order delivery and when you eat in.

I initially gave the restaurant 4 stars and then realized that I have been saving that 5th star for a great place like this one.
