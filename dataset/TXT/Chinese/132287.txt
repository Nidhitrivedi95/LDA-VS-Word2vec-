pNp1FK8JqW8ZMA26YJGXYA So after Saturday night, I've been flummoxed on what to write on our previous go-to Chinese place. 

This is a family run business, so I'm always very careful on what to write when things appear to be going down hill. Let 's just say my rating is under review, from 4 Stars to 3 Stars, to ???.  

The food is simply not the same and Lordie yes, we've had better from here. In a word, it's bland and doesn't appear fresh. The pot stickers had no tasty. Both the Sesame Chicken and General Tso's, looked and tasted the same. And, the texture of both looked mushy (photo), like it was defrosted in a wok. My Hot n Sour soup was chicken broth-ish and again bland. Ugh. 

Maybe the regular cook had the night off, so I don't want to write Red House off just yet. And yes, we'll be back for another try sometime soon, but... if this is the new normal, then...
