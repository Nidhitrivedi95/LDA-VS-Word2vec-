x7RxFtOnRXKEagcsDiwrAQ Kam Wing is a local favourite a good example of Canadian-Asian cuisine, if you're looking for authentic Chinese cuisine this place will not impress you. However, if you're looking for the type of Chinese food that you see in Western movies and on TV, look no further, you will be satisfied. 

Kam Wing does offer a great variety of various types of Eastern oriental based cuisine including Thai, Japanese, and Chinese dishes all in one kitchen which I think is fantastic, and there's great family meal packages that incorporate all these different flavours together. Some of the dishes (Kung Pao Chicken, beef & broccoli) i strongly do not recommend, you will be disappointed but other dishes (vegetable/shrimp tempura) are fantastic! Personally my favourite is the crispy sesame beef, while it is covered in honey, which makes the dish very sweet, the breading on the beef manages to remain crispy whether delivery take 45 minutes or you leave it in the sauce overnight, which seems to defy science.

The only major pitfall I have to confess is that more often than not delivery will take 45 minutes to an hour, and I live 15 minutes away by foot! Sometimes the food arrives a little past its fresh point because of this, but on rare occasion the food will arrive promptly and the food is obviously freshly cooked. It for the most part, hit or miss but altogether its exactly what you would expect from your local Canadian Chinese restaurant, and I keep coming back for more so they must be doing something right!
