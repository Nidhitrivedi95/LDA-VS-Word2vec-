1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Finally got to try this place after months of reading the reviews and dreaming of a big bowl of shrimp wonton soup. It was well worth the wait. The wontons were delicious, the broth was a little spicy, which I loved, and the ramen was perfectly cooked. Pricing was more than reasonable and I left very sated.
