Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Used the Yelp deal here.  I dig this place.  It's way smaller than I had anticipated, but it makes everything seem more cozy.  They make everything fresh and there is only one cook in the kitchen, so my only complaint is that the food can take a little long to come out, but it is well worth it.

The red curry has eggplant and pumpkin in it!  I was surprised at the ingredients since I'm so used to just bell pepper and bamboo in my red curry, but the owner told me that's how the royals eat it and he didn't want to put that "cheap stuff" in there.  I may have a hard time eating red curry anywhere else now!  The pumpkin is so good and unexpected in it.  

I've also tried their linguine dish, which was flavorful and tasty.  It really reminded me of Pad Kea Mow at Archi's Thai.  Their pho was ok, but I am so partial to Pho So 1, that it's tough to impress me with pho.

The food is great and the owner is very friendly.  He remembers everyone who walks through the door!  He really pays attention to his food and his customers, which is much appreciated by this patron.
