UPSzbM6D2SkarWAINq1I9A Glad to find a place closer to home for Vietnamese. Typically go to superior pho but it's a destination for me. Although not the same, it's great food in its own. Spring rolls are awesome, pot stickers are the size of perogies, and the pho is great. They don't have Banh Mi which is one of my favorites but wouldn't hold it against them.  Everything was well worth it. I'll be back for my pho fix.
