x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ Great place for Indo-Chinese food.
We ordered Chili Babycorn dry, Paneer chiili, Chilli Garlic Noodles. Everything tasted pretty good.
We reached at 9.30 and the restaurant closes at 10.
My only complaint is that we were handed over the check when we were only halfway through our food. Table etiquette was totally missing which was a bit surprising for a restaurant of this stature.
I would definitely recommend this place for Indo-Chinese lovers.
