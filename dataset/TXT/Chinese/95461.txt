JhEtJbGjAqKDHCZ11i3qoQ Usually really nice. I guess weekdays are when the losers that don't care about anything work. All the veggies looked like they were almost rotten. Then when I ask for some fresh cilantro they take 10 minutes to beat the fresh cilantro with a dull knife. You could see where they hit it with the knife and it didn't cut through. And you could tell that they were smashing it with there hand while they were cutting it because all of the leaves had the juice coming out of them.
