hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA Don't let the Yelpers fool you on this place because the food here tastes pretty bad. I didn't have a single dish that I would consider good and I tried fried rice, lo mein, mapo tofu, beef w/ broccoli, a spicy chicken dish, some pork dishes, steamed dumplings, egg rolls, crab rangoon and pretty much every dish except the mixed seafood one.   Even the steamed rice and basic things like wonton & hot and sour soup were not very good either. Panda Express is a lot better than this place. For the same price as this buffet, you can go eat at Ping Pang Pong which is the best Chinese food in town. Don't waste your time.
