a_tpGkXwqqC_ZeIp59V7Sw Decided to try this one out of the 4 new hot pot joints that recently opened in the east valley.  It definitely hit the spot.  Half numbing spicy and half reg broth were both superb. Meat was spectacular quality and didn't come out still frozen like some places. The premium lean beef was sooo good.  The partial fat beef was great too but more fat than "partial."  Beef tongue good quality but $10 for like 5 slices.  Veges and Tofu skin good as well.  Overall, quality and taste are amazing BUT just too expensive.  My one friend and I racked up a $100 bill!!  I should preface that with the fact that we are gluttons and had leftovers but still.  They charge $10 just for the broth when I'm used to broth included.  Also $1/person for sauce bar which is usually also included.  No raw egg option for sauce which is usually the magic to the sauce for me.  They did say they are "proposing" all you can eat for lunch only.  Would come back more often if more affordable or AYCE offered.
