bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ By far our favorite Chinese place, because the have pork egg rolls that are delish.  No-one else in the Vegas area has real egg rolls, atleast that we have found in the last 8 yrs. All the other food is above average too.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of service.  They need a bigger dining area and more employees. It's so busy they can't handle it sometimes and there is nowhere to sit.
