I ordered the fried chicken tenders with Chinese sausage and an iced chrysanthemum tea. Everything tastes great. The sauces were delicious. It may seem like small portions, but I feel it's the perfect amount; you won't walk out too full or still hungry.

The server (only woman working the front) was very kind and polite. She remembers your name as she brings out the food. A nice touch of hospitality. She explains what's in your food and how it's cooked. The price is a bit on the higher side, but you're eating good quality chicken!
