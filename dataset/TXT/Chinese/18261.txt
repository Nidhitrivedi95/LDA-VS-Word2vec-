5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A This Thai place was a recommendation from my nail artist.  

It is clean and the service was quick and polite. 

Ordered pad Thai - terrible ; very oily, and lack flavor; green curry - very watered down and lacked Thai flavor; and some appetitiAers that were bland. 

If you are hungry only.
