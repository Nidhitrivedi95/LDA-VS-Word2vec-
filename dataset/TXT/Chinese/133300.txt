pvjPOBfYF2QbkqNY3xHC-A Honest to goodness the best chinese food I've ever had was at a tiny family owned restaurant on the island of Santorini in Greece, maybe it had something to do with being so over Greek food by the second week of my trip but ever since then I've been on a seach for a non-chain restaurant in the states that compares.  My husband and I just moved to Chandler a couple of months ago and found Hong Kong Bistro as we were driving to the supermarket one day. We decided to check it out. The small restaurant was cute, the staff was very helpful and polite, our waitress asked if it was our first time, made suggestions and asked for our names to remember for the next time.  I ordered the Garlic Chicken, just as good as any I've had at any other chinese restaurant, the egg drop soup was also good, it had corn it which was a little weird but still good. My husband ordered the Gang Pang chicken which was spicy and very good.  They have a combo special where you add $1 to your meal and get a crab puff, egg roll, soup and fried rice added to your already very well priced main dish. They also have a small bar which looked fully loaded to me.  All in all it was as good as any other chinese restaurant I've been to, not the best, but for the price and location I was pleased and would definitely go back.
