uxSL4FHWiO-fr2iae_d3Bw Went to eat dinner here tonight, Sunday, January 27, 2013 but left before we could get seated. Over 50% of the seating was empty but there were about 20 of was waiting to get seated. It would not have been a problem if the staff had a sense of urgency, but they were slow to seat people. We waited at least 10 minutes before we decided to leave and there were still people ahead if us waiting to get a table. We did not all come at the same time either, the customers were staggered on arrival time. The staff just didn't want to seat people when they walked in, they just took names. We asked if the problem was if they were short staffed and she never really answered, however, it did not appear that they were. They just didn't want to sit tables at the same time. We would have been happy sitting at a table with a drink and menu while we waited on a server. The food is not that good (edpecially for the price) at PF Chang's to begin with, so, we left. Won't be back...ever.
