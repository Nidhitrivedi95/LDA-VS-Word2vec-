HAqFrpN8ukzFZuSgTvLijw This is a great Hakka spot in Etobicoke. I have been going here for several months now and I have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and they the food is great. Make sure you are hungry or bring someone to share with as the plates are fulling. 

I had the General Tso chicken today which is one of my go to meals here. The other ones are the chilli chicken and the Faleys chicken special. I ordered it on white rice with gravy and I like saucy meals and as always they didn't disappoint me. The chicken was tender and the sauce was amazing. 

Note that the first time you order will be a little confusing as there are main mixing options, but asked the waiter what options they have and they will help.
