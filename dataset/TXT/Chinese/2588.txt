I haven't been to the bathrooms yet but the seating areas seem quite clean, compared to other Chinese buffets in the area.

My biggest gripe with Hibachi Grill is their dismal dessert section. It consists of: ice cream prescooped (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, orange sherbert, rainbow sherbert, AND THAT'S IT), banana pudding, chocolate pudding, rice pudding, apple pie, donut holes (but larger), and little finger cake assortments like you can find from the grocery store.

To get a 5 stars from me, I would need:

1) at LEAST a soft serve ice cream machine. Like wtf? I thought this was a given for all buffets, but I guess not. I realize these machines take a lot of cleaning and effort to maintain (I used to work at Pinkberry) but like. Not offering a froyo or soft serve machine with a topping bar is maddening. Take some notes from Sweet Tomatoes,  please! Or literally any other buffet.

2) if not, then more ice cream flavors. Cookies n cream? Mint chip? Butter pecan? Seriously, the flavor selection they currently have is kind of super depressing.

Upgrade the dessert selection and this would be my favorite buffet, probably. In all honesty, adding a soft serve machine to their lineup would really convince me to join my boyfriend here for dinner wayyyy more often.

If you aren't a sugarholic and love these Chinese buffets, then this place is probably not going to disappoint. I like their dumplings and sio mai.
