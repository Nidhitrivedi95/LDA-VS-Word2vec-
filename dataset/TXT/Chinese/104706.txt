After entering, we waited only about 2 minutes but I saw her busy with another table so I wasn't worried. When she did notice, she was soooooo cutely ('sweet'-ly) apologetic with a gracious smile. Than our waiter, Roger, was the 'spicy' part haha. Ok my food was!  But he wasssss funny. No swimming or sushi from the fish tank haha!!  You have to have been there for whole convo. 

It was great that he explained what vegetables was in my Hunan beef dish & gladly exchanged them for other veggies for me that I like better. He agreed with me that it's better than wasting food by pushing it to the side of your dish. And they made it extra spicy for me.  

The dessert treat (macaroon) after our meal was awesome & served warm!!  And free!!  Truly great experience!!
