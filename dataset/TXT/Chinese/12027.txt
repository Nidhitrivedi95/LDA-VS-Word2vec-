2meb5cwKh125tF5IwUiIJA There was a time I came here every a few days for a bread, pork floss spring onion rolls, most of the time, and then it made me feel good all day long. Most of the bread here are not as attractive as that in China from the appearance, but the flavor is the same good, oh, steamed buns are all so cute, that's an exception. Egg tarts is great, the crust is light and flaky, the filling is tender and tasting! Pork floss bun is my favorite as it's special, nothing else could replace it. It's savory flavors topping with shredded dried pork. I like the pineapple also, it's simple, soft and have a crust to make it richer in flavor. Except that, they also have green tea cakes, chocolate éclairs, cream cakes...Actually, if you can't decide which to buy, I think everything here worth a try!
