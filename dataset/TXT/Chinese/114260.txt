MVBCWXTDtU8C1Qh5mMNSKA Lunch and dinner is like night and day. Dim sum is busy with unique selection and upscale tea to match.  Dinner for the first time was a surprise as the meal was excellent with huge portions.

For dim sum, plan to get there early as they have their specials like others before 11 am. If you get the before 10, you should be seated with a short wait and as long as you submit your order before 11, dim sum will be at the special price. If not, dim sum will be pricier than you expected when you came in.

For dinner, my family ordered banquet style with 16 people including 6 kids. We were surprised as the meal fed all of us to our delight and we just added a dish or two to the set dinner. Total price was much less than what you would normally expect for the quality.
