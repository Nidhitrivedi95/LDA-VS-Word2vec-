gtcsOodbmk4E0TulYHnlHA Been here twice, enjoyed it both times. Great craft beer selection, everything from hoppy IPAs to sweet Belgian ales. Also an impressive cocktail menu, with some delicious concoctions. Try the Ruby for something sweet, or the Jacket Pocket for something a little more bracing
Great intimate atmosphere, low lighting. Music and ambient noise is a little loud later in the evening. Place got busier the second time I was there, probably due to getting written up on BlogTO. Lots of hipsters
