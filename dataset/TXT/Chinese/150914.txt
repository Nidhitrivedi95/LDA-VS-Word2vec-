SxjNgkzAlUG-wt2rSbc2HQ I live near Chinatown, and I was always timid about going to places because I never knew which place was good, as there are so many! I was really excited about trying this place as I had high hopes, but I was extremely disappointed. BlogTO rates this place as 7th best chinese food in Toronto. If this is the 7th best Toronto has to offer, then we are in trouble. The dumplings in the won ton soup were overcooked and falling apart. The beef tasted chewy and the sauce on it left a weird mouth feel. The egg rolls were tiny and cold. The sweet and sour pork was what you would expect.... but hitting 1/3 on expectations is a pretty bad score in my book. Cooking chinese food is not like baseball!

This place is terrible. Buy frozen wing wong from the store instead. I would not go back.
