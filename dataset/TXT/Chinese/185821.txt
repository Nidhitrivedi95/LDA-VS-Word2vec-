Y22IfhXChXoRp3vKi6QwaQ This place is way better then the Kanbai located near Concordia.

The food is excellent, well prepared, and perfectly seasoned. I would like to point out that for the numerous times I've had the pleasure to dine here, the food was consistently that good and tasted great. For a Sichuanese restaurant, consistency is something extremely important yet so often undervalued.

The Yuxiang Eggplant is truly amazing here, the eggplants are not soggy, full of flavors, and the amount of sauce is just right. The Sichuan Boiled Fish is also extremely delicious, the visual presentation is stunningly beautiful: huge pot filled with spicy soup, topped with a handful of dry chili peppers.

The restaurant offers some Cantonese dishes as well, but the stars are really the spicy goodness. You don't come to this place to eat General Tao, you're here because you want to excite your pallets!

The interior decor is really nice, the place is neat and clean, but not spacey enough to accommodate the large volume of diners it gets every night.

I only have two issues with this restaurant:

1. It does not accept Credit Cards.
2. The waiters just sort of ignore you during dinner service; I get it, it's a busy place with lots of hungry diners, but that's not a valid excuse.
