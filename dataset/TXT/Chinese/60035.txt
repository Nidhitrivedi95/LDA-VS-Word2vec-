dltDW0fS4HzxZ0A7PDT5jg I really like this place. Of course, I love Chinese restaurants in general, but this place has a lot going for it.

First, as everyone rightfully mentions, the decor is modern, looks great while not being at all over the top. It's basically the opposite of sitting at the drab Tremendous Chinese Restaurant. (And actually, like Tremendous, JAM House is open late - 1 or 2 am - so this would be a very intriguing option for late night Chinese food.)

I've had dim sum here on several occasions, and all the staple dishes are very solid. In particular, the tripe is really nicely gingery/scalliony, and thus better than most of the dim sum tripes I've had recently. They also have some very unique dishes: coconut bun/cha siu bao mashup (which is all the craze at the cool dim sum places these days) and century egg puff pastry (like the one with cha siu, but filled with century egg instead) come to mind.

Staff here is really nice and the vibe is positive - something I can rarely say about a Chinese restaurant. That left a really good impression on me.
