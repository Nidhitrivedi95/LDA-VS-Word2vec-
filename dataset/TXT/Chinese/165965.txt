vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw Great food and we're served in an appropriate time considering it was a dinner rush. I came in hungry and wasn't dissapointed on the wait time. The servers were awesome. Responded to our needs before we even asked of them. Clean utensils and table cloths. They served the food presentably and looked like they prepared it with care. They deserve 5stars! Keep it up!!
