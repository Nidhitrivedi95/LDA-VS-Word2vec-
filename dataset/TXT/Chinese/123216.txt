Oj4PqiXtPTd4kZdI5aG1uw What happened to taste and flavours?! Practically all the dimsum dishes were so bland.  For the first time the sirracha bottle was being used by every member of my family, which was comical but what's a person to do when food tastes like nothing.
The bill came to $136 including tips for 38 dishes of dimsum.  So that's  $27 per person.
I can get a good meal else where for what i paid.
