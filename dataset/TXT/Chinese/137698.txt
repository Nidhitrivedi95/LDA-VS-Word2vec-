QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw I've come here several times since this time. I'm still satisfied with lunch.

Dinner here is pretty pricey (though there is more meat and egg for dinner) and unfortunately, I feel the quality of the food has gone down (less variety of veggies and more lettuce), and everything is frozen before it is served. It's still a good place to go to for hotpot and I will still frequent this place, but honestly I've been a little disappointed recently.
