QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ ive been wanting to try homemade authentic dumplings and im so glad i found this place!! its small and a bit hidden and not very busy most of the time. the owners dont seem to speak much english but they have a good system of having customers write down their order number. they were very humble and even sat down to eat their lunch. the dumplings were AMAZING. made fresh to order, they were full of flavour and a slight crisp of the pan frying technique. they were a bit oily but i wasnt expecting this dish to be healthy. they also have vinegar on every table, if you remember anything about my review EAT THE DUMPLINGS WITH THE VINEGAR. im drooling just thinking about it. also the prices are so good. 10 dumplings for $8 and i was perfectly satisfied. i highly recommend if you're in the mood for some homemade dumplings!
