The meals are very good and reasonably priced. my favorites are the panang beef curry, and the garlic eggplant dish.  Lychee martinis are awesome ( $5 happy hour), need to make my way to a asian market to get some lychee syrup for home use.  Good service, dining inside, outside or takeout.  If you live within a few blocks on east side of strip they will even deliver, although I never did that because it's only a one block drive for me.  The crab rangoon appetizer was disappointing, but everything else I enjoyed.  The chicken wings are surprisingly good, tangy sweet sauce.
