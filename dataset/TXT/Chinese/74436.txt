fnLiPkJL0ur4-pS99bgqGA Our order for the night was tomato sauce pork chop submarine, sake chicken with rice, and sweet potato noodle in fish broth.  All dishes come with a drink, hot milk tea, hot coffee etc.  Cold drinks theres an additional cost.  

The sweet potato noodle in fish broth was forgettable, as in don't order it if you're coming to eat.  If you want to eat fish broth noodle soup, go across the street to Times Square and eat at Deer Garden instead.  The broth itself was very bland.  It had the milky fish broth colour, but no sweet fish flavour, there was a bit of fishiness too.

The sake chicken had no sake taste, but other than that was done quite well.  The chicken was cooked through, and very smooth.  Smooth is a very strange word to describe a chicken, but that's a term Chinese people do use.  I guess it would be the opposite of overcooked and dry.  The dish is very similar to Hainanese Chicken Rice.

The thing I have been waiting for, the pork chop with tomato sauce submarine was MASSIVE!  The bread part was a whole Italian loaf that was hollowed out.  The bread was then filled with fried rice, topped with fried pork chop, tomato sauce, and a bit of grated cheese.  The entire thing was quickly baked/broiled.  How is this healthy?  I hope people don't eat this often......  Taste wise, was pretty good, tasted like any other tomato pork chop baked rice really.  It was just interesting that it was all in a bread bowl.  For any normal sized appetite adult, the submarine could feed probably 3 people.  I wish I had put something next to it for size reference.
