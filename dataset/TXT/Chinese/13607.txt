2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q I went for lunch. Got the lemon chicken lunch special. It was a panko breaded butterflied breast with a lemon sauce that tasted like it came right out of a lemon pie. The fried rice was tasteless. The soup was the consistency of mucus. One bite of everything and I walked out without paying my check.
