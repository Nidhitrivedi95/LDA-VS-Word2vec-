pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og Just alright for me. The ambiance is nice. You can sit at the sushi bar or go over to the booths. I bought 2 rolls on happy hour and let me tell you I was disappointed. I ordered the Tuna roll and the Las Vegas roll. Tuna roll was on the plain side and the Las Vegas roll was just alright. Lacking in a bit of flavor and not on the savory side. This is a reminder for myself to not order those rolls again. My thoughts were that this was better than getting sushi from Safeway, but I've had better sushi at most places in Az.. It's better than store bought, but the question is... is it something I'll go back to?
