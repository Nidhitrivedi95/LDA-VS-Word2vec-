BH0K6SxPnY3wTRB7tA27hQ Let me first state that I am giving this restaurant four stars for carry-out only. I have not had the distinct pleasure of dining in that so many of you have described, and now I most certainly will NOT eat in the restaurant. 

I have ordered a variety of items from the restaurant and everything has been delicious (most recently combo lo mein). I am not a sushi expert by any means, but I have really liked everything I have tried. Compared to many Chinese carryout restaurants, I think this is better than most of the greasy options around town.

They REALLY need to add descriptions to their carryout menus. 
For half-off sushi on Wednesdays, they need to advertise ON THE BANNER hanging out front that your must purchase a beverage.
