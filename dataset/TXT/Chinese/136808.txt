qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A Stopped in last night for happy hour on our way to a movie. We went straight to the bar. Been here about 5 times in the last 6 months or so, always for HH and have never been greeted by the hostesses. It's funny too, because there is always 2 of them standing there, usually talking to each other. Last night I commented, oh yeah, the service here sucks. Oh well, we continued to the bar and found a seat. It was about 5:30. Happy hour ends at 6:00 so we had plenty of time to get an order in. We sat for a few minutes and still not acknowledged so the husband went back to the hostesses and picked up a menu from their station, while they were standing there. The waiter we had, however, was very prompt to take our order and bring the food and check on us several times. He gets 5 stars for his service. For the food: it's always consistently on the money. And the HH deals are great. We get the lettuce wraps (my fave), spring rolls, the ribs with the dry rub (they are fantastic), dumplings and the green beans.  Everything is fresh and tasty. After the meal, we left, walking right by the hostess station without a peep from either one of them. I really wonder if they are trained that way because I've never seen them any other way. If not for the hostesses, I would give it 5 stars.
