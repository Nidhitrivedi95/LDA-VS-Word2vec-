nTc-Qj_-ABZrpM9YSpJ6jA My friends and I endured hunger and a long drive just to eat at Chowking again, but were extremely disappointed when we got there. The taho's caramel sauce and the buchi's sesame seed covering was very bitter and overcooked. All the food we ordered (lauriat and chicken) looked and tasted like they were reheated and not freshly prepared that day. What a disappointment!
