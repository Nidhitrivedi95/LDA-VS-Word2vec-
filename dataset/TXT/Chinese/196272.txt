ZlrHrg7jrbO6blqwfa0MkQ My friend Jenn and I were very skeptical about this place when this place was suggested as a meeting place. We are not fans of Americanized Chinese food. However, our friend promised us that it's the best Chinese restaurant he has had in Charlotte area.

I was really excited to see that they offer Peking duck as I scout the place out on Yelp. There are also some other dishes that got me really excited such as three glass chicken and spicy wonton!

I got a duck dish, one of my friends got a seafood clay dish, and the other friend got orange chicken. When he told us that he's going to order orange chicken, we were shocked because that's probably one of the most Americanized Chinese food. He ordered it extra crispy and spicy which tasted just as great as it sounds! I enjoyed my duck. I wish I had asked them to make it spicy because the sauce was a bit too sweet to my liking but the meat was very tender! My friends seafood clay pot (she also asked them to make it spicy) was also very good with plenty of seafood in it. 

The service was also top notch. We had a great time there. I definitely want to come back try other dishes on the menu!
