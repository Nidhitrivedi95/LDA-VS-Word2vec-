Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w Zero stars was not an option!  $90.00 for 3 of us.  Food was cold.  After our first plates we struggled to find other things to try.  Food got so bad we were scared to continue.  We left hungry and ripped off .  We kept trying to figure out how they are still open?  We could have had Firebirds for the same price and had fine dinning first class service :(  it's just horrible.
