-H1-IzxW6CXmjhmF5F6iMA 1st time here. Not friendly at all. Chef was eating lunch when i walked in. He got up to go cook with a full mouth of food.  Okay dining area..floors look very dusty. This place is new right? White walls are scuffed n dirty...chicken not tender, was rubbery. Yummy fountain soda.  Compared to other places serving size was a bit smaller. This is. Last resort spot to eat.
