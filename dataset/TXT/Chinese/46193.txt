BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I picked to eat here based on some yelp reviews. It was good, but I've had better. I had the green onion pancake and the juicy pork dumplings. Decent, but greasy. A good value at least. One other thing, was that my order took a really long time. I was there at least an hour before the juicy dumplings came out. I was by myself, so I tried to pass the time on my ipad, but they wouldn't let me use the wifi password. Lame.
