VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Came here twice for Happy Hour where apps and drinks are all 50% off. And you get to sit in the restaurant so that makes it nice when the bar is full or you have more than two people.
Potstickers are good-chicken better flavor than the pork. You get 4 chicken ones and 6 pork. The chicken are bigger than the pork so it balances out. 
Shrimp skewers are good and good deal. 
Shu mai-awful. Mushy. Stay away from these. 
Salt and pepper wings-yummy. Good taste. Big and plump. 
Spring rolls-not the rice paper wrapped Vietnamese ones. These are fried like lumpia or skinny egg rolls. Better than I thought in that there was lots of meat in the chicken ones.  
Chicken skewers (both kinds)-had mixed reviews.  Some people liked them and some did. 
Calamari-good amount.  Not the best I've ever had but for the price, pretty good. 

I've also had the lunch version of the Dan Dan noodles and they were pretty good. 

There's not many good Chinese places in the area so unless you want to drive to Mesa or Tempe, I think this is a good sub.
