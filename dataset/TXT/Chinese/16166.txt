3ZQrhYY5ExaECVfbVqmyMQ Geographical proximity has always been a bane for my proclivity for good authentic exotic food. Needless to say that has never stopped me from trying all the close establishments. Chinese food being one of my favored cuisines led me to be easily convinced to accompany me colleagues to this joint. The first impression was quite decent. Also the fact that it was once a Vietnamese establishment that catered to wedding parties gave it a pseudo garish pomp. Ordered the egg[plant steamed fish, green beans... while friends ordered the kung pao, lemon chicken (oh lawrdy!! bleah...). Not bad not bad , I mused to my self and put it down as another place to revisit.

However every subsequent  revisits here has been a horrible experience in terms of food. At one point I managed to peek at "non-chinese" cooks making our dishes. Sigh! one of those precipitously  "going bad" joints, ratified by their 6 health code violations. Ah well on to Swadee...
