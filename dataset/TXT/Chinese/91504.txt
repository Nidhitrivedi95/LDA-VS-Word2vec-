ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg The dim sum here is alright, but now I feel sad that people drive the 2 hrs from Pittsburgh just to eat here... since it's only ok.

I think my main complaint is that there is no variety. There might be 10 different things on one of the carts, but they're all variations of the same salty and fatty ground meat in the dumplings/shumai/just as meatballs. And the meat is so greasy that after a few bites you begin to feel sick. The selection of sweet stuff is a bit better, but still, not many options.

Also a bit expensive. We spent $40 between 2 people here. In other cities, $30 easily feeds 4.
