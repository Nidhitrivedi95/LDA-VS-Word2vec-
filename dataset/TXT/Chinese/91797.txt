ikUSTcW7AL4nKsBjx5co0w We happened by this place by chance on Friday evening. It was impeccable service from the beginning to end, with a friendly chat and too it off excellent food! 
We had the corn chowder soup (made vegan on request), Manchurian noodles and the chilli paneer. They are very flexible in substitutions, which is perfect especially for vegetarians or anyone else with any allergies. I will definitely be going back!
