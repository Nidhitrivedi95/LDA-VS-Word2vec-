ZZF5iqlKFBWJSGSZzWHMzA Good Asian fusion right in the heart of Chinatown. I came here with a friend on a Tuesday night. We decided to try a few of the following menu items:

- Pork belly steamed bao: Decent pork belly bao. It reminded me of the Banhi boys one, which makes sense as the restaurants share owners. 
- Hambaoger: Presented like a hamburger, this is a mini Big Mac only with the buns replaced with fluffy steamed white baos. Personally I thought there was a lot of excess oil was dripping from the burger while I was eating it, but overall it was quite tasty. 
- Korean popcorn chicken: A plate of small balls of deep fried chicken, this dish was quite heavy with nothing to balance it out. We regretted not ordering a bowl of steamed rice to balance out all these intense flavours. It felt like having a traditional Chinese dinner without your own bowl of rice! 
- Side of eggplant: This was shockingly spicy, which further supported why we needed to a side of rice for balance.
- Tuna tostata: Very small tuna tostadas - the tostada was crispy and oily but I liked the tuna on top. For $3, it was not a lot of food, just a very small tapa. 

Overall great food and service. If you are looking for more of a "sit down" atmosphere compared to Banh Mi Boys, this is the perfect place as Lucky Red is an extension of the Asian fusion trend there.
