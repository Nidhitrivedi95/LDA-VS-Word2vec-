hPTx2Y5e4Czbr21XcbDN8g If you can't stand the smell of stinky tofu then don't come here. Otherwise come enjoy some hot and tasty beef noodle soup while trying to cover your nostrils. Basically the whole restaurant smells like stinky tofu since they cook a lot in the kitchen but if you can get over the smell, the beef noodle soup is pretty dang good. I also ate the stinky tofu but there was nothing special about it.
