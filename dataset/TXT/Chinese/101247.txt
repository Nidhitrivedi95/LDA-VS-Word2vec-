kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A Just left the restaurant. A friend of mine recommended this restaurant so I was so excited to dine here tonight. I should have read the recent reviews as my experience was quite similar. We ordered the top 2 appetizers. The prob dumplings were hard and the Mongolian pancake was full of onions.

The soups were like warm and the noodles were hard and could have used another 2 - 3 minutes on the burner. 

Overall I should have stayed in and made a more appetizing dinner.
