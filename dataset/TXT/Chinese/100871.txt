K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw Students at Agincourt C.I. (Which was kind of a rival to my high school) Seem to have lots of options to skip the cafeteria in this strip mall, and One2 is certainly one of them. It's closed 3 of the 5 weekdays (be careful of this!), but Thursday and Friday there must be a lot of kids sleeping through algebra class in a carb coma. 

Today I got an order of laksa and a char kway teow (which I found similar to Thai "drunken noodles") for take out, and the laksa alone fed 3 adults! - absolutely huge portions, and as you can see from photos of the menu, huge value too.

I first heard of laksa after a lengthy discussion on chowhound (http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/928691), and it was nice to have a fresh version for comparison (PS - the packaged product is legit too, and if you can't get it in a supermarket, it's online - I got a case on Amazon in the U.S.). 

Would I recommend a visitor to downtown Toronto schlep all the way out here for noodles?  Probably not, but a visitor SHOULD get out to the burbs to experience the cultural and culinary diversity that is unmatched anywhere else, and so I give it the full 5 here on yelp. If you reside in Toronto, you need to go there for sure.
