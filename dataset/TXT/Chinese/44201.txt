BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg I have loved How Lee's food for all of the years I've lived in Pittsburgh. However, my last 2 take-out orders from them have fallen flat. There were bones in the sesame chicken takeout. Moo goo gai pan was salty and all of the vegetables overcooked. Don't order the brown rice, it's watery and crunchy at the same time. I don't know if they have just been slacking off on their takeout or what, but this is really disappointing.
