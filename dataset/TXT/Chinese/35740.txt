AFxhYWtszxGXaGGMnWZ9CA I would say dine in is definitely a better deal, as AYCE prices and quality are on par. 
We wanted something quick for lunch and opted to try their delivery, as we were curious about the dim sum delivery portions vs the dine in.
As with all delivery adventures (free within a certain radius) the experience has its up sides and its down sides . The dim sum is sadly disappointing in size, as it is the same bite size portions served in the restaurant for roughly $4, Not bad, but not great.
The dinner set however is excellent. For $13.50 it comes with a generous portion of teriyaki chicken, tempura (2 shrimp, 4 veg), rice, miso soup and California roll, making for a reasonably priced, filling meal.
In all, both dine in and delivery has been a good experience thus far.

2nd Delivery :-
Decided to try something different.
Mango Chicken Bento. A very cute Bento container and delicious. Mango chicken (lightly battered white meat with mango sauce, no mango pieces sadly), rice, great veggies (sweet peppers, zucchini, broccoli, mushrooms) and miso. Definite winner.
