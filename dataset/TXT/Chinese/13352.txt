2UFl9gLOQrSGY2sPu6U-kA Came here for a birthday celebration. Reservations had been made and we were seated as soon as we arrived even though we were a bit late. 

The food- the food was fantastic! We all had individual hot pots to cook our items. My boyfriend and I shared so the table wouldn't be so crowded. We had both the regular and spicy broth although we both preferred the spicy broth. We had ordered lamb and beef, the lamb was amazing! We had visited Mongolian hot pot before but were total noobs when it came to hot pot, we had over cooked everything and didn't really enjoy it. This second time around we knew better and loved it! We cooked most of the items bit by bit like the lamb, which you only need to stick them in for about a few seconds, and other items like the radish I stuck them in for a while once I pulled them out they were soft, but not falling apart, and had soaked up all that spicy broth goodness. All the ingredients provided were clean and fresh, couldn't have asked for anything better! 

The service- okay I go to Chinese restaurants on the regular but never have I ever had such friendly service. We were all so shocked and couldn't stop talking about it and thanking our waiters for being so nice and attentive. The only time we needed to call our waiters attention was when we needed an extra bowl for a sauce or another glass. Our broths were constantly kept topped up and they provided us with 2 sets of chopsticks and plenty of napkins. As you all know you don't typically go to a Chinese spot for service but for the food. 

Overall- food wad delicious and service was fantastic! Most definitely worth coming to this place!
