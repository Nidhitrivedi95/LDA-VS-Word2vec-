p2OOk46G_AOO0nCWl-eVlg We used to go here all the time. The food was always fresh and cooked well. As of the last year, all quality of food as gone down the tubes. Way too over priced for this food. I may as well go to Panda Express. I also found a peanut in my food last night...if my wife would have got this in her food we would be in the hospital, or I would be possibly picking out a casket.
