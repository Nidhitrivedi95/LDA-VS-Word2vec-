iP3E7Nl_cGA3xWCORkoLGw Food was perfect. Fiance and I ordered food on a day when I didn't want to cook and they delivered straight to my door. Only bummer is in order to get delivery you must order a fifteen dollar minimum. 
We ordered three lunch plates and liked it so much we ordered three dinner combo plates the same day and ate those too.
