pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA We went for lunch yesterday and, as usual, absolutely outstanding. This restaurant never ceases to amaze me with how good the food is and how good the service is. It is located in a very good area of the shops closer to Palazzo than Venetian and the architecture of the restaurant is very cool. We ordered a lot because we had not eaten yet: we ordered the yellowtail scallion rolls, which have a little bit of rice with a lot of yellowtail with scallions and literally melt in your mouth. We ordered the Chilean sea bass which was incredible and the Peruvian corn side dish and seaweed salad appetizer. The vegetable tempura was also outstanding. We received two complimentary samples of a scallop on a shell with a fabulous array of ingredients to top it that was delicious. The house ice tea is one of the best ice teas that I have ever had. We share a form of banana split with really cool features. The ice cream and whisky whipped cream were a total wow, surrounded by fresh berries 
Will not hesitate to go back today! It is that good. Highly recommended whether you like sushi or not: plenty of variety, and all selections are at the top of their game!
