pImcSPg5tEkuvqHF7JnpoQ Last evening was my first visit to Ginger's China Bistro, and I'm happy to say, it won't be my last. This quiet little restaurant is tucked away in a corner of a fairly quiet strip mall, but don't let that scare you off. Quiet is good when you're looking for a relaxing dinner for two, or for ladies who lunch. The Moo Shu pork was perfectly prepared, and plentiful and the service shines. Check out Ginger's yourself, you won't be disappointed.
