h7As2jB8bhfFxCMCvdssWA I really wanted to love this place.  Well rated.  Packed with people.  Friendly and outstanding service.  Great prices.

The lunch menu comes with egg drop soup, fried wonton wrappers, a pork eggroll, egg fried rice and whatever protein entree you pick.

I had the Mongolian beef.  It was just so salty and the meat had a weird texture.  My son had some shrimp dish and was happy.  My daughter had the teriyaki chicken and was disgusted.  She actually barely picked at it.  Some of the meat is so dark and some is so light.  There were pieces of fat and tendon, etc.  

The bathroom is very hard to get to.  Go through the crowded dining room, past the soda cases, through the kitchen.  Turn left at the stairs, go down the hallway and find it on the right.  

Very much a hole in the wall.
