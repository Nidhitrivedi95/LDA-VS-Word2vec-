n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A The restaurant looks beautiful but that's about it... Servers are not really attentive, they left dirty silverware on the table and forgot to bring out one dish. The food was not the best, honestly it was rather mediocre and almost the same as in the chinese food court places. For the price, we were disappointed.  It's only a famous name and nothing more, you better off spending your money elsewhere
