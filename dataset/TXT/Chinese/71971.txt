Fe699lNnpiZIGjgmuQahXA Went there the other night and we got a chicken bowl and a chicken and broccoli bowl. The taste of the food was good. The portion of chicken to rice was very reasonable. The staff was very friendly. And price for the meals was good. What I didn't like was the presentation of the place. It was a bit messy, the tables had trays on them, rice all over, and chairs were all over the place. It wasn't even that busy someone could have cleaned the place up. I was happy they had drive thru, I will have to give the drive thru a try next time. Will be returning.
