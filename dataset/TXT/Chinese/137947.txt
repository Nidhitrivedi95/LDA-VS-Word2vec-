qMJCVx6-ZYvZQHlfrZ_cug Very tasty food. Fast service. The owner was very nice. Will def come here again. Seven of us ate here for 40.00 the portions were just right. We tried shrimp and chicken lo mein and beef and broccoli and the mushroom chicken. The outside looks old and run down, but the inside is clean. What really impressed me was all the A ratings in the doors
