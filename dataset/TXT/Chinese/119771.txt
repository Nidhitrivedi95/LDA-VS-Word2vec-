NyGlEmuYcpZSKfk6IwJeSw Tavernakaya  in downtown Madison Wisconsin: 

Atmosphere: Was great, the place overall is really nice and super modern. 

Service: Was really good. Servers were extremely nice and super helpful wen explaining everything. 

Food: Overall the food was good but it had many areas that it could improve. I felt that majority of the food was under seasoned but the spicy miso ramen had great flavor and a kick of spice. One dish that I thought needed improvement was the Popcorn Chicken (starter) it had no flavor and could have used some dipping sauce on the side. Also presentation overall could be much better. 

Overall: I'm willing to give Tavernakaya another try and see if the food has improved.
