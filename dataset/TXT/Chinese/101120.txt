If you just want to have a quick meal and want to stuff yourself with noodles for a reasonable price, Gold Bowl Asian Noodle Soup is definitely a good choice.

Menu here is really simple: Vietnamese Pho, Vermicelli or Ramen from 6.99 and up. There are also snacks and drinks if you want something light.

Special House Pho Medium ($6.99) is quite sizable with a lot of noodle but not enough meat?! Broth though heavily in MSG, I feeling the thirsty now after 30 minute after eating that noodle.

Happy Hour 20% off all snacks.

Free Wifi

Parking might be hard as the lot is always busy!

But if you are sensitive to MSG, I suggest you to pass on this place. But seems like a lot of young people like to indulge on carbs and MSG as this place was quite busy for lunch.
