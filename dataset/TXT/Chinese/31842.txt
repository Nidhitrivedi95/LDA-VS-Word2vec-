9SHoWGXsGOCa5hOjBOzPtg DON'T EAT HERE!!! You'll be disappointed and sorry that you did! I went at dinnertime on 12/28/15. There were only 3 customers the entire time that I was there, and now I know why. Keep in mind that this was dinnertime. Most restaurants are busy at this time. First, I'll rate customer service, then I'll rate quality of food. I was standing in line when this rude, disrespectful, ugly chick with a horse face to match her long, black fake horse hair ponytail weave walked in, disregarded me, walked right up to the counter and asked for her order that she had called in. Not only that, but she didn't have enough money to pay and had to go out to her car for more money, then asked for more condiments as if I wasn't even there, and the cashier let her!!! The noodles of the Chicken Lo Mein were big, overcooked, soft and super greasy. The Chicken Fried Rice was old, mushy, soft and super greasy. The food was not fresh at all! The restaurant is dinky and dingy. You can't see everything that goes on in the kitchen. They could be serving up cats and dogs. Who knows? The poor quality of the food makes it overpriced. You've been warned. If you go there, you'll see that I'm telling the truth!!! This was at China Joe's-6126 W. Lake Mead Blvd, Las Vegas NV 89108
