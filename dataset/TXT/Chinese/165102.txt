UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw Food was ok, not great.  It seems like they're trying to be a Pei Wei/PF Chang but aiming to some better food.  They have great value lunch combos every day.  I ordered a combo that had wonton soup (avg, had too much soy Sauce), and then an eggroll (which was really good) an a shangai shrimp plate that was good, but nothing specisl, with fried rice, which was pretty good. My gf had the pad thai, and she found it good, but not great.  The potstickers we had for appetizer were ok.

That being said, prices are very reasonable (especially the lunch combos at 10 dollars) and the service was good. You could do better, but you could certainly do worse.
