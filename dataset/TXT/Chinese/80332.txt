GRfq3L3500tXfEFwBK5RRQ Better value than i expected for a restaurant like this, though one did have to know what to pick, that said, its a buffet, so you can figure out what that is. I particularly liked their deep fried battered squid which was cooked well when we were there, not the rubber band material one sometimes gets. We also liked their rat-on-a-stick (read chicken skewers). As a safety check, my wife set her phone to simulate various cat noises and slunk around to determine if any response would be forthcoming, nothing happened so safe there too
