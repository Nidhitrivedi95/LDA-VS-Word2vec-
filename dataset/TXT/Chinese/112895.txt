Mkpg9S2j0ZrZc3q-VjfLsA Last night, at dusk, we were in the mood for a terrace in the neighbourhood. We knew that Montana's on Steele's had one, but were bemoaning that no Chinese restaurants had any. And lo' and behold, as we drove by the Congee Queen (where we had eaten a couple of times before), there was a terrace.

This was a very popular place on Saturday night, with a very long wait...but no wait for the terrace. Although it fronts on Steele's they have landscaped in such a way as to create a nice quiet space.

We were not overly hungry, it was more about enjoying dusk outside. For starters we ordered the appetizer Stuffed Eggplants. They were awesome! Beautifully prepared with a nice firm yet spongy middle layer of stuffing. This was following by a Fungus and 6 grain Congee, that apparently has many health benefits. This is not the usual enormous congee, but it was just right.

As a main course we shared the Seafood with Noodles, and had the vermicelli changed to broader flat noodles (like the ones in Shanghai noodles). It was delicate and delicious.

They have a broad extensive menu, with many pan-asian specialties. I had previously had a great Pho' there, and they have very tasty succulent duck and duck dishes. They also have an extensive take-out menu.

The restaurant is very new and very elegant, not pretentious, just nice! EVERY SINGLE employee that we came across on our way out addressed us, was pleasant and thanked us. This was almost worth the extra star to 5star.

We will be back!
