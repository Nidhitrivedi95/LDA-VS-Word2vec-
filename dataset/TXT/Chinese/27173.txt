85SnEWWFSm8z0EDupfTO7w I have been looking.. nay... searching for an old-school, North-American-style Chinese Food joint that delivers to my house in Vaughan, and have been met with nothing but disappointment, time after time again.

Rejoice waistline! Or rather, weep. For I have finally found what I've been looking for.

Maple Garden Chinese has it all:

1)The menu has everything I like on it
2)The proteins are cooked perfectly and are really high quality
3)The food is not overly greasy and disgusting
4)They know how to cook everything on the menu properly, so you can feel safe if you go outside the usual orders once in a while
5)They deliver in a large area and food arrives fast and PIPING hot

it's not rocket science. I'm seriously such a cheap date when it comes to this kind of food, but most of the places around here are just not good.

I'm taking one star off because I don't give 5 stars out to a place unless I've tried it more than a few times, but I'm confident with my next order this one will get bumped up. I hope.
