WbQOuI7mVST8XrJotWq9fA So my friend and I finally make it to Toronto and what's the first thing to do? Go to Chinatown and eat of course! After getting some bubble tea and feeling happy about where we are (all day dim sum, all you can eat Japanese food, unlimited hot pot, etc) we were salivating! We walked by Sang's which had ridiculous deals (mussels in black bean sauce for $2.99?!) when we stumbled upon this place. BBQ fried rice for $4? Sold!

My friend got the roast pork and rice while I got the bbq pork and duck with rice. We also shared a fish congee which was absolutely delicious. Actually all three meats was great, the roast pork skin had excellent crisp, the bbq pork (not sure if it's the best in North America as they claim, but it's darn good) was flavorful, sweet, and juicy, and the duck was excellent. Portions was generous, the congee bowl ended up 2-3 cups for each of us. The fish and ginger in the congee had a crisp flavor, and the congee smooth down the hatch.

The best part? The bill was under $15. Instant classic in my book.
