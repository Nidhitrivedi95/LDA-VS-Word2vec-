nBwOIq5KI-zmxp061dTmgw Been going here for years now. The food is made FRESH when you order it. I crave this place all of the time. It's a hole in the wall type of place with the best food ever.. fresh, hot, and delicious. I love their cashew chicken, kung pao chicken, curry chicken, fresh crab puffs. Their portions are big and the lunch specials are really inexpensive.. but I'd pay more if I had to! They have the option to add white meat only to your meal for $2.00.. it used to be $1.00 but  because of inflation everything has to go up so I understand.. can't be mad. I love all the veggies and sauce it almost all their meals! I just love their freaking food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The other locations don't make their food fresh.. don't be tricked! They are not as good as this location.. yum!
