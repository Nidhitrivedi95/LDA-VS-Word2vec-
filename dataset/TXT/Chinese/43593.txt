bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Was hoping for a new go-to spot close to our house. This will not be it. 
Ordered take-out. Customer service was severely lacking both on the phone and when I picked up my order. Food was sub par. We ordered the chili chicken  but it was meh. Chow mein was alright. Shrimp pakora was frankly soggy and just mediocre. 
If you want good hakka - I liked luckys better.
