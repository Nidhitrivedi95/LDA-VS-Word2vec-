VGxJbglGlx-a7Gdc55Q6jQ I'm a fan of Katana!  Yummy in my tummy!  Great place for sushi at a convenient location.  If you live anywhere in Dormont, it's a short walk away.   

You can't beat the all-you-can-eat sushi special that runs Sunday through Thursday for $23.95.  I'm usually eating at least $30 worth of sushi (I've got a huge appetite).  The staff is polite and on top of things and the food is prepared quickly. 

The atmosphere is clean and in the back portion of the restaurant it is fairly quiet.  It can get a little rowdy in the front of the restaurant where the hibachi tables are located.  Some of the cooks love an audience and put on quite a show for their customers.  At times they can be loud but it's never been a problem for me.

Give Katana a try when you're craving sushi!
