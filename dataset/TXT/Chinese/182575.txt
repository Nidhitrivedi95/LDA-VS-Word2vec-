XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA I've been here quite a few times and it's the cleanest Chinese buffet in the area. Food is of high quality especially the seafood. The only buffet sushi I feel safe eating. Lunch is reasonably priced and even though dinner is a little pricey it's worth it.

One time I found a hair in the ice cream so that was a bummer.
