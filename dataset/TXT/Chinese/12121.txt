2nsMgH0zh8hK4Bu55fYxlA Some friends and I have been missing great fusion food ever since Fu Lin closed in Charlotte.  We stumbled upon this place and after getting our dishes, we felt confident that we found a sufficient replacement as the flavors brought back nostalgia.  Thats when it happened.  My friend saw the owner/chef of Fu Lin come out of the kitchen!  So ecstatic he decided to get back into the business and open this place.  The food is unique, flavorful, fresh and always satisfying.  You can order Indian, Chinese, Thai or a fusion of them off the menu.  It is worth noting that every dish has a vegetarian version with paneer, cauliflower or tofu- so anyone can partake in the wonderfully flavored sauces and curries.  Don't worry vegans you are covered too!

Definitely worth the drive.
