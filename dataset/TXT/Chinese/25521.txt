7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ The pork belly bun is worth the trip !! I'm not much of a fan of pork but my girlfriend made me try it and I'm obsessed. We come by at least once a week to get something new but she can't get away from the 4 piece fried chicken and I can't get enough buns lol our next menu venture is the street cart noodles and the kale salad. The General Chow chicken is exquisite if you love the heat, but nothing tops off a better meal than some "dirt" pudding (vanilla pudding with Oreo crumbles)
