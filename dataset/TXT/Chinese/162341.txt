uLzgiSqVg5Pr93VVXSdOlg Great Noodle place, fresh made noodles right in front of your eyes. Its fun just to watch them make the noodles. The restaurant is very small, so it can get very busy. But it is definitely worth the wait. I would have given 5 stars but they gave a large instead of a Med. Which turned out to be good as the food was delicious. But its the principal that they got the order wrong. Either way, I highly recommend this place!
