CBOsWj63K1_O1m2Ounz7bQ I live nearby and come here when I'm craving congee, my favourite breakfast meal (i think it's the only place in the area that serves it?) and other cheap eats.  It really is affordable. 

I like their authentic HK menu, but the food never tastes good & fresh.  I think they use too much MSG, salt & sugar.  I question the freshness of most of it.  I feel kind of unhealthy after eating there (mild headache + general gross feeling).
 
The lighting is way too bright, they should install dimmers on their light switches. 

2 stars: 1 star for the interesting menu + 1 for the prices.
