SO GOOD.

As I was visiting from out of town, I decided to call in my order and proceeded to greedily eat all of my food by myself in my hotel room, in a manner that I would have been embarrassed to do in public. I was not mistaken to do so. I wanted to SHOVEL it into my face it was so delicious. I'm pretty sure I was using both hands to eat at one point. 

First things first: the woman who took my order? Very nice. Patient with me as I tried to navigate their 1-million-item menu. I asked her for a couple of recommendations; I like sweet and sour, chicken, maybe a veggie or two and not too spicy; she obliged with several tasty suggestions. I got the sweet and sour noodles, orange chicken, shanghai egg rolls and some awesome garlicky bok choi number; everything was on target. (Not the fried donuts though...those were kind of lame.)

Go here. Order. Eat with both hands. 
You will be ever so glad that you did.
