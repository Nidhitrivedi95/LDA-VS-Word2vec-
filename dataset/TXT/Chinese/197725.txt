zTGxLMOd9crAz0XNzqrcrA I'm gonna file this place under "popular, but I can't understand why", along with a couple of other Chinese places on Green. Had two meals here - the first was a lunch special, Schezuan beef (comes with fried rice and an egg roll). This was actually okay. The meat tasted fine, but I would've liked the veggies to have been cooked a bit more. The fried rice was where I was having problems, it just tasted kind of off... not at all like the countless other fried rice dishes I have had. Egg roll was pretty good though, hot and crunchy! Based on this first dish, I thought I'd come back again.

Meal 2: Moo goo gai pan. Never had it before, so my first try was at this restaurant. ABYSMAL. I'm disappointed in myself for not taking a photo, but god damn, it was awful. Chicken tasted borderline undercooked, not to mention completely devoid of flavor. Same goes for all the veggies. Whole thing came in hot water "broth". Waste of money, and the kind of meal that makes you go "never again". I ended up throwing away most of it.

Other problems: Minimum of $10 (IIRC) for plastic, or else you get charged a fee. Place isn't very nice/clean, despite recent renovations. For whatever reason, closed on a rotating day of choice each week (although it seems to have settled on Thursday).

1/5, AVOID.
