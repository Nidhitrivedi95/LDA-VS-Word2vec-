XqPMOwrJ0xjphyNQYcoPLg This is not your fancy white-cloth restaurant. The moment you walk in, you will wonder where you will eat since there are only 2-3 small tables at the front. Then you are led through their kitchen/prep area to the back, where there are more tables. This 2min journey kinda reminded me of going down narrow alleyways in Hong Kong to find a hidden eatery stall.

The food here is vegan/vegetarian friendly. For 4 people, we ordered the imitation duck (small), fried rice, fried tofu with imitation pork, general tao chicken and fried taro. 

I really liked the imitation duck and the tofu. However, as a omnivore, the imitation pork tasted really weird and unnatural. As for the general tao chicken, it was (as someone previously mentioned) basically your typical canadian-chinese chicken ball and red sauce. I suggest they could change the name to reflect what it is. Finally the fried rice and taro were tasty!

There is limited parking in front of the restuarant (city parking). However, if you are frugal, there is free street side parking on the street one block east of the restuarant. Overall, this place has a great bang for your buck. $40 for 4 people and we were barely able to finish everything.
