Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g The food over here sucks! I don't recommend anyone coming here for delicious Chinese food! We ordered Chinese swear n sour soup, HORRIBLE. Too much vinegar, each sip was a spit out! The dumplings were awful! Dumplings had no soup in it and everything I picked it out, the dumpling wouldn't stay together, it'll just rip off the dumpling skin. The place is very nice and high class, but it doesn't match up with the food.
