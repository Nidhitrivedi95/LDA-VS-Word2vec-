ydUqgWsF3F27TbauOyib0w I need to give it a high rating because it can count as the best Chinese restaurant in Charlotte University area.   The owner is always very nice and humorous, and service come check you and add water very often!

Good food to go: Pork Rice Combo, Three Cup Chicken, Onion oil Cake, Vegan Chicken, Ants Tree, Soup......So many
