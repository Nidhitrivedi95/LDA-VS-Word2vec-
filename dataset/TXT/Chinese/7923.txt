1CeWMRJwyFkQ-fc3MR1Dmg The food was fairly decent, but I had the worst dining experience with waitress that was assigned to our table. I don't expect five-star service when I'm dining in Chinese restaurants (I am Chinese myself), but this was beyond appalling. We had a misunderstanding in one of the items we ordered and thought that she might have brought us another table's congee. She somehow managed to turn it on us and blame us for the mistake. She scolded us, saying that she even repeated the order to us and that we were looking for trouble. We don't dispute that it was our mistake, we would have gladly eaten it. That entire experience just took our appetite away. 

We spoke to some family members later, and my aunt had a similar experience with the very same waitress. She had found a millipede in her veggie stir-fry and had notified the waitress. She scolded her as well and accused her of looking for a discount. The waitress' name is Lily. Needless to say, we will not be returning.
