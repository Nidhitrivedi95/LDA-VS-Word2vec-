t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA One of the worst Chinese restaurants I've ever eat in, the dim sum tastes like they got them from Asian supermarket, which basically is dog food. The experience is terrible, can you imagine it is 90F outside and they don't have their air conditioner on? I was sweating and eating the ****ing dog food in a restaurant which is as hot as an oven! I will never eat at this place again.
