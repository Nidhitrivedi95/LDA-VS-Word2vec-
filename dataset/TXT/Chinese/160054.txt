U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Fresh, handmade noodles served in a very ritzy atmosphere that charges a fortune. The fambam and I came here for dinner just before my return flight to the Bay Area. The decor of the restaurant was very white, and there are A LOT of goldfishes in about six fish tanks standing guard in front of the restaurant.

I ordered a Beijing Style Noodle w/ beef and mushroom in special sauce. It was fifteen bucks for a small single serving of noodles. It would fill up an average person just fine, but my 6"2' stature was unsatisfied with how little I ate and I devoured copious amounts of chocolate chip cookies at the airport.

Our server Kwok was kind and prompt with our requests. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some good recommendations. Some of the staff however was flat out rude and incompetent. They'd simply set down the dish or cups with a loud clatter and grumpily stalk away. 

Nonetheless the small serving of Beijing noodles I got to eat were delicious. Because the restaurant is located inside the Caeser's Palace it must have been absolutely necessary for the prices to go through the roof, but save your money and go else where. If you have a car, drive up Spring Mountain for some good pho houses. There's a couple of Korean BBQ and tofu restaurants that will give you a rich dining experience. You can contribute the money you save for the blackjack tables back at the casinos.
