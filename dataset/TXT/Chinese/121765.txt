oAngC9V69vyzBVYwKEJQaw I was in the Green Valley area for a doctors appointment & since it took forevers & a day @ the doctors office, I was starving by the time I got out. I drove around the plaza looking for someplace to eat. Chinese food... Always drags me in & also my fav! Decided to eat here w/ my lil one & I was definitely NOT disappointed. We ate in so we were served. I had a lunch special so it was served in a plate lunch box (which I was fine w/ as usually I don't eat all my food in restaurants anyway. It would already be set to pack up & take hm if I didn't finish). Anyhow, I ordered fried rice, chow mein, sweet sour pork (which I'm so picky w/ because it's one of my fav Chinese dishes, & it also came w/ a soup. I believe it was miso soup but don't quote me on that. They also give a tray of what looked like wonton chips appetizers which you dip in sweet sour sauce. A bit too greasy but my little one loved it! =) All this for about $12 or so. I did buy a fountain drink of course. Not too bad for the amount of food we were served. Back to the sweet sour pork, absolutely delish! Not too hard & not too greasy. & most of all... Not super drenched in sweet sour sauce. I hate it when the crispy batter around the meat is soggy before I even get to eat it. This was perfect! Way better than what pandas serve anyway. Chow mein & fried rice was great as well. Tasteful. The guys working were super nice. The place was clean. No funky smells. Haha! Definitely gonna eat here again. Hopefully soon when i get the chance. This ones a keeper for me!
