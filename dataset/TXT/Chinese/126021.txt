oyPvqoQhsdkfUeHtdPD7BQ I'm sorry, but how does this place have so many stars?? I feel like my fellow yelpers failed me. 

The food is horrible! The steamed rice is...crunchy?? It was as if it's uncooked and we ate it straight from the bag. The fried rice had no flavor other than tasting smoky. Did they just add soy sauce and flavored smoke? 

If you like McDonald's chicken McNuggets with sweet and sour sauce, then you'll love their General's Chicken. That's what it tasted like! Yuck. 

Others in my lunch group of 7 ordered other items, and not one person seemed to be happy with their food. 

The server was nice, but had no idea what was going on and got half of our orders wrong. The chef blamed the server and the server blamed the chef... 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. We should have gone to Panda....
