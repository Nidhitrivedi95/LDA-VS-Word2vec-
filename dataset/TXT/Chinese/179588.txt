I'm not sure what was worse the lay out the bouncers or the fact that they over packed the club which in a place full of drunk people is an awful idea! To be fair one of the bouncers was super polite and helped us when we needed directions but the remaining were unnecessarily aggressive. Also the fact that the bar did not serve free tap water to gentlemen is unacceptable. Not only is that Inhumane but a HUGE liability for the club. People are drinking and dancing inevitably they will get dehydrated. I was fortunate to be part of a group with a table so we could actually drink water! I was appalled to see that they did this too their patrons. What's more is that they over book the club. I love the vibe of big crowds but when the club is so crowded people are literally falling into my booth that is not ok. We could barley walk from our table to the restroom! And my friends were almost assaulted because people were cramped being stepped on thirsty and getting very aggressive. Clean up your act Hakkasan. Don't over fill your club. Serve your patrons water. Make it worth getting a table at your club. The only positive is the DJs they book. There are a lot of clubs that are as large look as good and have amazing lineups. I would not recommend coming here. Pay a little more and go someplace that will at least serve you a cup with some ice sheesh so cheap! That would never happen at any California club!
