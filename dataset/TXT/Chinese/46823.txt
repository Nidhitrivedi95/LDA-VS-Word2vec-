bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Exceptional food and service! Beyond five stars. Have not been more pleased with a dining experience for as long as I can recall. The service was phenomenal!!!  We felt like VIPs from the moment we walked in and the food was ridiculously fresh and delicious. It is obvious they take great pride in what they serve. Everything is made fresh to order. Every person we had contact with was truly a pleasure. I think one was the owner because she was so knowledgeable of everything from the ingredients to dish recommendations and was sooooooooo accommodating. I honestly feel like any restaurant would have trouble topping this experience. We had orange chicken, black pepper beef, Mongolian beef, vegetable low mein and we got the following appetizers: crab puffs (crab angels), and calamari. The food is served family style on the lazy Susan in the middle of the table. We weren't there for the entertainment as we went in the afternoon after church, but we will be back for the entertainment soon, which is at 5:30 and 7:30 each evening. This restaurant is family friendly, but would also be wonderful for a date night. Can't wait to go back. It's not super close to home, but that won't stop us from becoming regulars here. It's amazing and I'll gladly make the drive anytime I'm wanting awesome food and service.
