b7wUWVV01xaa7E0FUNMDiw DaiLo really surprised me. I have put off going because I expected it to be another hipster den that was a bit heavy on pretence and a bit light on food. Boy, was I wrong.

While it does serve a hip crowd and have a funkier vibe, the food and the service are stellar. In fact, the service was attentive and professional at a level of the top white table cloth places in town. There was not a whiff of "we-are-the-shit" arrogance. Everything was explained well, every question was answered patiently, and help choosing wine was really great.

For the meal I opted for the 55$ tasting. A value for what I got. Unlike a lot of tastings, they ask you what you like and create a menu (from the a la carte menu) tailored to your unique tastes. The whole fried fish, pork loin, fried rice, and pea dumplings were all delicious. The food is east and southeast Asian inspired. They manage to hit the bullseye where creative and scrumptious intersect. Nothing is so "out there" that you can't enjoy, yet nothing comes across as McDonald-ized Asian either.

This is easily one of the best restaurants in Toronto. Bear in mind that the tables are close together and it can be loud. If you can handle that kind of vibe, you will love this place.
