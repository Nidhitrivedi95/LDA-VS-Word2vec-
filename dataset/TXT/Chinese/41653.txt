B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ Ordered take out Chinese noodles, and that is exactly what they gave - sans the vegetable and chicken I had ordered!
Vegetables were sparse and a sole chicken piece decorated the entire dish! I have eaten here in the past and they serve decent Indo-Chinese fusion food, but the take-out was disappointing !
