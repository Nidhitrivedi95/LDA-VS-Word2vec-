uBCRRQJ4ukFaE_UyY6T1uQ I'm going to steal Ben L's word: "enjoyable" Americanized Chinese fare in a hip and attractive setting within Mandalay Bay. However expect outrageously expensive prices for Chinese food. 

Don't expect any authentic Chinese fare here. Expect Americanized Chinese dishes that are catered toward the varied touristy crowd that hits Vegas. We had these appetizers: 

Noodles (forgot what kind) - pretty good
Calamari salad - pretty tasty
Beef dumpling appetizer - okay, nothing special
Short rib  - tender and okay
Lamb off the ribs - alright

Most of these appetizers were ~$20 each. Granted the portions were slightly bigger to accomodate family style, but c'mon who charges $20 per appetitizer for something like dumplings and noodles?!

Bottom line: Hip atmosphere, some tasty dishes, friendly and helpful service but not authentic Chinese and rather hefty prices.
