PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ This place is soooooo good. Plenty of options and things to try, beware you might be here for while enjoying the yummy treats they have in the carts, so fresh and hot and full of flavor. A definite must try! 
You have options of ordering dim sum from a steam cart or heading over to the counter and ordering other various items like egg flower soup and yummy pastries. Overall we were very happy with our lunch
