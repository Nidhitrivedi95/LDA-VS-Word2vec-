VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng All I can say is wow.. That was single hamdedly the worst eating experiences I've ever had. Right before i had even loaded up my first plate one of the staff had so graciously burped next to my face.. It looked awesome but don't let the food decieve you, pretty much everything tasted stale and that it had been sitting out forever. The only reason I gave it two stars and not one is because my friend had been there a couple times and swore it had never been that bad. So maybe new mangement/chef I dunno but something definatly has to change.
