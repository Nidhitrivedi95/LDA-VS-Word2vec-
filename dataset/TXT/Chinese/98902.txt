JUI0-5ENNGAoqSF8v1LO8Q went for my first visit here this evening.  it's a bit hidden (at the same plaza as "Maxim cafe").  ordered "shrimp with lobster sauce" and cost $10.99 taxes.  The take-out container was a bit on the smaller size and shrimps were on the smaller size as well.  a bit surprized by that since it's supposedly a 'seafood chinese restaurant'.  tasted good none the less.

May go back there one day to try a difference dish for "speedy" take-out if i happen to be in the area....but i wouldn't choose this place to meet up with groups of friends...
