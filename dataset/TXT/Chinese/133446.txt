PwcZPVAxhnG-MPPpH3BsYQ For a Sunday afternoon there were not thatamy people. Cannot really comment on the service since it is pretty much fast food style and self-serve. The food was pretty good but not the best Hainan chicken rice I have had. The environment was pleasant and comfortable. It is a very good place to meet up with friends. Overall there was nothing bad about the cafe. I will give it an 8/10.
