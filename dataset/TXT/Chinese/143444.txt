rntKF4Dm9JIJoSNi5XqRsQ I love their dumplings!! Especially the pork and chives steamed dumplings! I think they make this dumplings 2nd best aside from Deng Tai Feng.

The price is really good too! a lot cheaper than Asian Legends and Deng Tai Feng..

The Pork and Chives Dumplings are $3.99 for 10! They are freshly made.. and the skin is so thin and soft. One bite and your mouth will be splashed with the great tasting soup! They are not oily or salty at all! 

The steamed twisted buns with condensed milk on the side are $2.50 for 2. Freshly made and steamed... really satisfied my carb needs!

The lunch specials mainly rice dishes.. startiing from $5.75 that comes with sweet and sour soup or soy bean drink.

Services are always  nice and friendly... A good place for me to practice my Mandarin! :)
