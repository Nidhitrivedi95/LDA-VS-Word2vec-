ui33pIJmkW0s8HddH_ZZ9A My parents had been raving about Wild Fusion for a while and I finally got to try it on a trip home when a friend bought us a huge array of food for me to pick up one night. This restaurant is really only for take out. They have one table for 2 and 3 or 4 bar seats for sushi eaters. It's clean and bright and friendly.

They cook up everything fresh so be prepared to wait a little while for your food. We got the mango chicken, pork egg foo yung, veggie mei fung, and fried rice. I don't eat egg foo, but my dad and brother really enjoyed. I really liked the mei fung, which was crisp stir fried veggies with angel hair sized noodles in a super light seasoning. The mango chicken was a very americana dish. Deep fried white meat chicken and super sweet sticky sauce. Good, of course, but while it's my dad and mom's favorite, it was not mine. Veggie fried rice was solid. 

Food to feed about 8 people was only $53!
