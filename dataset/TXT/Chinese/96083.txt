jKxES7iLV63H_PfyGVGIDw My friends and I differentiate between our two favourite Chinese places in C-U: The "really good one" (Lai Lai) and "the really fast one" (Empire).  Lai Lai is a bit spartan in its set up, but if you want a great selection, central location, and a delicious menu, hit it up.  I think it's ideal for a lunch time meet up with people from the university, and the tea dispenser is rather convenient.

Enjoy.
