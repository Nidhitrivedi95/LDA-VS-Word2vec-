xftWto4IdilizsGdE07AQw We've gotten takeout from Chef Chiang's a few times. It's not in our regular rotation because their prices are too high for takeout and for such mediocre food. Tonight, however, it went beyond that. The egg rolls tasted like they were full of rancid vegetables. The spare ribs had obviously been cooked hours earlier and left to sit. Everything else was coated with a shiny layer of grease and msg. I will not be ordering from here again.
