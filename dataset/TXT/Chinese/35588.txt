afdthOntL8hfhomIFX-NWg The restaurant smelled really bad right when we walked in the door (like bad fish and old musty hotel), so that should've been enough to make us leave, but we stayed and gave it a try.  The service was good, but the food was really awful.  We ordered spring rolls and two different tofu dishes.  The spring rolls and sauces were bland and greasy, the broccoli was cold, and the flavorless tofu was over-fried so much that it was hard.  Definitely won't be going back.
