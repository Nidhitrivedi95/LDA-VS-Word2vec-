g7bVip6ncXJC5xzkQMjohQ The food is the only good thing - and it is really good, which is why I went back to this place 3 times despite how weird it is. I'll start by saying this is honestly the ugliest restaurant in the world. I'm honestly surprised that I even tried it because I get a headache just walking by - the lights are seizure-inducing. 

However, I can stomach the bad deco style but cannot get over the horrid service. There are always at least 2 dirty tables when you come in (and when you leave....sometimes they are the same tables). The last time I was there the two employees sat behind the bar complaining about their manager (the owner?) the entire time we were eating - loud enough for us to hear. I've never been brought my bill or had my plate cleared - every time I've had to go up to the front to pay. 

I'll probably just start getting take out....
