Most dishes were only half-full... and there was NO ONE there... which suggests that the food was old.  Boy, it tasted like it too.  Chewy meat, gentle bread with raw dough inside, egg drop soup that was the consistency of slime... I'll be lucky to not get sick.  The place was filty, and our waitress was about five years old.  Not kidding.  She had an apron on and kept taking our plates and bringing us water.  Aren't there laws against that sort of thing?
