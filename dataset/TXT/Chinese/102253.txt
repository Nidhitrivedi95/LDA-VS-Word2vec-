KhvwEXKJXRTgcJRNmJNhsA Outstanding food and absolutely outstanding customer service. I ordered food from here today on Christmas day and they delivered. We were missing soup and I called them and they sent it right away, no questions asked. They were so happy in doing so as well. Christmas is really a tough time for us and they made our day with how sweet they were. 

Not to mention the food was absolutely wonderful. I will be ordering from them for now on. Thank you and Merry Christmas!
