wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA Great place for good quality food with exotic flavor like no other.

Where do I begin?

From their A5 Wagayu Beef Proscuitto to Bone Marrow to Uni Inawa Udon, I was blown away from all the new flavor overload.

They hands down have the best grilled scallop in Chinatown that are fresh from Canada. 
Everything is homemade from scratch & fresh!

Portions are great to share for couples, and seating is spacious. 

Service is also great, and the owner Jung is very friendly and attentive with his customers.

If you are looking for the newest & trendiest Izakaya menu with great quality flavor, this is definitely the place to be.
