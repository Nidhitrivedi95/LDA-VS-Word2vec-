U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Mediocre at best.  Had the brisket soup and it was very small.  The brisket was very fatty and not as tender as I had believed.  I came in on lunch break being that I work at several hotels on the strip.  I deal with a lot of tourists and like to know what's good and what's not.  I will not be recommending this restaurant to the thousands of tourists I deal with on a yearly basis.
