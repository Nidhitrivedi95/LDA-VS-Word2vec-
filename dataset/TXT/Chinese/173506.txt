W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g Took my family for dinner last night and all 6 of us ordered something different. The service was prompt and attentive and the staff was friendly. My green curry chicken was tasty with average warmth and zip, which was perfect. The General Tso's chicken was unusual by not being heavily breaded and with a light slightly tart flavor which allowed you to taste the meat rather than just deep fried breading. Overall a pleasant evening.
