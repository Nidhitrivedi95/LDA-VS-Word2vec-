xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw I went to Genghis Grill for the first time the other night.  My finance had told me about it, and I was a little apprehensive on the concept at first.  But I went willingly anyway (mainly because I was hungry, and I was not paying LOL).  When you first get there, you are handed a bowl, you're seated, and then you go to the area where all the food stuff is located.  This is where you can choose from meats galore, vegetables, sauces, and spices, and anything else you want in it.  After you're done choosing, you pick your starch to go in it.  The greatest thing about this place is that you're essentially the cook:  you pick the ingredients, the spices, and the sauces you want in it, so if you don't like it, it's your own fault, NOT the restaurants.  I really like that concept a lot.  So I was a great cook that night.  LOL.  Oh, and another thing:  when you first put your ingredients in the bowl, it's raw.  You give the person behind the counter your bowl full of stuff, and they cook it for you and place your stuff together (with your starch) in a larger bowl for you to pig out on.  I recommend this place to anyone who is a picky eater.  This place would have gotten five stars, but I'm not too keen with the wait staff.  If you can get past Skippy waiting your table, then you'll be fine.  Enjoy.
