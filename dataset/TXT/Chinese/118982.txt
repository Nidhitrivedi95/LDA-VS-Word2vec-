nQe4TPwn3iGiWlRWqguhwg Just dropped by right now as boxing day can be super tiring and I needed a break lol. I ordered my usual grass jelly roasted milk tea, 30% sugar less ice. The drink is consistent to other chatime locations I go to, so that's good. Very convienient as it's right across from Vaughan mills.
