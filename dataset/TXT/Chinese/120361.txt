o1FLiGssn5Wxc_POWSuZZA Great selection of many different meats and veggies you can choose from. The food is mediocre. Chicken Teriyaki is a great option but ive had better. Portions are also big. Expect to pay around $10-$12 for 2 meats abd a veggie option. One thing that is good is the service at this location. Super friendly and they make sure you get everything you need when leaving. The place is clean and is a good spot to go to if your feeling a quick spot to fill your craving. 

Ive had better but will return if I ever have a craving..
