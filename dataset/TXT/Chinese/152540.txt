T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw Probably my favorite Chinese food.  Have eaten there dozens of times and tried almost everything.  I usually get the Chang's Chicken (highly recommended) and the Mongolian Beef.  Too bad they discontinued the Lemon Pepper Shrimp, which was awesome.  The down sides are that there is often a long wait to get seated, over an hour at peak dinner hour, and the price is higher than most Chinese food.  But other people have had poor experiences there.  They do have some dishes that are not that great, and if that was all I had ever ordered there, I would certainly give them a worse rating.  I do not recommend their salads, for example.  Service is usually very good, and they have a full bar for most any trendy cocktail you might want.
