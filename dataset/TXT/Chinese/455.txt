-7EwIdxcRC5McO35DVfeSQ So was trying to go to JT Mix (another place in the same area) but found out that they have shut down. Ah well wandered around and found this place. Ordered a few items such as lamb skewers, rolled onion pancake with sliced beef and lamb dumplings. While the pancakes were at best average the lamb skewers were AWESOME. They are authentic and they taste amazing. Someone earlier reviewed that it was too much spice and it was trying to cover up something but that is definitely NOT true. These lamb skewers tasted just like the one's in China. I would probably be happy just coming here and having 10 of these. 

The service was at first a bit strange (as soon as you finish something they wisk away the plates and stuff, could be quite annoying at times if you approach it from a Western perspective). However what they do is very similar to what happens if you go to a restaurant in China.

4/5, can't give full marks because of the pancakes :P
