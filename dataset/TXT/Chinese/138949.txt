qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w Whenever I eat Chinese (and by Chinese I mean western style take out food) I pretty much always get the same thing

-Crab Rangoon (cream cheese wantons)
-Sweet and Sour Chicken
-Pork fried rice


So my review is based solely on these items. Most of the deduction came from the crab rangoons although overall the meal was aggressively mediocre.

Crab Rangoon

A good CR should be crispy on the outside, and stuffed full of moist, gooey cream cheese and fake crab meat. The ration of filling to pastry should be such that there is barely enough pastry to hold the filling inside and no more. These CRs have way too much pastry and not enough filling. This produces a CR that is really dry and no matter how much sweet and sour sauce you slather it in (as a professional slatherer I should know) the taste/texture is never quite right. In addition, unclear if this is because of too much pastry, the whole thing was very very dry- no delicious moistness. 

Sweet and Sour chicken

Getting take out SSC has a few pitfalls
-if they mix the sauce beforehand the chicken will be way to wet/not crispy
-if they don't mix there is a chance the steam from the dish will make everything inside mushy
-they can have vegetables mixed in

This one was actually dec. The chicken wasn't super crisp but they wisely did not premix the sauce so it was salvageable.

Pork Fried Rice
Not enough egg , but other than that acceptable.
