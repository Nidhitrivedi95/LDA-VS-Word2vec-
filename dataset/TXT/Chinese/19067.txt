5Je2-6KDxPQJZdItfo1ngg Inexpensive Chinese buffets rarely merit a very high rating, but this one deserves it. Although not located in a choice area of Phoenix, this establishment is clean, has a very efficient staff, and serves really good food - definitely better than in many of the good buffet establishments I have tried. I joined Rand H. for lunch here at opening day and was impressed by the appealing interior decor and the wide array of tasty choices which includes Mongolian grill (they have killer mini-kebabs), sushi, clams in ginger-jalapeno broth, as well as many of the staples in Chinese buffets but very nicely seasoned here. I'm definitely returning so that I can have some of the dishes I wasn't able to try because I ran out of tummy room - even though I had only a small tasting portion of each dish I tried. That's the happy consequence of having such a wide variety of good food available. And all that for just $6.99 + tax, for lunch.
