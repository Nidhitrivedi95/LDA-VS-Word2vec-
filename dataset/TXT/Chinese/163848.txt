uSANDilamc1QSiCinFSKYw This place gives Journey a run for their money.  It offers up a pretty good selection of your standard chinese-american fare.  They have a mongolian stir-fry, noodle bar and a sushi dude rollin "fresh" rolls.  

The sushi is about what you'd expect from a grocery store.  The General Tso chicken is up there with the best of them.  The noodle bar is pretty solid.  They offer udon and glass noodles, tripe, "beef balls" and other meat products as well as an assortment of veggies.  After the Noodleman boils up your selections you choose what to add from the basket of sauces and oils. Not too bad.

They don't have soft serve ice cream. Instead they have a selection of single serve ice cream cups.  They had some roasted duck sitting out on the counter.  I wasn't brave enough to try it though...

All in all this spot has everything you'd need to make it your westside go to chinese buffet.
