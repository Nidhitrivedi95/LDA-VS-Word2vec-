hx-oJMNnweYqE5ybU8aiSg I come here often now since they are under new management. If it was under the old management, I would have never stepped a foot in this place again, but I'm glad I did. They have a very large variety of food. Even sushi. Sure, its not 5 star, but its up there. For around 10$ a person, Its not bad. Very clean place. The only thing that I dislike is that their drinks taste a bit weird, so I always bring my own water. The staff is... normal, nothing over the top. This is a good place to go.
