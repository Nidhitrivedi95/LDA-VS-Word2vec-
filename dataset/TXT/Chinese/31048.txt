For take out food, we ordered the special for 2 and pan fried meat dumplings. The food was pretty tasty overall. I wasn't too pleased with the dumplings. If they fried it longer where the skin is crunchy, it would've tasted a lot better. The dumplings were freshly boiled so there were still a lot of water in the container and the skin was soaking. I won't be ordering this again. 

PACKAGING
The fried chicken ball was packed in the cardboard box which is great bc they were still crunchy when they were delivered. Everything else like the fried rice, chicken suey, and pan fried dumplings were packed in plastic containers. I personally prefer the plastic containers - healthier choice of packaging compare to the white styrofoam. 

DELIVERY
Delivery over $25-$30 (I believe) and the food got here in 30mins after the order was placed over the phone.
