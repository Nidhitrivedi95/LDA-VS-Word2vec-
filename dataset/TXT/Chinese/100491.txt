k-zr3rReFvYWz8vNyDpJMA For my last 2-3 visits over the past few months I have noticed that the quality of their stuff has gone downhill -- drastically. I am not sure what exactly happened here but things have gone sour.

I can't seem find any reason to like any of my previous favourites. The menu hasn't changed but the food has. I have noticed a sharp decline in clientele as well even during the weekend rush. I used to have to wait in line for a table but now tables are readily available.

I wouldn't waste my time coming here unless you are absolutely desperate or you are in dire need of a cheap fix. The only positive thing that remains is the relatively low price and huge portions.
