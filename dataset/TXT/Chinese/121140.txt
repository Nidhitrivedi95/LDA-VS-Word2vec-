O7_rXHN_-cFp0TgiMaNulw Go to spot for sushi, pad Thai, and lo mein. Have yet to have something on the menu I did not love.. Portions are HUGE and enough for two meals. They even have hibachi bowls, which are delicious as well. Tommy the host is very friendly. They can prepare a to go order in around 10 minutes. It gets very busy on weekend nights, so it is often worth opting for takeout. Overall, one of my favorite Asian restaurants ever!
