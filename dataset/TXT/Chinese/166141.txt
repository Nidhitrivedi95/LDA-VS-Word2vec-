vAyQDNs9lu_8hT20lleGqg We decided to give China Cafe a visit because of the mail flyer offer Japanese food. There is no close sushi in our area. 

The sushi rolls are great! The hibachi however lacks flavor or taste, very disappointed. Just not what I am used to. 

There are very few tables to eat in- so I would recommend take out. 

I am not sure I will return. Nothing overly negative but nothing that has drawn me to return.
