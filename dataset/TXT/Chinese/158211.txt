TxNeo206T0jMvRRQ4nKSIg This restaurant was recommended by friends when I asked if they've tried Spoonfuls.
We were both VERY disappointed with the food quality and really only have positives for the self serve bottled water and Pepsi products.
The men's washroom floor was disgusting to stand in wearing sandals and the whole environment was confused with low quality buffet tables.
Spend a few dollars more per person and go to Spoonful!
