6UxZJhcZClFdHJcA4kEG_g Everything, even the Fortune Cookies are good here.  (I know, I've never really thought about the quality of my Fortune Cookie before, but they're light & crispy, and just GOOD).  Some standouts that I've tried: (although to be fair, everything is good, see above): 

- Fried Rice: fresh, homemade-tasting, with LOTS of whatever protein you pick; 
- Honey-seared chicken: fuggetabout that chain place. This stuff is the Real Deal; 
- Chicken Wings. Yes, I said it. And I'm from Buffalo.  

Best of all, the SERVICE:  friendly, fast, attentive.  Whether we dine in or take out, I've never been unhappy, and I grew up in the restaurant business.  I'm not hard to please, but I notice the little things like genuine hospitality and attention to detail.  And Moon China never disappoints!
