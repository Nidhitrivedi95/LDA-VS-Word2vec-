-I7Vz5eDjc63xKmmt4Qx4g This place really should deserve 1.5 star and all the positives I could think of are:

1. Comfortable and nice environment.
2. Decent service at night (ONLY at night during dinner hours).

Where the other 3.5 stars went? The list is just too long, so let's just say this:

1. I went there in late after around 5:30pm, waited for 15 minutes to be seated when seats are everywhere left, right and center. I assume the morning/early afternoon shift is nearly over at that point so the waiter/waitress just doesn't care anymore. But their initial impression was bad. 

2. Sat down, they threw us a menu and then stood there like a mute. When I asked about certain options to put in my drink and the side dish to go with my food, the waitress rudely pointed at the menu and tell me to look at it. You call this service?

3. On multiple occasions I saw the waiter/waitress for the pre-6pm shift gathered together and just chat in the open while people were waving their hands to order and people waiting at the door.

4. Food portions were tiny.

5. Extremely lack of dessert options and for what little they have (i.e. slice of cheesecake), they charge a crazy price of $5.99 for it.

Avoid like a plague.
