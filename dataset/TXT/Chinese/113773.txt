MRoTUJyR2TVpvDdbOAtBlQ We are from San Jose California visiting here for a wedding. We were craving Indian Chinese food and found this place on Yelp. We ordered Chinese Hakka noodles, Spicy Garlic Chicken, hot and sour chicken, vegetable Manchurian balls and Jasmine tea. The food was great, the tea hot and the service was friendly and prompt.
