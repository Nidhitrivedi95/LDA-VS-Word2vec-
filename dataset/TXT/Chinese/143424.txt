rntKF4Dm9JIJoSNi5XqRsQ Yay! I like Northern Dumpling Kitchen.  A Lot.  I have been here a few times.  My favourite dishes are the jelly fish appetizer and the steamed leek and pork dumplings, but I have yet to find something that tastes less than good here.  When I do explore the rest of the menu, I find the tea duck very tasty and not too dry.  They also do the noodle dishes right.  They use the mid-width noodle instead of the thick northern noodle, so there are more sauce in each bite.  Last but not least, the prices are reasonable.
