ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Came for Restaurant Week and loved the place. Sat outdoors and the weather was good. We shared the teriyaki short rib which was amazing with the apple & daikon kimchi. We also had the pork face dumplings - they were good, but not the best I've ever had. 

We both had the seared hamachi which was heavenly. The sauce helped make the dish and I had a weird love for the mushrooms that were in the dish too. 

As for the desserts.. I hope I remember mine forever. The banana fritters were the best dessert I've ever had. The soft dough with five spice sugar, the bananas that seemed to be melting, and the red miso caramel had me almost crying in-between bites. 
 
I checked out the happy hour menu and I definitely wanna go back again.
