Plenty for 3 to 4 people. Also a combo plate of pork egg foo young and extra fried rice instead of an eggroll. A quart of wonton soup was very flavorful loaded with huge pieces of pork and packed with wonton and the green leaves ( not sure what the plant leaves are). 
China gate has been at cedar center since Moses parted the Red Sea. They're now primarily carryout although they do have a couple of tables if you want to eat there, but not ideal.
