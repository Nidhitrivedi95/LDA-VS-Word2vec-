jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg I haven't had Chinese food in a while so I took advantage of the fact that my husband wasn't hungry. (He doesn't really eat Asian food) I didn't order much because I knew I would be the only one eating. The crispy lemon chicken sounded good so I ordered that with a side of white rice. It was good especially liked the pieces of lemon. If you order this it's best to eat it there. It gets too soggy the next day ...even if you bake it. I'd like to come back and try the Walnut Shrimp, Fried Rice, and some Chow Mien. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!
