R__NLOqjUlw8qf12KD-I5A - 6 buns for $3. you really cant go wrong in chinatown. seriously.
- i always get my trifecta of portugese chicken, tuna, and curry beef.... for the savory. and then a bunch of coconut ones for good measure.
- and come on. with a name like this.... you gotta go.
- im actually eating a coconut bun as i type this review!
