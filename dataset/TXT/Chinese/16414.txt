However, it is the only Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale (that we've found) that serves authentic Chinese food!  Our primary residence is in Chicago and we grew up Chicago's Chinatown. We stay in the Troon North area when we are here and until now, we have been driving to "Chinatown" in Phoenix.  The food is good, authentic and fresh.
