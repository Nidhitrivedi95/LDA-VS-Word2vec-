Nasi Goreng- Indonesian/ Malaysian fried rice with shrimp, squid, topped with a sunnyside fried egg... tasted even better the next day

Pad See Ew - Chicken and Shrimp flat rice noodles Thai style with eggs and Chinese broccoli in black soy sauce... better than average

Thai Duck Curry - Red curry with coconut milk, bell peppers,  basil leaves, cherry tomatoes,  pineapple and bamboo shoots.... on top of coconut broken rice helped put it on the top of the chart.

This Thai restaurant is a well publicized and received by the Las Vegas locals. Very close to McCarran International and as midtown as you can get. Plenty of parking and a perfect spot to rendezvous with a local friend from Summerlin.

Our server Tia was most polite and professional allowing us to socialize with our friend. Don't recall ever asking; yet it was on our table. The three entrees were served hot and simultaneously. Ate slowly without interruption which was very much appreciated by all of us. Spoiled by previous Cambodian cuisine, we were hoping for a better selection. 

Someday an equivalent of Portland's Mekong Bistro will find its way to this valley.
