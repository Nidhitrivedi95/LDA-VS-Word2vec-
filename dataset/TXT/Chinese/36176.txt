Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg We ordered seshwan chicken and terriacki chicken. Both were served with the choice of white or brown rice. The amount of chicken and veggies was impressive: compared with the rice.

Although I enjoyed the flavor of the terriacki sauce, there was too much if it for the rest of the food. 

Service was attentive and food came very quickly.
