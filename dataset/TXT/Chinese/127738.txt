pdr6U7qSa9jIivVy_glF-w went there today with Rand H. for there lunch buffet. Well the place is a little worn down but the 100 or so trays of food were all in good shape.I started with hot and sour soup which was good .Then it was on to the main dishes , fried stuffed shrimp ,crispy chicken wings ,deep fried battered veggies , fried fish , spicy french frys all of which were above par. Then i was off to get some dessert and they had a lot for a Chinese buffet. I had fresh strawberries , canned sliced peaches , manderin oranges , yummy cakes , good chinese donuts not crunchy on the bottom. Eight types of hard ice cream. So yay I am a fan and will return , these other one star reviews must have eaten somewhere else because the food i had at China Town Buffet was all good.
