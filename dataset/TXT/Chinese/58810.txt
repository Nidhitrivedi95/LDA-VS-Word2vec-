dgIrIkCBiHtAHZ86_-awFQ This review is for Dim Sum at Grand Lake... and bottom line, if you care more about price than quality, and don't mind arriving by 9 am for the discount deal, and like the novelty of *some* carts on the weekend, then this place is for you.

As for us, the Siu mai, Har gow, Sticky rice in lotus leaf, steamed ribs, and bao (both chicken and BBQ pork) were very bland and the deep fried items all were stone cold, and while not the worst we have ever had, it certainly wasn't worth the trip to Markham!   

In future we are sticking to Elegance Chinese for Dim Sum, which while a little bit pricier, was the best flavourwise by a mile, and was indeed elegant and didn't have that dingy dining room feel that Grand Lake has. 

Lastly if you don't speak Chinese, good luck asking for something that you don't point to or order on a sheet.  Even the manager at Grand Lake ignored or didn't understand our request for hot sauce (to add some flavour to the bland food!)
