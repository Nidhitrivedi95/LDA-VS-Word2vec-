SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ Stopped in here one afternoon for happy hour with my boyfriend and we'd just missed the happy hour time but we figured we'd stay and give it a shot. We were the only people in the bar and that meant we got great service (a little too eager to chat us up.....he seemed a little bored). Food was good but I was sad that they're a beer/wine/sake only place. Overall, I would come back during happy hour pricing but not regular pricing; it gets expensive real quick!
