CfYZJ81nL6-6fFqS8OMR9Q I have come to this place on two separate occasions, one for dinner with my husband and one with a friend. I definitely like their lunch specials over their dinner ones. I particularly like the goat curry with roti though the goat seemed small in quantity. The portions for dinner were plentiful. I would say the lo mein was particularly too saucy for my taste and didn't sit well in my stomach afterwards. I prefer Windies over Tropical nights if you want another Caribbean restaurant to eat it in Scarborough. The atmosphere is however lively and their patio is spacious and great for summer weather. Music was a little bit too loud to my liking but my friend who is Guyanese says it's typical of Caribbean restaurants.
