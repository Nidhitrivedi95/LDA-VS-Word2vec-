TDgV70xYZOR5CHOqlOIYyQ I was embarrassingly excited the first time I ordered a takeaway from here, mainly because of how much I love japanese food.

Which is why it was such a let-down when it arrived... eventually. It took over an hour, which is pretty excessive for a weeknight, and especially since they charged for delivery.

That would have been ok if the food had been worth waiting for. I'm no expert on how to cook Chinese or Japanese food, but when you put the hot spring rolls that my flatmate had ordered in with the sashimi in the same box, the sashimi has a habit of having started to cook and be lukewarm and rubbery by the time it arrives. 

I don't think I'll ever get a takeaway from here again.
