68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw I got Hainan chicken which was only okay. Chicken tasted dry and we had to pay more to get stock on the side. The portion is pathetically small; I had ordered a side of vegetables of the day and it was so little when it came. 

Also the bathroom situation was very odd, they do not have public restroom in the restaurant. You'll have to rely on the kindness of the next-door costume store owner and use their bathroom. The lady  who took our order when asked about the bathroom situation, was very defensive about it to. 
Overall, this place is over-rated in my opinion. any home-made Hainan chicken taste way better than this.

updates: as shown below, the owner is very defensive. I've never heard of a restaurant settling on mediocre quality just to stay consistent. I am not opening a restaurant but I for sure don't recommend this restaurant to anyone.
