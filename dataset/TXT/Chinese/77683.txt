Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA This place was sooooo amazing and inexpensive! My boyfriend actually recommended this place for their potstickers (which were a mouthgasm).

The service was okay. We went in on New Years Day and they forgot a few essential things like hot sauce, napkins, extra bowls, and even plates.... Haha but it's okay! The food totally made up for it.

We ordered the seafood soup with rice noodles, basil beef, chicken satay (on the tiny side) everything tasted fantastic and the price I paid was unbelievablely reasonable and way cheaper than any other thaifood place. Good prices and high quality food. I can't wait to come back :)
