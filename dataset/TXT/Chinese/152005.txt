I've eaten-in and taken-out and the food is always delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order. The only reason they don't get 5-stars from me is because they are way too expensive. Eating here is not a weekly occurrence if you are on a budget. But once you've had the food here, you won't want to go to any other Chinese restaurant in the area.
