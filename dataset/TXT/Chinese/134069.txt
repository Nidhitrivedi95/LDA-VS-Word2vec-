q_c2ZvPJJxYEFPoWMKY2vQ My foodie group and I had the chance to dine at this establishment located in downtown Montreal on a Friday night and of course, we had reservations on the terrace. It was a dark day and raining hard when we arrived so we were so relieved when we noticed that the terrace is actually covered! The venue is very modern with exposed brick, dark wood tables, a slick bar and chandeliers, but the hanging lights and lots of greenery on the terrace really gave you the feel of the outdoors. The rooftop is actually clear and with all the windows, you'd get all the natural light in if it were a sunny evening; for sure, one of the most gorgeous terraces in Montreal!

We shared the tasting menu at 65$ per person and wow, was it well worth it! Four generous courses were served that left us full and content. Some dishes missed the mark like the sweet and sour chicken and the veal, mostly cause they were too dry and tasted more like smoke than anything else. The mango papaya salad and black cod dish were fabulous though, as were the cocktails. I had a spicy pimm's cocktail with wasabi and lemongrass which had the right combo of heat and sweet. Worth mentioning was the cheesecake dessert which came with a wasabi ice cream; the combo was good but not my thing although that cheesecake was fluffy heaven! 

The service was excellent as the staff was both personable and friendly, although there was a small wait between the second and third service. 

I'd totally return to the terrace on a sunny day to try some dishes from their a la carte menu and enjoy some of the lovely selections from the wine list; it was a memorable evening overall!
