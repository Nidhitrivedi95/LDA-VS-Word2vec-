t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg I'm a fan of mom and pop shops that may appear sketchy on the outside (and the inside.) You'll never know what pleasant hidden gems you may find unless you give them a try. 

We went based on the sheer fact that they were open later than most Chinese restaurants in the area. The antiquated blue interior was uneasy on the eyes, but it was clean. 

They have great combo specials served all day for $6.95. Not a bad deal at all! This is a great spot for lunch and dinner at bargain prices. You can also choose your entree size: small (under $6) or large (under $10). They offer generous portions, so we would try small next time. 

The good:
Crab Rangoon $4.25 - 6 large pieces of crispy golden fried wontons stuffed with cream cheese. Very addicting! We enjoyed it with their sweet and sour sauce. 5/5

Hot and sour soup - we ordered a small $1.60 and it was piping hot and the perfect size to share. Great flavor! 5/5

Moo shu pork served with eggroll wrappers and hoisen sauce - we ordered a large $8.25 and it was a very generous serving. It had mushrooms, cabbage, pork, and bamboo shoots. It was a great version and we really enjoyed this flavorful dish. 5/5

The bad:
Sweet and sour pork - ok, so we definitely took the wrong step with this dish. We ordered a large $8.25 and although the portion was massive, each pork morsel had way too much breading. Just imagine the dough on corn dogs...each pork was excessively covered in thick dough. Way too filling, in a bad way. It was bland as well, so we added salt to the sauce and it helped. Also, they barely gave us any vegetables and pineapple, so overall it wasn't a balanced dish. Nope I wouldn't order it again, it was poorly executed. 1/5
