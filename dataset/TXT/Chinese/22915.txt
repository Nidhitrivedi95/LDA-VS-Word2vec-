6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ Waited over 40 minutes for my food. Talked to the manager and was told, "yeah, that's about how long it takes when there's a conference in town." I don't understand how that's relevant when the restaurant is only half full. She also said the food is coming out slowly because of their limited staff and that all the restaurants are like that at the hotel. How is that possible? Don't hotels book conferences several months (if not longer) in advance?

To make it worse, the food was just alright. The manager ended up comping my entree which is why this review is two stars instead of one. This place is definitely not worth waiting 40 minutes for your food while the restaurant is half empty.
