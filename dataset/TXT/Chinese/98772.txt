JTNdV6u3DK-wcqX7ZXl5hw What has happened to this place?! Once we finally found a table, one of our dishes isn't even made and my husband has to go inquire TWICE about it. The Bangkok chicken noodles he got was bland and disgusting and the chicken tasted funny. They replaced it with spicy chicken but again, just gross. I don't expect my salad to be the world's greatest but good grief give it some flavor!!! The manager did refund one of the dishes which was nice but yeah, we will not be going back. I can find much better places.....
