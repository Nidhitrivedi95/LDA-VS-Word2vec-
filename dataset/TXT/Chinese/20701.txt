China A Go Go, definitely heavier on the oil factor is a little more flavorful than China Tango in Anthem.  In terms of service, they are both friendly and efficient.  The dine-in is just more upscale at China Tango.  

The price comparison is about the same, the food is okay, but no where great.  Beats driving to Chinatown, so I guess I'll settle.  Our normal staples are Mongolian beef, Singapore noodles, broccoli chicken, Szechuan chicken.
