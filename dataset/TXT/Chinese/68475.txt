eS8OuIk6_fMNNslFnj8noA Best Chinese Food I've ever had!! I seriously don't understand why the ratings are so low! We came in on a whim cause we live close and we all couldn't stop raving about how great it is! We got the egg flower soup to start, my mom and I both agreed best one we've ever tried! Super flavorful and just so yummy! We also had the squid salad, beef salad, pork chow mein, house fried rice, egg rolls, Mongolian Beef, orange chicken and Szechwan 
Chicken! EVERYTHING was phenomenal including the service! The egg flower soup and orange chicken were our absolute favorite! The orange chicken was the freshest I ever had and the breeding was so light and crispy! Definitely a must have!
