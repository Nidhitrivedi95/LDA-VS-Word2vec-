pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA The food was great.  

Salt and Pepper squid ~ good, it wasn't chewy as I expected it to be.  
Duck with Sweet Ginger Soy ~ good but it wasn't too memorable.
SeaBass with Miso ~ amazing!  Our waiter recommended this to us.
Cocktails ~ Bushido ~ really great
The rolls were okay but didn't feel that they were memorable

I would have given this place 4 stars but only getting 3 due to its service.  Our waiter was great initially but somewhere in the middle he kind of ditched us to go attend to a bigger table.  We were about to order more food but we gave up when we realized that our waiter had disappeared on us.  After 15 minutes of waiting for our waiter, we called another waiter to see what happened to ours when the manager finally came to tell us that our waiter was busy.  

I would have gone back because the food was great but I probably wouldn't due to the service.
