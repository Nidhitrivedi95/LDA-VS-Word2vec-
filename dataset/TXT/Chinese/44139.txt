BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg I eat here every chance I get!  If you like spicy asian food, than this is the last restaurant you'll ever need.  I practically drink chiracha sauce, I love all things spicy and How Lee's new chef (imported directly from China's sichuan province) sends out all the spicy dishes with a beautiful sea of flavorful chili peppers.  There are plenty of non-spicy dishes which are good, but not amazing.  But if you like spicy authentic Szechuan cuisine, this is Pittsburgh's finest!
