9qGnuoT91dg8WtVGVMbWAQ We ordered takeout from here a few days ago. All of the food I ordered tasted like it was cooked in hot and sour soup. The lo mein did not look like lo mein at all. None of the food was appetizing. 

I added a star because it was the friendliest service I've ever had at a Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, the service would not be enough to bring me back.
