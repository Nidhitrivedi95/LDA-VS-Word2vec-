iiN1UUyLRQrdQ_8nNzByGg Niccol is one of the best massage therapists I have ever experienced. Not only does she have the most magical hands, her personality is so big and exuberant- you are sure to have the best time. Every time I schedule a massage with Niccol, she is on-time and prompt, and always ahead of the game. She ask's me what I want her to focus on, and she's able to tailor every massage to my needs. If you ever feel like you need a massage, Niccol at Arizona Massage and Healing is the woman to go to!
