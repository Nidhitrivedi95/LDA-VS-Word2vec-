1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Came back for a UYE and had an awesome dinner once again, this time I tried the salt and pepper shrimp woohoo. A favorite is still the Big Wong Special Shrimp Soup and ramen. Every time I return I pay close attention to their newest additions displayed on neon colored posters always looking for my next favorite.  Their pricing is also among the best in Chinatown. They now have dessert like almond pudding and rotti with condense milk.
