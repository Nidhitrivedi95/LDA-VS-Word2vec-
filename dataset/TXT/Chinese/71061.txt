fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ This is my first Yelp review and it's for this one star Michelin restuarant. Being a Chinese, I did not expect to come to vegas to eat Chinese food. But being it is a Michelin restuarant and we have a show to watch at this hotel, we decide to try it out. 

Kumquat mojito - Perfect for my tasting! Refreshing, sweet but not overwhelmingly sweet, alcohol is just the right amount, not too much. Very refreshing. 

Hot n sour soup - expensive because they added some seafood in it. Not worth it to me. Some part of it is even cold. Not warm enough. It feels like that they added the seafood in right before they give it to me and it's still cold. My least favorite. 

Peking duck - their most famous dish. Lived up to the expectation. The meat and skin are one of the best! However, they were served with Mexican tortillas. So weird. (Not the soft thin one you have at Beijing). The worst thing is that tortillas is hard!such a drawback! We had to ask to change it to the bun! 

Sea Bass - we wanted the steamed one which was not on the menu but they said they can make it. It was amazing! This one is such a surprise. So fresh and perfectly cooked! The first bite I took I was already so impressed! 

Customer service - Superior! They granted every request I had. Give me a free desert to go because we didn't have time to eat desert. 

We spend $250 for 2 people. Overall, it's a good restaurant but does not deserve the Michelin standard or worth the money in my opinion.
