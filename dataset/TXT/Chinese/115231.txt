n_rEQNgsCOLNfMzGqFhn1g Great Wall of China is a nice place. The food and service is consistently good. There is outdoor seating and there are large aquariums inside with some cool fish. It's not expensive, but it's more than a "china wok" kind of place obviously (food's a lot better too). High quality veggies, so don't pass them up.
