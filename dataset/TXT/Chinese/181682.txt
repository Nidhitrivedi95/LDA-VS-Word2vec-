xEIqG7Rq8ydAT9LxCVBOOg I've been going to this place for a few Years now. Needless to say service.m, the quality of food and NOW the quality of drinks have declined. Came in today and learned the bartender John quit :( he made the best Long Island ice teas. So I ordered one from the new guy and it was Horrible!! I won't order another drink from them. The meat: chicken and beef in the house lo mein and house fried rice taste "weird"   Besides the sushi here, I do not like the meat. Service sucks because they have maybe 2 waitresses tried to care for 20+ tables and it's not working. I love close by but it's time to find a new restaurant. We use to eat her 3-5 times a week now it's maybe once a month.
