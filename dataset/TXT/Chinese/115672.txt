N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ Great, small, focused brunch menu with some really solid choices. The fried rice eggs are a great staple, and while the French toast is dynamite, it's best enjoyed shared thanks to its sheer decadence. An only decent vibe and a lacklustre amount of seating reduce it to almost a typical Toronto brunch place. Thankfully, the food keeps it putting above par.
