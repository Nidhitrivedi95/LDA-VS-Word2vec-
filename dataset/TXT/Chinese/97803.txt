JQrh2cmndqRKwTpVveHPDg At first, I felt disoriented by this place. After all, I'm an elderly Anglo from the Beaches, so coming into a place that's in a sea of parking places and right beside a Keg isn't something I'm used to. Whatever happened to streets up here?
The lineup was long and the restaurant had no places I might consider quiet, private or intimate  as a place to talk with friends. The service was totally impersonal; indeed, we ordered our meal through an internet service so it was ready shortly after we were seated.
But our two friends recently arrived from Beijing helped us make some excellent selections and we got into the swing of things in no time. If you want genuine Chinese food oriented to people from the Beijing area -- not the Hong Kong style dominant in Toronto's downtown -- this is it.
The place is owned by a Chinese chain. 
We started with long yam and blueberry; fantastic! And then black mushrooms, again cold, and again fantastic. And then came the Peking Duck. It's my first and I thought it was delicious too. As a side dish, we had lotus root and yam, which was the only item that could be described as spicy, perfect for me, mild for my friends, and a bit too much for my wife.
They brought us bottomless jasmine tea, but didn't offer any booze, which I think is terrific-- why should it be pushed, when alcohol isn't good for anyone.
In my e-book, Food for City Building, I argue that food is a major vehicle for multiculturalism or interculturalism -- where cultures learn from each other. Unfortunately, for not fault on its part, that is not the case with Dyali. Packed as it was, my wife and I were the only Anglo's.
This food and this food experience, need to be experienced by everyone. So get adventurous and learn about your Greater Toronto Area neighbours.
