VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ I'm giving this five fat stars because I'd get fat if I still lived in Arizona and was subjected to the close proximity of this restaurant to my apartment.  And job.  

I can't remember other things on the menu, other than the Pad Thai.  I'm not sure if Pad Thai is Thai (makes sense that it would be), but I see it at non-fusion Chinese restaurants, often.  Anyway, I don't care about authenticity when something is this spectacularly good.

I am very afraid of flying.

I had to fly back and forth from Phoenix to Burbank (Los Angeles area) once per month for work.

I needed comfort when I stepped off the plane, regardless of if it had only been a one hour and five minute flight.

I'd make a beeline here after getting back to Arizona.

Yummy Pad Thai.  I miss you so much.

You were my friend and comfort against the horrors and fears of the scorpion enemies.  

Wide, flat (but short) noodles.. slightly curled..  chicken, egg, sprouts, and other good-tasting things.  

I would usually get my order to-go, but the seating area seems cool, too.  Service was also great..  to-go order always ready to go..  price was right.

You know that feeling you get in the deepest parts of your gums and jaw..  that tingling thing that begins the process of salivation?  It's happening now.  They're heeeeeere!
