I also split a Papaya Salad and that was excellent as well. I took a Thai cooking course while in Thailand last year and the food Pan Asian served was as good as that taught to me by the master chef from my course. 

The service was really good as well.  The owner broke a glass but rather than freaking out or getting flustered, he quickly took a drink order and then cleaned it up. 

One other thing with mentioning is that it's very reasonably priced! Two meals and tea came to a grand total of just $20!
