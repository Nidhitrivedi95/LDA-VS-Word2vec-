2.  Most of the food seems to be very greasy/oily...more so than most other places you would eat Chinese food (regardless of authenticity).

3.  Not really the cleanest of places.  Because of the amount of grease/oil in the food the tables pick up a lot of the grease/oil and floating dust.

4.  Soda is served by the can...not the fountain.  Again, not a bad thing, just an observation.

5.  When the kitchen fan is running its really loud.

6.  I got a mild case of bubble guts.   Probably related to item 2 above.

Not really a 3 in my book, but higher than a 2
