ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ It's like going to a regular dim sum place but with smaller portions and higher prices. 

I always leave hungry and feeling ripped off. 

I would be ok with all that if the recipes were exceptional or eccentric but they are not. 

So many more interesting dim sum options in the city.
