osvcl7Fh_J5VwUikh5Vskg I've only been here twice, but nothing about this place impresses me at all. The first time I came here, I ordered their wings (honey garlic). The sauce tasted like it came out of a bottle, and although the fries were very good (reminded me of the ones at Costco), the chicken itself was just average. The portion was meant to be shared, but my friends didn't want any, so I ended up bringing the leftovers home. 

The second time I came here was close to Christmas or New Year's. My group and I were informed about a special, but we thought the regular menu was also available during this time. That was not true, and we left because there was nothing on their special menu that appealed to us (plus the prices were very high compared to their regular menu). 

The service here is mediocre, and if I were to return, it'd be for a quick bite. Not a place I would take anyone to.
