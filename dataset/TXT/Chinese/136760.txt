They have gluten-free menus & vegetarian/vegan menus but the two do not combine unless you just want rice & a side of steamed veggies which was not what I had hoped for. Eventually the server had a manager out who then got the chef out & he cane up with a great tasting tofu dish. Meanwhile the rest of the large party had already finished their food & I had to try a few bites of my dish & get it packed to go since I had an appointment to get to. Fried tofu always tastes best fresh. But it was very good. I appreciate that the chef did come out to discuss the options & then make something special, Wish it hadn't taken the server so long to get others involved. This could really be resolved by having just one entree on the menu, but most of the sauces are pre-made which is why I couldn't get the tofu lettuce wraps.
