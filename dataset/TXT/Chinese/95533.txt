JiGea0M8LjKSFcHASLWnWg Not bad for west island, and pretty inexpensive. 3.5 stars.
We came with my family for lunch one day and ordered pretty standard fare: fried Cantonese noodles, house fried rice, and beef hor fun. The food came pretty quickly, even though there was only one guy working at the time. The best dish was the fried rice, which was fragrant and flavorful. The broad hor fun noodles lacked the "wok hei" flavour and honestly, I think my hubby makes the dish better at home. The Cantonese noodles were okay, although for some reason they substituted a different kind of white ramen-like noodle instead of the thinner yellow crispy one that is typically used.
We will come here again if in the area, but if craving more authentic fare, we will probably drive to Chinatown.
