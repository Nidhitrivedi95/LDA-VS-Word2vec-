IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ I grew up eating congee in the most dirtiest of places in Chinatown in Manila.  Those have always been good.  

I'm a bit skeptical about the congee here at The Noodle Shop, (just because my surroundings are actually clean looking) but I've got such a serious craving for congee when I woke up and I wasn't having anything else.

Since we were staying at Mandalay Bay, it was convenient to eat lunch here.  I ordered the thousand egg and shredded pork congee ($10.50)  I had to season my soup with soy sauce but the pork itself is already salty. I like the big chunks of egg in there.  Bf had the wonton noodle soup, it was tasteless and for $14 wasn't really worth the money.

Our server was looking distressed from the many tables she was attending.  I thought she forgot about us, but she did manage to throw out a "how's everything??" , just as I was about to look up and respond, she was gone. 

Disinterested server and mediocre food.  A skip.
