f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ We went for lunch at noon, on a Sunday. It was crowded and wait time is acceptable for busy weekend lunch hour. We were seated in the main dining area, so the carts came around frequently.

Food: Overall the food came out freah and hot. The common dim sum dishes was acceptable. Shiu Mai (Pork dumpling), Sticky rice in lotus leaf, Beef ball, and Steamed Rice Rolls was good. Egg Custard Tarts had a very good filling, the tart crust however needs improvement, it's a bit too flaky and falls apart. Turnip cake was too soft and fell apart, if they added a little more flour or starch to make it solid, then fry it, the outcome will be much better. Their Coconut Pudding was great, smooth coconut flavor and chewy.

Service: Grand opening, so the service is still smoothing out, which is underatandable. They servers did tey their beat to stay on top of things and went around frequently to check on refills, clear empty dishes, etc.

Atmosphere: The new owners remodeled the inside, closed out the old unused bar and moved it over to the fish tanks, which ia easier for servers to deliver drinks to us. The old bar location has been converted into a private VIP room. Leveled out the entire main dining room intl a single level, which made it better for access and looked nicer. New lighter shade of paint definitely brightened up the place. Flooring has been redone, tiles throughout the hallways and waiting area, carpet has been cleaned. Overall, no old food smell anymore.

We will come back again.
