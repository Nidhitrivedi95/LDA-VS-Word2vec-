The staff is very friendly and service was extremely quick but the good ends there.

The prices are on the high side of "$" and the food is bland and unimaginative.  It was almost a chore to finish it.

The hygiene is also questionable - my bowl of rice was carried to the table grasped from above in such a way that the waiter's hand was touching the top of the rice.  

Finally, this is a cash-only place with no warning signs about that on the door, so I had to run out and find an ATM after my meal.
