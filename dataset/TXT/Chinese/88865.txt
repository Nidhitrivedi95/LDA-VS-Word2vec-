I1pLg_ZjLMcie3g58I_GZA Came here and on my second time got a stomachache after I got home and started to feel ill and continued to feel sick for the next few days. If you want to have a nice meal you can try here. Small portions and a large portion of virus. Pretty much cash only. If you pay debt they add a surcharge and the tip starts at 11%. I've veto this place, as should you.
