lpqtCUzSnKc1QGi4wO6ovQ When I'm feeling a little under the weather, my mind immediate shifts to soup.  Warm, slurpy delicious soup.  And when I'm stuck  downtown at work, I need warm delicious slurpy soup that's quick and nearby.  And Nu-Do fits the bill.  

Located in the food court at the Eaton Center, it isn't the first place I'd think to get my soup fix, but it works.  They do takeout, putting the noodles and toppings in one container and the soup in another, so you don't need to sit in the food court to enjoy (though it can be fun to people watch). A bowl of bbq pork noodle soup will cost you less than $10, so it doesn't break the bank either. It isn't particularly spicy, yet it's flavorful, so when I need to get the sinuses moving I make sure to load up on the hot sauce to add in.  

As an added bonus, while waiting for your soup you get to be entertained by the cook pulling the noodles.  It can get loud, as the dough is repeatedly banged on the counter, but oh so worth it.
