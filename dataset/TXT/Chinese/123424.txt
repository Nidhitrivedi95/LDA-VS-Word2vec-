OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


Let's not be needlessly sensitive: a lot of Canadian people go to Chinese restaurants because they want fast cheap food, and a lot of people go to Chinese restaurants because they want Chicken Balls and Chow Mein.

If you're the kind of person who gets excited when you see groups of Chinese people eating Chinese food, including Chinese families, then King's Noodle is a sure visit. They offer hundreds of dishes, but all revolve around the same concept: meat, seafood, or vegetables on rice or noodles. Or, even better: meat, seafood, or vegetables in a soup filled with noodles.

The BBQ pork and duck are sweet and well roasted. Favourites like BBQ Pork on rice ($5) or noodles with squid ($6) or BBQ pork noodle soup ($6) will do you right. Try the fried bread donut for a guilty pleasure and dunk pieces in your soup.

The tea is right, the service is cold but efficient, and the dishes are consistently good. For real Toronto Chinatown, you can't beat the King.
