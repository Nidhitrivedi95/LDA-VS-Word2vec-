CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of hot pot. There is nothing more satisfying than throwing ingredients into a flavourful boiling hot broth and watch it cook as you anticipate what it will taste like in your mouth. The concept of AYCE makes it even more exciting for me. However, Montreal's Little Sheep is a let down for this promising idea. 
I am not a very picky eater but I do expect food to be fresh and make me feel safe about eating it. The meats were fresh enough, but on the other hand, the veggies weren't all washed. I suspected dirt on them. Make sure to have the pot boiling before putting anything in, do not eat raw food. 
The seasoning bar was ridiculous... Sesame sauce was diluted with lots of water, I had to add 2 teaspoon of salt and soya sauce to make it taste something. No ingredient was labelled, it was such a struggle to mix the dipping sauce. Someone give me advice on how to differentiate salt/sugar, vinegar/soya sauce without looking weird and tasting them :(. 
Anyways, the make-your-own-food experience is something to try out, and if you're YOLO enough, do give it a try. Taste wise it's not that bad because the broth is still good and tasty. 
Price is high for what you get as of quality of food. 
I'd say service is better than average Chinatown restaurants, orders came quickly at our tables.  
I will not be back before a long time, I would rather try other hotpot locations in Montreal.
