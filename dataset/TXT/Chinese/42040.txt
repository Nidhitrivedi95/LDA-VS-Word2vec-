BaHMCHFuuVpVUV_wOInnOA Great Chinese food delivery! We've never eaten int he restaurant, but we order take out weekly from Bamboo. Service is always quick and the food is fresh and hot. Our favorites are Sweet and Sour Chicken and General Sho's Chicken. Crab Rangoons are tasty. Hot and Sour Soup is a bit generic, but still good. Don't bother is the fried rice (at least not the option in place of your rice side) - it's just rice with soy sauce on it. The chicken lo mein is good, but I wish there were more veggies than onions and sprouts.
