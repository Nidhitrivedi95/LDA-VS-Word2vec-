TkXmhC7ZDA5H2tebIXH2_Q Ichiban delivers what you would expect from an all you can eat Asian buffet restaurant. I found no unpleasant surprises and everything was typical fare. 

I really enjoy several items on their bars though. Especially the crab rangoon and baked crab with cheese. 

As I said before, this place is what you would expect from a buffet place, so don't go in expecting anything more or anything less. So if you're a fan of these types of restaurants, you'll have a good time.
