XjmHPe0H91BlJ3gwJb7OiA If you want good price and more than average servings, this is the place to go. It's been our favorite sit down dinner and take out place too. Be prepared to stand in line during peak time dinner or lunch hours. Don't know what to order for a group of 6 people?  There are set meals for 6 like double lobsters, beef dish, prawns, fish with corn, veggie dish with mushrooms, steam and yellow chicken. Its $72.99.  We added an order of Cantonese chow mein. All that food for 6!  Love them!
