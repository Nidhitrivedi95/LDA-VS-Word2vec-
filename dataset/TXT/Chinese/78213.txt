GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog My husband got food poisoning after eating the fish tacos here. When we brought it to the attention of the manager the next day, he seemed very unsympathetic and did not even offer to compensate us. He seemed insistent on proving that the cause of the food poisoning was not the food there since nobody else reported any issues. Hello - but the part of the fish my husband ate may not have been well cooked. Instead of agreeing and apologizing, the manager came off as rude, unbothered and displayed very bad customer service to clients that really loved the food at China Poblano. But rest assured, we are not going back there again.
