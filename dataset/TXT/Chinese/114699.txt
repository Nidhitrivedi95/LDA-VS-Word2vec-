mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w I'll give it to them. The place is clean. Restrooms are clean and that's it. The dim sum taste old or flavor way to overpowering. We got seated, handed water and waited ten minutes before I had to flag someone down and ask them how do we order. Then half way through our meal they all go on lunch so I had to bother them on their lunch to ask them to get us more food.  Never coming here again!!
