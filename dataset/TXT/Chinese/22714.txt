6OhahrmtLGmkUdPfaMck0A Ordered a few dumpling dishes and a seafood soup for the table.  Dumplings were good as per usual.  Seafood soup was huge in portion but was nothing special.  Though it's nice to go to a place where the flavor is relatively light.  Far too often going out means consuming too much salt or things deep fried.  The seating was also nice because there was enough distance between the tables.  More often than not most Chinese restaurants try to cram as many seats as they can inside.  The space was a nice surprise.
