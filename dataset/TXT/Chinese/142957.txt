RN-fX-LiwUm46a6G_r1xSw By all means, skip this restaurant. China Moon used to be good, but no longer. Walking in to place an order, you can see clearly that the restaurant is not clean. The floors are filthy, the walls need scrubbed. The cieling tiles should be replaced.  Waiting for the order, I didn't want to touch anything...


I ordered a chicken and broccoli combo meal and a General Tso combo meal. Both come with fried rice and an egg roll. The egg rolls were way over cooked and dry, like they had been prepared hours ago. The chicken on the chicken broccoli combo meal was under cooked. One bite and I had to throw it out. It wasn't safe. On the other hand, the General Tso chicken was over cooked, also tasting like it had sat a while.

What a shame, and a waste of money.
