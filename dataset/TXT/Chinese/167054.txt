VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA I was here for a friend's wedding (we're from Pittsburgh) and we had our nails done in the salon across from the dumpling haus. I knew I had to try it! So the next day I dragged my boyfriend with me and it was totally worth the drive out. The dumplings taste like the ones my mom makes by hand and the bao zi (steamed buns) reminded me of food we would get in Taiwan. Yes, its a little expensive, but if you want something authentic and truly homemade, then you won't mind shelling out a couple bucks. We had the Haus Dumplings, shrimp dumlings, haus bao zi, and the BBQ bao zi. You have to dip them in the accompanying sauce or I mixed soy and the hot pepper sauce they provide. The place was packed and the food took a little bit to come out. But you could see them making your order so you know it was fresh. I only regret is we couldn't come back to try the noodle bowls and tofu salad. Next time we make the trip out to Madison, I hope to come back and try everything else! 

**This is not Americanized Chinese food! No General Tso's here! If you would like to try the REAL stuff, give this place a go.
