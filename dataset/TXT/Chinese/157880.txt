twrfUEK_7kTOLOL96oPYyw I eat here all the time. If you want fresh, healthy food...this is the place. It's always clean. It's fun stacking your bowl high and watching them cook it in front of you. Here's a tip to maximize your bowl space - after you smash the meat slide it up on the side of the bowl so your veggies don't fall off. Also, mix your sauce in a separate bowl. Last thing, you can ask the chef to cook your food longer on the grill or not add so much water or whatever your preference is to really customize your meal.
