3cAy1gxlprn1ue0q3L_ziw I have been to this place many times, this is the first time I encounter a pain-in-the-ass waitress, she,aka Stephanie, said the reason we can't sit at where we want to sit is because that seat is not under my waiter's range yet there is a couple sitting right next to those seats and we are a couple too. My waiter is actually quite nice. Also I am pissed that the quantity is getting smaller and smaller. I will give higher rating only if I see improvements. 

0 star for Stephanie
5 star for our waiter Kui
4 star for the food
9/3=3stars
