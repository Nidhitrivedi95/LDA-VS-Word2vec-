XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA I would give this place a lower rating if there was one. I used to frequent this restaurant when I worked in Chandler and was very happy with the quality. I have since moved away but went back today with family and what a 180 turnaround difference! The place was filthy, the food was tasteless, cold, and one could tell the desserts were served more than one day by their dried out condition.  I brought our concerns up to management but all we were offered were ridiculous excuses. (I found it interesting that I was not the only one who was complaining tonight).  That will be the last time I frequent that restaurant and will be trying a new place that some other people we were talking to on the way out had said was excellent along with having the old manager and chef of this restaurant when it was excellent. Do yourself a favor and try another place. There are too many great buffets to settle for a place that is way past its prime.
