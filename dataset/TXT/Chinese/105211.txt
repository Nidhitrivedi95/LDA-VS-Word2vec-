KvfaPsLlpOZAF276Lpvm4w Decided to try this pace out because the Chatime line up was too long of a wait. Was a bit sceptical at first because it wasn't very busy. Just one group of customers playing board games. They did have a selection of board games to choose from and a big enough selection of drinks to choose from. I ordered a mango juice with aloe Vera. The mango juice is very viscous, not a thick nectar or pulpy. The aloe Vera chunks are quite big. Tapioca sized cubes. I quite liked my drink. And the bonus! One of the reasons why it might be empty is because you get a discount for take out. Come get a drink and get the hell out of here. Haha.
