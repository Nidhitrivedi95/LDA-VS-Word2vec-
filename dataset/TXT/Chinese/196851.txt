zPcF4fI18gSp42G17oHmmg 1st off, on the positive...we thought the food was good. We enjoyed the Mongolian Grill.

But that's where they lost us as customers. We went up to the Mongolian Grill and the man at the grill cooked our food. Great. Enjoyed it and came back for another dish. After it was cooked, I noticed the man who cooked our grilled food was staring/glaring at me and was mumbling something that I couldn't understand. He then physically picked up a tip bucket/shaked it in front of me and it became apparent to me he thought he deserved a tip than and there. Thinking this was extremely rude, I didn't leave any tip and he muttered something again/made a few noises.

Finding it hard to believe how rude that was to treat a customer, I mentioned it to the person who was supposed to be the "manager" and told her calmly about the incident. She basically said "sorry" and left our table and didn't offer anything beyond that.

We tip at the end of our meal and are decent tippers for good service which is 99% of the time. In any case, we will NOT be back at this restaurant based on how we were treated by this rude man working at the Mongolian grill. There are too many other dining choices in the valley to have to deal with rude employees.
