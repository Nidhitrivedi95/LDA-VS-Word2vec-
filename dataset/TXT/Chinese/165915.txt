vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw It's really 3.5+ stars

My understanding is that this was THE go to hole in a wall place that was busy from open to close with constant wait back in the day.  Place has had its share of drama over the years apparently.  Now it's a fraction of former glory.

The space/decor shows it's age.  Service is blah.  They really are not that helpful.  

Food wise, place is solid.  Food is tasty.  We ordered roast duck which was moist and flavorful.  Also got salted fish clay pot.  Seemed a little soupy but flavors were good.  And got garlic sautéed green vegetables.  Nicely done too

If you are looking for ambience and service, this will not be place to go to.  But if you want a solid Chinese meal, then it will.  

Not sure where else to get good Chinese in Vegas.  Likely other places off Spring Mountain Road.  Little suspicious of places inside the big casinos. But it makes sense for casinos to cater to Asian clientele
