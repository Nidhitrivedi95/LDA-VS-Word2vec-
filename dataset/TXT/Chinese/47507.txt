bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ We were pleasantly surprised by our meal here. I understand the NYC concept of good food fast with limited seating out front and they nailed it.

We ordered a family meal, two dinner dishes and tried a combined total of about 5 different dishes. The other patrons were staring as the server kept bring plate after plate to our table but we were only sampling and bagging dishes up as the new ones came out so don't know why we were getting weird looks!

The Spicy LoMein was a home run. Perfectly spicy and shrimp were plentiful. The General Tso chicken had good flavor and plenty of Broccoli. The vegetable LoMein was delicious and reminded me of a dish I grew eating. Thanks for that wonderful memory. Had been years since I thought of that dish.

There were a lot of take out orders that night, be sure to not sit in the asile to the counter as you will be getting bumped as people push in past you. Also as the sun sets you will be blinded by it so make sure you aren't in the path of the sunbeam our you will spend half your time their squinting at your dinner partners. 

All in all it was a great experience and we enjoyed leftovers for days.
