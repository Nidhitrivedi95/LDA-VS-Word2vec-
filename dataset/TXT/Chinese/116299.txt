n72smZw1iVORdnjGfFT0FQ There maybe a lot of others Better Chinese restaurants in the immediate area but Richmond Court has always been the to go place if I need something late night or with a big group.

Good selection of Cantonese Comfort food: congee and noodles.. which is good for any time of the day and all priced reasonably.

Service always fast and efficient. And trust me, if you are hungry and it is past midnight.. what Richmond Court has is good good food!

HK milk tea is quite decent too.. not too many places you can find those old traditional thick rim tea cup...
