c-Ur4wPDNjt-e2N5MkRRaQ I dropped by this place with two friends one day randomly as we were walking down Yonge. 

The decor was nice so we went for it. When we ordered we realized that the dumplings were quite small and as such had to order quite a few dishes. The shrimp was really good but most of the meat was mediocre at best. Overall we ended up with a bill close to $100. With tips we ended up playing $35+ per person and to be honest it was not worth it. I have had better Dim Sum at much better prices.
