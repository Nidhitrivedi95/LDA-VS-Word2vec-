b7wUWVV01xaa7E0FUNMDiw Love this place. Great service. Excellent, creative dishes. We tried:

Fried watermelon: this is so good l. Love the contrast between the fried outside and sweet watermelon inside. Definitely a must try.

Ponzu beef carpaccio: enjoyed the ponzu sauce and the beef. This dish was a bit on the light side. 

Prawn banh xeo: this was good, but I didn't think it was great. An interesting take on the banh xeo but kind of lacked flavour. But I prefer the real vietnamese banh xeo.

Duck breast: loved this dish. Duck breast was tasty and cooked to perfection. The brussel sprouts were amazing.

Jellyfish slaw: a decent slaw. Wasn't much jelly fish in there though.

Tom yum cocktail: so good, very interesting flavour. Really enjoyed it.
