T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw We ordered the meal for curbside pickup while we were in a hotel in Vegas with out 4 month old daughter.  Takeout is much easier when you have a little one.  To our surprise, when we got back to our hotel, I noticed that they had forgotten plates, napkins, utensils, and all of the dressings that we requested when we made our online order.  

Normally, this would not be an issue, but being in a hotel and not realizing this until we got back complicated things tremendously.  That being said, it's not the mistakes you make but how you handle them, and when I called the restaurant to explain our predicament they went above and beyond to make it right.  I wasn't about to drive back to the restaurant, so they offered to refund part of the order via a gift card sent to our house.  As I said, above and beyond.  The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the original mixup.

The food was excellent.
