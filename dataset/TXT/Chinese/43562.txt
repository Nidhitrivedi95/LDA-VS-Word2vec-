bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug My boyfriend loves fredericks. Once in a while he picks up food to go, so I can't speak on the dining experience but I can say the food is good. Fredericks was my first taste of Hakka cuisine and definitely won't be my last. We always order the chilli chicken, chicken/fish pakora and the chilli green beans (not sure what they are called). It taste like Chinese food kicked up a notch with more spices and flavours. The green beans were the biggest surprise. I'm not a huge fan of green beans but they were so good. A nice blend of sweet and spicy. I actually googled the recipe and made them because they are that good!
