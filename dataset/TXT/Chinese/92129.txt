iP3E7Nl_cGA3xWCORkoLGw Absolutely terrible. Rice was seriously lacking in flavor. Brown sauce in the chicken in broccoli was very thin and lacking in flavor. The chicken tasted boiled. Veggies were over done. Honey chicken was overdone. Delivery was quick but now I see why. Never order from here again.
