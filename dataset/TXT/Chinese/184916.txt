xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw I used to frequent here more often a few years ago but have gone less and less the past few years.  Something about this place is going down hill and I can't put my finger on it! The meat section always kind of creeps me out in terms of how sanitary it is , so when I come I stick to the veggies! What I do like about this place is the food tastes fresh and not greasy and comes out fairly quick!  Good option if you have vegetarian friends. I have never ordered off the actual menu so can't comment on that.
