355zerURpj4IMs2no238_A I would give them a zero stars if allowed. I have been to this particular location only a handful of times. Last time I was here they gave me the regular, gluten-laden Spicy Chicken by mistake which was easily remedied since I was there physically. The manager apologized profusely and made me a new meal quickly. Today the girls from my office placed an order of maybe 4 meals including mine which was GF. They brought the lunch back to the office as we only have a limited time to eat. When I discovered my chicken was breaded I called and spoke to the manager who was rather rude and copped a tude with me. Additionally he offered no apology whatsoever. He went on to say he personally bagged my order asking how I could tell the order was not GF. [Really? How does a manager not know this?!]  He offered only a refund of my money. After he processed my credit he immediately hung up. So I guess I get to be hangry the rest of the day lol. At least it's Friday right?! 
Very. Poor. Customer service. Not to mention lack of food knowledge of the restaurant he manages is a real shame. Shows he has not been adequately trained and doesn't give a hoot about the GF issue or customers. The manager SHOULD have taken this as a learning experience and educated himself and his staff but sadly, he chose not to. Hangry Donna will not be back to any Pei Wei's in the future and wrote this Yelp review instead. Hangry Donna's coworkers are staying clear of her this afternoon. Chang's should hang their head in shame.
