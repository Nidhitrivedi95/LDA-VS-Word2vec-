kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A We we're excited to try this place due to our friends reviews. The interior was very authentic and nice, it seemed like you were transported to China. Service was prompt and attentive, unlike some of the other reviews. 

They have an extensive fruit slush/boba drink selection which complemented the meal. The Mongolian pancake was good. However the broth from the noodles we got (B1 and B5) was really bland. Needed so much more flavor. Maybe we ordered the wrong things but the B1 was on the top of the menu and the server described it as one of the most popular dishes. I was really hoping to find a go-to Chinese noodle place outside Chinatown. Maybe we'll give this place another chance.
