hQNVDY_NtdtkLjXw4baA-g G Y used to be my local Chinese take away, so I visited here quite often.

I have to agree with Julia that on the surface this place is pretty standard. The menu is what you would expect (although the prices are pretty good). Apart from the free prawn crackers, nothing really strikes you as extraordinary about the food. However I have always found the staff to be exceptionally nice. I know this shouldn't sway me, but it does. The guy who is always behind the counter (I used to know his name) always used to chat to me about nerdy stuff, or just ordinary stuff like how my day had been. The food would also be served really quickly and efficiently. The second time I went back, they already knew my face.

Average food, great service.
