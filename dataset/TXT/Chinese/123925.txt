OnGPegQGuQ5_uuFLvezvKw I had a very disappointing experience with a take out order from Shun Lee.  I was surprised that the same entree which I ordered a month or two ago had decreased in volume by about a third.  Plus, it didn't taste as good as the last time I ordered the same entree.  

I was even more surprised when the price was two dollars more than the price on the take out order from my last visit.  The friendly woman at the register said that the prices had gone up.  However, when I got home and read the new photocopied take out menu, the price had gone up only twenty five cents from that which was on the menu which I had ordered from.

I think that the quality, quantity and price of Shun Lee have decreased in quality overall since the new owners took over.  I had frequented this restaurant regularly while Frank Lee owned it over the last thirty years.  

I will definitely think twice about returning to eat or take out at Shun Lee Palace in the future.
