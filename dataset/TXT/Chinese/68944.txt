EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ Went tonight - party of two.
Almost empty
Stage was set for karaoke which would have been fun! 
Clean restaurant . 
He ordered curry beef and steamed rice  with a side of egg rolls.
I ordered beef noodle soup and side of sticky rice.

Would rate a 1.5 if we could. 
Server was rushing but pleasant. 
Curry was edible but runny and the beef hadn't marinated in or cooked in it . Just thrown in at the last minute .
Steamed rice was fine- bland as expected
Egg rolls were horrible . Rated 1 out of 5

Beef noodle soup was so potent that i couldn't eat it . I'm accustomed to pho or Latin American flavored soups but this was totally diff - could've been exactly how it was supposed to taste but I don't know! To me, the aroma itself was nauseating. I didn't even eat one bite - tried the broth and couldn't stand it any more.
Sticky rice was good - steamed in the traditional woven bamboo-looking thing.
