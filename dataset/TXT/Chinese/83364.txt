hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA This is honestly not a bad deal at all for an $12.99 AYCE.  For that price, you get crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, clams, mussels, and probably 40 other dishes that are all decent to quite good.  Plus, you can use the coupon for $5 off the bill!  Only exception was the sushi section where I thought the nigiri were not quite up-to-par.  Service was typically stiff but very timely.

Here's what I liked:
- Crab legs were great, and unlike most places not salty at all.  Only if I saw that giant pot of melted butter earlier...
- Seasoned crabs also, which I did not have but mum said was good
- Raw oysters!!!!
- Crawfish was yummy, they put some type of seasoning on it that was great.  As with any steamed crawfish, it's a pain-in-the-ass to eat though.
- Mussels in the mayo-based sauce was great, mussels were plump
- Clam in some type of garlic(?) sauce was also great
- 4 types of soups - miso, wonton, hot & sour, and egg drop were good
- Several flavors of ice cream
- Fried bananas were awesome!
- Mandarin orange - the canned kind, but I love those
- The apple strudel-looking thing looked really good, but did not have room in my tummy
 
Didn't like so much:
- As mentioned above, stay away from the sushi
- Desserts were not great.  I had the cream puffs and they were awful.
- Fried rice tasted like the ones at fast food places, not Chinese restaurants
- Overall Chinese dishes didn't look impressive
 
With at least twice as many good as the bad, and with the goods being so much bigger in stature, this place gets big ups.  4-star food, not quite, but 4-star deal, it is.

Table-for-1 Factor:  It's a buffet, not a good idea.
