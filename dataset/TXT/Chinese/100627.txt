k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA I am less than impressed with this place.  My family (5 adults) and I went in for the "unlimited hot pot". The options for the hotpot was small and not very diverse/unique.  The service micro-managed our order form.  I wanted to order 6 orders of the beef (which isn't alot, considering it was only 8 slices per order) and he said that i should order a smaller amount and order more when we have cooked/eaten all of the order.  We took his "advice" and ordered as we finished.  The order fulfillment was pretty slow.  It would take about 10 mins for them to bring out the next round of food.  

The soup was bland.  They did not give us enough condiments.  Between the 5 of us, we had to share 3 different condiment bowls, 3 scoops, & 2 ladles.  The table was small, so it make it really hard to pass the condiments and ladles around.  

I would NOT recommend this place for the hot pot.  $24.95 per adult (2 adult+).
