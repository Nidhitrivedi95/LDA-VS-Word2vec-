Rg4FHrDOD2DJeDY_khy-0w Although you don't know me, take my advice and do not order the Korean spicy chicken with quinoa from this location.  It's a disaster, like that raging apartment fire across the street.  Soupy mess ... Needs 2x more quinoa and less sauce.  The chicken wasnt vey clean either ... A major turn off.
