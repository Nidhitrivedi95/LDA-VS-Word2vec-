3cZPjRA29LrHVbByA6W4VQ I started seeing Ryan at Avenue Acupuncture in the fall of 2015 when I was struggling to get pregnant.  Ryan was very professional and sensitive to my fertility issues. Shortly after starting sessions with Ryan I began the IVF process.  Ryan was supportive and knowledgeable about what types of treatments would compliment the process and enhance my chances of success.  Through my sessions with Ryan I was able to get my body and mind ready for IVF.  I am very happy to report that I got pregnant on my first round of IVF and I credit that a lot to Ryan.  It should be noted that I first heard about Ryan and Avenue Acupuncture from several people who were previously struggling with infertility.  Ryan is a bit of a legend in helping women doing IVF get pregnant right away.  When it came time for my baby to be born and I was going overdue and would need to be induced I did two sessions with Ryan and went into labour spontaneously.  I cannot thank Ryan and Avenue Acupuncture enough for helping me fulfill my dream of being a mom.  I would 100% recommend Avenue Acupuncture to anyone.
