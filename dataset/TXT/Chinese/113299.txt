mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ Some dishes here are average, the dry noodle varieties are one of the average bunch. 

Moving on to its greatest hits:  fried pork chop (can be ordered with fried rice or by itself), fried rice (there's something pleasantly different from the fried rice I been fed up until now), PAN FRIED WONTON (we all raved how delicious this is, we had the shrimp/pork variety), steam buns (xiao long bao), pan fried meat buns. 

This is a clean restaurant with nice waitresses. Owner was there when we visited and she greeted us warmly and made great effort to accommodate my picky friends (no onion, no scallion, no.... ) 

Menu is limited, mostly are Shanghai regional cuisine, which I'm just learning what the variety is about.
