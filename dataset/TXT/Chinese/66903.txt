ejdBoVvEdn5fdycuJRen8Q I just realized that I have been eating here for years, driving from the other side of town even, but I had never written a review.  Well here it is.  I have gotten food from First Wok for the last 8 or 9 years, on a regular basis, and I can't remember a time where I was not happy.  I lived in Chicago for 6 years, but came back to visit family a lot and always made sure to get it while I was here.  The pot stickers are like 4 or 5 bucks and they are enough for a meal for one.  They have your typical fried appetizers and they are not greasy.  I am not going to try to remember every dinner or lunch that I have ordered, but they were all good.  It is totally worth going to sunnycrest to get it.
