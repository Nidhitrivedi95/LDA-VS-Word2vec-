N2M0WyGCyTV5jMOYPH7odA I've been exploring my new neighborhood and found this gem.  We started off with the lettuce wraps (gf is vegetarian so went with tofu) and they were awesome.  After apps, moved onto and really enjoyed the surf and turf specialty roll.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere for any date night or casual dining experience.  Looking forward to visit again!
