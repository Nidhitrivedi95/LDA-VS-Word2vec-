fnaDx7UD4MiodQlgYHDwsQ I visit this restaurant regularly and it's a family favorite.  The food is consistently good and the service is great.  We always get the Peking Chow Mein, Wor Wonton Soup and Orange Beef, and usually pick one more dish from a short list of other favorites.  I have never had a problem when requesting substitutions and they were happy to prepare  special orders when my son had to deal with some dietary restrictions.
