ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg Great food at this place
No matter what location you go to

Turnips
BBQ Pork
Udon
Shanghai Noodles

Even the Thai food is decent

Have had both the mango salad and the pad thai is quite yummy

My parents have always ordered their Chinese food since it arrived

We'll definitely keep ordering from here
