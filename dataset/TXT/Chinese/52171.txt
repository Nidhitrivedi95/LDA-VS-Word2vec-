cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A Not So Hot... I see a ton of really positive reviews so I think ok must be awesome food,  it must have been and off day for the whole experience or the reviews are posted buy shills... because Im not going to ever return to this DIVE, I can get past the run down decor and mix match seating or the way open dining concept with the pitiful wall art  or the unclean bathrooms (keeping and open mind) that is just superficial stuff that should not get in the way of awesome food & I like the Mexican Chinese food combinations the concept is a pretty cool idea i was impressed by that,  but  the food holy mother of yuck I was not impressed at all...! & staff just don't give a crap if your new or not so they offer no advice on anything YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN, the food was dry, over seasoned salted to death...like the cook must be a smoker kind of salted its bad, I had the emerald chicken it was in the trash after the first bite...the green in the emerald part  ..??wow what a disappointment  it was only ground up over salted green onions dry topping not even a sauce of any kind it was gross..and whats with the over salting everything damn I mean really..my kid had the teriyaki chicken he ate the rice tossed the chicken it was dry and so over salted from the sauce he couldn't eat it, so maybe the tasty reviews are just people that think salty is a flavor??? the beans well if you can get past the salt..they were ok, the RICE was good, my husband had something edible after you peeled off the way to thick batter the Chile relleno with teeny tiny little Chile and a un-relleno (chile relleno should be stuffed not puffed),   the the rest of the experience was all about the sticky floor under carbonated soda and not one single lid to fit the med cups..? & I noticed the cost was way to much to pay for what you got in portion size too I mean really a cup of rice and a few chunks of chicken & a cup of pureed green onions for 8 bucks with no other sides really!!! but we had plenty of "unsalted" napkins, if you come here expecting a unique dining experience there is nothing unique here but if you insist then by all means knock yourself out, but for me I'll stick with a Freebirds or Cuccas  style food...
