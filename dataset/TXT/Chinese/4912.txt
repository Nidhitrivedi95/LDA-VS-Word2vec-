_zh_cug7ewvQEHT-uwaw8w Very bad experience and will never order again :(. We called and ordered and the lady told us 20 to 25 minutes, but when we got there they told us another 20 minutes. We waited there for an 1 hour and 15 minutes for our food because they were very busy that day, so we didn't say anything. When we got home, we started eating and found a black hair in our food and immediately called the restaurant , and they offer to delivery another one to us. The other food was very watery, and the sweet and sour chicken was still a little pink inside and the sweet and sour sauce was very sweet :/. We will not be back.
