c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ My last trip to Vegas included a visit to the Victorian Room. Okay so what if it was located in our hotel lobby and we were too lazy to go anywhere else for breakfast. I'm quite the frugal diner so I had to try to the $5.99 steak and eggs special. 

You should expect a short wait if you are coming in for breakfast. It was about 20 minutes to get a a table. Luckily there are some slot machines close to the waiting area. The service was really friendly. If you order the OJ I suggest you order the large size for about 40 cents more and over double the size! The steak and eggs surprised me! I was expect Denny's quality. The steak was about 4.5 to 5 oz. You also get a side of potatoes and toast. Pretty good deal especially for Vegas. I would definetly go back and maybe even try the Prime Rib.
