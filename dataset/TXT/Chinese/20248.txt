5XX1w4WbwSlrACQ5vKuLDw Excellent authentic food that also comes along with excellent service. I don't know for a fact but it seems like it's a family run place. The service was amazing. Portions were large and price was very reasonable. I will recommend this place to all my friends and come again in the future! I don't know how people had a hard time finding this place?? I found it with any problem and it was my first time to Chinatown in Montreal. Big sign outside... It's kinda hard to miss.
