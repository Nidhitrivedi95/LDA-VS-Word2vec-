HgL6gGEGoAUBKGrT6BXU4Q The Jackpot Chicken Rice was amazing.

My girlfriend and I checked Yelp pictures before we came here, and we were expecting a "small portion, good food, but pricey" experience. 

We ordered the Triple 7 with Jackpot chicken, and another single order of the Jackpot chicken rice. We actually ended up being really full, surprisingly.

I would definitely recommend people to go if they want some good Hainanese chicken rice! Totally worth it.
