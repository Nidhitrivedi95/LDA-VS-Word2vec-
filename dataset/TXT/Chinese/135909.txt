QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA This is THE best Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area. Everything I have ordered is full of flavor and tastes fresh. The most inexpensive lunch for the amount of food. Everyone is nice and friendly even though they are busy and running every minute. You will not be sorry if you have lunch or dinner here. Just a heads up. Hot means hot if you love spice and heat you will get it.
