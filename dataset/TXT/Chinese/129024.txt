pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I've been to other SS's before and this one is no different. Quality eats, quality drinks, and a high price tag (although considering Strip prices, it was semi-affordable). Sat at the bar and picked up 5 rolls and an order of grilled asparagus. All the rolls (tuna, yellowtail, salmon) were fresh and I give them extra love for serving spicy tuna that wasn't ground up tuna bits mushed together with spicy mayo, but actually a tuna roll with spicy mayo on top. Love that. The servers were on top of everything and were on point with the cocktails. 

Speaking of, we sipped on a Chu-Cumber (shochu, Hendricks Gin, elderflower liqueur, freshly muddled cucumber) and although called a 'wuss' by my lady friend for ordering it, it happened to be a well made cocktail. Her Samba Juice (Cruzan raspberry and Watermelon Rums, açai, passion fruit, crème de banana, guava) was good as well. Both run $12. If you're 'stuck' in the Palazzo, def try and hit up the HH specials which look like a fun time!

I'll be back asap for more of the menu and to bump this baby up a star.
