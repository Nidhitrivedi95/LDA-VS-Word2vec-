t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA My favorite Chinese restaurant. Take a menu write down the numbers you want and order... Check the wall for dim sum and specials. Don't know what they say ask a fellow guest. Wonderful dim sum and wonton soup. Many dishes are shareable.?Fresh, hot and truly special. Loved the place. Pay cash and save 5%. Free hot tea and water. I will definitely be back.
