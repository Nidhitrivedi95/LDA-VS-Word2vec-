QKCu3cKjMAOOZI7tEfv0zg Pretty decent Chinese food on this side of town. Their egg foo young is always cooked perfectly and the gravy for it is just right. We usually get their seafood combination and it comes with shrimp, lobster and an assortment of vegetables. Their fried rice is not greasy at all. You get free egg rolls with your meal.
