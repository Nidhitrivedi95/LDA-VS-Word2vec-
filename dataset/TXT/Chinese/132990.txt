pTvL6Upfp91J1ryrCZpzgg I have driven past Jade Garden many many times in the past and because it has no curb appeal and Chinese buffets can be questionable I never ate there. However, some coworkers of mine recommended it and I was pleasantly surprised. We had been stuck in a long meeting and were very hungry by the time we got there. Thankfully they have a buffet so there is no need to wait for your food. Their hot and sour soup was really good. Also had the Lo Mein Fun, Kung Pao, Eggroll, Green Beans, Mushroom and Crab Rangoon. All of it was really good. And yes the Crab Rangoon is the best in Madison as other reviews state. The food is affordable and the lunch buffet price even includes soda. I will be back.
