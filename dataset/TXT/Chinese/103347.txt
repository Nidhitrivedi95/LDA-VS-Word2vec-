KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ Came here for lunch to meet a friend. They have a good variety of lunch entrees. The food comes out fast and the prices are good for the amount of food you get. The only thing that I didn't like was how much MSG was in the food---I guess it's expected in a Chinese Restaurant, so I'll just have to make sure to ask for no MSG if I go again. 

The place is pretty authentic though, so if you are looking for a good Chinese food this is a good place to good. Personally, I just don't like a bunch of MSG in my food.
