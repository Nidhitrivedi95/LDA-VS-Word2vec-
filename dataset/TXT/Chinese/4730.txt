_xt4ZyvtgY8Xu_O6SpSB5A Came by for dinner the other day and it was mediocre at best. Ordered the beef brisket wonton rice noodle soup which was lackluster. Beef brisket was fatty, although some parts were overcooked and too salty... The wontons were okay although they didn't taste super fresh...

The rice noodles were also mediocre as again, they didn't seem super fresh...

The broth was surprisingly decent...
