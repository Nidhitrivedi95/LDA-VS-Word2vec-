zQlaDJqp3c_HAuYP5Ukk3w 3.5 stars for me actually. Ambience looks homey - like your single 70 year old aunt that owns a cat kind of house. Interior and tables were painted with off green and light pink. But it doesn't smell bad though. We were seated after like 3 minutes of waiting, though it wasn't busy even if it was lunch time. Server got us some wonton strips and sauces to start plus some tea. She didn't really say anything. Then we ordered chicken wings for appetizer, one of the beef entrees Feung something (starts with an F idk forgot) and Shrimp LoMein. 

Chicken wings arrived, it was meh. I've had better. Though it was served hot and crispy so it was kinda good. Then the 2 entrees came. Size is huge! Totes worth your money. The beef entree wasn't that bad, it wasn't as spicy as I've hoped but it's okay. Shrimp Lomein on the other hand was bomb though! The sauce was flavorful, noodles weren't soggy and there were a lot of shrimps.

Total bill was around 24 bucks, and we were full. Even had the leftovers to go. So 29 bucks all in all plus tip. Not bad. Would try other dishes for sure. Still hoping to be wowed.
