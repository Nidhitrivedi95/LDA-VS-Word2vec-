njngMI0mhAGJ-kH0oo68Ow Can we say gross? I had their quick lunch -- 2 entree combo for 6.50, and omg it was horrible. It's not as if I had high expectations.... I just wanted something edible for lunch! The fried rice is super soy-sauced and brown (which is not the way it should be). The orange chicken was nothing like Panda Express (an Americanized Chinese chain out West). Literally, I went orange eating it. Sadness.
