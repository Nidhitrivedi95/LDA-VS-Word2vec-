Q62lGVKqoKJ09lZNt2qpfw This is my favourite go-to hakka Chinese restaurant in the city. Service is a-ok, the food is freshly prepared and absolutely delicious. The place is always busy, portions are large, and prices are very low. The chili chicken is the best! The hakka noodles and rice are also staples in our order.
