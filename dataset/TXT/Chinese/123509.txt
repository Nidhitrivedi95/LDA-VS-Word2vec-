OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA I feel bad about giving this place one star but I have to!!' I ordered their congee with liver & intestines!! It was so disgusting!!! The liver had blood coming out of it and the funny thing is that other parts of it was over-cooked! So the chef didn't cook the dish evenly so it was partially over-cooked and partially raw. 

My friends ordered other stuff!!! Their beef in black bean sauce over rice was pretty good! Their other dishes were just OK...

Advice: order their dim dums! I think they're more known for their dim sums and other dishes on their small menu! 

On the plus side: their prices are cheap/ decent

I wouldn't come back again. I would rather eat anywhere else!!
