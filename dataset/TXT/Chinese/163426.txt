URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg I've been here 5-6 times over the years. I know it's got a decent reputation and always seems busy but I have never been highly impressed with the food. Nothing that bad, but I was never just delighted by my meal. The kung pao chicken I got tonight was at best average tasting and they gave a small portion of steamed rice. The vegetable egg roll was odd. They were sliced in half diagonally and very greasy. I have gotten better food from hole in the wall places. But you can do a lot worse than China Chili.
