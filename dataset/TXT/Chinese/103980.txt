Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg The one star is for the excellent service from our waiter....he made the whole dining experience acceptable.  We came in & the hostess led us into the restaurant to the stairs. There were empty tables, so I asked her why we had to eat upstairs. She said that they wanted to make the tables evenly distributed between the waiters/waitresses, that if we went upstairs she would make sure we had a table with a great view, so I said okay. The she proceeds to hand me the menus so we could go upstairs ourselves.  Waiting at the top was a young girl, the hostess for upstairs, I guess.  I smile at her & tell her we were told we would get a table with a great view. She looks at me, no expression on her face, says nothing & turns around & starts walking.  We follow her. We walk by the only table left with a view...and she leads us to the very back to a table with no view. I tell her again, we were promised a table with a view. i won't go into details, but that young girl's facial expression & attitude was the worse I have ever experienced.....and I go out to eat a lot. She was both rude & belligerent...not a good combination as hostess. She was obviously having a bad day or hates her job.  Neither speaks well for her or the restaurant manager for hiring her.  Our waiter on the other hand, 5+ stars. His positive attitude saved the day.
