SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ Just ordered lunch for my office (14 lunch specials).  I placed the order online, they called to confirm (which I loved).  When I got there to pick up the food, they had it all ready, each meal marked and they included all the sauces, forks, fortune cookies, etc.  The staff was extremely friendly and even helped me carry the food out to my car.  I will add JC Sushi Bar and Chinese Restaurant to my restaurant rotation!
