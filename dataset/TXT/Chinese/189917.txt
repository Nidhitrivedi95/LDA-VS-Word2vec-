ygJshif4VuxL1ijnRJnuYA good food, if a bit pricey for what it is. We had amazing general tao chicken and a beef dish with nuts and avocado that I would happily kill for. Mixed veggies were fine if a bit greasy and we had about a gallon of white rice forced on us that we ate exactly zero kernels from. A big meal with beers aplenty came to about $60 which was more than I'd anticipated spending on Spadina but which I think I would happily do again.
