Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g Came twice and this place makes me kinda sad, it has good potential but it just isn't met. The Shanghai noodles are some of the best I've ever had but the dish is so small (like kid menu small). Why?!?! It's just noodles, filler up! Maybe if they decide to use bigger (actual family) size dishes I'll come back.
