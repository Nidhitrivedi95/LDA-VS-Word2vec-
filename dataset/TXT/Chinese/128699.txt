PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ When Yelp works, the reviews the restaurant has received matches the food quality when you get there and you're not caught off guard or surprised. 
This is not one of those instances. Overall, I would say our experience at Yum Cha was disappointing. Not sure why it got so many stars. The biggest disappointment here was the beef (and shrimp version as well) wrapped in rice noodle dim sum, that was unfortunate as those are my kids favorite dim sum dish. I don't understand how they can mess this one up as it's probably the most common dim sum dish. 
The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf was also disappointing, no filling inside. I mean literally nothing inside! 
The other dishes we had, such as the steamed tripe, fried taro, steamed roast pork buns, beef chow fun (ordered from kitchen), was good. 
I'm comparing this to dim sum restaurants I've been to in the NY/NJ areas and having eaten dim sum for over 30 years. :)
