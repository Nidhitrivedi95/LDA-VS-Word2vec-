I ordered from Ricebox and picked the order up myself. By the time I got home (about 3 mins walk away) my hands were soaking in grease and the food was so soggy I barely ate any of it.
We all know we shouldnt really eat too many take aways, but when the food's that greasy the guilt just wont go away! Not bad for a quick fix but I'd suggest looking elsewhere for a nice meal!
