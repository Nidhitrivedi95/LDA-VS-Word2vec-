6PdHFAW72p0sSrMCX0mmbw Hubby loves noodle, he was so excited to see Noodle Fans opening in Mississauga. There ain't many authentic noodle place here on the west end of the city, so I understand the long line up. We tried off hours (like 3pm in the afternoon), still have to wait for a seat for 15mins... Good quality is good, service is so so (I guess too many people). To me, not worth the wait, but hubby is willing to wait for over 30mins... I love the house special noodle and the BBQ lamb kabob (but they sold out couple times when I was there). The side dishes taste good, but portions are smaller than other noodle houses in Scarborough or Markham. If they improve  their service a bit, and the waiting line is not that long, I will probably give it a 5 star.
