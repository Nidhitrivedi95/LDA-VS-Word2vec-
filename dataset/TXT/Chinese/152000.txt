For example, if I ask a server for water, napkins, and chopsticks, I usually expect them to forget at least one thing. Service just isn't a priority, and you need to accept that going in to ensure you have a good time.

Golden Harbor has a system that defeats my system by doing something very simple - eliminate as much service needed as possible.

Here's how our meal went with about 15 of us around a giant table.

1) Go to your table with a notepad, grab the Chinese menu, ignore the Americanized menu
2) Mark down the numbers of the stuff you want on the pad (only blame yourself if your order is wrong)
3) Go up to the register with your pad, put in your order and pay for it (no flagging down people at the end of the meal)
4) Get your own waters, plates, chopsticks, flatware, tea, etc.
5) Food comes out super fast to your table
6) Eat and eat and eat, then leave when you're done (service charge already included, they forbid tipping)

It sounds weird, but the complete lack of provided service made it much more enjoyable. We could concentrate on our conversations and our food and not desperately trying to get another soup spoon.

And I haven't even gotten to the food yet, which was excellent. I think my favorite was their take on basil chicken, which used battered chicken and tasted like a hybrid of the Thai classic dish and General Tso's. We also got a giant bowl of egg drop soup, cold chicken with scallions (my fiancee's favorite), huge pieces of walnut shrimp, mapo tofu, pork belly, and a bunch more I don't remember. Luckily we had reinforcements show up to help us as the plates were huge.

Oh, and what's also crazy is they have like 1500 things on their menu. And from what I'm seeing on Yelp and on my Facebook there are still lots of reasons to come back. Definitely the perfect place to go with a big crew!
