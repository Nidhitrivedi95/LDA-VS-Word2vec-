_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w LOVE the food here. Seafood is fresh and meaty! You can't go wrong with ordering lobster or Alaskan king crab here. They also show you the live lobster/crab after they fetch it out of the tank. People like to take pix with them and what not. It's definitely more on the expensive side. They don't take credit card either. Only cash / debit.
