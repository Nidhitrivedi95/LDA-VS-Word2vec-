U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Extremely disappointed!! My food showed up 20 minutes after my friends food and they didn't even offer to comp my meal. The service is horrible and extremely rude. Our waiter didn't come check on our table once. I had to find someone to check on my missing plate of fried rice. How long could it possibly take to make fried rice?!? Once I got the fried rice, it was seriously just rice with eggs. The plate was extremely unappetizing and all brown. There wasn't one vegetable in the fried rice. Who doesn't add vegetables to fried rice?? There was absolutely no flavor to the dish. When u cook fried rice, onions and bell peppers generally add flavor to the dish. Apparently the cooks at this kitchen don't know what's up. The Asian food at the Caesar's Palace buffet tasted better than this food. Oh...and don't get the tea. They charge you $15 for 1 small pot of tea!! Are you kidding me?!?  It's freaking tea!!
