MLVBJjbgk3sLZYyxqBD4XA Best milk tea in the city. It is best when you see a man taking care of things behind the counter and in the kitchen, he's the one who makes the award winning milk tea. It's always good even without him, but when he's there he makes the tea at a whole new level.

I've eaten here a few times and the food was bad both times (chicken wings and a sandwich). Their donuts are good (albeit small), though.
