4vLaHphDBWOy1aI7URQ75Q Came to Top Choice for an early dinner at around 5:45. The place was already 3/4 full. We were ushered to a table near the window. We decided to order the usuals: Sweet and sour pork (<U+5495><U+565C><U+8089>), fish fillet with creamy corn sauce (<U+7C9F><U+7C73><U+6591><U+8169>) and a tofu pot (<U+516B><U+73CD><U+8C46><U+8150><U+7172>). 

The food came quickly and the sweet and sour pork was no doubt the best dish. The pork was crispy yet not too greasy, and just fatty enough for our liking. It was so delicious! The fish fillets were drizzled in creamy corn sauce but was still crispy on the outside. The tofu pot lacked flavour but surprisingly had a lot of "wok hey" which was strange as it was supposed to be cooked in the claypot (not complaining here haha wok hey is hard to create and it shows how skillful a chef is).The portions were large compared to other chinese restaurants and they served complimentary soup at the beginning and ended the meal off with dessert (sweet red bean soup) . 

This place definitely live up to its name and is one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area. We will try out other dishes next time!
