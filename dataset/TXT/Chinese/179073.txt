X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Like any club in Vegas or LA, if you get bottle service, you get in real quick. Fortunately my girlfriend's friend had one on a Friday night and we happen to have a higher girl to guy ratio. The place is cool, pretty big and of course has a great sound system. The bathrooms attendants are very nice and even without tips, they'll offer you some gum on the way out. I think all Vegas clubs are very similar, they just blast EDM music now and like I said if you have a table or a high girl to guy ratio, entrance could be fairly easy. Drinks are about $15 per at the bar and although I didn't see the bottle service bill, I am sure it was anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000 a bottle. But you are in Vegas, you are supposed to lose money right? 

Overall, its a fun spot.  Every Vegas club has its time in the spotlight, so I guess Hakkasan is in right now.
