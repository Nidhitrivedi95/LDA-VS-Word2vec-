Uf0NdSvJnFbwbXua7abULg Chinese food so bad it makes you want to cry...or at least send it back!

Have been ordering party trays of deep fried wings from here for years. Loved it!! Price on those recently shot WAY up so we decided to order just an appetizer wings and then an assortment of other dishes (chicken balls, shanghai noodles, beef fried rice, general tao's chicken, assorted veg). It was all terrible. Beyond terrible. The wings are clearly all they can make well. And to top it all off, after asking for extra lemon they sent...wait for it...NO lemon for the wings at all. And now my stomach is starting to cramp up...not exactly a well-spent $54.
