XplJHcYSQTFlwv3Rk8WsYw First bad review i have written.

Tried out this place for weekday lunch.  Actually quite crowded.  But waitresses were extremely rude.  Asked some questions about menu and response was did u not read the menu?

Tables are jammed packed together and not a comfortable atmosphere at all.

Stir fried rice cakes so salty we did not finish.  Portion was rather small as well.
Beef noodle was average.
the only tasty item was xlb.

Definitely not returning for 2nd visit when there are so many better options or competitors in the scarb/ mkm area.
