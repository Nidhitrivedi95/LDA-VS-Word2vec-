v95ot_TNwTk1iJ5n56dR0g Food was good.  Really the food would have had me coming back.

The service was just terrible.  I don't have a high standard for service when I am at HK Style Restaurants because unfortunately, poor service & HK restaurants generally go hand in hand.  I mean the service is efficient, but poor.  Under-staffing and tip management is the main reason to blame, but that's a whole other story, for another time.

The service at this restaurant was depressing.  I got number for a table of 2 for me and my gf.  We're a small table so it was hard to flag anyone down.  The boss is too busy servicing the big table customers, and so are the service captains.

One of the waitresses that finally serviced our table did so very reluctantly.  Gave us almost a "god, why are you even here, and sitting in my section?" feeling.

The waitress that ended up servicing our table in the end (due to the fact that we were unable to flag down the same waitress again) was very friendly.

Oh and our tea pot came with a side of grease and sauce.  Yummy.  So we ordered a cup of ice water.  The cup was pretty dirty, so instead of telling them, we just ordered another cup of ice water--still dirty.

Food was great, everything else, not so much.  Won't be coming back until new management/owner.
