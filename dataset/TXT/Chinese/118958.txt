nQe4TPwn3iGiWlRWqguhwg If you are ever craving Chatime before or after shopping, come here. This is probably the biggest location that I have been to which makes sense since it's beside the mall. Great service here and they make their drinks right comparable to the Yonge and Finch location. Finally tried the new flavour Almond Roasted Milk Tea. It was delicious just that next time I will get it without sugar because it was just a bit too sweet.
