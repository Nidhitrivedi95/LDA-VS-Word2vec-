XdfYrFt4tkHn3TZWtBPDWw THEY DELIVER!!!!!! I could eat here every day! This is authentic Chinese food and I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. I highly recommend the hot and sour soup and the hibachi shrimp and chicken. Some of the best I have ever tried. I am sick today and called Huang  to place a to go order of this soup and he had it ready and waiting for me when I walked in the door. Now that's service!!!
