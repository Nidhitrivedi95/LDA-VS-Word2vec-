I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg I love this alternative to ice cream and froyo. I love the taro and condensed milk glaze. The topping can be interchangeable. So far I really love it with almonds cause I love the crunch. The shaved ice is great cause it isn't too heavy and it's just sweet enough. This place is definitely a place to try!
