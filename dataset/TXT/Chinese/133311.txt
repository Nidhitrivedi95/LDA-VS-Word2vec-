pvjPOBfYF2QbkqNY3xHC-A I was really looking forward to going here as I went on recommendation.  I will say, the food was very good, tasted fresh and was very tasty. 

However, sometimes the experience can spoil the meal.  There is no host to seat you so when you walk in you are just guessing as to if to seat yourself, wait for someone etc.  At this point a child (yes, I mean about a 9 year old child) tells us where to sit. 

After a bit; a Chinese woman asks for our drink order.  Upon returning she takes our order although she does talk me out of the sizzling rice soup because she thinks its too big if I plan to order dinner.  She tells me that she will just put rice on top of wonton soup (which arrives too cooled to sizzle the rice). 

Dinner is served with 1 paper napkin each.  Although we had ordered the "extra sides" as stated on the menu for $1.50 each; when those were delivered to the table, they were on 1 plate set in front of my hubby.  NO indication that it was for both of us. 

Food itself was actually quite good.  1/2 way through dinner I received a phone call on my cell that was a bit important.  When I grabbed my phone, I accidently dropped it in my sizzling seafood platter.  This splashed my phone, hair and shirt with sauce.  The primary waitress SAW this happened, yet it took 10 minutes to get additional napkins.  I requested water and we never received. 

The 9 year old is who processed my credit card for the bill.  We never were served water, asked to order additional drinks etc. 

Bottom line; IF I go here again, it will be for take out order only.  Food good, service bad.
