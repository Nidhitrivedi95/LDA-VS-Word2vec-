46LhKfz6MPaLYoS0jegsdw Qwik Chinese Bistro is a diamond in the rough. It's on the same half-mile stretch of 90th street as at least 3 other Chinese food restaurants. I've been here once, and it's already taken over my spot the favorite.

I ordered Kung Pao chicken, as I have at almost every Chinese place in the Valley. The dish was spicy, well-balanced, and full of flavor. I would give the food 4/5 stars. However, the service and hours make up for the other star. I work at the hospital, and I've been dreaming of a spot I can get Chinese food even when it's late (they are open until midnight everyday.) The gentleman who served me, even though it was takeout, impressed me with his hospitality and was very accommodating, making sure I had a plate with my to go order. This is rare, and very appreciated.

UPDATE - The quality has gone down. The chicken is not being prepared as thoroughly as when the place opened. There is more gristle and veins, which I absolutely can not stand. I've deducted two stars and I've stopped going.
