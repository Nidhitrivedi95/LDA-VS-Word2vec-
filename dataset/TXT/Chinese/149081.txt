so5zDDBvYTMjqpd0Tb8yqw I've been to Amazing Wok for lunch a few times now, and everytime that I have been the food has been great.  The lunch prices are $5 and includes rice with an egg or spring roll.  I usually get the regular Sweet & Sour Chicken.  The portions that they give you are pretty generous and the food always seem fresh.
