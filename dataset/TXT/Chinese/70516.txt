F7EuGx19ChOlv__ov2G9bw I stopped going here because the food was getting bad,  but some friends wanted to go so I thought perhaps it had gotten better.  

I got the General T's chicken & had a few pieces.  I was totally disgusted with the food.  There was no flavor & bad pieces of chicken.  Usually General T's chicken has some things mixed in for flavor - the red peppers, broccoli or a few other things.  There was nothing on this at all.

I will never go back to this place.
