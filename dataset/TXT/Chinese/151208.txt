szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A Dining at this restaurant was quite an experience!  Being my first visit to a Dim Sum restaurant, I was a little bit confused about how it worked...and I still am!  The place was very busy and I was seated promptly.  I was given a menu to look at and then these carts started coming around with different types of dishes on them.  Many of the staff manning the carts didn't speak great English, so I wasn't sure what some of the items were.  I tried several different dishes, each had good flavor and I enjoyed them.  Overall this was a good experience, but certainly not the usual Chinese food dining atmosphere.  One thing to note is that the sweet rolls are out of this world.
