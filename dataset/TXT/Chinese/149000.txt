SNkkuchbVtUzCwyENcai_g I've been to danji twice and while the food is fairly standard fare, I find that the portion sizes are too small.   Compared to other Korean restaurants around the area and that of K - town, the portion sizes are tiny.  
I ordered a seafood pancake for $8 and while it was tasty, it consisted of mostly batter and maybe one or two pieces of squid. That's not really acceptable. The size of the pancake was also about the size of a standard desert plate which is tiny! 

The first time I went to danji I tried to jajangmyeun which is basically just meat sauce over noodles.  It wasn't bad but certainly wasn't the best.   The second time I went which was today I had the cold noodle dinner special.  Again, it was edible but it literally consisted of a bunch of noodles, half an egg, and very few pieces of Shredded radish.  For $8 I really expected more.  You can get a very decently loaded bowl of pho for $8.

My dining partner ordered the japchae which was also incredibly small. It looked to be about half the size that other Korean restaurants serve but the price was the same. I get that they are a small mom and pop restaurant and that they have to skimp somewhere to be profitable but there is no excuse to skimping on food.  I mean, you are a restaurant for heavens sake. Your main product is food! 

The kicker and reason why they score a measly 2 stars is because they did not include any ban chan or side dishes of kimchi or the regular side dishes.  I am not Korean and my dining partner was Caucasian so I'm not sure if they thought they could pull a fast one on us and not offer us any side dishes. Everyone else in the restaurant got some.  So if they want to skimp on that then I will simply never return here. 

I don't recommend this restaurant.  There are other choices steps away that offer better value and with food that is above the decidedly average food served at Danji.
