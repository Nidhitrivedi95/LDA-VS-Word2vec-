Kig-T7wfebjGIpgSKcdlKA Went to Big Bowl for lunch and the experience was just ok. We got the typical pork on rice, pho noodle soup and deep fried squid hoping that it would be as good if not better than most. It took a bit of time till we got our food but we eventually got it. The food tasted ok, was average at best my pork chop was seasoned well but overcooked and the deep fried squid looked like it was store bought and lacked some flavour. There are room for improvements and I see this place becoming a foodie spot but till then I would rate this place as average.
