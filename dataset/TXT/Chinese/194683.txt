Went to summerlicious and the cured salmon was bland and not appetizing at all. Reminds me of a downgraded poke bowl in San Fran. My Dan Dan noodles was probably the best dish all meal, but that's not saying much. It was mildly warm, egg was slightly raw which I liked, ramen noodles were slightly al dente, broth was thick and flavourful. At least it tasted like a completed dish. The cold noodles was too much. Warm noodles cooked in a Chinese taste, mixed with Korean kimchi, and a splash of Japanese cold side dishes all in one bowl. Fusion is one thing and I love fusion. But clash of different cultures to the point where it felt like a messy art piece compared to an intricately designed dish is not my cup of tea. 

The bao was too hard and not quite fully steamed through to bring out the fluffiness of the bread, meat within was too dry and sauce was evident but not flavourful. 

Desert was horrific. Ice cream was creamy and milky and acceptable. The cheesecake? My god I literally started crying mid-bite because i was choking on it. Couldn't get past two spoonfuls. And I'm a girl. All girls would not leave dessert unattended...but I had to let that ship sail. Cheesecake was well whipped, but overpowering taste of cream made it feel like I was slurping down thickened whipped butter. I can't even write about it without feeling nauseous so I'll stop. 

Long story short... Disappointed and never again am I stepping foot in this restaurant. Oh mind you, service was horrible. The entire duration never saw one smile from the server. It was like I owed her a million dollars. Brutal experience is all I can say. Truly brutal.
