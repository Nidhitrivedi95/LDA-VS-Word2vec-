kjx0Zq21nF9aAK9wpGkmng I "seefood" I eat food! I "see" dumplings.. I will eat them all! 

I was a little embarrassed when I saw the spelling mistakes and the typos Dumpling King's menu on the wall.. 

Dumpling King is a small restaurant.. you cannot even see through the windows and doors on this particular winter night because of all the steams from cooking? 

Dumplings here can be order either boiled, steamed or fried. I will definitely suggest the steamed. I like that better because all the juice from the meat are still packed inside and soup just explored in your mouth!! Be careful though, they are just really hot and fresh! 

The owner/cook came out from the kitchen and served all his dumplings..and I can tell he is watching all of us eat and he definitely so happy when every single customers enjoyed his cooking!! 

The dumplings are smaller in size than some of the other places I have been.. but $6 for 16.. I counted them.. are still good value.
