bbFjlDYqeZvHFfitD9nFIg The main thing going for this restaurant are 1. Low Prices for mediocre (but still acceptable) dim sum and 2. Parking....usually available in the lot.   We thought the quality was a bit better when they first opened in late 2011.   Go here when you want value.   The place has gotten super busy lately....  They use carts on the week-ends and serve menu dim sum M-F.
