I've definitely had better BBQ in Chinatown proper and Scarborough/Markham. Beware when ordering a "medium" or "large" sized duck/chicken. They told us the medium was a half a duck and the large was the entire duck, but they were definitely missing some pieces, such as the breast and wing. We figured they used those part for the "small" or combo with rice dishes. I don't like the white meat anyway, plus $8 for a half a duck would have been pretty cheap so I wasn't too bothered by it but some of my BBQ afficianado friends were quite offended.

I think it was slightly cheaper than Spadina Garden down the road and nicer decor than Yueh Tong across the street, so I might go back to try a few other dishes, but otherwise I wasn't really impressed.
