The accompanying sauce was good, too. Then I had noodle and dumpling soup (broth wasn't very tasty - fixed this with hot sauce), which contained ALOT of noodles, green onions, cabbage and 6 delicious, fresh pork dumplings. All this for the modest price of 10.50 tax included. Seriously, it's worth it.
