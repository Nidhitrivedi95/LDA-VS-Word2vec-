c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ So it was like 3 in the morning and we were starving and so we hit the strip and came across the sign, "Prime Rib dinner or Steak dinner for $10.99" and underneath the sign was Las Vegas Police arresting a guy for God knows what, (maybe weed or the notorious underage drinker).  We head inside, the casino floor was roaring with peoples playing craps, roulette, poker, etc. and out in the back corner there was the Victorian Room, the name fits the description.  It's nothing special or spectacular, found some of the staff, (the white staff to be a little rude, when waiting for at least 40 minutes for our meals to go.  Finally the order comes out and we straggle back to the Imperial Palace, turn on the T.V. and grubbed on some great tasting medium-rare prime-rib, It was like 5 o'clock when the food coma occurred, and when we woke up hours later we hit up the Venetian for the Gondola ride, and went back to the Victorian Room to actually sit down and have a late lunch.  Once again I ordered the ever so irresistible Prime-Rib.

All in all, the food was fair, the price for the prime-rib is great, you can only find that at Vegas, otherwise you're looking at a 20-30 dollar plate of prime-rib with all the fixings at Outback.  Forget the fixings, the prime-rib with a baked potato, and a salad appetizer, you cannot go wrong.

Looking forward to it again, when I hit up sin city in a few months from now.
