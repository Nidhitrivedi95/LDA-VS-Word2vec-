_xt4ZyvtgY8Xu_O6SpSB5A was really busy when my family and i arrived, so i figured that was a sign that it was good :) we made a reservation since there were 7 of us, so we were seated right away. got one of the pre-arranged dinners (they have dinner for 2, 8, 10, etc.) since it was our first time there, so wanted to try a variety of things. very good food! service was just okay, and we ordered some extra stuff, but never got it, which are the reasons why i'm not giving 5 stars. busy plaza, but not too bad to find parking.
