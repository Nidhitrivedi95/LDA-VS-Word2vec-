OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw This place is fantastic. I love the siew mai. It is as authentic as it can get. Prices are really really low. Dim Sum specials are $1.98 for all groups but its for dine in only. Otherwise, group A is 1,85 (20 varieties), group B is 2.50 (19 varieties) and Group C is $3.75 (2 varieties). The group A items are the standard dim sum items. Good enough. You MUST try the home made sweet toufu. Its a dessert and the toufu is so smooth. I am going back tomorrow. They serve Dim sum from 10.30 to 3pm. Specials are for all days except holidays.
