osvcl7Fh_J5VwUikh5Vskg With a mix of cafe, restaurant, and bar menu City Hollywood Cafe has the ability to accomdate whether you're here for snack, dinner, drinks, or bar food.  With its Hollywood movie inspired decor collaborated with some sports banners, this place seems to have a mish-mash of everything.  
They've got their daily specials ranging from $7-12 which includes soup of the day, and drink with your meal.  
If you're feeling more on the fatty foods after a big game they've got their DAILY happy hour from 1pm-close: $14.99 for 20 wings & $8.99 for pitcher of beer!! which is quite insane, hence i'll need to make a second trip.
The food!
I had the Hollywood mixed grill $12.50: chicken steak, pork chop, sausage, bacon, served with rice and mixed. My meal included soup (Russian Borsch, or Cream soup) and tea, coffee, or soda.
Overall this place seems cozy, perfect for all ages, and the staff are friendly. I could consider this place among my local hangouts, especially in the summer with its patio! :)
