K4-J1A_ZIzG2yNkee0KOaA Keung's Delight's Afternoon Tea Specials from 3:00 pm to 5:30 pm ROCKS!

Great diversified selections of snacks, rice dishes and stir fried noodles and the best is the choice of drinks for free. Iced Black Jello with Ice Cream, anyone??

Stir Fried Singapore Turnip Cake ($5.95) with my fave drink both tasted A-OK! 

Services though was extremely slow... My food took over 20 minutes to arrive! Whenever I need anything, I have to tell the waitresses twice to get everything..even my bill..................
