vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Stopped in for a late dinner after a day of poker at the Rio. Easy walk across the street. Was quickly sat, drink ordered and after a quick review of their extensive menu, I opted for dishes I am familiar with:  war wonton soup and Singapore Rice noodles. I was not feeling adventurous to try frog legs or the live eel dish and was a little put off that they offer shark fin soup. Service was far and friendly, my ice tea never ran dry. Place was clean, well lit and not too noisy. But then it was 11:20pm. 

Soup was delicious with plenty of shrimp, chicken white meat, BBQ pork and pork filled wontons. Throw in some greens, scallions, mushrooms and it is a shareable portion. He second dish was Singapore Rice noodles. Again, plenty of meat and it arrived steaming hot. I added some red chilli paste as I found the curry spicing a little lighter than my preference. It too was delicious. 

Overall, 4 stars and a definite recommend to my friends, family and fellow Yelpers. Also, I found it to be a good value considering it is in Vegas.
