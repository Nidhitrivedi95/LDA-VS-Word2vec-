CPcy22Hd2F7z0EKG66FMRA Have been coming here for the last 2-3 years! This place is amazing! Definitely a little gem in scarborough! Trust me if you're not from around here, it's worth the drive!!! I've never had an average dish/ meal here! It's always the best of the best! Don't miss out! If you like spice and authentic fresh food! This is the place! Also the staff and owner are the absolute nicest people!
