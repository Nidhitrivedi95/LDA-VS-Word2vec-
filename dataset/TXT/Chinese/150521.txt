SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA Wonderful Chinese food for a very fair value.  
My favorites Salt & Pepper Shrimp with the shell. But no shrimp head oh well. It's hard to find Chinese food cooked for Chinese and not the american palette.
Also Salt & Pepper pork, Sea Bass House seafood on crispy noodles. Black pepper Beef. They also do celebrate Chinese New Year and offer a Special Menu that is also very tasty.
