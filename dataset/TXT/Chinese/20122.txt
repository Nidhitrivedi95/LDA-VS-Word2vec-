5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ Just an update. And a warning: I was contacted by corporate. At first I thought great maybe they will redeem themselves. But nope! After giving them all the info they completly missed the point of what took place , offered no compensation , told me it wasn't their policy to do what happened to me and to check with my bank!! Bad move! Though in the end I WAS ONLY charged the amount of my bill. THE RESTRAUNT/SERVER put a HOLD on my credit card for an extra amount of money to guarantee a tip until it could be varified we paid one (cash)..=this happened and was wrong!!!!. TIPS ARE NEVER GUARANTEED!! Unless it is shown on the bill as when there is a large party. I signed for one amount and another amount was held hostage by this RESTRAUNT!! Bad business..
