2ZHk1x5ZH687aPVo4ElYAA This place only gets 5 stars because it's the best Tea Shop 168 location, not because it's better than some of the independent tea/coffee shops I've reviewed. It might be because it's a newer location, but this location is a lot less crowded than the other ones.  It's very clean and the service was great/friendly all three times I've been so far. They also have free Wi-fi, which is pretty awesome, though I really wouldn't recommend studying here, the music is way too loud for that. Their bubble teas are good, and their presentation for ice cream was wow-ing. This location also serves hot tea in a clear pot (the fruit tea is really sweet but yummy), cakes, crepes, waffles, funnel cakes, condensed milk toast (in several flavors ex: green tea, taro, etc..), burgers and fries with different toppings. Yes, I said burgers and fries at Tea Shop 168, although I haven't tried it yet.

I decided to give this place 5 stars instead of 4 because I found myself coming back to this location several times after I wrote my initial review. The service was very impressive every time I went back *thumbs up*. The fact that they're open until 2AM even on Mondays is amazing. Oh and unlike certain larger bubble tea places in Richmond Hill (won't name any names) where the employees look like annoyed zombies, the employees here were still energetic, friendly, and fully alert at 2 in the morning. Lastly, If you're trying to stay up to study/work, I highly recommend the Peach Black Tea (which also happens to be one of the cheapest item on the menu, double win!).
