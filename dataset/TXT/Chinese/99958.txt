JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA I love this mongolian bbq...its my favorite one in arizona.  I have tried others and they never have the good variety of veggies, proteins or sauces like this place has...I do the combination everytime...I have tried other sauce combos and I always go back to my original way...I love to add the chili oil because I love spice...then I get some of the wontons.and dip them in siracha and hot mustard...yum yum yum...dont forget to use the wheat noodles they are the best!!! Always put extra sauce because your meal will come out dry if you dont.  They have rice and soup too, but I never get it because you get so much food! You get to have frozen yogurt after and its perfect because you get a little sweet at the end.  I love it...i just wish it were closer to my house but I will make the drive...
