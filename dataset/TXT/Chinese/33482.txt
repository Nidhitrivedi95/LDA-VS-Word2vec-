A5Xd85djipsW546Bq6qIYA Living on Mt. Washington this is our go to place for Chinese takeout. The food is always fresh and the portions are huge, so you definitely get your money's worth! Our go to is the chicken and broccoli with brown sauce, chicken lo mein, fried rice (veggie or chicken), and egg rolls. It is always consistently good. We have never eaten in the restaurant but it is very nice inside and clean! The people that work there are also very nice.
