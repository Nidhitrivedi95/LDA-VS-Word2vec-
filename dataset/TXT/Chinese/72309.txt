fgm7DKVy1wuod6FTPvZqRw Why did I give it a two and not a one??? Because we have ordered from here before and it's never been this horrible!!! We ordered chow main and got some thing that looked like old cabbage soup!!! The pork pieces looked so gross , not like meet at all!!!  I called back to be told that's what their chow main looked like, that if I antes noodles like Panda Express I'd have to order low main.  Very disappointed . They did offer a credit, but since that won't fix my hunger at this moment I ordered something completely different that I have ordered in the past. Oh and did I forget to mention no fork to eat our food with :(
