1PMwRG0uWGxk2hIVEQj62A Spring Villa is a great place for dim sum, provided that you arrive early for their $2.99 special (for S, M and L dim sum) when you place your order before 11AM. Otherwise it might be on the pricey side for dim sum.

The interior is nice and bright, and tables have nice table cloths and chairs has fabric covers, unlike the dingy looking dim sum places you find in downtown.

There is a tea charge per person, which some reviewers complain about - I just want to say this is a standard for dim sum places even in Asia.

Dim sum on the most part is good. Some items I ordered (such as the lotus leaf rice) were a bit light tasting and could definitely be better, but I would prefer dishes to be light tasting rather than too salty.

Recommended.
