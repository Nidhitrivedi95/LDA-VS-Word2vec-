fyBRBuzx_F00INwZ6W_G_g Horrible service stood for 20 minutes and got no service even when I said excuse me. Two woman one young man stood there and just watched me even when I was trying to speak to them. Asked to speak to manager acted like I was not there. Hopefully I get to speak to district manager about the people they choose to hire at such locations ! Horrible! Spoiled my appetite with such horrible attitude!
