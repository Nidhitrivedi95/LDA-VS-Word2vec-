HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Saw all the reviews and had to come try this place. It's off the strip just right pass stratosphere so no too far. The setup looks like a diner so not a typical Chinese restaurant setup. Which is different.

We ordered all their signature dishes and the portions were a good size and filling. Don't miss out on the pork belly and duck bao! Omg our friends were begging us to bring some back to them but considering our 5hr drive home, it might not make it to them. 
 
We would stop here again for the bao's.
