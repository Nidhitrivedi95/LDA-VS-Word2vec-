XUDOc980cjB0PZvVS-T6Eg I guess we shouldn't have had high expectations for good Asian food in Pittsburgh, but my wife and I were pretty unimpressed.  The food was a bit too oily, the roll she ordered was very small (but good; fish seemed fresh).  Maybe we've just been spoiled by too many great Asian fusion places on the east coast.
