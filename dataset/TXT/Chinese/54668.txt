ctTiEiUTY_FvnZ0ovBeZWQ Delicious quick serve Korean food. The serving sizes are perfect and are priced very well for the financial district. You don't feel gross after polishing off a meal here, but you won't be hungry either. Deep fried items are not greasy. The bibimbap and fish katsu are my go to meals.

You get 2 sides with most meals. Their kimchi is amazing! It's the only kimchi I have been able to eat on its own. Not too strong, but still full of flavour. I also really enjoy the glass noodles. 

Don't worry when you see the line. It moves quickly and it's worth the wait!
