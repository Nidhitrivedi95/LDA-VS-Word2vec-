KL-HPc-8AvUZgMNvRmiozw The food here is legit - great portions, full fresh flavors, wide variety.......so very good.  We were staying at the Holiday Inn across the street in need of a good meal within walking distance and saw this place across the street - so happy we stopped here! We were seated very quickly in a comfortable little nook.  Reasonably priced too - just go, you'll love it!
