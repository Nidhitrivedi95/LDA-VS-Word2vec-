RdwJXTQo3Ez9DAbGpybl_w Some of the worst Chinese food that I have had in a long time. My wife and I ordered delivery. She got Szechaun vegetables and I get sesame chicken. Two pretty typical Americanized Chinese meals. The vegetables were way overcooked and who knows what the chicken was. The pieces were so tiny and they were really leathery and chewy. I don't recommend this place.
