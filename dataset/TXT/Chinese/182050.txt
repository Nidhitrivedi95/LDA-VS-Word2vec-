xftWto4IdilizsGdE07AQw Had a delicious lunch there! The service was fantastic, both the female & male servers were very nice and polite. The food was so good. We had the jajamyun and sweet & sour pork, which came with couple sides of the cabbage kimchi and onion with black sauce. All very tasty and delicious! Food came quick and hot as were served as the dishes were done cooking. Love it served that way because I love my food piping hot and fresh. Never had a bad meal here, but I usually come for lunch too. Less busy that way.
