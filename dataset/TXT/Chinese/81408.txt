gyDTYm_NDWXEHBPGnL-oRQ This is one of many good Noodles locations at which I have eaten, and it does not disappoint.

While the chain may have eliminated my favorite dish (a common experience for me), the options are still varied enough to keep me coming back. There is always plenty of seating at this location, and I am please that they recently added the high end coke machine. I love the flavored dasani waters and the cherry Mello Yello.

The portions are always correct, and so far I've always received quick, courteous service. If you are in a hurry for a quick lunch or dinner, I'd recommend stopping here.
