s7sMnx0GknqoQEYahMPygg Hiro Karate has given my daughter a great sense of direction and a bit of a positive attitude adjustment, but most of all she loves it. Her attitude has improved and she has learned to be more respectful to her sisters(meaning she now knows she is not allowed to fight them with her fistacuffs! A great lesson that sticks when it is taught by someone other than her parents with Instructor Hiroshi!) It always amazes me how your children listen so much better to another adult authority figure that they respect and our daughter certainly respects Hiroshi and loves all of the work and fun they have in his class. He puts together a great karate class!
