Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg We had a great experience at PFChangs at Planet Hollywood on the strip. The food was excellent, coconut curry chicken and shrimp with lobster sauce.  The server, Bruce, was absolutely great....very attentive to details, cheerful, made great suggestions, and added so much to the visit.  I recommend this place highly.
