3PsmvwxetLz1Tzb-6mNhgA I'm a big foodie and love eating out.  This is one of my favorite places.  Great food, welcoming staff, managers remember me as I eat here on average once a week.  I also think they're starting to scrimp on quality, though.  Last time I had Mongolian Beef, the meat was tough and chewy, not cooked to perfection as it used to be.  My rice was also crunchy, but they fixed that when I brought it to the waiter's attention.  I guess it's a sign of the times and cost-cutting for restaurants to cut corners, but I never thought PF Chang's would do that.  Overall, I still love the place!  I'm a Warrior!
