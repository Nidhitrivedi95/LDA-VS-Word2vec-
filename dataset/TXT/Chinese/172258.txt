W_nU2qtu1AEDDCgkCo0gJg This use to be really good a few years back. Now it's just a restaurant you go to for a quick bite and just because it's close by. The food is doable for dinner. Is it special? Not really, is this something to try from out of town? Not really.

I have the fried ramen with ox touge. Nothing special nor something I recommend.
