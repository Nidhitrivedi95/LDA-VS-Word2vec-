Wqa1JjkSuviehZ7OedhPeA Do not like it. We definitely would not go back.

We ordered no. 2031 on the menu: stone pot duck with rice noodles.  Not even a piece of duck.  100% duck bone and duck fat.  For the price of $10.99, it is robbery.  Complained to the waiter at the end of the meal.  We got a $2.00 deduction from our bill. I do give them credit for this gesture.

The dessert No. 5001 Gold dayali pear was just sticky rice flour made into a pear shape with a little bit of sweet red bean in it.  Inside was mostly empty. It looked different and impressive but definitely not worth $2.00 each.

We also had the half price special Peking style steamed tofu for $3.49.  This was the best of the the three we ordered.

No complaint about the service and the room was a bit crowded but still pleasant.

We would not recommend this restaurant and will not return.
