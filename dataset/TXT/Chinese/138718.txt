QQSlx-l_cfwkVrNwjV_HgQ HORRIBLE! Poorest customer service I have ever had. The worst!!! Do not order online or you will be reprimanded for it. The person working, Jackie, told me I NEEDED to call and I should NOT have ordered online because I'm so far away and it goes to her personal email. We never had problems ordering before but she had attitude. Plus, we live less than 3 miles away. She only gave me a pint instead of a quart of soup and told me she didn't charge me for the quart, which in fact she did. She continually told me I was wrong and should have ordered over the phone. I asked for a refund or for the rest of my paid for soup to be delivered. She told me she would send the soup sometime today, which meant anytime between 12:15pm to close. I told her that was ridiculous and she told me I would just have to wait because she wasn't going to make a trip to my neighborhood just for soup. She continually made me feel bad, like I was the one that messed up when in fact it was her.

I decided to drive and get my soup myself. I tried to tell her to deactivate her online account but she said no. JUST CALL!!! I tried to reason with her but she continued to be the most rude service industry person I have ever encountered.

PS The food was awful. Soggy and cold, except for the soup I went and picked up myself. It was bland but hot.
