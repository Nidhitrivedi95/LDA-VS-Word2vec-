XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA Deliciously fresh handmade noodles!! Very small inside but worth the squeeze. Noodles made right before your eyes! Broth of the soup was amazing and the large bowl was huge! Wish this was down the street from my house in California!! I will be revisiting when I return to Toronto!!
