wwoOWTunPh4QnaKW11Zl7A I waited at the bubble tea line for 10 minutes while I watched the lady work, I assumed she hadn't seen me and said "excuse me, can i get a bubble tea?" 
she told me i could only get the ones up at the front, so i asked her if she could make me one, because usually i get something that isnt at the front.
She told me they were closed. It was 2:14pm. But apparently their open til 10pm on Tuesdays. So i asked her why they were closing at 2 and she called over another lady, who also said were closed. I politely asked her when they closed and she walked away from me. I don't think I'll go back again.
