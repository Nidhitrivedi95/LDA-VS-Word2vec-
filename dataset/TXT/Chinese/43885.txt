bI4emjU96ZvGQRTwxItd2w Came here with my boyfriend for lunch today. Service was good and quick. I got Chicken Pad Thai and he got Drunken Noodles with Chicken. It was a lunch special price so that was about $2 off and you got soup (dine-in only) and an egg roll with the entree. We both loved everything. The flavor was great, the spice was good (I could have had spicier but no complaints) and the portions were huge. Good last minute choice to come here and will hopefully be back whenever I'm in town!
