Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Delicious food, affordable price, and friendly service! 

The main guy is funny and very accommodating. Offered some suggestions on which ones are their popular dishes. BF went for the Massaman Curry with beef and I went for my favorite chicken Panang :)

I usually get papaya salad and pad Thai but we were feelin' curry that day. We really wanted to go for dessert but since we both ordered a second helping of rice we didn't leave enough room :(

We'll definitely come back!

UPDATE:
I've been here a couple times and after some evaluation, I say their Thai menu is definitely A+ their "other" items however can be a hit or miss. I've tried their linguine and I wasn't a fan. This restaurant's cuisine is Thai to begin with so I don't stray anymore. They do have one of the best curries in town !
