LB7r3hZmb4NXb2jDQmmQ9w I have been coming to this restaurant since I was a teenager and I recommend anyone who can handle some spicy food to check this place out. 

Some dishes I would recommend are of course, the beef noodles, the hot and sour soup, and the double cooked pork with rice. I pretty much order this every time I go and its always delicious :)

I do want to mention that the quality has gone down over the years since the beef noodle soup base isn't as spicy. Regardless, the double cooked pork makes up for the spiciness and both are worth the try!
