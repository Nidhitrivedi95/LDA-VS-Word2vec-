GVTL5nxjlhzdXJMy4-4HBA So excited I found this place. Fast and hot delivery! For $40, including delivery charge (not including tip though), I got the pepper steak combo, the teriyaki chicken combo, house fried rice, chicken pad thai, BBQ spare ribs, and a pint of both teriyaki sauce and pepper steak sauce! The pepper steak was amazing! The teriyaki was great! Their fried rice is awesome! Some of the best I've had. Egg rolls are like every other place. Ribs were decent with a noticeable amount of meat on them. It was the pad thai that was disappointing though. It was in a tomato-type sauce and the noodles were over done. Asked for extra extra spicy, but noticed none. The rest of the food more than made up for it though!
