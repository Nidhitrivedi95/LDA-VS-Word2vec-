B2UK8R5y-nSyTrCpzn_VFA I have been coming here since my parents brought me as a baby.  Best Crab Rangoon I've had - more real crab meat than any other place I've tried.
All the food is similar to what you'll get at other Chinese/Asian places but the quality is a big step up from those other places.
