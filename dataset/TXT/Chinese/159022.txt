u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ We are in town for a visit and came here for lunch yesterday because it was highly recommended by a friend. I've eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants so I am used to ok service. However, the waitress that waited on us at this restaurant tops the list for the worst service ever. It was ok when we first walked in at 2:45.  The restaurant was not busy at all and we were greeted promptly by a waiter who seated us.  Then it started going downhill.  First, the waiter brought us the dinner menu instead of the lunch special menu. So I asked the waiter if the lunch specials were still available.  He initially replied no but changed his mind and brought us the lunch menu a minute later and said we had to order by 3.  We decided what to order in a few minutes but the  waiter was no where to be seen by then. We waited patiently and finally a waitress emerged from the kitchen and we waved her down to take our order.  She was very cold and unwelcoming and never once smiled at us during the rest of our meal. She seemed to be angry when she was taking our orders so I thought she had a bad day.  However, she seemed to be in a good mood when she was chatting and giggling away at the table next to us with another employee the rest of our meal. Needless to say, our ice waters were never refilled and empty plates were not cleared away as we finished them and she never came over to see if we needed anything else. She seemed more interested in chatting with her coworker than waiting on us.  The food on the other side was pretty good and that's the reason I am giving them 2 stars.  It was better than the 2 other Chinese restaurants we've tried the previously 2 nights. Personally, I would not come back here again.
