AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw I ordered some takeout and was overcharged.  Instead of being credited, I was charged for the same item again, something that I did not realize until I checked the receipt later.  I ended up overpaying by $15. The takeout area was dark and no one was there for 10 minutes - I had to go to the kitchen door to get help.  That should have been a big clue as to the service.  

If the food had been even average, that would have made it better.  However, the food was horrible. Wonton soup ($7 for less than a pint) overloaded with iceberg lettuce and 2 mushrooms. Over cooked wontons that disintegrated and must have been cooking all day.  Hard and inedible rice.  Over cooked vegetables.  Truly a "kitchen nightmare."
Bad food, bad service, and overcharged.
