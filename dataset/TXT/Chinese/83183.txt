hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Freshly made noodles and soup dumplings - all are so so good. 

My favorites are the beef noodle soup, oxtail noodle soup, and dan dan noodles. We usually get some with wide noodles, some with thin noodles. 

The soup dumplings are great too - my favorite is the shrimp and pork. I haven't made it out on a Sunday yet to try the sponge gourd/loofah and shrimp (only available Sundays), which is my favorite at Din Tai Fung. 

Pork Belly Slider (gua bao) is good too - it's huge, so you can share it. 

Bubble tea is good - they have a more fragrant milk tea here. 

Busy busy busy! But if you're willing to share a table, you can get one faster.
