rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g Love the Chinese food here. I can honestly say when I think of having Chinese they are one of the first places I think of. Love the Sesame Chicken and Chicken Broccoli. Their egg rolls are some of the best egg rolls I've ever had. Good place to eat and also, a good place to get a delivery from. Oh yeah, their dumplings are amazing as well! Will continue to be a customer here!
