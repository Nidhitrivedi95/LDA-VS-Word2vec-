We ordered the String Beans w/ Braised Pork Chow Mein, Sliced Pork and Mushroom, and Chicken Mushroom Pancake. I enjoyed the flavor of the String Beans w/ Braised Pork. However, it was a bit oily and had too much fat on the pork for my taste. Same went for the Pork and Mushroom. The winner of the night went to the Chicken and Mushroom Pancake. That was tasty and I would order that again!
