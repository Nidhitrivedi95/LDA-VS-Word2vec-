GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g Stopped in for dinner before Love.

First off, the prices are pretty high. But it's in a row of "high class" dining (Samba, Stack, Japonais, etc.) so I can't really expect them not to keep in line with the local pricing.

The staff can be quite "hovery" one moment, and then "disappeary"

I ordered the "Dinner and a Show" package which is $49 dollars and you can pick from a soup (well your pick is always Egg Drop because that's the only soup), appetizer, entree, and dessert.  I had the Pot Stickers, which were really good (and probably the highlight of the meal).  The Sweet and Sour Pork was good, but nothing exceptional.  The Dessert was Vanilla Brulee which was quite good with the added fruit.

The Ambiance is nice, but a bit dark, and it IS hard to forget that there is a casino right outside.

Overall I would say the price really is the biggest drawback. Between myself and my wife I spent more than I would for a dinner at The Melting Pot (Granted, this is more food for sure).  Since it was planned as our "Expensive Dinner" before the show I knew what I was getting into, but I would never just "Stop in" here for a meal.
