I was really craving Sushi on the day we arrived in Vegas, the weather was amazing as usual, and I just needed something good. We hadn't tried Sushi Samba yet, so we made a reservation and added in that we were celebrating our Wedding anniversary.

I got the spicy Tempura Rock Shrimp, which was good but portion size should have been nearly double what we received, since it cost almost $20 (for an appetizer) I mean it was a lot of lettuce and greens, not much shrimp.

Next we got 2 yellowtail Taquitos and my husband ordered Robata - chicken and Berkshire Pork Belly - and the waiter tried convincing us we needed the filet mignon and duck breast instead - which were "better" - (he actually meant they were more expensive) and we did not want them. Not a fan of duck breast, my husband once again specified Chicken and Pork. The Peruvian Corn that comes with the Robata was outstanding - delicious! That corn may have been the first highlight of our meal.

We ordered a couple of sushi rolls and they were good - just not memorable. I just wanted a "WOW" experience and it never happened.

I am a fan of Japanese Whisky, but I never got any - I ordered some cucumber and gin cocktail instead which did not taste good at all - I regretted it at $15 per drink. They brought out 2 glasses of complimentary champagne for our anniversary, which was more palatable than my cocktail. That was the 2nd highlight of our meal. Overall, we spent $150 on food that was fun and cute, but did not satisfy. But...when in Vegas, I guess. I've eaten better for a quarter of that price. I was full for about an hour, and then started getting hungry again. 

Those Butterfly-shaped gummy candies in the treat box in our room at Encore started to look appetizing...
