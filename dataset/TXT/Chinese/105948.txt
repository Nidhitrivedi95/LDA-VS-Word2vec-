ky5L-EfUwU9chSPcIeXM5w First and last time I get food from here. I ordered the chicken fried rice and it was horrible, lots of undercooked peas and carrots and no egg or bean sprouts. Very little chicken as well. I find it very difficult to find good fried rice in town, being from the Midwest spoiled me as it was so good anywhere you'd buy it from.
