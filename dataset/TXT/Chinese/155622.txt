Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w I was in town for Eater and my mom said she made a reservation here.  First of all I'm leery of Pan-Asian restaurants, and In Cleveland?!

But this place was fantastic.  My son and I split the chicken satay and I have to say it was the best I've ever had (even in Thailand).  It was perfect in every way.  

Next I had the shrimp & scallops in black bean sauce hot plate, which comes to the table sizzling.  It said it was spicy, but it was not too spicy but was very tasty.  I also had the snow pea pod shoots with garlic which was great as well.  Everyone in my family enjoyed their dishes.

The manager/owner? dropped by our table a couple of time.  He's from Canton (China, not Ohio) and is quite funny and personable

All in all a great find!
