X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg HAKKASAN.. thank you for the moat amazing night of my lifeeee! :D hahha went during their opening weekend when Bingo Players was spinning! Literally, one of my favorite nights of my life! The venue is gorgeous and huuuuge! They definitely need more seating areas! But can't complain when you just want to dance the night away because the music is on point! Their residencies are the best out of all the nightclubs! I highly recommend Hakkasan over all the other Vegas clubs!
