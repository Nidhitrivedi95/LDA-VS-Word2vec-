3PsmvwxetLz1Tzb-6mNhgA I agree with some of my other Yelpers, that I have a love/hate relationship with PF Changs. (On one hand, its a great, classy atmosphere, good for groups or even a date night. The food is good but the menu does change. So I struggle with chains at time, because the reason why I go to chains is because the food is dependable. Since it changes so much, sometimes I have something I love and then next time I go, its gone :(  You do need reservations by the way.) I do feel like the service is slow almost every time I come, servers forget to bring something I ask for, but that is most likely because it is so busy.
