Sometimes i walk in with my youngest kid, 3 years old, and they got a little toy cart he can push around.  When he tries to head back into the kitchen, they chuckle at him.  I can attest to fine egg rolls, Mongolian Beef, yui-shan spicy pork, orange chicken (spicy!), moo shu pork.  Since we moved to Chandler 13 months ago, i have not bothered to try another go-to Chinese place.  Now I am frakking hungry
