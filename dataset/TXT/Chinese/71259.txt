FbMZ0N5iAicep5ssYLZB9w Like many have stated, Chen's serves Americanized Chinese food. That isn't to suggest that it isn't good. In fact, it quite good. We were promptly seated and given menus. 

The establishment is well kept and not too noisy. Friendly service of the mom and pop shop gives the place a comfortable feel. Appetizer soups came out only a minute after ordering, and by the time we finished our cups of soup, our HOT meals were on the table!

The pan fried noodles were a little on the salty side, but tasted really good. The beef with snow peas was really good, especially after adding some chili sauce (which I asked for separately). Portion sizes definitely worth the money, and it's relatively inexpensive anyways. 

I would eat here over Panda Express any day! Better taste, waiter service, quieter and the personal touch of the owners running their business. Thank you!
