ajkx7NWnjraj_uz20mdbhQ Yes, a comparable alternative to the legendary Beijing spot next door, very good traditional dishes and fast service. Open later than Beijing which is how we stumbled on this gem. Staff is super chill and helpful with suggestions. One dish we tried once was breaded shrimp smothered in a creamy mayo type sauce that was a bit heavy but very delicious.
