-oOKqZbYDt08zaWWyLZNIw The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the place was clean and the waitress was friendly.

I had a craving for fried rice so I ordered BBQ Pork Fried Rice, with a small order of Beef & Broccoli. The food wasn't good at all. Both the beef and pork had a weird texture and flavor to it. I picked out the pork and tried eating just the rice, which it tasted burnt, even when I put Sriracha. So I just trashed them both. 

The portions were really big, but they were definitely not worth the price. In this case the saying quality over quantity does not apply. I will not be going back.
