eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ I've been meaning to try this place for a long time, but finally got around to doing so today with my son.  I was surprised that they offered their lunch specials on a weekend, as many places do not.  So, that was a plus.
  We were greeted as soon as we walked in by a very friendly waitress.   She asked if we had ever been there before, and when we said "no" she gave us a short summary of the menu.  That was nice.
  The lunch specials included choice of white or fried rice, soup, and eggroll.  I ordered the red curry chicken.... spicy level 5 (medium).   The food arrived quickly and was nicely presented.  We were a little surprised that the portions were rather small, though.  But most importantly it was delicious!  It was enough to fill us up, but other Thai/Chinese restaurants have given us more.
  It's not a fancy place, but prices are reasonable, service was great, and the food tasted yummy.  We'll be back.
