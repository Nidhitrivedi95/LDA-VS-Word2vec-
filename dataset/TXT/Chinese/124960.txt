oVtnnGat2Wco0ksQT1cGCA Was very surprised today with Heart Sushi.  Usually everything is on point however food and service was of poor quality. Seriously would it hurt to crack a smile or be polite.  I can understand it's not An easy job but when you got nice customers don't take your frustrations out on us. Food was pretty bad tonight not the usual quality.
