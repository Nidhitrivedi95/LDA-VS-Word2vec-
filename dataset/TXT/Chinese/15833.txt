The seating was bad too they say us in the back room and it's just awful for anyone who's claustrophobic. There's way too many tables in there and they're too close together. They pretty much stuffed everyone back there even though there was plenty of room up front. 
The service was pretty good though and as full as the place was I never saw them run out of food as soon as it was getting a bit low a new tray would come out.
