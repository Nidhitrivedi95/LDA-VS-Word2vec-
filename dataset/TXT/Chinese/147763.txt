sDQDMrb5xez4aASZ8U5qTg I love this place!!  I come to have their "tofu fa" multiple times whenever I visit Toronto.  One I like the most is the black sticky rice, it's good hot or cold.  I do have to say that all their tofu fa are good, not just the one I had!!

Their other food (like friend noodles) are only so so.  I could have better elsewhere.  Just go for the tofu fa here!!
