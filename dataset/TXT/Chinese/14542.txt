3fw2X5bZYeW9xCz_zGhOHg I can understand the difference in reviews on yelp cause to be honest there's definitely an inconsistency in service and food here. At times it is the best place to be and others it is just not even close. I usually order the hot pot rice which is pretty amazing but there was one or two days that the chicken was just not as fresh as I remembered and depending on what you order the desert can be lacklustre. My favourite is the pomelo fruit with mango sago, it is just Heaven!  Can't understand why there's such a huge difference some days but I definitely will come back and hope that the kitchen is having a good day.
