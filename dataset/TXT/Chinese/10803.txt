21lt9KBnxcKtQagmImBOpg I was in the area today for a meeting, and when lunch time came upon us, we found Tang's and decided to give it a try.  I was expecting a typical greasy, Chinese experience, but what I got was so much better.

Tang's is much like a Pei Wei, you choose the dish that you want, the type of protein, the type of rice and it is all done at the counter.

The inside is sleek and very clean, and they have one TV hanging on the wall that was tuned into Sportscenter (bonus points there).  Our food was out in a flash, and it looked divine.

My dining companion got the Chinese Chicken salad and said it was the best one she had every had.  They used a combination of different leafy lettuces, including spinach, so it felt very hearty.  It was  lightly dressed with an Asian vinaigrette and some fried won ton chips.

I opted for the orange chicken with brown rice, and I was happy to find that they don't up-charge you for brown rice like many places do.  My dish had chicken, carrots and snow peas all in a sweet & spicy orange sauce, it was excellent.  The best part was that instead of giant chunks of chicken, the chicken was cut into thin slices, making it easier to eat.  The brown rice was cooked perfectly, and was very fluffy.

We both commented as to how much we really liked Tang's, and if I am in the area around a mealtime again, I would surely go back.

As for the complaints about pricing I have seen on here, the prices are no different than Pei Wei and maybe even a bit less. (P.S. Pei Wei doesn't have "lunch specials" either)  The portions were quite large, neither of us could even finish, and the quality made it worth it.  My meal was only $8.01 including tax, and I am going to get a second meal out of it!
