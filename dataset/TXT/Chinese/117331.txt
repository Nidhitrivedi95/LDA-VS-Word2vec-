ndq4rJcFLMbMGU_gK5u79Q Thank you Doubletree hotel for this great recommendation :(    The only good part is that they delivered in under 30 minutes.  It is located across from Fridays at the Consol arena.  

Wonton soup had undercooked noodles.  Cream Cheese puffs were just bad!  Pork Fried rice was lightly brown in color and didn't have much flavor.  The pork ribs were OK and the happy family main dish was a ripoff.  There were no Scallops or Lobster meat.  There were a few giant shrimp and much sliced pork.  The beef and chicken were of very poor quality.  It did come with broccoli and carrots.  The sauce was very  bland.  

Unfortunately there was only 1 prior review on Yelp.  Mine makes 2.  Prices were very reasonable and now I can see why.
