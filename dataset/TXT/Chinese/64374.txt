e88NPlmWRJiNgfblLfQvWQ Definitely worth many return visits. There are just too many good things to choose from, and even with small portions from each tray I had to skip several dishes because I had gotten too full from all the tasty stuff I've taken. The place is huge and very clean,  there's a staggering array of food choices, and the staff is very efficient and friendly. There's a separate area for Korean/Mongolian BBQ which offers grilled fresh sardines (love it!!) in addition to the expected bulgogi and grilled chops and chicken, as well as fresh ingredients for you to assemble and hand in for cooking, Mongolian BBQ style.  They also have a centrally-located area for sushi (good sushi - for a buffet, that scores major points) and edamame, and the main buffet area also offers crispy veggie tempura to complement your sushi if you feel like giving your meal a Japanese slant. I enjoyed the seafood dishes a lot, especially the poached fish dishes and the clams.  Of course they also have the usual buffet staples such as coconut shrimp and beef 'n broccoli, all very well made. For dessert, lots of fruit as well as the expected buffet dessert cakes and puddings. Thanks, Rand, for introducing me to this great dining spot. A place that can make me enjoy even things I usually don't like - such as hot and sour soup - is an awesome place indeed.
