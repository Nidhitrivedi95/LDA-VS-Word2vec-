W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g Ive only been here once. I decided to try it out because of all the good reviews. The appetizers and food were delicious! Definitely 5 stars. The waitresses were friendly and provided good service. The place is easy to miss and I have driven by it so many times and never stopped because it doesn't look all that appealing on the outside...it's very plain.  But, the food is so worth it. Will definitely be back often!
