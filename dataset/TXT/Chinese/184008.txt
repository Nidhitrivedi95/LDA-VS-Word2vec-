XUDOc980cjB0PZvVS-T6Eg Came here for sushi, I would have to say its the worst sushi place I have ever been too. Service wasnt great at all. This place is very over priced. They charged me 44 dollars for sake, Which I thought was the most I have ever spend on 250ml of sake. I would never go back to this place. I would never recommend this place to anyone!!!!
