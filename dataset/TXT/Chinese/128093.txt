PEulzjDwcSL_ujv5mRbc4w This is the best Chinese food around! Family owned with a comfortable atmosphere. Johnathan is such a star waiter, very friendly and helpful, very attentive to our needs. He recommended the orange peel beef which was delicious. We also liked the crab wontons, vegetable fried rice, and walnut shrimp. The Thai tea was the perfect amount of sweet, too. Definitely check this place out!
