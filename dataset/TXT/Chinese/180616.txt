X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Had the best time here! Didn't have to wait in line since our promoter walked us in. It's a multi level club so they have elevators to take you up and down. You aren't able to gain entrance freely among all the different rooms for some reason. We couldn't get into the hiphop room where our other group was. It was confusing. The club had a lot of VIP tables on the 2nd floor (?) and some guys invited us to their table. They played great music all night and dancing on the booth tables are always fun. Bathrooms were clean and easily located.
