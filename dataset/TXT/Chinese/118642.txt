First off, it's pretty clean compared to a lot of the dumpling places in Chinatown, but that's probably because it opened not too long ago. I quite like the TV on the wall behind the bar that's playing what seems like "The Taste of China," which I find complimentary to the food. 

In terms of dumplings, I can't really tell whether the dumpling skins are handmade based on the texture. Nonetheless, I found the dumplings to be quite average. They're served in four different ways: boiled, steamed, soup, and fried (extra $$ for the fried ones from what I remember). The soup dumplings are served in chicken broth, which I find light and warming on a cold day. Paired with a pot of jasmine tea, it's not so bad for a quick hearty dinner.

Overall not a bad choice if you want dumplings in the plateau.
