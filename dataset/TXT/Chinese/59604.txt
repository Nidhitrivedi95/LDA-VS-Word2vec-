dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw Mind you I'm not Asian and have never been to Asia, BUT, I can say this is the best Asian "sandwich" (bao, bahn mi, or otherwise) I've ever eaten!!! I'm concerned long term that word will get out and the scant 4 chairs available will always be full. Mind you, I love these little baos enough to eat them at my desk, or in my car... but I just don't see this place as having enough space to serve the demand that this place deserves ! For now, the space works, but once word gets out, I worry. 

I tried the 3 baos + drink for $10 combo. Tax is included and he has a nice variety of drinks to choose from. I felt the price/value was reasonable. I had a delightful mango passionfruit (?) iced tea with my beef bao, duck bao, and pork belly bao. 

I hate to rank them, because all 3 baos were incredible and I'd order that exact same order again and again. Each was served on a perfect bun brought in from his favorite bakery in LA.  If I had to choose a favorite - it would be the duck! The duck had a lovely consistency and he served it with 3 tiny pieces of crispy skin on top. YUM. The beef and pork belly were also amazing.  If I had to offer any criticism at all, it would be I'd prefer the pork belly a tad more crisp, but that's just my personal preference. 

The chef/owner has got serious credentials, and he puts a lot of love into these little baos. Luckily I work nearby so this will become a regular indulgence for me !
