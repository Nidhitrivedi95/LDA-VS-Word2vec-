oZfNL6ZFdITqfwJzcE-LyA Impressive!  I'm deducting a star, because the place is not a very comfortable dining experience and I think they needed more help.  

The food was five star.  Dad ordered the almond chicken. I ordered the szechuan chicken and an order of mixed vegetables (which I didn't need because both chicken dishes came with a healthy portion of veggies).  But, everything was really, really good (for the super-cheap price).  The food was hot and prepared quickly.  

The place got busy quickly after we got our food.  They did seem understaffed, so I'm not sure how they typically run this place.  Next time, I will order takeout and call before.  Definitely a keeper!!
