UslSiDSUTCaq62FMpWK6Lw What a damn discrase I tell you, I just wanted to order it simple sweet and sour chicken and a side Of veggie fried rice. Well guess what this place doesn't serve sweet and sour chicken. What the hell kinda Chinese place doesn't serve sweet and sour chicken.The chicken was chewy and the rice was like eating dried up horse shit. The egg role was the only DECENT thing about the damn place. Even the service was bad the person you can't damn well understand and she doesn't even take time to get the damn order right. Oh and the meals are over priced for shit. And to top it all off the damn soda was dis flavored. I wish you dint even have to leave a star in the rating because this place doesn't deserve one. I have read other reviews on this place and I have heard other terrible things . And it also made my stomachs hurt. "PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE!!!
