kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA I had dinner here before david copperfield. First impression is that I liked the ambiance. The service was 5 star. The food portions were fairly stingy and very expensive. I would rate the food a 7 out of 10. Nothing special. The bill was 240.00 for two people and we don't drink. we had soft drinks. so thats one appetizer,two entrees and fried rice and two desserts for 240??? I would say that speaks for itself. I think the portions could be bigger I also found the menu a bit on the limited side. But its all part of eating on the strip.
