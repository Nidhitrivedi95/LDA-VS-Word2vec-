VxwcmqZ56tzPr7ZbLxlhTw Hubby and I love this place.  We've had Chinese food all over the country, including Chinatown in San Francisco, and we think the food here is just great.  The sauces are so delicious, the veggies are crisp, they put a ton of shrimp in their dishes, and the meats are good quality (some buffets have really fatty, tough meat).  If you want the buffet, you need to be here between 11:30 and 1:30 when dishes are hot and fresh. They have additional dishes at the dinner buffet, but we think lunch is the best deal.  Hope this place never changes.
