rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g I was in the mood for some Dim Sum this past weekend and supposedly this was the best option for Dim Sum in the Phoenix area so I had to check it out for myself. It was fairly crowded when I got there but I was still able to get a table quickly. I did notice a lot of Asian families dining in near my table which is probably a good sign. As for the Dim Sum I decided on getting the Har Gow, Shu Mai, and the sticky rice. Out of the three that I tried the sticky rice was my favorite, although even then I have had much better elsewhere. The Har Gow was just okay I thought and the Shu Mai was not very good, would probably pass on getting that next time.

Overall I would say that Phoenix Palace is an okay spot to get Dim Sum but mainly because there are not too many other options in the area. I did notice that they do takeout for Dim Sum which could be a good idea when I stop by in the area next time. The service here I would say is typical of other Dim Sum restaurants, although I would add that I did feel a bit rushed when dining in.
