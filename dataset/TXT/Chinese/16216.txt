410NJLoLryd-vYNwRA58pw We ordered pork dumplings and they had shrimp with no indication on the menu that there was seafood in the dish. Apparently most dishes have shrimp in them even if the menu does not mention it. Very dangerous if you are allergic. How hard is it to put a symbol beside all the dishes that have seafood in it?

When we were served the spare ribs, they were half fat and grey looking. Not appetizing at all. The waitress made us pay for it even though we did not eat it and they were far below acceptable standards. She even admitted that they were not quality controlled by the kitchen. All she did was give us excuses. 

If you're not Asian, you will not receive great service. They will give you the bare minimum. They will not care about you. We were the only non-Asians in the room and the quality of our food looked way worse than the tables near us. 

I will never return to this place. Not even for a free meal.
