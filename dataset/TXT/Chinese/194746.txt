zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I stopped by for a quick dinner late on a Thursday evening. I didn't know what to expect - I just knew I had been dying to check it out and tonight was the night. I typically hit up restaurants alone (we can talk about how depressing that is later) but a good restaurant never makes me feel weird about that. Noodle Bar was a brilliant example. They sat me on the bar in front of the open kitchen, and they were friendly, attentive and fun. I ordered the pork buns and the cold spicy noodles. The food comes out fast, hot, and (since I watched it being made) fresh. I have a weird relationship with pork belly, usually finding the layer of fat to be too overwhelming. The pork on the pork bun was so evenly balanced that the fat just melted into the tender meat. A touch of sirracha on the side adds the perfect heat to the sweetness of the steamed bun. And I can't say enough about the damned bun. Damn that bun. That was a damned good bun. 

My noodles were chewy and the right temperature (cold!) but the real winner in that dish are the cashews. Sweet and roasted, they balance the seschwan spiciness and add a desirable crunch. 

I popped upstairs to Milk to pick up dessert but I can't review it yet. I've got a cookie for my sister and a slice of crack pie for me. Just waiting to get home to eat it.
