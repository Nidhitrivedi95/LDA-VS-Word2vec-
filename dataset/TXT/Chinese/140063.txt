R__NLOqjUlw8qf12KD-I5A Soft sweet buns. What can be more appetizing than a few of these buns in your hand? Ding dong makes it happen. Trays and trays of of an assortment of Chinese sweet buns more fillings than you can shake a stick at. For a Loonie, you get 3! Insane lunch idea? You bet. 3 is enough to get you semi full, 6 is a bit much but you can leave some as a snack for later.

My favorite are the ham, corn and mayo buns, the coconut pineapple buns and the hotdog buns.  Although small in portion, you get more than you pay for. Make sure to bring cash money. They don't take debit or credit at this bun factory.
