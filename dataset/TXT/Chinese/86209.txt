So one day I was looking through Yelp and stumbled upon this place of super good reviews and thought, why haven't I heard of this place before?! I absolutely love and sort of Asian fusion so I got super excited as I read through the reviews and looked at the photos - I bookmarked it right away and told my bf we were coming here for dinner! 

We followed the directions and winded up at such a random location - Eureka Casino  (a stand alone casino in a not so great part of town) hahahah. But we were like we gotta see what this hype is about!!! So we went into this small casino and there it was, Fay Choy. It looked like an old, diner-style restaurant with old school diner booths. Interesting ambiance to say the least. Anyway, the waitress handed us menus and we could decide what to get cos there was so much I wanted to try. We ended up getting an order of the Pork Belly Bao (YUM) ugh so nommy. The bao was perfectly made. Some restaurants mess up and make the bao a little too dry, or flaky, but here it was perfect! We also got the Braised Short Rib Grilled Cheese..... Omg my love for grilled sandwiches got even stronger after this one!! I mean, I LOVE short rib and I LOVE grilled cheese so when I saw this as one thing I had to get it!! My boyfriend got the Fat Choy burger, this was good too but not the bessst burger in town, still good tho! Our experience was great, service was awesome. Definitely will be coming back to try more!! 

Don't be intimidated by its location!
