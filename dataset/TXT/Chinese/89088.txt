i55cm4i5C7fSCVONIQ8DRg I walked in about to give this place a try because trying new Chinese food restaurants makes me nervous. As I was about to order there was a little girl behind the register who didn't speak. I said hi to her and she still didn't say anything but looked as if she was about to take my order. I believe if you put your children to work then they should be taught properly how to interact with customers. I ended walking out without ordering anything. Their loss.
