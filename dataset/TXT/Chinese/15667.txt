3qrfY-XCUKVyrO5T6GskqA I usually do not write reviews about food establishments. But my experience here has compelled me to share it with you guys. Here is my take:

1) The staff is extremely incompetent esp during the rush hour. You have 4 guys and 1 girl shouting at each other over the counter. Honestly, having lived in 4 continents and 11 countries, I have never seen such incompetence,

2) During the rush our (11:30 to 1 pm), the food is often undercooked and is unnecessarily oily.

3) I ordered Pad thai to go (hoping for a quick bite), and after waiting for 55 minutes my food did not arrive. When I approached them again, they did not have my order in their system!! I kept my calm, and asked them to cancel my order. It took 3 guys, and over 15 minutes to figure out the refunds!

so a word of advice? RUN!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!
