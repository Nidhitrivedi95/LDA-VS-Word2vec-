X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Best birthday ever, came here for my 21st to see Tiesto and I couldn't have spent it another way. My girlfriend and I had a blast. Only downside is it's always packed, literally like a can of sardines. People bumping into you at all times. Tip, get table service. Totally worth it.
