9BBWtaSvsootDkKTVBgv_A A couple months back, I took a co-worker to Jasmine Buffet and he knew one of the Asian females at the register. I was just gonna wait around until I decided to go look at the sushi. As I walked away, I heard some laughing but didn't think anything of it. When we left, my co-worker stated the female stated "I bet he makes his way to the watermelon!" As an educated, professional black male, I found this offensive and degrading.  I have tried to hold it, but every time I see the co-worker...it makes me angry he thought it was funny and condoned the comment. I am at a point now, where I wonder what other comments or actions are being taken against folks her! The staff here needs some cultural diversity, because I guess she forgot she is a minority too!
