UHVeLqYpNLJp5mw_vnQnRQ My family went here to eat but the food so so salty.  My husband ordered the food on the menu chicken dish( it comes with fried chicken thigh, two side vegetables and one whole boil egg). However, they bring out the dish just a drumstick chicken with two small side vegetables and there's not the egg. My mistake came to this place to eat for our vacation.
