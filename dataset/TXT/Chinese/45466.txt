bRy4yyU0XXcOJRX5tGQ_dg When I moved to North Ridgeville about a year and a half ago, I wasn't sure of where to order good Chinese food from. I saw an ad in the mail about Little Hong Kong and decided to try it out. Needless to say, I haven't had any other Chinese in the area because this is so good. Always fast service, even if you order there and wait.
