Arrived at the restaurant and was greeted by a server. Waiting for our table to be ready. 

After a couple a minutes, we were seated. Our server set up our plates, chop sticks etc. very quickly. We ordered our food and the server was attentive. The house daily soup came quickly. The soup was bland and was not seasoned.

The steamed chicken came minutes after that. The chicken and the ginger and onion sauce were average. Ordered two bowls of rice and came quickly. The rice is mushy and did not taste fresh. The bolay tea tasted okay.

The sweet and sour pork tasted crispy and fresh. The xo chives were spicy and was full of flavor. The beer tasted even better with a refreshing taste.

The spicy beef and broccoli tasted good and had a good 'wok hei'. The dish goes well with rice.

The décor is average but is welcoming and matches the cuisine of the restaurant. The service is average and is sometimes attentive.

Bayview Garden is a restaurant that had high expectations before my visit. Unfortunately, it did not impress me but has the potential to become an excellent restaurant. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone who is looking for dinner to eat.
