HAqFrpN8ukzFZuSgTvLijw Went with the guys from the office to Faley, their regular place, and found it to be pretty bad. Fried rice is a favorite of mine and there were things in it that were unidentifiable. Probably nothing that didn't belong there, but if it doesn't look like anything I've ever seen, then what the heck is it???

The taste wasn't that good. There was something about it that seemed "off." And then the unidentified food objects! No thanks.
