Rvj6ryvV1Wf-27UT75soMA I'm not going to sit here and tell you that this is the best place for Chinese food. I will however say that for what it is it's pretty good. They are very clean inside and super attentive to their customers. The food quality is good and if you've ever ordered to your home you know that they get stuff right and it doesn't take long for your food to get to you. I enjoy this place and it is good for this side of town.
