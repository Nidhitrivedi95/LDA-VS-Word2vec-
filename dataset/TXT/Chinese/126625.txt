p2RqycIW2jzjbQnkEw5lkA This place has gone seriously downhill! Haven't visited in awhile (opting for the drive thru pickup). Went in today for first time since winter and it was filthy. Bathroom was dirty and every surface in the restaurant was covered in smudgy handprints, easily visible in the low evening light - doors, Coke machine, condiments bar, door to the kitchen, etc. The A/C also seemed to be barely working on one of the hottest and most humid days of the year, so it was stuffy, sticky, and humid. Food was pretty normal Noodles but I don't ever want to eat in there again. Really disgusting and sad - used to be a great quick option with 2 little kids.
