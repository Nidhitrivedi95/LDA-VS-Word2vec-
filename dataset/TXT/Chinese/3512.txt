_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA I don't know how they can substantiate their absorbent pricing for their Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup but I certainly fell for their ploy. Considering I am already on the strip, I didn't want to venture to Spring Mountain Road for noodles so this was literally the closest restaurant. The beef noodle soup was decent, but at $14 before tax is a complete rip off.

It looks like they have a good variety of Asian food, but in order to satisfy your cravings, you would have to pay a premium to indulge.
