KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ My family and I have been going here for years, but I felt it necessary to review now. Some of the people working there have been working there for years, and I couldn't love them more. Now, food time! If you ever want a mouthblowing flavor mix, try getting the szchecuan anything and an order or orange chicken. The two sauces are like an amazing double dose of awesome in your mouth hole.

I always get an order of egg drop soup when I go. It's a small cup, but it's a perfectly sized appetizer.

Beef and broccoli is solid, egg rolls are on point and every meal so far has been great in it's own way. If you are ever around here, you won't be let down.
