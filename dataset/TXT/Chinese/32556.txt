a0Jm-rlHOKk_1fm4hzxskg I will first give the caveat that we went on Valentines Day for our first visit to this restaurant.  There was an hour long wait, which, though we were not thrilled with, we took to be a good sign.  That said - We were somewhat disappointed with this restaurant. The décor is interesting but a bit dated.  The food was simply not up to the prices that are being charged.  The Moo Shu pork was pretty bland with only 4 wrappers and two tablespoons of plum sauce.  The dumplings were decent but a bit overcooked.  The hot & sour soup tasted like a mix though it had plenty of mushrooms and chicken. The jasmine tea didn't taste like anything resembling jasmine.  In fact, we asked the waitress if they had made a mistake and she said that they only had jasmine tea - no other choice.  On a $50 meal for 2 people I was just looking for better quality.  Could it have been an off night because of the volume of people - possibly.  Still, there are much better Chinese restaurants for the money in Charlotte.
