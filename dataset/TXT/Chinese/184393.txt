xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A This is a noodle bar place - not a Chinese restaurant. At times the kitchen can get backed up - especially late at night. Some of the staff does not speak English very well - but I don't speak Chinese either so fair enough.

Meals are fresh cooked - always hot and good. Spice is adjusted for the american palette - but ask and they will spice it up!!!

I am a regular fan of LuLu's Pan Fried Noodles with Pork - hot oil on the side. Egg roll and Hot n' Sour Soup. Friend really likes there seaweed salad. Wife is a regular consumer of Crab Rangoon and Udon soup with fish balls (pasty, dough/fish concoction).

At lunch - order at the counter, pay, get a table and wait... Evenings - sit down with waitress - can be very busy at times - big student population.

Go and enjoy - just have a leisurely visit with someone special. 

Largest obstacle - street parking is hard to find...
