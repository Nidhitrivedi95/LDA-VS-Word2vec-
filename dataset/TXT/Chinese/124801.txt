ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ Overall, too pricey for what you get and that's hit or miss dim sum with mediocre portions but quality ingredients. Very ncie atmosphere though. Food breakdown below:

Good:

The jumbo size sticky rice. It wasn't really that jumbo but it was still good.

Har gow- lots of shrimp goodness

Shrimp rice roll- lots of shrimp and some spinach as well. Pretty good.

Okay:

BBQ Pork rice roll- Meh. Typical.

Beef balls- Typical.

Shrimp and scallop dumpling. Quality ingredients but bland taste.

Avoid:

Chrysanthemum and Lychee jelly - too sweet and lacking qualtiy ingredients. Yuck.

Chicken congee- I feel as if they prepared it in a blender. I'm not sure who their target audience but it's surely not people looking for authentic chinese.

Vegetable and pork chiu chow dumpling- just didn't taste like anything special. Typical fair. Love it or hate it kind of food.
