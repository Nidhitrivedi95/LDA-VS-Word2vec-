X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Great time seeing my favorites GTA at Hakkasan and huge thank you to our Promoter, Jonathan! We were able to enjoy the night dancing away and enjoyed a few complimentary drinks. The 'wait' time was non-existent, since we were escorted in. 

This club's layout is a lot different than the clubs in Las Vegas. It has levels which is interesting. Overall I really like this place. The crowd was a bunch of convention nerds which was a great one. It tends to get a little packed on the dance floor but we did go on a busy weekend. 

What Stay's in Vegas Tip: Go through Jonathan!
