6qkNhpgMYE6y3eHurFq6yw Previously spolied by the overabundance and competitive quality of central/uptown Toronto delivery restaurants, I am choosing to not compare.  Etobicoke sucks for deivery selection and quality. I probably wouldn't order if sharing with others whom I wanted to impress, but the quality and price is generally acceptable.  Not bad, but ok. To specify, the sauces are a bit thin, but I would (and have) ordered again. They have a 20$ delivery minimum, which is very good for the single person.  Review update:  a 2.5 inch long black hair (with the root still attached) was found in the last order of lemon chicken.
