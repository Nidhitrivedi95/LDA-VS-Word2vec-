We order our food. 
I go to the bathroom. Funny enough, it does not smell like bathroom deodorizer.
We had ordered one of the lunch specials. It came with a beverage. I chose coffee. They didn't ask what I wanted in it. It arrived with cream already in it. I told them I couldn't have cream. They insisted it wasn't cream (when you're allergic to it, you know it's cream), they brought it back black a few minutes later. No sugar. I gave up. 
We had the Hu Fun lunch special and the Cantonese Chow Mein (this is the dish I rate all Chinese restaurants with.) 
The Ho Fun with beef was very good, the Cantonese Chow Mein was average. 
Service overall was average, not fully attentive, but just enough to say it was good.
I don't think I'd have to return to the restaurant again. It is average, in this neighbourhood with so many other choices, I know I don't have this as an only option.
If you are wondering what happened to the bathroom deodorizer scent, it was faint by the end of the meal. However, I will always remember this as the "Bathroom deodorizer scented restaurant"
