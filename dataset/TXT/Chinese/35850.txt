aghOCY7m-I_8tNA9FnRcjg Like other reviews said. I'm confused. Where were the dim sum choices? Only shumai and shrimp ball. They should change their signage. Wasn't a fan of the shumai. The shrimp balls were really good I have to admit. 
Honestly I would have knocked this Place down to 2 stars but the other dishes were decent and my boyfriend liked it.  You can taste the food was fresh. Except for maybe the walnut shrimp.  Looked like it had been sitting there for a while. They make the entrees in smaller batches. They offer "organic" option for a higher price. I say pass and save your money get the traditional version.
