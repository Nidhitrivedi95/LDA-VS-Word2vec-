emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw I love Dim Sum and this place is super cheap. I hear the regular food is amazing. Sadly I haven't tried that. I will always come back here cause the food is cheap and good. I will miss this place. Service is not always the best. Sometimes you want the food cart to come around and it never comes to you...

But what can you expect from an authentic chinese place huh. lol
