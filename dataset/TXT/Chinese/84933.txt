HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw One of the worst chinese restaurants I've ever been to. I understand that the dish that I order isn't something that is usually on the menu at chinese restaurants but they should still know how to make it, everyone else has up until now. I asked them if they could make general tsos tofu and the lady at the register said yes. I was given a tray with tofu and general tsos sauce and white rice on the side. The dish didn't come with onions, broccoli or anything. It was just tofu, the sauce and rice. I asked for the sauce to be spicy and it wasn't and it didn't even have much of a taste to it and to make matters even worst I'm pretty sure there was little tiny pieces of chicken mixed in with the tofu. It had a different texture and taste from the tofu. I'm a vegetarian, I can't be eating chicken!! It was 10 bucks for one of the worst dishes I've ever had. The tofu was way too soft. I asked for fried tofu! Every other chinese spot makes the general tsos tofu crispy not super soft like this place did it. Horrible chinese food here. I'm from New York City and I know good chinese, stay away from this place!
