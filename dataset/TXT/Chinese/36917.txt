AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw A very odd atmosphere to be a Chinese restaurant.  The place was an entire bar, with a gothic/ rock vibe to it. Food was okay, considering the fact we had to send back a plate because the noodles were so hard and had a nasty taste.  Save your money and go out to an actual restaurant.
