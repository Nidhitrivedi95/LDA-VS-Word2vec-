mQCT1psNh2pJT38ohSQDHA Just visited the hibachi table for my moms birthday dinner. YUM. We were pleasantly surprised, the food was delish.  We were seated right away, out server was very attentive. She made sure we had drinks pretty quickly and got our orders taken. 
The show was fun as always. My food was cooked perfectly. I usually don't love the Miso soup but this one more flavorful and I loved it. Salad hit the spot, that ginger dressing was on point. I got the Filet, it was cooked medium and was super good! We all got the house noodles on our plate, what a nice treat. My kids devoured it... and shamefully so did I :) 
My kids split a meal and that was plenty. They even split the soup up in two bowls so they didn't have to share. I thought was really nice and made for an easier dinner time for us. 
We will be back, no doubt about it.
