6eUJ3BbrP7tsEKwYhMI4_Q Last night my wife asked me if I wanted anything when she was going out shopping, I said, "sure get me some egg foo young/" We'll she brought me home some of the worst egg foo young I have ever eaten anywhere from Yunan Wok. She has been begging me to stop there for weeks since she got a flyer in our house door. I checked it out on Yelp and it confirmed much of what I had already thought, too expensive and even worse the food reports were awful. 

We'll now I can concur. My egg foo young had to be premade frozen patties. They do not put the meat in the omelet mix, rather serve it with the sauce. I can say there was an ample portion of barbecue pork in my order but it could not make up for the awful patties. The texture was grainy. No sign of fresh bamboo shoots, bean sprouts or anything else that provided texture. My wife's chicken and broccoli was nothing to write home about either. We are used to getting a container of the main course with a separate container for rice. This was served in a typical to go lunch container, which in itself wouldn't be that bad, but the portion was small, and I mean small. 
My wife will not shop there again for sure.
