CIFjkjllhTPGyx9eWBwJGQ Love this place. Try the classic noodles, it won't disappoint. The menu is limited, but the taste is there.  
Traditional Chinese noodles, unlike anything I have tried, with generous portions.
The owner is often the one serving you and she is really friendly.
This is mainly a pick-up place, although there are a few seats at the counter.
If you go in the summer, it is not uncommon to see trust babies from Asia flaunting their Ferrari's and Lamborghinis.
