8FUzCm4Q13MJMX7N6ftmQw Ordered through eat24.com! The restaurant I wanted to order from for delivery was already closed, so we decided to switch it up and I'm glad we did! The minimum to order is low and so is the delivery fee. 
   We ordered two of the "individual dinners". For the price you get a lot more for your buck instead of ordering the entrees separately. We ordered a General Tso's Chicken with hot and sour soup, fried rice and (2) crab rangoons, then a Sweet and Sour Chicken with wonton soup, steamed rice and (2) vegetable eggrolls. Then an order of Honey Walnut Shrimp. 
   The delivery was right on time and the food was delicious and fresh. I was taken aback by the General Tso's chicken because my first bite I bit into a pepper! Hahaha, but it was very good. The Honey Walnut Shrimp, eggrolls and rangoons were still crispy. Although the rangoons had barely little filling. We asked specifically for utensils (chopsticks, forks and hopefully spoons because we ordered soup) but received none. We'd order from here again.
