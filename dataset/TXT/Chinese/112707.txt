mI2GqBeadATqOkLPhDNOfQ Sorry, there is no option for me to offer it a 1/2 star or else I would have, and here's why:
The owner cuts back on portions, for $7 plus tax, you at least expect to get a full box. I showed the owner/server how he had cut back by comparing 2 boxes he had fixed for the customers standing in line ahead of me. He just gave me an unapologetic look. I ordered the Mangolian chicken, there was more oil and less chicken on my plate. To add to this misery, on taking a closer look, I notice a strand of hair. This place is still surviving because of its location, it's right next to the Spectrum center and is located inside a busy bus stop, but if you have an option, please do yourself a favor and walk away. There are several other Chinese eat out spots just a few blocks away, or else good luck tasting human hair!!
