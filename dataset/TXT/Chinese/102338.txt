khxjYMwb_V8UovvwPVhysw Stopped for takeout today... service was fine, food was just OK, had teriyaki chicken that came with tons of veggies (not expected) and small portion of chix, watery non sweet sauce.  Lunch came with egg roll and wonton, both not so great, no mustard or sweet and sour came in the bag, asked for chili oil and got a large side of bland red colored oil and chili.  AS we were waiting asked for a cup of egg drop soup...she rang up $4.20, I nicely declined with holy cow.  She did apologize, I guess the solo egg drop is for two but she should have accomodated and sold me a single half price???  So, small portion lunch, barely ok flavor...its hard to mess up teriyaki chix, lunch takeout and large drink, 10 bucks.  Way too much cash for what I got...I am going back to Tao a mile north.
