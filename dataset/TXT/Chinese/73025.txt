fhYtFEVagrSKQu-t2gL66A This is a newly opened restaurant. We got a flyer in the mail so decided to check it out, to satisfy that North American Chinese craving.

Due to the discount on cash-pick-up orders, the place already had a decent stream of customers on a quiet Tuesday evening. 

The front clerk was friendly, speaks fluent English. The place is small but has a decent amount of seating for dine-in. Newly opened so it's a clean joint. The kitchen is openly visible from the counter, which is nice I guess if you like to see where you food comes from. 

Prices are decent for the portions you get, no complaints there. 

The food is spot on North American Chinese, with all your typical favourites. The textures, tastes, and looks are pretty much right on. It made me think these people are definitely not first-timers, and have probably worked at or owned other Chinese restaurants in the past. 

Chicken balls had flavourful chicken breast filling, though the dough was slightly on the chewy side. Sweet and sour sauce is moderate in strength, which I prefer but my wife did not.

Cantonese Chow Mien was excellent, nice crisp vegetables, squat yet slightly crispy noodles, abundant pieces of chicken, tender beef, and nice sized prawns! Was surprised not seeing small shrimp.

Stir fried vegetables were fresh, green and crisp, well done. 

We didn't feel overly thirsty afterwards, which is a good sign. 

We will be going back to try out their other offerings. This is a good local fix for some quick Chinese take-out.
