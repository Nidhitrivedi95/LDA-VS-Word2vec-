AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Had the spicy Cajun fish and the spicy beef. Liked the spicy beef better. Had cilantro salad again. Liked it but think it was a little on the salty side - maybe too much soya sauce this time. Still really like the sauce but like it a little lighter so it's healthier. I agree that some of the dishes can be more healthy - lots of people are liking the fried stuff. Will go back and get some other dishes next time I am in Vegas.
