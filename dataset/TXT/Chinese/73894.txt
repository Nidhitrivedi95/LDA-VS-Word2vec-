fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw I actually really liked this place! They have dinner combos so you can eat more than one thing and it doesn't cost you a million dollars if you're the only person eating. The pork was a little sweeter than I'm normally used to but it was cooked well. Plus their chow mein does t have bean sprouts and I hate them so I appreciate that so I can just go for the noodles! I got this for carry out and it was done in 10 min and was packaged very well. I'll go back again soon.
