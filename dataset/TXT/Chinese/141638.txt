rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g We've been back over the years. I still really like it. Service is top notch and ultra quick. Food is good. My Szechuan scallops and shrimp tonight (a new dish for me) were a bit on the sweet side and not spicy, but it is what it is. My GF doesn't really understand my allegiance to the place, but she doesn't have any suggestions for better Chinese in the area, so she's down with hitting it up. Also, the crab puffs actually taste like crab. I'm sure its imitation crab, but it's not all cream cheese! Her Hunan(?) pork was spicy and good, although they seemed to have forgotten or were out of mushrooms. We forgot to ask why there weren't any, although the menu indicated there should've been.

If you want decent ambiance, quiet booths, and quick table service (rather than standing in line to order). This is your ticket in the area. See my earlier review for much more detail. 4.5 stars for lack of mushroom without explanation.
