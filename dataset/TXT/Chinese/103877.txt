Kn57RIWAdnVfJHI1loLXOQ I went here on the reviews I read.  I've been to 3 or 4 Hakka Chinese around here, and this was hands down the best.  Everything was delicious, from the seafood hot and sour soup (never saw it in seafood), the fish pakoras, the crispy ginger chicken and the Bombay chicken.  Nice flavors, and they can tone down the spiciness.  Obviously a former Japanese restaurant, we sat in a little curtained off booth, of which there were several.  Great service.  Be warned, this is in a really dumpy (dumpier than usual for this area) strip mall, but once inside it doesn't matter.
