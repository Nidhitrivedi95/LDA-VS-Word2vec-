aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ I loved this place! While visiting toronto we stopped by for dinner at spring rolls and had a wonderful time.
Our waitress was very sweet and very quick! She was very prompt.
We ordered from the all you can eat menu, and ordered a bucket of beers to drink.
I found that the portions were perfect, just enough but not too much, and everything was wonderfully plated!
One dish that I need to rave about was the beef rib platter
it came with two large but thin beef ribs, kimchi, edemame and a lovely watermelon/mint salad. The ribs were perfectly cooked, and the salad was AMAZING! I gave my guy a small bite and kept the rest for myself! ;p
One item that I did not enjoy was the mango/cream cheese roll. The mango was not ripe and I found it very hard to eat, but I did because I didn't want to be wasteful.
For AYCE this should be a number 1 choice for you!
