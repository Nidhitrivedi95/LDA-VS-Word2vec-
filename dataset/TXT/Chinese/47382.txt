bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ I have been a customer for several years, but tonight was the last straw. The last time I visited, I left frustrated, and vowed not to return.  They let me stand there for 15-20 minutes, and never asked me what I would like to order, so I left. I am a regular, and always tip the help. Anyway, tonight I thought I would give them another chance. Boy am I sorry. I placed the order, (it is always the same) at 5:30 pm. At 6:05, I was still waiting. Meanwhile, people were being seated in the restaurant, and they received their food while I continued to wait.  When they did realize they had an extra bag of food, the food had been sitting on the counter for 15 minutes. It was barely warm. They tried to tell me the food just came up.  They vowed to take care of me on my next trip!  Are they kidding?  I got my money back, and needless to say there will not be a next time.  We did enjoy their food, but the service is horrible.
