MLwVTDhM2DOESvKGcfKCsg We were hot, tired and hungry... Was looking for some place close, but hit the delivery button instead. We had fried potstickers, fried rice with chicken, bbq pork and shrimp and sesame tofu (our faves forever). The order arrived within 30 minutes, steaming hot, and at least $5 less than any other place! 

The dumplings seem to be homemade and perfectly chewy. The filling was was very tasty and not greasy at all. There were 2 meals worth for each entrée, plenty of meat in the rice and the fried tofu was some of the best I've had in Madison. Next time we'll try dining in and maybe at lunchtime. Definitely under-rated, especially for the $5/serving.
