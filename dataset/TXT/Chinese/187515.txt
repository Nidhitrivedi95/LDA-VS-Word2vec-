yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I've never found a Vietnamese place that serves up a good Steak and Red Rice like this place we always used to go to in Concord when we lived in Cali. We saw something similar to it on the menu, so we decided to take a chance and we also shared an order of fresh spring rolls and a combination Pho.

The steak was kinda disappointing and the rice was okay, but the saving grace for our dinner were the other two items. Their Roasted Chicken with the Red Rice is actually a better option.

We are still fans, as the service has always been good, food comes out quickly, and its open 24 hours...ALOHA!!!
