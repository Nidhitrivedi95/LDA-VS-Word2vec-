dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw My husband and I went in on a Saturday at around 4:00p.m.. There was one person ahead  of us and we waitied for maybe 5 to 10 minutes. We were greeted by Jenny who was very friendly, she asked  our names and took our order. My wife and I both ordered the 3 trio and a drink for $10.00. They were out of the Pork so my wife got 2 chicken and 1 tofu and I got 1 tofu, 1 duck and 1 chicken. 

Jenny asked us if we were going to eat in or take it to go. We wanted to take them home, but Jenny informed us that they wouldn't let us take them home if we lived farther then 10 minutes away. Apparently people have been giving bad reviews and these were people who waited for sometime to eat there food and then complained that the food wasn't that good. 

That didn't bother us though. We told Jenny we were going to eat it in the car on the ride home. Which we did do. The Bao was ready within 15 minutes . Jenny told us a little about the business and made small talk with us while we waited. 

The Bao was delicious. Light and full of flavor. My son who is under 2 years of age loved the chicken Bao. My wife loved the tofu. I liked the duck and tofu ones the best. We'll definetly be back one day to try the pork and get more of the delicious tofu Bao.
