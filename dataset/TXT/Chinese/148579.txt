SktLID5_ywSlgVE-h3NB3Q This is my go to Chinese delivery. Ordering it on my lazy Sunday's has become sort of a tradition. I always get the Sesame Chicken or Sweet and Sour Chicken. The noodles are ok but I prefer the fried rice. It's delicious!!! And the best part is they deliver fast with no minimum purchase required.
