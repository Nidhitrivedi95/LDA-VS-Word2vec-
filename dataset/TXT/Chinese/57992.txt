D9bf5U0y_0MnL9wMFc4bKQ Not really impressed with this place. I guess I was misinformed but I arrived thinking this was going to still be a relatively cheap eats kind of place, given the previous restaurant and it´s Spadina-Dundas location.

The food was reallllly expensive, I could have eaten at Patria or Byblos for the same price. The portions were ridiculous. I ordered a sashimi salad for $14, and it literally came with 2 tiny tiny pinky-finger sized pieces of sashimi on top of maybe half a cup of various greens. It blew my mind. 

They also billed us incorrectly, we had ordered 4 orders of the chicken dish which was priced at $12, and on the bill they charged us $14 each. When I pointed it out, they mumbled something about how they had recently adjusted the price of that item.

Anyway the decor and ambiance are great but just don´t go here without knowing it´s going to cost a lot. We each had two dishes, so about $25 or $30 per person plus tax and tip, and I basically went home and had to make a second dinner afterwards.
