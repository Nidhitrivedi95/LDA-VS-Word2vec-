nQe4TPwn3iGiWlRWqguhwg I came home to Vaughan and found out that they opened a Chatime at the plaza across from Vaughan Mills and I was so happy. I dropped by here with some of my cousins and we all ordered drinks to go. One of them never tried bubble tea priced so high, so he was pretty hesitant to order. 
We got him hooked on that Hazelnut milk tea. One of the favourites. The servers here are also extremely nice; one of them working the counter recommended a drink to me and it was very refreshing for that day. Will visit again.
