2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w On Thursday, March 16 at 6pm, I stopped by and ordered Shrimp in Lobster Sauce and Pepper Beef to go. When my wife and I opened the boxes, we found some sort of very salty, brown "stuff."  We have eaten in many Chinese restaurants over the years and never encountered anything like this. Being brave, we  ate a small amount of each meal and threw out the rest..  Tom and Donna Butler, Surprise, AZ.
