MhnihE0alud0ereVInSt8Q Yummy Yummy is right! This spot makes some very good Chinese cuisine. I usually order the Sweet n Sour pork, Broccoli Beef, or Teriyaki Chicken, which are repeatedly offered in just about every other Asian restaurant. But, Yummy seems to do it better :D

Delivery is very quick! IT usually only takes about 20 minutes to deliver to my business in Old Town. And the prices are unbeatable for the amount of food you receive.. they really hook it up! One delivery usually lasts me three to four meals!

Definitely recommended.
