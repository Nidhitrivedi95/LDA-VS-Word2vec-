XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA This place is a borderline 2-3 stars. We went here recently for a mix of birthday's and Easter. It was our first time for most people going Pacific Buffet. If you are doing a restaurant based almost solely on seafood, you're really putting yourself out there. This place may have been the spot back in the day but not anymore.

The seafood didn't seem that fresh at all. In some cases, I left some of the food on the plate after trying it since it was either lacking in flavor or had a strange texture to it. Their sushi was okay and you can't really mess up dessert (except for Home Town Buffet) so that was tasty. The service was well though, they did a good job clearing empty plates, but I don't have any plans to eat here again.
