I think I've sampled most of the Raman -
But prefer something with pork in it. The salads are also nice, but given the near zero temp, it was definitely a noodle night. We split the special - of course it had a nice slab of pork belly as one of the protein components. 

We also had an order of the spicy beef buns and an order of the pork dumplings. The bill was $30... Not bad for two.
