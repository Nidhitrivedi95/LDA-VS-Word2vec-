fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw This place is just ok and stingy on the shrimp. My boyfriend and I both ordered combo plates - szechuan shrimp with chicken fingers and orange chicken with crab ragoon. They only gave us 3 pieces of the chicken fingers and crab ragoon. So it shouldn't really be called a combo if one of the entrees is not an entree size. And I can count in one hand how many shrimp was in my szechuan shrimp - they piled more of the veggies than the shrimp. For the money we spent, there was definitely not enough food for each of us. The only thing that was given enough was the orange chicken. We definitely won't be coming back unless we're desperate for some mediocre chinese food.
