YpnvKqeVD7dqZ9Mr0SGw6A We have gone to this Pei Wei many many times now. Sometimes it's good, sometimes there is too much sauce, etc. etc. like you would expect at any fast casual place. However, last night something happened that made me decide I would never eat there again.
I suffer from a moderate shellfish allergy. I always advise the cashier and chef of this fact. I have a couple normal safe dishes I order. However, last night I asked about the Chicken Lo Mein. My husband often orders this and I've really wanted to try it. I asked the cashier and she informed me that it was fine. I then asked her to verify with the chef because often asian food contains fish sauce, which shellfish allergy sufferers cannot consume. 
The chef verified that it was indeed fine, so we ordered and took our food home. I was eating my food and encountered a chunk of charcoal in it (maybe from the grill?) which set off a bit of gagging on my end. I decided that was probably the only piece, and I was tired and didn't want to return to the restaurant, so I continued eating. As I was eating I noticed my throat was getting sore. I thought that it must have been the gagging that caused it. However it wasn't much longer until I was wheezing.
I went to their website to check allergy info and saw that the lo mein is clearly marked as a shellfish allergen. I have now spent last night and my entire day today wheezing. Now, imagine I didn't have a moderate allergy, and instead I had one where I might need an epi-pen. I COULD LITERALLY BE DEAD. I wish that people could understand that food allergies are serious, and not something to just brush off. 
Obviously, shame on me for going to an asian restaurant anyway...but geeze. So please, please, please, if you have serious food allergies, DO NOT EAT HERE. Allergies are not taken seriously here, and you could die.
