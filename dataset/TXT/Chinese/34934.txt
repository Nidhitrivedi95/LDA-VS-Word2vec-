aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg I've been meaning to try this place out for such a long time. I actually stopped by a couple of months ago in the middle of lunch hour, and it was so crowded (even for to-go ordering) that we just couldn't stand to wait. I'm so glad that I finally made the time to come back.

You'll find a lot of awesome entrees in English, Chinese, and Vietnamese (some of the employees speak it, actually) on the menu. Noodle soups, congee, chow mein, and fried rice options abound. Large trays of meats are available for advance order. There's even various pig parts to order if you're into that kind of thing.

However, for my first attempt, I had to go for the "BBQ 2 Combination With Rice" for $6.99. I had the roasted pork belly (aka crispy pork) and the roasted duck as my options, and I have no regrets. These two meats actually bring back childhood memories from when my parents used to order trays of them from a local butcher and we'd enjoy them at home with some rice that we'd cooked.

Every table in the restaurant was taken - go figure - so I got my order in a to-go box. Instant nostalgia with the pork and duck laid on a bed of rice, plus a healthy side of Chinese cabbage. I just had the time of my life sitting in my car eating these delights. The pork was chopped into very manageable rectangular portions, each with perfectly crunchy skin, a layer of white, and a layer of dark meat. The duck pieces had lovely golden brown skin and a very anise-y seasoning on the bottom. Make sure to expect bones if you order the roasted duck, and you'll just have to kinda slice or bite them off to get to the meat.

I'm already plotting my next trip back. Maybe I can sit down and enjoy a nice noodle soup next time. That would be a great winter lunch, mmm...
