Wu_OmrEyhpllBnTNvOYSGQ This is what I have considered my secret spot for a while, mostly because it is the kind of restaurant you only enter accompanied by someone who knows the place! It is very difficult to find it if you can't read Chinese (you definitely know there is something up there as there is a sign, but you have no way of knowing if it is a secret Chinese spy agency, Jackie Chan's lair or the best Chinese restaurant you can possibly find in Montreal) but once you do, you become a privileged member of the very special club of those who know (I would have italicized "know" if I could). Alright, last time I checked I think there was something written in English, but you could still be confused, and you do have to climb some stairs,  I understand that this involves some kind of commitment, you know, you must be sure there is something worth it up there before you undertake to climb said stairs. You wouldn't want to go through all that trouble for nothing, or worse, have to climb down on an empty stomach. 

More seriously, you get a very good meal for 8$ (a side of rice with three dishes of your choice) and this is as cheap as Chinese food can get, especially for that quality! The lady who usually takes your order is very polite and there is no waiting time as she will just load up your plate as you point at the dishes and I never had to wait in line!
They do not deliver but you can take it to-go and I would definitely recommend getting your meal from here and bringing it back home rather than ordering over-priced Chinese food for delivery, it is worth it! (So, you know, climb the stairs!)
