DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA I lived in SoCal and love, love, LOVE the Sam Woo there, and was so happy when I first moved out here to Vegas in 2008 to see a familiar restaurant in Las Vegas Chinatown.  It was one of the first 3 off-strip restaurants that I tried on Spring Mountain.

Unfortunately my expectation for quality Chinese food at a reasonable price was quickly shattered by the huge mound of rice and miniscule amount of chicken and vegetables on the plate and the tourist trap prices being charged.  The flavor was okay, but trying to justify the price tag by shoveling extra extra rice is not the answer.  And I recall thinking WTH!  Did this restaurant steal the name of a well-known and much loved restaurant from California???

2.5 years later, I am still not sure if the restaurant is operated by the same family or is part of the same franchise, but I do know that I didn't want to go back to this crappy Sam Woo ever again, and have been true to my word.

And to those reviewers that think real Chinese restaurants do not or should not be bother with offer good service along with good food and still rate this poor imitation of a restaurant a 5 star, I think you should qualify your reviews with disclaimers that the reviews and ratings are for food only.

And if I want to pay Casino Chinese restaurant prices for at least mediocre food, why do I have to leave the Strip?  Plus, I dare say that a lot of the Chinese restaurants in the high end casinos offer better food than the ones you can get here.
