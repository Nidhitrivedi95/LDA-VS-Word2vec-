em3TpGN9BAA85u2lXewDiQ This is a two-thumbs up from me and my 9-year old.

We arrived at 545p on a Saturday, no wait and quick seating. Pleasant waitstaff. 

Soup was delicious-hot and sour for me and miso for my son. Hot and juuuuuuuust right on flavor.

Rainbow roll and double heart roll for supper-and wowza-they prepared it quickly!! We both loved it but the best part was the sauce on the double heart roll. We just about licked it off the plate. 

Definitely coming back.
