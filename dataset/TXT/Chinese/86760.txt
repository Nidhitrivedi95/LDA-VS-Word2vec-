hPTx2Y5e4Czbr21XcbDN8g I visited Mei Nung Beef Noodle House with a party of 6. We each ordered our own beef noodles and had the stinky tofu to share.

Beef noodles: The soup was flavourful, but I found the beef quite tough. Noodles were chewy - just the way I like it!

Stinky Tofu: The restaurant did smell because of the stinky tofu (so be prepared for that!). The texture was good and the hot sauce on the side accompanies the dish really well.

We were seated in the corner so it was difficult for the servers to see us. The perk of our visit was that we were able to get a small % off our bill for checking-in on yelp!
