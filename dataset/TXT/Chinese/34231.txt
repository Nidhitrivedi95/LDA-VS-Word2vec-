ABRgXNwdOX_JyqChNr8IYw After a long night of partying, my stomach is growling and I know I have to feed it before I get hangry. So I find myself at Swatows once again in the wee hours.  I keep coming back here not because I enjoy sitting in a cramped restaurant or eating the same food that hasn't changed for the past 20 years...It's simply because the food is good, it's cheap and the service is super efficient.  Your food is put on the table before you even finish giving your order! It's like magic!  There is always plenty of servers to make sure you have everything you need and the tables are turned for the next guest.  

Notable mentions are Black pepper beef with rice and shrimp dumpling soup.
