VGKq16vCdPPHMoryy6XTHg My wife and I were invited here on what might have been the coldest night of the past winter. We parked our car and walked around the block. We didn't find the restaurant, so we walked around the next block. I don't remember how we eventually figured out that the assholes who run this place decided not to post a sign in order to be edgy or something, but I do remember that I couldn't feel any of my limbs when I finally staggered in 20 minutes late. 

Since we were so late, I assumed that everyone else had ordered, so I quickly asked the waiter for some sort of pizza when 
he came by. He sneered back, "Maybe you should let the ladies order first." What an asshole-- exactly the kind of guy who works at a place without a friggin' sign. 

The pizza was fine. I won't be back to try it again.
