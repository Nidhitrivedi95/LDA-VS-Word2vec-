ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ I came back here a day after and got the same drink, QQ mango Taiwan juice with coconut jelly and pearls. This time I got no ice and 0% sugar and a large. This was much better. I would never get ice there again! And 0% sugar is perfect. Yum!!!!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND 0% sweet and No Ice!!! Large is the size I'm used to and a pretty good deal for the extra $! YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and get their stamp card if you're a local. I need to try more drinks here!
