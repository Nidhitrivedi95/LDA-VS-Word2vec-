The noodles were overcooked, there was no flavor and depth in the broth except saltiness and the meat was absolutely flavorless. My boyfriend ordered the tripe noodles and it was equally as awful with the tripe being overcooked and soft as jelly. We were appalled by the Taiwanese sausages. $8 for a plate of scattered thinly sliced sausages? It tasted unusual too, so it was mind blowing how awful it was. Needless to say, we felt completely ripped off and wondered why the place hasn't closed down yet.
