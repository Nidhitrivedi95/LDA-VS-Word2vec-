Food is obviously cold. Had to call to find out where the food was, as the delivery time on just-eat.ca said 3:35pm, they are only 10 minutes from my home and I was starving. They said they were busy. No apology, just said the delivery guy will be there soon. As I am about to reheat the food I ordered nearly two hours ago, I strongly recommend you avoid this place. Save yourself the hunger pains, and order from WESTOWN CHINESE. Great food, great service, huge portions, EARLY delivery.
