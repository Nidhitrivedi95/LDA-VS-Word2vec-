c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ 11pm to 6am special. Steak and eggs for $6.99 and 3 egg special for $4.99. Price is probably the cheapest on the strip.

Venue: medium size restaurant inside bill's casino. Semi ghetto old style.

Service. Okay.

Food:
Steak and eggs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ?select=7Av2xXdetk3VjO9IlpIy4A) - $6.99 small piece of steak (smaller than Ellis island) and very chewy... Hashbrown was okay. Wheat toast was good.

3 egg special (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ?select=lSjbluNsM-nn898jZir0sQ) - $4.99 eggs tasted like it came out of a carton... Maybe I'll op in for sunny side up next time. Hashbrown was okay and came with 3 rubbery sausages (you can ask for bacon instead). Wheat toast was good.

Price: okay price for on the strip.

Overall: would rather pay for taxi to Ellis island for their steak and eggs.
