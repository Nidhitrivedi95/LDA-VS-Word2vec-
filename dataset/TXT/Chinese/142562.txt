rkTFLIt_Z1bYMIuXfSyAqg Wonton hut is one of those places that you go supposedly knowing that it is a specialty place. I went expecting some classic wonton noodle soup food. overall i would say a 3 star seems appropriate as the wonton noodle soup was not exceptional by any means, and the wonton in particular was nothing special to scream at. i think for the price and quality i would've been better off at wonton chai. Overall the place i would not go back or recommend, unless you have major wonton cravings and are in the area, i wouldnt' highly recommend it,. The wontons themselves aren't very juicy or big or fresh, it is just average at best.
