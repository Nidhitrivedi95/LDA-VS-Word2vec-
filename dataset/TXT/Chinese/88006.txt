I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Love seeing the art in this place and the atmosphere is pretty chill.  Even though they are mainly knowed for their shave ice, I usually go get boba here mainly for their house special.  Their house special drink is a unique blend they mixed up, it's a mix of milk tea with some other tea flavor which makes it sweet but not too sweet.
