pw9ErdIO1t7CWLrZwNP1fw We tried this when it first opened ~3 years ago and weren't impressed back then, but really enjoyed it this time. Martin was the sushi chef and was great. We had two rolls: "Hot Night" and another that is not on the menu w/ shrimp, tuna, cucumber, mango, sirachi, etc.--both were fantastic. The sashimi was very fresh, too (we had yellowtail and albacore). For dinner, we had the House Go Ba and Orange Chicken and were very happy with both. The Won Ton soup was excellent, too. 

If you're looking for a good "neighborhood sushi place" near FLW and 101, we think this is a great choice and encourage you to give them a shot. Hae Su ("Kate") and Christy were both very friendly and helpful, too. We will absolutely be back.
