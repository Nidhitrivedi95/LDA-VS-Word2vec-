This a small Vietnamese place in a strip on Snow rd. Not terribly impressive looking, except for the little Buddha shrine complete with fake incense just outside of the kitchen.
The menu is very daunting. I mean huge. Once you realize that it is just thirty different variations on five themes you can make better choices. They have a bunch of Different Pho. A bunch of different noodle dishes, rice dishes and crepe dishes. I got a pork chop with two fried eggs over rice. It was very good, but afterwards looking at the yelp pics, I wish I had ordered the tamarind soup or the crepes or both.
You need to be patient here. The food takes awhile to come out of the kitchen.
Hopefully I'll be near Parma again and will get a chance at another meal here.
