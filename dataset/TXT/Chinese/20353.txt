5YUoTimGDPbbmRfw6SJgTQ I had a great big craving for pork egg foo young and I been sick with a cold so I had them deliver. Not the fastest delivery but was nice and hot even though we live not that close to location. It's not place where there is space to eat, it's mostly for take outs. The few times that we did eat there, they were very kind to my elderly mother at the time. The food is always consistently good. I'm very picky about egg drop soup as simple it may seem. I always order theirs because it's one I enjoy. I have no need for the crunchy noodles that it comes with because it's just that good.
