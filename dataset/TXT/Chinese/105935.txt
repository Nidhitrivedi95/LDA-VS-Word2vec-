ky5L-EfUwU9chSPcIeXM5w Sometimes you just want "fake" Chinese food, but you still want it to be delicious. THIS IS IT! It is authentically stereotypical American-Chinese food at its best. Completely blows Panda Express out of the water!

I was seriously craving some "fake" Chinese food, and this place was open, took online ordering through Yelp, and was on the way. Couldn't have been more perfect! So I ordered the corn egg drop soup, combo fried rice, orange chicken, Mongolian beef, and shrimp chow mein.

The fried rice was seasoned and cooked perfectly! Great proportion of veggies with egg with meat and rice. Beautiful soy-color and flavor. This could almost pass for real Chinese fried rice, except for the carrots. The shrimp chow mein was just how I like it. Long strands of noodles with some veggies and shrimp...but the veggies didn't distract from the noodles themselves. Orange chicken was done perfectly, and I think it's almost as good as Panda Express. It was slightly too saucy, but the sauce was the right tart and sweet. The corn egg drop soup was plentiful in egg white, but needed more corn. The soup base was on par. The Mongolian beef was disappointing...they use too much beef tenderizer (or corn starch). It would be best if they didn't use any at all because it makes the beef taste slimy and loses the texture of beef. I'm not a fan of using tenderizer to soften the meat because texturally and flavor wise, it's a lost cause. 

Reasonably priced...delicious slushy drinks. If they can improve on their beef dishes, I'd be inclined to give it 5 stars.
