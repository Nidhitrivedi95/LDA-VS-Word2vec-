2KOXNZVoxpcwen_JmIQdfA I made a stop at this spot on a recommendation of a friend and it was perfect pho weather.  It was warm but there was also a slight impending chill in the air.

I remember walking into the restaurant that had high ceilings and tables were filled with people happily slurping away.  My appetite was whet with anticipation.

I don't think I can ever get away from order the pho house special (or whatever is the closest).  In my many years of sitting down at pho restaurants, I haven't deviated from this choice and it's hard to change now!

So I ordered the house special pho, yas!  The first sip of the beef broth was very soothing.  The taste was very light, delicate, and just right.  There was a little bit of everything (beef slices, tendon, beef balls, tripe, etc) along with the noodles swimming around. 

The bowl of pho was really satisfying and I had a great time slurping up all the contents.  They offer the standard accompaniments with the pho such as bean sprouts, lime, and mint leaves but no chili pepper.  You can ask to have the bean sprouts quickly dunked in hot water if you are so inclined.

Would come back to this place when i am in search of a good meal in the area again.
