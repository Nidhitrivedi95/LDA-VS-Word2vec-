Fhjzzo7ranqqgEdbiPD50Q Usually I am hesitant to write a review after my first visit (unless the place really turns me off) but after 10 minutes in here I could tell this was going to become a favorite spot.

My friend took me to this place on a Tuesday afternoon and we were the only ones in there and the only thought in my head was "awkward!" But nevertheless, our server was prompt and super friendly. 

There is a fairly large selection on the menu with different types of rice, pork, beef, seafood, the usual stuff. So naturally I figured it would be like any other Asian restaurant but I figured wrong. 

I ordered the orange chicken (I'm white...I know) and it was tremendous. The portion sizing was unreal...It was huge (That's what she said)! I was incredibly hungry and I couldn't finish it. It was the combo deal so it came with egg drop soup, a side of rice, an egg roll and a crab puff of some kind. Needless to say the meal was marvelous and had a taste of epic proportions. 

When the bill came it was only ten something for both my friend and I, and I near soiled myself. This place is awesome and I will be back.
