ZZF5iqlKFBWJSGSZzWHMzA So disappointed.  Have visited this place before, and wanted to take an out-of-town friend here for a quick bite.  I even checked their website for their hours and there's no indication of any closure.

We went on Aug 4, and there's a note on the window that says "closed for renovations".  What a total drag.  Luckily, Bahn Mi Boys is within walking distance which is where we ended up for dinner.

Anyway, curiosity got the best of me, as I had talked up this place, and I looked into this further, since they only just renovated last year.  Their twitter feed, which had been inactive since the spring, now says (Aug 3, 2016):  

"Time's up for this location.  See you all again soon.
This is not goodbye...let's see where we end up, maybe in your neighbourhood.  It's time to split from this location.  Thanks to all our friends and awesome patrons for the support.  See you later."

Oh man, I really liked their baos, fried chicken and ram'n cheese.  Sigh...
