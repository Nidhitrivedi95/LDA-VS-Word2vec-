pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I'm not easily impressed with fusion places, however I'll definitely say that I'm a fan.

Came-in with a large group (14) and had a reservation and special menu set-up for us, in 3-course fashion.

Ordered a ton of food and had plenty of service staff waiting on our table. They threw-in a bottle (or two, can't remember). Which was nice of them.
