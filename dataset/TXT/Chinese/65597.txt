eC-duRpbiVsCD14oGYiDOA Went to Hana last Friday and was pleasantly surprised with my experience.  Arriving, the server was pleasant and accommodating.  Took our beverage order and returned quickly.  We were then left alone for a few minutes to look at the menu being first timers.  The hot and sour soup was great as was my partners miso soup which lead to the calamari appetizer.  The breading was amazingly light and the calamari cooked perfectly.  The accompanying sauce was also very good.  I opted for the steak teryaki which came with a small side salad with a great Asian dressing.  Also included was fried rice.  My partner had the Happy Family which included pieces of lightly breaded chicken, shrimp and Asian vegetables and white rice.  We were checked on regularly, water was constantly filled and staff was always pleasant.
I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great sushi/sashimi bar as well as Asian dishes and entrees.
