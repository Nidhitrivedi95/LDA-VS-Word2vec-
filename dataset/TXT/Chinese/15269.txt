3PhF188adiC8ZutKRP9gyQ Health Herbal Harmony is another Chinese desserts restaurant that serves Essence Jelly and other herbal remedy. It is located in Time Square with storefront facing Hwy 7.

Dropped by on a late Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was empty. The menu here is extensive with a lot of different selections and it will be great if you come with a group of people so everyone will find something they enjoy!

 Have to get my fix for Essence Jelly as eating too much spicy food is not good for health, and Chinese believe that Essence Jelly can balance out the effect of NOT so healthy eating. This is especially true when the weather is hot!

They do serves afternoon tea set (2pm-6pm everyday) which are around $5 that seems to be good value. Which I definitely would be back to try out. Today I decided on the Essence jello with Fresh fruit mix with coconut milk. ($6.80+$0.6).

The portion here for sure is not as big as other places. However, the mixture of fruit is great, watermelon and mango are both so sweet and other fruits are all fresh.. thank you! no canned fruits in sight!

The essence jelly  is a lot bitter in taste than any other places in TO that I tried. They put  lingzhi in that too. Lingzhi is another herbal remedy that suppose to be good for your health. I am not sure if the Lingzhi gave it a really bitter taste or they use extra herbs when preparing their jelly. Any way, I am glad that I order it with fresh fruits and coconut milk. If not, it will taste more like a medicine!

Services are fast and friendly. 

They do give 10% off non set menu if you have a full time student ID and with free Wifi, I can imagine a lot of younger customers would hang out here later in the evening.

Their website is really cool too.. and they even deliver to your house or you can order takeout online and then go pick it up!

Cash only!
