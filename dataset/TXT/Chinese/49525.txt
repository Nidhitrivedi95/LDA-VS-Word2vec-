CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I wish I could give 0 stars.
As soon as I was seated I was greeted by a pungent fishy smell. 
My coworker and I ordered:

Sesame chicken: looked like thin strips of plastic dipped in starchy sweet and sour sauce. Funny cause it tasted like it too. Only thing sesame about it were the sprinkles on top.

XO Green beans: I asked the waiter what XO was (HEY, JUST CAUSE IM ASIAN DOESNT MEAN I AUTOMATICALLY KNOW ALL THE SAUCES GEEZ) and he said I shouldn't be worried because it's very tasty and not too spicy. I wasted my time asking cause I didn't even taste any sauce. It was so bland. The string beans must have been grown in a neighborhood farm (note this is Vegas) cause they were sooooo small and skinnnnnnnny. I felt so bad for those guys I almost wanted to just drench them in my water. Well, atleast it had a nice crunchy texture.

Laksa curry: Our other coworker said it was difficult to eat bc of a strange fishy taste although it was a chicken curry soup...*cringe*

Beef noodle soup was the best bowl of the table so we just stared at her as we crunched or sipped politely on.

A Chinese pair next in line were debating so I did them a civil service and frantically shook my head as I pointed to my dish. I never saw them get seated.
