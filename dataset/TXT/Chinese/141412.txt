RFufCVXsOldhbPOvgIRlFw I had the seafood toss and turn. The menu says it's something you'll have to try and I did. I liked the large shrimp and crab and vegetables. The sauce was so-so for me but not bad, portion was huge. Next time I want to try the bento box or one of the entree meals. My fiance got the bento box and I sampled from his (with permission) - delicious! We went with one of our friends as well and the three of us could barely finish our meals - so filling! The interior was clean and the employee at the front was sweet and informative. We will be returning soon
