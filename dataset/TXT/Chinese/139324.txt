qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA OK. Reviewing PF Changs in Phoenix is like reviewing Delux, Barrio Cafe or some other overly reviewed although perhaps well deserving place. That long incorrectly worded sentence aside, I have to say, we had a fantastic Chang experience. Mostly due to the fact that we were buzzed after the fabulously thrown Gabi yelp event. And we didn't choose to wait for a table, yet sat at the bar, with the other drinkers. We quickly made friends with the bar staff, and diners on either side of us. The spring rolls were crisp, hot and well, kinda bland. Thank you sides o sauce. The mushu pork was dee lish as was the Spicy Chang Chicken. However, riding the bland wagon, was the chicken fried rice. Undercooked and totally void of flavor. The sake was hot, just like the electronics were our diners to the left were hawking. Seriously. He went to his car to retrieve things. Thanks. But no thanks. Service was outstanding. Energy in the restaurant was fun. Unusual for me to give 4 stars to a chain restaurant, unless there's and in and an out in the name. But here goes for tonight. Four stars PF. Four stars! More on service and ambiance than food. But four stars nonetheless!
