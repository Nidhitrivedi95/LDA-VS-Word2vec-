JEqM8xXhKumU5AfhmsiD8w The general tso's chicken is the best you can get in the Pittsburgh area. Crunchy, with sparingly used delicious sauce. It tends to be the only thing I really get here. The dumplings are quite good as are the egg rolls. I have had the pad Thai, which is really good as well. I would also recommend the chicken lo mein. Delivery seems to be just as good as the food you get in the restaurant. You have other options for Chinese in the area - Benichopsticks and Sesame Inn, just a stone's throw away. But this place is my favorite.
