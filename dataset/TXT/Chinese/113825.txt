mRubgo8WfjraJkE5Bvbf6w Horrible...disappointed to say the least. After waiting almost 2 hours for our food to be delivered we called to speak with a manager. A girl by the name of Hannah spoke with us who claimed to be the manager. We love their food, but after the conversation with this so called "manager", we will never order or refer anyone to this place. She was very condescending and rude and even argued with us. This is a true representation on how this place is run. A simple apology would have been enough, instead we were treated as if we did something wrong. Never again.
