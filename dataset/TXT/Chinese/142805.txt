RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw Anything less than 5 stars for this place is, I daresay, blasphemy

Having grown up a few blocks from this place, I ate here almost on a weekly basis during my high school years. Virtually everyone I knew has good things to say about this place--the authenticity of the "wok" taste, the low prices, the homely/cozy atmosphere, the large menu with wide varieties of items, and perhaps most importantly, the fact that it opens well after midnight!

No wonder parking is always a problem

Even with the large number of chinese food places springing up in the Toronto area, this place has stood the test of time for many years!

Definitely one of the places I always visit at least once whenever I visit Toronto
