HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ First off 1 star is too much, but I have to give a star. Not to be rude like the waitress there. But try avoiding the chubby younger waitress. She's a smart ass, not friendly, and tries to rush you out. The worst part was when she took the tip money while we were still sitting at the table. As we start walking out, she openly complains about the tip. Yes, it was only $1, but that was generous. It was a completely torn dollar, duct taped together that she'd given us as change. We laughed the whole way out the door as she whined to the boss. Very poor quality, small helpings, and over priced. I'm shocked that place is even running and she still works there. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND! Worst sushi bar in town, quality wise
