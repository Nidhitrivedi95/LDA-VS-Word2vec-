BJLjRP7HvIbdQOZc9UoVNA Cheap and plentiful. The menu is very large and contains a mix of items.  Service wasn't amazing but food came out pretty quickly. 

Ordered braised beef ramen, pork chop vermicelli, and the spicy and peppered squid. The squid was slightly dry and the noodles was alright. 

They have a $10 minimum for debit and $20 minimum for credit card.
