Fu5rL-dPs-VNW0k315xMbw The only real upside is the nice renovation to appeal to the young people in the area (i.e. Richmond Hill High School students). The food is rather pricey, and while the plates are unique, the serving size is kind of small. But what I really dislike is the MSG and odd parts in the meat dishes (e.g. the chicken congee is entirely chicken neck). However, back to the ambience, the decorations are tasteful and suit the "fantasy" theme, and are plentiful without being too crowded. The free wifi double rooms are also a huge plus. I hate to see this place go; it's the only Chinese restaurant in the area, and the price is somewhat understandable due the competition; it shares a plaze and mcd, bk, swiss chalet, popeyes, cora, subway, timmies and many other eateries. I guess I'll give it one more chance (the atmosphere alone is worth going to with friends), maybe it was just a bad day.
