egxK8E9T6MWLxJyD_iCIVQ Haven't been here in a long time, so since I had business to take care of in Sewickley, I thought I would get some take-out.  Used to really like to the place, but was disappointed.  I ordered the tender blossoms stir fry.  It was supposed to be spicy (that is what the red hot pepper means next to the name right?), but there wasn't even an inkling of 'heat' or spice.  Also got one of the rolls (can't remember which one), but it was boring and lacked flavor too.
