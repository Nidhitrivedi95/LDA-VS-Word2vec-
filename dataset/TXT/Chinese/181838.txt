xFCJqbDQu8YbHQoD1mODfg -A nice, variety of Chinese food, plus some salad bar fixins, jello, desserts, and some American food.

-Seven buffet islands, plus the Sushi area = eight total areas of food to choose from.

-Clean restaurant. Pleasant decor.

-VERY friendly, coridial staff.

-Food was really good & fresh for a Chinese buffet. Tasty & delicious!

-Drinking water did not taste filtered (usually from the soda machine), it tasted like Phoenix tap.

-Convenient parking.

-The ladies restroom smelled like sewer (not like someone who just made a stinky in the stall, but the foul aroma of a sewage drain)...

-Despite the smelly restroom, I would definately eat here again!
