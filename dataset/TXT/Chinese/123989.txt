ooFlFjIuGW8Lx0bxmvEZJg My family and I absolutely love Passion Grill. It is one of our favorite places to go. It has a unique ambience and variety of foods. Our favorite is the hibachi where you have.an array of ingredients to choose from. The prime rib is also very good. The only things I'm not overly pleased about is the desserts and American food selections, but I did not go there for either. My son had his 11th birthday dinner party here price was decent and the staff was very warm, welcoming, as well as helpful. Everyone had a great time.
