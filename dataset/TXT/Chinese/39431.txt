AVLj5MSJD1si-Rl6X6qTXQ Dim sum: Reasonably priced, above-average selection, average quality, slightly below-average service. No cart service as it's 2 stories but food arrived quick and hot. Best dish: shrimp & coriander steamed dumplings. A delicious twist on a classic!  Paid $45 for 2ppl with leftovers.
