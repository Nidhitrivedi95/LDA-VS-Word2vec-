yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Very bad service, i wait too long for pho. The servant said they lost the ticket but didn't do anything. In the end the pho came out, but the way they servant serves very rude, he threw the bowl and said "do you want it or not?" It's very unacceptable behaviour and service. Even they have many crowd, but it's not a reason to treat customer like that. Not recommended.
