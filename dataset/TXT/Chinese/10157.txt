1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA The service isn't good, but I'm not interested in service at a poh-dunk little hole in the wall of a Chinese restaurant.  It's the food.  And the food isn't good here.  They managed to screw up fairly simple Chinese dishes.  Overcooked meats and various dishes improperly seasoned were enough to just say "NO" to ever coming back to the Big Wong after two occasions of receiving untasty food.  

And I wanted to llike this place...
