5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ Me and my family ate here on our recent trip to Vegas.  The food was amazing. We liked it so much we went back again the next evening for dinner.  Lettuce wraps are great. Orange chicken was the best we have ever had, pan fried noodles were delicious. There wasn't anything we got that we didn't love. The service was great too.  Definitely recommend to anyone. Really great for families too. My three kids loved it.
