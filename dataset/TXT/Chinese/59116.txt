DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw Okay. What a trip.

So, I copied and paste the address from Yelp into my GPS, and was taken on a wild goose chase. Had me behind the silverbowl, cutting through neighborhoods, all kinds of crap.

It is in the circle K parking lot, however, it is behind all that. It is closer to the Roberto's and the salon/check cashing place.

Tight squeeze doesn't even begin to describe how small the isles are here. An employee was stalking the shelves, and her and I could barely squeeze by one another to fit. The shelves are crammed with items, and pricing is hard to figure out, because there is just so many things. 

I found the boba that I was looking for (a quick boil, that takes 5 minutes to make). I grabbed a few bags of those, but their debit/credit card policy is $10 or get charged a fee. 

Luckily, I found a sweet roll that my daughter really loves. No one really acknowledged me, kind of lame... IF you can manage the tight squeeze, and you know exactly what you want, and where it is, you shouldn't have a problem.
