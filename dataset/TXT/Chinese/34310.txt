It's made up of delicious, plump shrimp dumplings that are pretty much a more glamorous version of wontons, plentiful noodle, and as a bonus, greenery in the form of a couple of stalks of Chinese veggie that's not lettuce.  I find that places like these don't often include quality veggie with their already cheap offerings, so I'm very happy plunking down my dollars at Swatow for their delicious noodle and quick, no fuss service.
