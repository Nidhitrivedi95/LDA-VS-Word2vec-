8C65DwwnazwYB2z9naHyaw I just moved here and have been looking for Chinese food near me. I was not impressed with this food at all. We spent $30 on food and could barely eat a plate of it. I have it in star cause it seemed like a clean place but the food was not good. The lo mein noodles smelled like dirty dish rag. I will not be visiting again. Sorry
