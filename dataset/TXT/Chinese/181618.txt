Because i dont have a car atm. Oh well  its super expesive for delivery i was like how much she said 6$ i said ok ill pay. Ok what you want mongolian beef 8.95 and potsickers 4.95. And she replies  is that it like 3 times and i say yes she  said  then its a 20$ minimum  before delivery. I have worked/work at food places that deliver food and no way would they ever try to rob you of $26 minimum  per delivery. Damn  i just wanted some chinese food
