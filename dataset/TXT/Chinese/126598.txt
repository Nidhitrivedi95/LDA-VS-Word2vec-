p2OOk46G_AOO0nCWl-eVlg Been coming here for years.  Always clean and good service.  Special thanks today to Brian working the register for honoring a coupon which I thought was valid but had expired.  Really appreciate it and it's that kind of customer service that keeps me coming back (and the kung pao shrimp rolls which I'm totally addicted to!)
