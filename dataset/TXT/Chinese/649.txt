-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw Bbtea is decent, reasonable priced compared to Ten Ren.  However the service is EXTREMELY SLOW.  They gotta take some lessons from Starbucks and Tim Horton's.  Would go back many more times if the service was faster, but I doubt I'll be going here anytime soon until the fad dies down.  It's like watching paint dry.
