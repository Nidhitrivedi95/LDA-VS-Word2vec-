68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw Don't be afraid of the crazy parking lot, this place is delicious. Despite its tiny size, Flock & Fowl packs a lot of flavor. 

I've only eaten the salad here (trying to keep it light) and I'm never disappointed. Everything is fresh, flavorful, and in season. I like that every time I order the salad it's a little different. Keeps my tastebuds interested. The chicken is very good, moist and flavorful. 

Service is always fine, all of the staff are friendly and helpful.  If you want to come here during peak lunch time, I suggest calling ahead and taking your food to go, there are only a handful of tables here. This is not the lunch spot where you can chill and catch up with friends. Also, food can sometimes come out slowly due to the busyness so if you don't call ahead be prepared to wait a while. 

Flock & Fowl has limited business hours so be sure to check ahead of time (they're closed on Mondays!).
