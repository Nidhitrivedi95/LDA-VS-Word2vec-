fBmyj1okdO1p-GUzfQQohg Craving one of my old haunts, I decided to stop by Szechuan Express today. This place used to be one of my favs back in the day.  Now, not so much.   

I called ahead and placed a to go order for their Szechuan chow mein, which typically contains beef, pork, chicken and shrimp.  No complaints about the chow mein.  It was tasty just as I remembered.  

However, now I remember why I stopped frequenting this place... two reasons. 
!) For the longest, they would not accept calls from blocked numbers.  I would get so annoyed when I tried to call them that I would just hang up and call Best Hong Kong (which is literally two doors down) instead.  Apparently, my call went through today so I think they finally wised up.
2) The place has a funny smell to it.  I'm almost tempted to  describe it as a stench.  I would never choose to stay and eat there.  Strictly, to go only.  The place is very small anyhow with only a few small tables with chairs (smaller than my living room),  I know they deliver but I hate delivery.

Can't comment on customer service since I ordered to go.  I walked in, paid cashier (who said hello and thank you) and walked out. Food is decent (3 stars); decor/smell (2 stars).
