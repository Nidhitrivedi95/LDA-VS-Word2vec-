-7EwIdxcRC5McO35DVfeSQ I am mostly commenting on the wait time here. We really had high hopes for this place after reading all of the reviews. We came on a Friday, maybe around 7PM I think.

The place was already very packed but we were seated right away. We ordered lamb skewers since it was the most recommended dish on Yelp. We also ordered a fish dish that was large enough for two people.

It took almost half an hour to get the lamb skewers and the main dish came out at around 50 minutes from us placing the order. There were also other customers who were becoming irate waiting for their pickup orders as well.

The lamb was definitely good but not way better than at other Chinese restaurants. Tiger BBQ also has really good lamb skewers. The fish dish was alright as well but not worth that wait time.

I don't know if it was an off day for the kitchen that day but we won't go back with that type of wait time.
