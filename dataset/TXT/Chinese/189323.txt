yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA It was a late night craving for Viet food.  My usual Viet restaurant was closed (1am), so I decided to go next door.  I was promptly seated, and I liked the atmosphere. 

Pros- the food came very quickly, the portion was acceptable, and the order was less than $10 a plate.  Service was speedy, but nothing spectacular. 4 stars.

Cons- I have never been served cold-to-lukewarm food before.  The soup was so cold that the beef in my pho was still lightly rare.  The portion was acceptable, but not for $10, because I was not full yet.  I had to make a second order of food just to get filled.  The flavoring was average, but the food was COLDer than I expected.  I brought the 2nd portion home so I could microwave it and continue my dinner.  2 stars
