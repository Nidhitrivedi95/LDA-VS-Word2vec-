X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Considering it's Memorial Day weekend, many friends were in town and wanted to check out this new hotspot. 
So, I had emailed a host regarding the pricing of tables.

And lemme tell you that you might have to take a seat after hearing their quotes:

4 people for $7,500. Not including 40% tip and tax. 

You see that ----- FORTY PERCENT TIP AND TAX

So, basically $10,000. Can you believe that!? 10Gs.

And I believe this is a table upstairs. Imagine the ones on the floor.
And if you get a table in the lounge, you can't see the main floor. Ridic.


I know this is Vegas and you pay a ridiculous about for bottles that cost less than a hundred bucks. And pay for a place to sit. But, c'mon.

40% is completely ridiculous.
