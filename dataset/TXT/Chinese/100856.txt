K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw Came here on a Sunday afternoon, was not busy when we got in but the place quickly filled up with people!

This is predominantly a take out place - there is some seating but very minimal and it's a tight space to eat. 

Took 18 mins to get our order, just a heads up

Here's what we ordered:

Mee Goreng (extra spicy) - 10/10
-amazing dry soft noodle that is very tasty and spicy 

Curry Laksa (extra spicy) - 9/10
-really nice watery curry with chicken and shrimp 
-comes with noodles

Chili Padi Chicken with Nasi Lemak - 8/10
-smaller portion but tasty 
-it's an oily curry that is chicken stir fried with some soft vegetables 

Good value for your money, very authentic taste, and a lot of delicious spice
