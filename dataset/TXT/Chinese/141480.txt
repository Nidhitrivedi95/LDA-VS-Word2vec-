Rg4FHrDOD2DJeDY_khy-0w I am a big fan of Pei Wei but may stop going to this location. Over the weekend my wife and I placed an order over the phone while at the grocery store. We arrived to Pei Wei at the time our order was supposed to be ready. My wife stayed in the car as it was a hot day and we had some refrigerated groceries we just purchased. When I went inside to pickup my order, one of the items was missing. The person helping me was the store manager and I told him what I had ordered originally (15 minutes ago). He never apologized but said he could have the extra dish ready in "2 minutes". I hesitated but he gave me a guarantee it would be 5 minutes at the most. Time starts to go by and in the past whenever I have had to wait, Pei Wei usually offers me a drink, since nobody offered, I decided to purchase one. I am waiting and waiting while people come and go, in the mean time my wife is still outside in the car with our refrigerated groceries that have been out much longer than expected. Fifteen minutes go by and my extra dish is finally ready. The rest of my order had been sitting out on the counter the entire time I was waiting. By the time I got home 2/3 of my order was no longer fresh and warm as it had been sitting out for 20 minutes, not what I expect for a $30 lunch. I will most likely start going to one of the other locations in the area.
