Kn57RIWAdnVfJHI1loLXOQ Interesting Chinese/Indian/West Indies mix.Large portions, food was decent and definitely worth it for the price. I would go again if I visited Toronto in the future. 

I would recommend take out over eating at the restaurant (might be worth it if you wanted to feed a large party good food for a reasonable price). Call ahead because they are a little slow.
