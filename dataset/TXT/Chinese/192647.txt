I came here with my family and we ordered a classic Chinese ten-course meal. Everything came all at once, and more or less in improper order, but the food was good and we all really enjoyed it.

The service was great. My mom called ahead to book a large lobster for 12. They brought out a couple of lobsters for us to choose from, and we picked the bigger one. I thought this was a nice touch.

Best: Lobster fried rice, sweet and sour pork.

The lobster was actually pretty good, but it was a Maggi sauce, and I'm a bigger fan of ginger chive sauce. Of course, that didn't stop me from eating almost half the thing myself.

All in all, a very nice dining experience, moderately clean restaurant, zero decor as in most decent Chinese places and good food.
