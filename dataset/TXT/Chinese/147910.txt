Se63tFm5tLlO5wuUlyww8Q First time here. We stopped in during the week for lunch. Wow! Ten dollars for an all you can eat buffet up until 4pm. 

The interior is nice enough with booths and tables available. The carpet is a bit worn and the restaurant feels like it needs some renovation. 

Service was good. We were greeted and taken to a table right away. A server came by and took our drink order then off to check out the numerous items on the buffet!

They have everything and then some! There is seriously too many things to try on one visit. Quite a selection with a sushi bar and habachi grill. There is a salad bar, soups, desert bar and an area with hard ice cream. Wish there were more labels for everything so we knew what we were eating. 

Good to go when you want to try some new things or pig out on old favorites!
