WkqoHQYYfnQuKEU4a8kjGQ Arrived here early in the morning, unfortunately before any of the BBQ meat was available. We had to ask the waiter to point out what was available at that time, which he was able to. 
They serve you with cups of hot tea to go along with your meal which is a very traditional Chinese thing to do, and I don't see this done often enough.

*Stir fried beef egg noodles: This is like "pad see ew" at Thai restaurants. Wide rice noodles stir fried with beef slices and vegetables. Very large portion, greasy, savory, and satisfying. Easy to eat even for people not familiar with Chinese food.
*Breakfast special (congee with fried noodles): For $5.75 you get a big bowl of steaming hot congee with a plate of fried noodles (without meat). We chose the ground pork with preserved egg for our congee. The congee is very lightly flavored and I feel the rice was not broken down enough for this style, but it was a good dish nonetheless. The fried noodles are okay, no meat, taste exactly the way they look.

Overall this place is "good" and it does come across as a tad basic based on my experience during breakfast, but I may be biased because I didn't get to try the BBQ meat that everyone on Yelp raves about. Short of that observation, as an Asian-Canadian who grew up in Toronto, this place absolutely cannot compete with what we have down there.

Also - who charges tax and then takes cash-only? I hate that this restaurant has this policy.
