AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw So, here's the lowdown on chop and wok!!
Do you go for the food? No, while it's not awful it's just very average. Very heavy and thick loaded w MSG.
Do you go for the service? No. We waited 10 minutes at our table and nobody acknowledged us. So, you ask the bartender and he will say "I will find someone to help you"
Do you go for ambience? No, it's let's say "eclectic" and if you look around the place is dirty.
So why go? Well, it was a group of 6 of us and we had a good time. You know what to expect there, not much. But it's has a good tap beer selection, it's not pricey and you know you can't be critical of this establishment.
It is what it is!!!
