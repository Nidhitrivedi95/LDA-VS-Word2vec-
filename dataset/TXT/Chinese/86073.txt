HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Located inside Eureka casino, I came here with a few friends right when they opened. They were supposed to be open at 11, but didn't open til about 11:05. No big deal. 

There were about 2-3 tables that seated 6+ so if your party is bigger than that, you might end up splitting booths/tables so just be ready for that. Very cozy feel. What threw me off a little was that they had Asian decorations while playing country music. Then again, it is an Asian/American fusion. A few big screen tvs so you could watch sports games and what not.

I had the Fat Choy burger, cooked medium, with fries. It's your basic burger topped with bacon, brisket, fried egg, and onion jam. The burger was delicious and decent sized. The fries were really good, and they gave a pretty good amount, all for $11.99. The staff was extra nice and seems like they knew the regulars on a first name basis.

4/5 stars simply because I don't think it deserves a perfect score. Nothing bad or wrong, just didn't "wow" me for the 5. Definitely would recommend trying here, but not sure if I'll ever go this far out of my way, away from the strip, to come back.
