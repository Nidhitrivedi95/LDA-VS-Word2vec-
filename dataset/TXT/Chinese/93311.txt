j-0QQUXuMuowlItX3ekBBQ I was born and raised in Wuhan. I would give 4 stars for the hot and dry noodles, but 2-3 stars for other stuff. There several Wuhan style restaurants that I know of in Toronto. This is the only one uses the RIGHT noodles. If anyone wants to try hot and dry noodles out, I'd recommend it. 

The reason I give the noodles 4, it's because it's too salty and sweet. They didn't put garlic water in the noodle neither. Even small amount of garlic water makes huge difference!
