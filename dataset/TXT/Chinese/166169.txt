vbVJzKDhHlhMnKRpES5QzQ Came here on a chilly night looking for some warm spicy food to fill my belly. This place is super hard to find. Not only is it behind the pho Kim long plaza, it's hidden behind another restaurant. Also, this place is located right next to a Yun nan restaurant which basically serves the same style of food... Well played chengdu... Trying to put that place out of business. 

The place is really warm inside.. They didn't turn on the ac. Maybe it's because it's winter?  For four people, we ordered the fish boiled in spicy soup, spicy eggplant, cumin lamb, and Dan Dan noodles. 

Dan Dan noodles- super good and saucy. You have to mix it really well or else all the meat and sauce stays on the bottom. It has a spicy peanuty flavor but it's not overwhelmingly hot. I love the peanut flavor and the texture of the soft thick noodles. 

Cumin lamb- probably my favorite dish that I ordered. It didn't taste gamy at all. Instead amongst all the dishes that I ordered I really enjoyed the flavor of this dish the most. It's a very satisfying meat flavor. 

Fish boiled in spicy soup. This dish looks pretty intimidating with all the peppers in it. But if you don't drink the soup or eat the peppers, this dish and veggies in it is super good. The fish is cod I believe. It's incredibly tender and juicy. The lady told us that the soup is drinkable. The top layer is oil but the bottom layer is broth. Becareful though because this spice tends to numb your tongue. Don't worry if this happens.. You are not dying. 

Spicy eggplant- really really good. Again not too spicy where you can't eat it. Full of robust flavors. Just becareful because since it's cooked in hot oil the temperature might be really hot when you bite into it.
