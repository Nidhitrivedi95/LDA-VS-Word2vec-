The inside is very nice and I like how the pots are in the table (I've been to ones with portable burners). It is self serve style and you can take trips up to get veggies, noodles and meats at your own pace. This ayce price includes everything and you can even get many options of seafood. In the end everything I ate was great and I definitely feel I got my money's worth!
