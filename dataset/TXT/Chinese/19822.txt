5UvAxXy6BBgyuxv0B3ztjA I was in town for work at CES and my coworkers and I ate here 2 times during the week for lunch but to our amazement and dissappointment, they weren't serving ANY noodles the first time was came!   Noodle bar...no noodles????!!!   We were told it was because of the large crowds from CES so they had a limited menu with no noodles on it.  The fried rice and other items from the very limited menu were all great but they lost a star from my rating because of that experience.  We did go back one more time after CES and finally got to try the noodles which were excellent.  I had the Thai Noodles and ate it all and left full and very satisfied.  My coworkers felt the same way.....excellent food once we actually got to try it.  Service was a bit rushed during the lunches but with the large crowds each day, it was understandable.  The server and host were very friendly and attentive.
Reasonable prices here too.
