rLyGCFULUSbLCt8J3U0_kA I compare all General Tso chicken I try anywhere to Peking Man's. 
The service is slow and the decor is delightfully/wildly tacky, but I seriously drive from Etobicoke to have the Shanghai fried noodles and General Tso Chicken. Unique recipe, quite spicy too. 

The Peking Duck looks cool to get, lot of effort put in table side. 

So, long and the short of it, fantastic food, brutal everything else. But I still go.
