We went on a weekday night.  Not crowded at all possibly because we were early, it was raining and cold.

We had Pork Jia-Mo, Traditional XPan Style Zha Jiang Mian and Biang Biang Mian.

The good:
Pork Jia-Mo - meaty and tasty
The chef is from Xian.  Noodles are about 1 inch wide and really long.  Not sure if it was one piece :)

Staff is friendly and quick.  Too bad no one offered us drinks.  Maybe a fluke.


The bad:
Like zero meat in the noodles.  There was some chopped up meat in the Biang Biang Mian.  But virtually none in the Traditional XPan Style Zha Jiang Mian.  It was more sauce than meat.  See photo.

They didn't ask us if we wanted drinks and didn't provide drinks until we asked them.  I should point out, 1/3 of the place was empty with no lines.  Not sure if they have tea but didn't see anybody having any.  But they were quick and friendly.

Notes:
Takes cash only.

I heard there is normally a long line going outside.  There was a line forming when we were there later in the evening.

Nice big bowls but Styrofoam cup for water.  Didn't see anybody with tea.  Hard wooden seats.  Clean so that's the important thing.  

I might recommend for someone to try the noodles if they never tried Xian noodles but I'm not going to go again as there was virtually no meat with my noodles.  I admit I didn't complain or ask why there was so little meat but seems kind of odd to be missing it.

Thank you.
