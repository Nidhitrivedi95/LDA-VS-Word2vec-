emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw On Christmas Day, any open restaurant must be busy. C-Fu was definitely busy, not busy as the other dim sum spot across the street, but still busy. My family and I were seated and I asked a fellow server if the server could ask someone to change the television channel to a basketball game on ABC. The server's response, "We're quite busy right now and we don't have time for that." Having experience in the service industry, I was appalled by his response, as were my family around the table.  I give C-Fu one star because the dim sum, or at least the ones they offered, were fairly flavored. But as for customer service, I give it ZERO stars.

Sincerely,
First time Yelp poster.
