n_fg4B1BPzcE2PK8qqnLhw We are on vacation and needed some really good Chinese food . We used Yelp and we were NOT disappointed!  Great food at a great price with huge servings. 

We started with the Hot and Sour soup. It was filled with lots of pork and other goodies in a rich broth.  Absolutely delicious! 

Our main courses were Mongolian beef and Sun Devil chicken. The chicken was my favorite- lots of slices of chicken breast with bell and jalapeño peppers in a delicate yet spicy sauce. The beef was loaded with tender slices along with onions and scallions in a flavorful brown sauce. Yum!

Complimentary fried won ton strips with sweet and sauce as well as a bowl of hot mustard were provided as we looked over the menu. The owner also brought us two free egg rolls part way through our meal. 

The owners are a married couple. We met the wife. She was so nice and welcoming and she was able  to chat with us after we finished. 

If we lived here, this would be "our" Chinese restaurant. 

Don't be fooled by the hole in the wall appearance. Looks can be deceiving!!!
