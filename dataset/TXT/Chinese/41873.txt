b7wUWVV01xaa7E0FUNMDiw I've been to Dai Lo twice last year. Both times, with different parties, I have had the Tasting Menu (Chef's choice). The first time, it was my host's choice and it gave our party of 4 a wonderful overview of the entire menu. 

The second time I went, it was a party of two. The tasting menu was still a great option. It covers many items you would wish to try anyhow. I am a bit of a spice/heat wimp and one of the dishes caught me off guard, but I wouldn't let that put anybody off. Look up their menu, and give it a try.

What I really enjoyed about the service at DaiLo is you don't have just one server. Everyone is in on it, so you're not left wanting a glass of water and trying to catch your server's eye. Love this place!
