HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA If you're one of those people that loves watching or "Top Chef", "Hell's Kitchen" or "Check, Please" not only to get your food porn fix, but to hear a great story behind the restaurant, you must make a trip to Fat Choy.

You can read all about Sheridan Sui here, http://fatchoylv.com/press, but simply put: this guy knows how to make bomb food in the most random of venues. Prior to Fat Choy, located in a less-than-impressive Vegas casinos, Sui was cooking up buns in a nail salon. And people lined up out the door to taste. It's gotta be good, right? 

Don't let the smoky, seedy Eureka Casino fool you... this is gourmet Asian fusion. With a few American staples still on the menu from the coffee shop who used to inhabit the space. It's very odd to see old, trucker-looking dudes hanging out here. But it's a dichotomy that I'm willing to wrestle in exchange for a gourmet bowl of sesame noodles, plate of shrimp toast (with egg on top), bone marrow or PBBLT (pork belly, bacon, lettuce and tomato). Gluttonous and divine.

Check out the menu: http://fatchoylv.com/food, by most people's standards, this food is CHEAP. Depending on the time of day or how busy the kitchen is, there could be a bit of a wait. But really, you can't rush noms like this. Just order a Kirin from one of the waitresses and she'll bring it to you in a tall, frosted mug. 

Definitely not part of the sexy Las Vegas strip, out-of-towners should call a cab to get here. Sure, you could walk but the heat will likely do you in before you make it in one piece. And you won't want to drag a food baby back with you, either. Go here for the non-traditional Vegas foodie experience... certainly off the grid and worth an adventure.
