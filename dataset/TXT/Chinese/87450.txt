hU1vaeTPmawvpzOyTEAK0Q This was my first visit to this business. I had booked an appointment and chosen a specific Massage Therapist - one of the options they offer when you book online. But when I got there, I had a different person with no explanation. The woman after me had also specifically booked one massage therapist she felt does a good job and again, did not get the person she had booked.

My MT did not speak English except for the rudimentary "ok?"  and "pain?" and there were times when more conversation would have been useful. But the massage was very good.
