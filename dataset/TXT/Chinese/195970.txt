ZKBUoCqTpwMtmImz64DGyQ The food was ok. My chicken was stringy and had some dark meat mixed in even though I specified white meat. The fried rice was barely fried and needed more soy sauce. Prices were average and delivery arrived earlier than anticipated. I don't know if I would order from here again though.
