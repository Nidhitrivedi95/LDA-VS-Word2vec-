Dx-Af02_QGi0dzItv4ANTg This place is outside of the "mall", closer to the Jacob outlet (to the left if you're facing Jacob).
Plastic sheets are the substitute for table cloths. It reminds when I was young when all the Chinese restaurants used them. 
I came here with my friend who just went here last week and enjoyed it. We ordered the duck roll pie, mushroom with shredded chicken noodle soup and pork & chive steamed dumplings. 
The duck roll pie is like Peking Duck wrap just a bit less crispy but just as fatty (which makes it delicious).  It's a bit difficult to eat as it falls apart easily so maybe not the best choice if you're coming here with someone that you're trying to impress. 
The mushroom with chicken noodle soup came with wood ear mushrooms (love them), king oyster mushroom, a lot of chicken pieces, bok choy and of course, noodles. It was a bit bland so we had to add hot sauce to it. Wouldn't get it again. 
The 8 dumplings were plump and really juicy. Yummeh. 
I think I'll have to come back and try other mains to really make a better call on this one.
