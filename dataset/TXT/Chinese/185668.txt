Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw Since moving to the East Valley almost a year and a half ago, we were baffled by the fact that we had not been able to find a decent Chinese take-out joint. One place we tried was almost inedible, and the others were places that we would not visit a second time.

Then we found this place. It was like finding a long-lost cousin. The food was very good. The prices were what you would expect. And the atmosphere was busy but very nice and comfortable.

The wife prominently declared this as "Our Chinese Place." I seconded the motion and look forward to visiting "our Chinese place" quite often.
