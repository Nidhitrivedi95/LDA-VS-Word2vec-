3v1c2BsFFcWlpV3S3LS8dA What a wonderful little place! Very nice customer service and friendly faces to greet you and take your order. Whether it's for a pickup or a dine in, it's always a pleasure. The food is with no doubt great, keeping consistent everytime. Whenever I'm in the mood for chinese food, that's my go to place. I highly recommend it to everyone.
