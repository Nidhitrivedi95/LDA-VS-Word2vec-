VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q I've been here several times. Food and service is consistent. There's good selection and when you feel like hot noodles on a cold day, it's a good choice. 

Food:
I like the ordering sheet so that I can customize everything I want. I'm pretty picky about no green onion and with that order sheet, it's very convenient. The combo is great, noodles and a drink with the option to add appetizers if you wish. Great selection of broth and toppings that taste good. 

Service:
Comfortable seating but service is a bit lacking. It's pretty much you order and hand in the sheet and eat (no tea refill unless you ask for it).
