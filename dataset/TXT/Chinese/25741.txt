7GfA5WMSRd-JCaPxnwgIQw Parking is tight in this area and this place is especially busy during dinner time but I'm usually in and out. 

So I went in Panda the other day for dinner. The customer service by the two young ladies in there was superb. They offered samples and assisted with menu election. 

Since I was waiting for fresh chow mein they offered me a free drink and just tried to make me feel comfortable while waiting. When my food was ready they bagged it up and gave me all the condiments I asked for. The service really stood out this trip. Thanks girls, keep it up. 

I ordered the 2 item combo with chow mein, and grilled chicken teriyaki - my fave, along with their famous orange chicken. Yummy when hot! 

I'm not too thrilled eating food that has been sitting for sometime so I don't mind waiting to have fresh food prepared.
