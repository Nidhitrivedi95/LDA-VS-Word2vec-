966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA I hate to give this place 2 stars but...

There were 5 of us and we all had something different. 

Food ordered: 
Pork sandwich and chicken sandwich - very boring.  It was just meat, iceburg lettuce, slice of tomato and some mayo.  

Fried fish fillet with Thai sauce...how about fried fish fillet with sweet chili pepper sauce that you get from the bottle (usually served with lumpia) served with rice and green beans.  I was so disappointed.

Fried dumplings appetizer - nothing to write home about.  Even the sauce had no inspiration.

Shredded chicken noodle soup - cousin ate this.  Said it was good.

Thai tea - not good, Red bean milk tea - eh, kid enjoyed the pineapple/mango/something something shake
 
Staff - friendly.  Owner came over and interacted with the kids.  She checked on us as well.  Me like.

Food service - didn't have to wait to long on getting food.

Overall - I feel bad about giving the 2 rating but the food was just so, blah, I feel I have no choice.  But the staff was wonderful!
