sp0kp2ZWmO0a6CcK-SGd-Q Really not much to brag about, only advantage is the long hours and nice decor for Chinatown.

I got 2 dishes to go.

Mongolian Beef was insanely sour with barely any veggies a steep $15.
The duck was a bit better, but lacked much seasoning (just 5-6 chunks) (more reasonable $10)

The service was very direct, barely giving me time to order or look at the menu, much less ask questions.
Food was suspiciously prepared in less than 5 minutes, and the result was what felt like re-heated food.
