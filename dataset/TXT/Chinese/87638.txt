HV3Q2JYwK9AvMHPYXcxzag I'm so glad that Silver Dragon is back with the same owners. Our family use to come to their place on Dunlap religiously as kids growing up back in the 90's. The 2 main things that I highly recommend getting is their  beef stew and  Hong Kong Style soup dumpling. It is one of the most flavorful and tender Chinese beef stews you can find in the valley.  Even my grandparents have no issue eating this. And their soup dumplings are made to perfection, with just the right amount of pork and shrimp. Remember to ask for the Chinese menu when ordering, this has more of the authentic Chinese food offerings. And don't worry there is English on the Chinese Menu :).
