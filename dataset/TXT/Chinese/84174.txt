HG9m9eldYtnX_UeMt4Yy2w first, this place is not a dim sum place. this is just a regular taiwanese restaurant.
not sure why they named it dim sum. lol
the food were good.
we had tons of food that we ordered and the quality of the food were consistance. 
again, this place is Taiwanese food. so don't order anything other than taiwanese food, if you want other food, then go to regular chinese restaurant. :)
taiwanese noodle is the typical food. (beef noodle soup, or try the spicy peanut noodle)
if you don't want to explore, try pork chop with rice.
