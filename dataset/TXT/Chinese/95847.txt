JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA I am so happy to have found an authentic Taiwnese restaurant for breakfast.  I do miss my hot soy milk and chinese donut and they do it well here.  We tried several dishes including ones not so... breakfast-y because I just wanted to try them.  As usual, I end up ordering too much had couldn't finish it all, but very satiated as I walk out knowing that I sample great number of dishes and still have money left to gamble.... 

Next day, we came back, though right after we've had a lunch (at another restaurant on my list to try) and walked away with handful of take outs to enjoy in our hotel room for late night snack.....
