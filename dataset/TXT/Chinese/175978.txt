wMiGwn4qPvEN17CaQ3Zi4g I haven't eaten at Bright Pearl in the past year because the last time I went (so as not to insult visiting guests' choice of restaurant), I was royally displeased. 

For an recent review, please see Bijan's review. Based on my past experience, I agree wholeheartedly and would like to append something that I noticed and relates to his points:

If you look carefully at "shrimp" dumplings, har gow, wontons, fried rolls, etc., the "shrimp" is actually pork fat (white chunks) with a little shrimp mixed in for effect. Having said that, the shrimp is low quality and kinda needs the added fat. 

It's sad that the decor is so gawdy too, since tourists to Chinatown tend to take this as authentic in our city of much greater Chinese cuisine.
