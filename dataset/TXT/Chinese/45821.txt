BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ We came in during dinnertime for a friend's birthday. Ambiance and service is really nice. The server communicated well with us about pricing, and even gave the birthday girl a free dessert. We just had no idea the food was going to be so horrendously mediocre at such a nice restaurant.

First of all, the corkage fee is $15... just for uncorking our wine. We thought, "well this is a fancy restaurant we should be prepared to pay that amount." We opened the menu and taken aback because we only found chinese buffet dishes like general tso's, lo mein, and egg rolls.  We figured a nice restaurant like this should be giving it an unorthodox or elevated spin so we ordered the Sichuan beef tenderloin, thai basil stirfry, and wok fried broccoli. We were getting ready for the best goddamn broccoli ever. 

Sichuan beef tenderloin: they just cut up and STIR FRIED the FILET MIGNON to a rubber texture. The broccoli and thai basil had the exact same sauce drowning these overcooked vegetables. It was appalling they were charging $26 for something that was identical in presentation and taste to a college student's takeout, except it was served on a porcelain plate instead of styrofoam. As asians we're not even asking for authenticity, we're just asking for quality proportional to the price, and we're begging to know who keeps coming back for ratchet chinese takeout for $26 because this place is obviously well liked at 3.5 stars. 

2/10 would not recommend coming back for dinner.
