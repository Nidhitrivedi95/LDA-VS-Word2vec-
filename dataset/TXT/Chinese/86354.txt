HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA This is CHOY good! I would say a whole in the wall that a lot of people don't know. This place looks nothing like an Asian restaurant but don't judge it for it's looks haha. I come here for the Pork belly buns and duck buns. Awesome Awesome! So great! Plus the server was great and made the experience. This place is going to be on diner drivers and something from the food channel now in a few months. Come here before it gets to big! This place is awesome.
