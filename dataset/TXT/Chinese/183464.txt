XplJHcYSQTFlwv3Rk8WsYw Came here for the xiao long bao and was left disappointed. Only 2 out of 8 xiao long bao had soup, which most likely indicated the restaurant froze them and then steamed it when people order. 

The pan fried pork buns. The bun ratio to meat is like 4 to 1. All you see when you first bite into it is the bun and a tiny bit of pork with some juice. 

The Chinese fried rice was nice and fresh. It had just the right amount of crunchiness.

The Shanghai style savoury soy milk soup was a let down. They were missing a number of key ingredients that made this soup what it is. 

Overall this place was a miss for me after driving so far.
