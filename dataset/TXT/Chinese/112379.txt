mHcfv-cdbx1LtR3n3FoooA This place has great food at a good price. The portions are huge enough to share which makes it super cheap. I had been here several times and the only complaint I had was the iced tea, it was terrible. They could also add a little more heat (spice) to their dishes, but not a big deal.

The last time I went in was a really negative experience. I ordered the orange chicken with white rice and an extra order of the white rice. All was fine until they brought out the orange chicken with no rice at all. They said they didn't have any white rice. I'm not sure why they didn't tell me that from the beginning especially since I asked for an extra order of it. The problem was this, they had plenty of white rice but since so many people call their orders in and pick it up, they gave the rice to them. They had the rice that I ordered, I know this because my sister-in-law (whom I turned on to this place) actually came in when my food was delivered to the table without the white rice. I ended up just leaving the place after paying for my crab puffs and I text my sister-in-law to see if they got white rice. Yep, they sure did. 

It is not good business to do that sort of thing. They are a Chinese restaurant...you would think they would have enough white rice, but I guess not. It didn't seem like they understood the problem. They said sorry and that was the extent of it. Haven't been back since.
