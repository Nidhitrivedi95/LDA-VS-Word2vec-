_c6CpqB2d1L7kbSVbE9HAw I won't even spend too much time writing a review on this place, food taste like they put all the right ingredients into a bowl with the meat and microwaved it. 

I ordered 

Thai green curry (it wasn't green)
Beef and black bean sauce( no black bean)
Deep fried crispy chicken wings 
(The wings were very good)

I called back to complain and they didn't answer the phone. 9 pm
