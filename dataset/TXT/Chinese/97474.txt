JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw I got the pork belly hand pulled noodles. The noodles were tasty and fresh, but the soup was a little salty. I also got the pork and cabbage dumplings which was also good. At one point they did some noodle making which was fun to watch. The shop was clean, service was fast and friendly.

I would recommend this place.
