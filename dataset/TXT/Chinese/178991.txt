x7RxFtOnRXKEagcsDiwrAQ Cheap eats and free delivery! Offering several different styles of Asian cuisine including sushi, thai, szechwan and more. The dinning room is a bit drab and outdated (I think it used to be a diner before...?) so I usually opt for delivery. The sushi is always fresh and they've always been able to substitute tofu in any dish for my vegetarian friends. Nothing mind blowing but a decent, inexpensive option in the neighborhood.
