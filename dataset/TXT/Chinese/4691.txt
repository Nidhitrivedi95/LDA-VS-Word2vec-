_XmJ3Y-yGxG2BENWBnYWVQ Got lunch here, and will probably get it again but not somewhere I'd go by choice.

Pros: Second best Mongolian Beef I've had out here, tasted perfect. The veggies also tasted fresh and not frozen or anything along those lines. Egg Roll and Crab Puff were tasty as well, two items I hardly consume at other Asian joints. Food was also done at the time I ordered at, which was great to pick-up when you have a :30 minute lunch break.

Cons: Asked for extra spicy, wasn't even spicy. Tiny portions.
