AktuBx1W7c3ZdzwuaOp8xg That was the most disgusting Chinese food ever. It smelled so good but when I looked at it I knew something was wrong. I ordered the combination rice.....It suppose to come with chicken, shrimp and BBQ pork. Okay.....The pork was not BBQ it was raw, warmed meat....the chicken was chewy looking and undercooked, the shrimp looked warmed as well. It seems like they may microwave their food, which explains how fast it was prepared. I didn't even eat it. I had already tasted the egg roll, and little chips they provided, which was the only thing I had....Now my throat is starting to close and tongue is swelling. I'm allergic to crab and I hope they didn't cook it in the same oil...My husband ordered the veggie with tofu meal...Its called the Buddha delight. He threw his out too after we began reading the reviews on here. Soooo we just wasted money on crap food. I'm reporting them to Action13 news or something because honestly I don't think they're up to code.
