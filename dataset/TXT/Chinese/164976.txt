uxSL4FHWiO-fr2iae_d3Bw My boyfriend and I were seated at a table almost in the middle of the dining area when there were hardly any people there. The only people infact, were dining at booths (most in only groups of two). So, why did we get stuck where the world could see us even after we made it obvious a booth was preferred? I have no idea. Also, as more people eventually came in for dinner, they were all seated at open booths. I don't know, I just didn't like (nor do I ever) being in the middle of the room as the only people dining at a table. It was just strange.

The food was good and our actual waiter was decent enough. It's too expensive to go back considering the portions aren't worth the price. Also, this is more of a 2.5 star review...nothing great, not completely awful.
