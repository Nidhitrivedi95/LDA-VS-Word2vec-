oMF1F795PpnITiNfOR1e2A I had the most amazing lunch with their popular Laksa dish and fresh fruit tea. I felt the lunch was prepared with love and served with smile. They played beautiful and calm instrumental music (sort of meditation music found on YouTube) which relaxes you and brings positive thoughts. 

According to the friendly volunteers at the restaurant (servers, chef etc. all are volunteers) they are the only one that serve fresh fruit tea in Canada. Every dish here is for $7. 

I still have the taste of delicious vegetarian Laksa in my mouth. I know I will be back here very soon. My only regret-why I didn't come here any sooner. 

I'll leave you with a beautiful quote found on the menu of this restaurant - "A Kindness Received Is Returned Many Times Over".
