My boyfriend and I were a little put off at the location of the TV though. It cuts up the ambiance, I would have considered facing it away from the sidewalk.

Service was awesome. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the restaurant and menu. Food came out fast. My boyfriend was a little put off by the bartender though as he was not very friendly. We only sat at the bar for one drink so this didn't ruin our night.

Prices are definitely up there. An appetizer and a few small plates will put you over $20. Sushi is very expensive compared to what you can get at some other Madison establishments. My boyfriend had the Bacon and Egg Fried Rice. He said it was very good, though there were too many pieces of bacon that were just chewy pieces of fat. I had the Veggie Buns and the TKO roll. The Veggie Buns were very good, I really enjoyed the peanut/sriracha/miso combo. The sushi rolls were okay. I appreciated the tempura pineapple as I've never had it before. It was just as it sounds - sweet and crispy! There was far too much rice on the rolls however. It really muddled the flavors from the rest of the roll. 

I would still return and try it out again in a few months. Hopefully they dial down the prices a bit so you can try more for your money!
