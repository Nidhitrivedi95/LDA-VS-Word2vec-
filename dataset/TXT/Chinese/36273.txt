Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Sat at the bar, the bartender was great friendly and very helpful. We got some sake and some kind of strawberry martini that quite possible was the best martini I have ever tasted. Egg drop soup was a big serving and delicious so was the fried rice and the sushi. Great place, great experience will definitely be back and recommend it!
