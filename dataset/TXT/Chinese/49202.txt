CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw We stepped into noodles for dinner couple of days back. They had a long line for tables but we're ready to seat us at the counter. Not a great seat location but definitely worth it if you're hungry! We ordered sesame balls, Malaysian style roti prata for first course and they were delicious. For the main course we had Penang style noodles(veggie version with tofu) and veggie fried rice. We loved both! The service was slow but that might have been because the restaurant was packed. Our waitress, Pauline I think was great - super friendly and kept checking on us frequently. Overall the experience was great and the food was amazing! Will come back again!
