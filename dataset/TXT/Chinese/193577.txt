ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ This was my first trip to the restaurant several of my friends raved about. They were right to rave. I loved the layout; it was open and inviting. Every dish we had was a true reflection of the chef's excellent reputation. I'm really looking forward to going back to explore more of the menu and the awesome drinks. It's a great place to go with a group of friends or for a nice date night out. The prices were reasonable and the food was fresh. We will be back soon.
