IdVoDto0eqtzzH5B4bpvsA Barely any parking, the waitress is clueless, the food in mediocre, the price is high. How do you charge nearly $11 (after tax) for a bowl of Satay Beef Vermicelli (which comes with an HK bun and drink) that is marginally just filling? Everything on the menu is priced at a premium without serving anything at a premium. You are better off avoiding this place and going back to your typical hk cafe around the area which can beat this place with quality and value.
