E0h1kK-8P_DtBHk5ClVI_g I want to give this place higher and may in a later review, but a few things don't appeal to me.

Decor: 3/5 - okay for a Chinese restaurant

Ambiance: 1/5 - how is it you say that decor is 3/5 and ambiance is 1/5?  The music and what the waiters were wearing (ugly pink aprons).  The music was depressing and it was very dark outside.  When I left the restaurant, I was like "wow, it's nice to be outside".  

Food: 3/5 - tried the eel fried rice and not much eel.  Maybe I'm spoiled but any Congee Queen or Congee Dynasty is better.  

Service: 3/5 - they were informative, but what I didn't like was that they posted lunch specials and I had to pay an extra $1 and the reason was "eel has gone up in price". They should at least update their menu.n

Price: 4/5 for their specials.  

Not bad and might visit again, but the ambiance was such a mood killer.
