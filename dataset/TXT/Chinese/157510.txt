There are several tables near the back that are quite close to the washroom, and the washroom itself isn't exactly the cleanest.

Food-wise, Congee Wong was the first to introduce their famous Singapore turnip cake, one of my favourite dishes to order with congee. It used to my crispy and delicious, but now it lacks the lustre and taste it once had.
