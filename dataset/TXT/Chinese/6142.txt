Yesterday, I was craving some Chinese food when, lo and behold!, what should I stumble upon? The previously discarded Chopstick Express menu. Now, I don't have terribly high expectations of Chinese food outside of New York, but we were pleasantly surprised by both the price and flavor of our meal.

Jamie was coming home for lunch, so I ordered delivery--the shrimp in lobster sauce Lunch combo for me, the mongolian beef Lunch combo for him, then an order of potstickers and a quart of honey-dipped chicken.

Wow. I've been searching EVERYWHERE for boneless honey chicken, and this did not disappoint--it was slathered in this sweet sauce, yet still crispy! 

the Lunch combos come with fried rice, a cream cheese wonton, and a spring roll--all steaming hot and very flavorful. my shrimp in lobster sauce was delicious, but nothing special; it tasted pretty much just like it had at the last place, and the place before that. 

the mongolian beef, on the other hand, was phenomenal! tangy, crispy, maybe a little too salty, but still incredible...it almost tasted  like it had been cooked in teriyaki sauce.

another plus--we were worried that Jamie would have to bring a frozen pizza back to work with him for lunch, since they said the food would arrive at about 12:45(when he leaves for work again)...but they showed up at 12:25! so..yay :)
