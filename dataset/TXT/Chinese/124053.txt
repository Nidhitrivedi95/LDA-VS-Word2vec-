ooZQt0jRqrJ_ejhjP8C4Mg We went quickly through the drive thru with a simple order. Dominique was extremely rude. She kept correcting us that it was called a Panda bowl with chicken instead of a orange chicken bowl. No where on the menu is a panda bowl listed. I hope when we get home this order is correct.
