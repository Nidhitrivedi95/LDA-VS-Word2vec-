I brought some friends to come eat at this place because of how good it was before, but seeing how they are so un-open to the idea of new customers trying new things, it really bothered me as a regular customer. We didn't ask for much, and we were very patient when they took their time to take our orders. Overall, I've never seen worse customer service in my life.
