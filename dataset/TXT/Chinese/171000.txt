vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA There is usually a long wait, so my boyfriend and I decided to go early.

There wasn't that much of a selection and it took about an hour after opening for food to really come out.  Once it did service was still slow.

Their lo mei gei was made with long grain rice, which I did not like.  Their food was fresh and good quality, but was lacking in taste.
