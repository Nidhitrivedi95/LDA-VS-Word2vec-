68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw I love restaurants that are consistent with food quality and Asian Legend is one. The dumplings are generally finely done (e.g. not too thick on the dough) and the franchises have the best hot and sour soup pretty much city wide. The menu is huge and I have never had anything that is under par. The main problem is the 2 inches between you and the next table. It's just too close and can be really quite loud. Not great if you want a quiet date night.
