VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q i really like this place! but it's not very budget friendly since you can easily run up to over $10 a person.. and i guess it's kinda worth it considering the portion you are getting. the fish soup is very delicious! ox tongues were great as well! and the hk style milk tea is sooo good!
