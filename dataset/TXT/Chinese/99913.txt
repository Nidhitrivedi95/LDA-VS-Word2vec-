JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA Our first visit was amazing! The gal at the cash register made sure we knew they wanted us to fill our bowls to the brim, unlike most Mongolian eateries. She further helped us with the sauces, making sure we had the flavor we wanted. Additionally, we observed the manager sweeping the floor, assisting customers and interacting with customers and his employees in such a way, that it was clear the employees were a team... They seemed to love their work... Which spills over into a welcome overall environment! Good food, healthy, tasty...upbeat! Great lunch. Thanks!
