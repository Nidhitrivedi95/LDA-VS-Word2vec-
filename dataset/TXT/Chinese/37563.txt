aPBTwoHvuVKHP2zkiKvwQQ By far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I called by phone to order food and I said twice I couldn't understand you and they hung up on me. I called back and the same person answered and continued to yell at me, now this whole time I was polite and understanding and just wanted some orange chicken... Never got my chicken.
