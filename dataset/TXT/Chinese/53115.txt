They have lunch specials which includes soup, egg roll and crab puff. I usually take their orange chicken as you get a lot of chicken which fills up your plate. I also like their chicken with veggies, chicken lo mein  when I'm starved and need carbs (comes with soft noodles and rice).

The food is pretty good for what you pay and it is always a joy to go there and chit chat with the staff when not too busy.
