KHxuTxhVt0smTGngblIjSA So my wife and I just came back to Brampton recently and needed to find a good Chinese restaurant that competed with the golden stove (which I reviewed on here, check it out if you haven't yet) in Etobicoke, Lakeshore area. To our surprise first place we picked was Sunlight. So far we have ordered delivery twice and we are very pleased. The food is great, cooked perfectly and tasty. It is a little pricey compared to our other place but I think it is worth the extra considering there isn't much around (as far as i know, if you have suggestions that would be great) 

One thing I would recommend them changing on one of thier dishes would be the shrimp fried rice. Instead of unflavoured jumbo shrimp try adding some cooked miniature shrimps, would be a lot tastier rice for sure. Still good though.

If you're looking for big portions and a not so bad price, definitely check this place out! Oh and try the orange chicken, really good.

Friday night deliveries could take a while, about an hour and half to be exact so order early!! That is all.

Enjoy!!!
