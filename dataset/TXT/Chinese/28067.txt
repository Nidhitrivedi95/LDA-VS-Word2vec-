8keN8Z2sylAEXgMCJMQpDg Placed our pick-up order online last night for My House chinese restaurant. Went over 10 mins later.. 45 min wait for food. So had a glass of wine at Frys while we waited :) "glass half full"

While we were there, the (young) owner came out.. stressed as all get out.. about having to close again at 6:30. He hasn't slept in 2 days and he's super worried about food quality and customer service.. people have been commenting about his restaurant on Facebook so more people have been coming out.. he's been open for 6 days.. Let's say you've been working on a job for 6 days and your boss tells you that you suck at your job, do you quit and give up? No way!!!!  

If you happen to be hangry today, please choose a different day to try these guys out.. you won't be disappointed!
