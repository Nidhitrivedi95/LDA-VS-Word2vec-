ZIdR-IopAtU5PH_mGtUAbw Not that bad.  For the price the quality and quantity are good! The food does need a little more seasonings. Will I order out again?! Sure,  the food wasn't supper bad..the only thing I didn't enjoy was the egg rolls waaay to much cinnamon. 

Shrimp in shrimp fried rice is small but has a good amount of them. 

Egg rolls way to much cinnamon.

Chicken fried rice not much flavor. 

Kung Pao Chicken was good.
