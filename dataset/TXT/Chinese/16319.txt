44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw My family loves this restaurant. We all have varied tastes and enjoy exploring the entire menu. My favorite is eggplant and shrimp with schezuan sauce. The staff is friendly and efficient, much better than the current restaurant trend of smothering attention. 
Highly recommend.
