TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA yeah, it might be a little eerie and kill bill-ish in there, but the food is fantastic. we were the only ones in there for a while so it was extra eerie..the service was alright. very ethnic and authentic chinese atmosphere, not so americanized.

the pot of tea was piping hot but especially delicious. the wonton chips were a good start. we went with the moo shoo pork and kung pao chicken, both pretty good. the crepes that the moo shoo pork came in were so soft and fluffy and the meat and seasonings were spot on. the kung pao chicken was a little water and not as spicy as i thought it was going to be. but it had peanuts, bamboo shoots, and my favorite chinese vegetable, water chestnuts...mmmm. the big bowl of rice we got was delicious as well.

and all for under $20. grubby good. especially for a city with lackluster chinese food.
