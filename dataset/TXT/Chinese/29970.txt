Well, get this, my boyfriend and I decided to go out on a limb and try Wendy's ingenious Tom Yum Goong Fried Rice ($10.95). Holy freaking amazeballs #%^*!! It was incredible!

Seriously. Close your eyes and imagine this: Lemongrass+tender seafood+sweet+sour+spicy+comfort+warmth+dancing taste buds. 

Ok, now, what did you imagine? Tom Yum soup right? Right! That's what this fried rice is all about. They added a whole bunch of seafood (squid, shrimp, white fish) and they were all cooked flawlessly - moist, tender, juicy and seasoned well! They even had crispy charred bits that popped in my mouth and added explosive flavor. Also, the rice was moist and had incredible lemongrass flavor; the spices were all very flavorful. There was a raging party in my mouf! I need to thank Wendy for reawakening my love for what I thought was boring fried rice, I will forever be grateful.

The other dishes we ordered were also tasty:
- House Special Chow Mein (Crispy Noodles) with tender beef and veggies ($7.99) - Huge portion and very flavorful gravy sauce. Let's be real, the gravy sauce makes or breaks the dish, well, they seasoned it amazing here. They packed it with a lot of noodles and beef. Not too many veggies, but that's ok with us!

- Rib Eye and white shimeji roll (from the tapas menu) (about $4)- So simple, but it really surprised us. The ribeye was juicy, tender and the flavor of the meat shined! The buttery mushrooms were cooked perfectly and had a lovely buttery bite.

- Rib Eye bao burger ($9.99) - Great rib eye flavor, super fluffy and soft bao buns, and comes with a side of tangy fresh salad that tastes great when you stuff it into the bao burgers! Also try dipping it in Hoisen plum sauce for extra flavor!

- Pepper glazed spare ribs clay pot ($9.99) - this dish is a classic! It really brings me back to my childhood (Vietnamese has a same dish called "thit kho to" - It comes out bubbling hot and served with white rice (check out my video!) It's an explosion of sweet and salty flavor. (Note: they have lots of small bones attached, so be extra cautious when chewing/swallowing) 

- Spicy steak cubes and rice cake with ramen ($8.99) - I typically don't like rice cakes because they are too plain, filling, and bland, but my boyfriend loves them. They were cut into smaller pieces and not too chewy (that's a good thing.) The sauce was deliciously sweet, not to spicy at all in our opinion (we eat chili peppers for breakfast!) and the beef was very tender. My biggest complaint was that there wasn't enough sauce. :/

- Mung Bean, Red Bean, Jelly, Coconut Milk and crushed ice drink! ($3.99) - Yessss!!! This dessert drink was the perfect ending to our meal. I really enjoyed the mung bean, red bean, and jelly bits and texture while slurping them up with the wide boba straw. Sweet, refreshing, and cheap!

Wendy has great prices! I mean, the house special chow mein noodles is cheap! For $7.99, the amount of noodles and beef they gave us was enough for 2 starving adults to get their fill. And $4 for a icy delicious dessert drink is a nice price point if you ask me. My wallet thinks so...
