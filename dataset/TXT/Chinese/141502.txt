Rg4FHrDOD2DJeDY_khy-0w Worst Pei Wei ever. Came in on a Saturday around 7 pm and the place was a disaster. Only one soda machine was working so there was a huge line to get drinks, they were out of napkins silverware etc. and it took forever to get our food. My sushi sat out on the counter for so long it was room temperature by the time I received it. When I went to the register to get a refund the employees couldn't figure out how to process the transaction and that also took forever. Not recommended.
