qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA Favourite Mississauga AYCE sushi, and I've been to a LOT of them (168, Kanda, AYCE in SQ1, Sushi Sushi, Momiji, Prince..). I'm a big fan of sashimi, and they get it right! The rolls are good, a good ratio of rice to fillings. They also have a lot of non-sushi options (generally Thai or americanized Chinese) which is great for my BF who's not as into sushi as I am. iPad menu is nice, but I would go here even if they didn't have it.

Just a tip: You can get the dinner menu (aka, sashimi!!) at lunch, but you'll have to pay the dinner price. They do have the items available, though.
