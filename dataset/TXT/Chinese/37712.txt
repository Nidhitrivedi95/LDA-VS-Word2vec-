aqszoKRB4Ol9bpemt0_-GQ I was definitely underwhelmed with this food. The service was super quick and it was delivered to me in less than 30 minutes (I only live 4 or 5 blocks from the place).
The sesame chicken was decent. It was the best part of the meal. The spring roll was tasty but the egg roll was blah.
I did not enjoy the house lo mein. The meat in it was gray and chewy. It lacked any flavor. The beef and broccoli also had a very strange taste to it....almost lemony? 
Overall, I will not be coming back to SoHo Bistro. I ordered from them for the convenience but I'd prefer to drive somewhere and get decent Chinese food.
