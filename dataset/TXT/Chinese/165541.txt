v1vcs-uSAQcjTFsHxS1dug This is the worst chinese restaurant we ever order food from.  Not just the flavors are bad, they can even screw up a simple hot and sour soup in the worst possible way.  The main dishes are meatless full of vegetables without hardly any pork or beef, which is what we ordered.
We lived in the Moon Valley area for many years and  used to go there, but now it is not what it was ten years ago, it is a complete disgrace.
Will not go back or order food from them again.
