yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Pros:

Spacious interior that accommodates tons of people.

24hrs!

Attentive service, even during the busiest hours. 

Vegan pho & fresh spring rolls with tofu are mighty delicious.

Fresh Thai coconuts! Ask for yours to be opened, the "meat" is so yummy!

Cons:

Always would appreciate more vegan friendly options...

There are often long lines.

Small tables for a large group - you are often almost knocking your dishes off, lol (and I'm quite small).
