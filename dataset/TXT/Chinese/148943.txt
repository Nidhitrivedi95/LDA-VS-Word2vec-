SmYGe2qXVsP8zXjhwJkNBw Typical no frills hot pot. Choices are quite basic. This time our fatty beef was the leanest chewiest beef ever. No fat marbling at all.  Surprisingly the Chicken slices were the best since it was at least tender. Sauces are abundant but missing peanut option. 12.99 for the standard beef option.
