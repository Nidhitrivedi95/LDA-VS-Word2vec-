7-Wlpm30PGCBIZtH2rOlew My review is biased because of my mom. 

She spends 6 hours to 2 days on her pho, using real bones and bone marrows to create the broth from scratch. When made this way, a layer of fat should be floating at the top of the broth--to indicate the bones that were simmered. Also she makes it with oxtail in addition to the rare beef.

It's quite obvious for me, an experienced Phodie, that their pho is mediocre. 
I ordered the Pho Tai. A simple bowl of rice noodles and rare beef. 

The broth wasn't hot enough to soften the bean sprouts. The rice noodles were undercooked. The broth was clearly from bouillon cubes. And there wasn't enough beef.

At $7 it's a desperate substitute for real pho. 

However I'm a fan of Thai food, so I may come back to try that side of their menu.

P.s. Bobas should only be bought from a place that only sells boba.
