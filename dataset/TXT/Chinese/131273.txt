pIB-Js9drl27qrrSjKK_eA I've been a fan of Xi'an Famous Foods in New York City and we've never had a good option for this style of food and the vibe in Toronto.  Artisan Noodles is a great option.

Excellent Biang Biang noodles with a good balance of spicy, savoury and vinegar flavours.  The flavours lace your mouth with a just the right amount of heat (OK, after I put a little more chili on, then perfect!) and sour.

Also had the Yo Po Mian which was also good - almost like a vegetarian version of the Biang Biang... without the meat... or tomato... or eggs... OK, so it's different.  But still spicy, sour, savoury good.

Obviously the star of the show here are those hand pulled, hand slapped noodles.  They are wide and flat noodles that are roughly ripped.  They are chewier and denser than your typical asian noodles, and they carry the flavour of the sauces wonderfully.

Also had:
- Potato Jia-Mo - a sandwich made of potato and tofu with a spicy gravy.  The flavour was really good, among the better sandwiches of these types (even for being meatless) I've had, but the bread could have been a bit crispier on the outside.
- Liang Pi - OMG, I love Liang Pi, and this did not disappoint, but with my all the other noodles, it was just noodle overload!
- Tossed Cucumber - Another good dish, fresh cucumbers with a sour and sesame flavoured dressing.  I would order this again all the time, as it is a great fresh side dish that pairs well against the heavy, spicy, noodle dishes.

The only reason I wouldn't rate it higher, is that it is a bit cramped.  There are lots of people going in and out, to pick up take-out, pay up front, that you never really feel comfortable in that place.
