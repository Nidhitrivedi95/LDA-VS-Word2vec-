9prl00viUUFrEcPIpXZDOw I don't usually venture out to Sauga for food (since the GTA area often has better Chinese food). But I happened to be in the area and tried this place out.

Overall pretty solid Chinese food! Got the $25 for three dishes, soup, and dessert. I especially liked the beef brisket & radish dish because the brisket was really lean (the way I like it). Price is reasonable compared to other Chinese places.
