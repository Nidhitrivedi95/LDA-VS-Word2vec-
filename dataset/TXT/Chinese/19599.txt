5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Blossom takes Chinese food to the next level.  Not only is the dining space incredibly elegant and beautiful, the food is very elegant and fine as well.  We tried be Peking duck, sweet-and-sour fish, watercress and pork soup, and mung bean dessert soup.  The Peking duck was excellent, and I like how the servers prepare it tableside for you.  The other dishes were also very good.  But, I think the most memorable were the duck and the soup.
