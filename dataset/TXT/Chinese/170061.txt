VvSmE1NnTjnaTPHT0WrCaQ Yuuuum. I'm not vegetarian, but do try to cut down on my meat eating ways every so often, and this is my go to place for a delicious vegetarian meal. 

I do wish they had more gluten free meals (they are listed in the menu) but I guess you can't please everyone!

We've liked all the dishes we've had here, but my two favourite dishes here are: 

- Soy-Fritters with Mango and Asparagus (description from web site: Fresh and delicious! Fresh mango and asparagus cooked with soy-fritters)
- Enoki Mushroom Balls (description from web site: Enoki mushrooms wrapped in a seaweed sheets and stir-fried in a savoury sauce, served on a bed of vegetables)
