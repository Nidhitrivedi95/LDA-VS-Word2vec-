mpG1R1ktTI3x1twNBsGvXQ I am shocked that this place has such a high rating. At a table of three, all three meals were inedible and the waitress didnt even care that we hadnt eaten anything. If you are a waitress and none of the people have taken more than a bite or two of their food, I think that would be cause for concern, but it isnt my profession so perhaps i am mistaken. 
Literally nothing we got was good. I am not sure legally you are even allowed to call that Pad Thai. There has to be standards people.. You can't go to an Asian restaurant and give it 5 stars because you liked their Hot and Sour soup. Maybe we all ordered the wrong thing.. Maybe if i had only gotten that magestic General Tso's Chicken or the magical sushi rolls, then i would have been forced to rate this differently, but this might have been one of the worst Asian meals that we have collectively had. 
It was rather pricey to return to give it another shot. I think this was one of those places that I will not be giving a second chance. Unfortunate because it was in a good location. Which is definitely worth the one star.
