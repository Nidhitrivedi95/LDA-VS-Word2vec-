U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Fresh noodles - YUM. Everything else - Egh.

Meat was dry in every dish I had - probably pre-cooked.

I liked the noodles so much that came back to give them another chance.  Same bad, dry chicken. Some people mentioned the eggplant - maybe that is better than their carnivorous dishes.

Decor is interesting and different, but really messes with your eyes after awhile. (need to see some photos to know what I mean)

Service was slow and impersonal.
