pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I ate here recently with a group of 5. We let the waiter select our menu for the night which I think is a great way to dine here. My only complaint is that we had too much food and I ate too much before the sushi came. Next time I will decrease the amount we spend per person and ask for the sushi to come sooner in the meal. We really enjoyed the Yellowtail Taquitos, Sea Bass and the Wagyu beef that we cooked on hot rocks!!! This was awesome!! Service was excellent!! I will go back!!
