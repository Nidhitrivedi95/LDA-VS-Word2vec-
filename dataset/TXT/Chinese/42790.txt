beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw The BEST thing about this restaurant is their service. The food on the conveyor belt is great too, but the service makes it so much more enjoyable. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. Don't know what you are doing? No problem...just ask. Definitely coming back with friends and family. There's a good variety of foods that will suit everyone's taste.
