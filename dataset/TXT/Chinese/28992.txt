We came on a Tuesday at around 9:45 a.m. wanting to get the before 11:00 a.m. special pricing. I believe all dishes besides XL are charges at the small price which is 3.50.

Our first dish was this yellow ball desert pastry. I forget if there is durian in there. It was piping hot but overly sweet. B-
The squid tentacles were good but did not come out piping hot the way I prefer it. B
The hak gow was good with rich flavour and good texture but was overly salty. A-
The siu ma was big but it was heavy and the texture was not great. B- to B
There were these durian pastries too that I had days later which were okay but might have been better the day of. B-
We had angus beef in egg noodles and it was okay, nothing special. B-

We recently had a terrible experience at Ginger & Onion and this was definitely much better than that, but everything was a B- 7/10 quality.

I get dragged to dim sum rather than voluntarily going, so I could go a year or two without it and would not think I am missing much. I would not wait in line to get in here. I would only come back if I could not find better, but I am sure there is better out there.

3.5 stars.
