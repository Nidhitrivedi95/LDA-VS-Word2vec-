iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A This far exceeds the other chinese place I had to eat a while back....

For starters, when they say "one hour" wait for delivery, it means like 20 minutes.  Awesome.  I'm not a patient person.

Otherwise their portions are amazing.  I ate leftovers for 3 days.  And cheap.  And amazing.  And so so so good.  *droool*

So we got teriyaki chicken, black pepper beef, veggie chow mein, and combination fried rice.  Plus you get 2 sides of regular white rice.  The chicken was PERFECTLY tender with a light sear and they did not short you on the teriyaki sauce.  It was warm, and delicious, and flavorized your mouth so good.  so so so good.  *more drooling*  The black pepper beef was not over-spiced and it was tender.  

Try it out.  You may like :)  Plus I always over-tip the delivery guy and he now remembers us and always brings us a special treat :)
