jKduhy-gJ9hyFzd1au6pOg I don't eat at Panda Express often but when I do I always say "why did I just pay for batter"? The orange chicken and Beijing beef were dry and crispy. Some pieces had barely any meat but other than that the rest were like I said dry and crispy. The sauce is always really good but other than that it's a sorry excuse for a place to eat.
