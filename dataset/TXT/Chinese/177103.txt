WuQZ5iesON7NWTDWgwWlbQ I love this place! After coming here twice, it's about time they deserve a review. I love coming here for their creative dishes rather than the typical ones I get back in Brooklyn, New York. This place is beautiful and huge! There a lot of parking spaces available but can still be quite difficult to find a spot if you come on a busy weekend morning. The service is poor and I try to be considerate that it's quite busy. It took me forever to flag someone down for some napkins and a fork. I like the western style but the teacups has to go, I did not enjoy a cup of cold tea. They finally changed my plate when I was full already. 

The earlybird special is $3.00 for any S, M, or L dish.
