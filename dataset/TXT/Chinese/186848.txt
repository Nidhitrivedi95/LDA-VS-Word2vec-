yDJhScdD8cCCYfO4WNb-CQ Times like this I wish yelp had half stars, I would have rated 3.5. The food can be the most amazing Canadian-Chinese food I've ever had however more than once I've had a brutal experience. I only get take-out, It is expensive but you get a 10% cash discount on pickup. I ordered for 2 last night and it was $63 for chowmein, 3 mains, one springroll and a small steamed rice however it was one of those amazing bang on nights and well worth it. The last time I ordered for 3 $78 and it was so terrible I walked back and asked for a full refund which was the only time out of more than 20+ orders where I actually did that. I'm thinking maybe they put a note in my account not to screw with me because I will return and be a very polite pain. Sidenote: they make you ask for chopsticks, I hate that because I always forget. They should ask me every time how many chopsticks I need. General Tao. Crispy Ginger Beef. Honey RIBS!
