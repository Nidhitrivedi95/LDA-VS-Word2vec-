cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw Absolutely love love love this place it is so delicious the food is always fresh crisp  it is amazing everything that I have tried from this place on their menu is just a meeting it's no ordinary oriental food.
They have the best green tea ice cream and best Thai tea
Also you can never beat their prices and their lunch specials it is freaking amazing I don't know how they do it but I hope they continue to PS they have delivery and an online menu
