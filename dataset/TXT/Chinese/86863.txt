HQpMwOOrGND3GaRqMNV9ig There are times you wonder how our taste buds can be so different?  This wonton noodle house is priced for a no frill quick bite, simple and fast.  What I cannot understand are the rave reviews?  Am I missing something or I stopped in on an off night (Thurs night)?  For me, a great wonton noodle bowl has rich tasting wontons w/ plenty of flavor, this place has decent size fillings but lacks the subtle flavoring.  Soup wise, it was weak, almost water like.  Price wise, it might seem inexpensive BUT if you use a typical Dim Sum dish like Sui Mai at a local special, then it isn't that cheap, just ok.  Sorry but I find the noodle bowls at some of the Congee places within Toronto GTA a much higher quality bowl.
