   When it comes to Cook on Wok:s shrimp chop suey, my taste buds say, "Baby, your the greatest!" Well, maybe not the greatest. I am still trying Chinese restaurants throughout the Valley. Regardless, my taste buds elevate Cook on Wok's shrimp chop suey to the 4 star yelposphere. 

  I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special. In my opinion they are a better value than a fast food restaurant. The Cook on Wok lunch specials include an entree (see my photo), crunchy noodles with duck sauce, white or fried rice, and soup of the day where an additional $2 upgrades to wonton soup. Their wonton soup is over and above the typical wonton soup that includes shrimps. On the other hand, I also enjoyed their hot and sour soup (included). The lunch special menu trails behind several Chinese restaurants in variety. After eating their SHRIMP chop suey, I am decided on ordering it when I done here. Although, the plate is not overflowing with food, it is flowing with the delicious ingredients of shrimp chop suey. Cook on Wok is generous with the number of shrimps. Every bite is delicious from the shrimp and vegetables down to the broth. With the lunch special I order a Coke that they serve in a generous size glass. Before the tip, the total adds up to approximately $12.

 Twice in recent times, I have made the right turn from Warm Springs Road into the Circle K parking lot at the southeast corner of Stephanie Street and parked in the adjacent parking lot to dine in Cook on Wok. Upon walking inside, the friendly gentleman walks me to the table a few minutes before becoming my waiter. The atmosphere is one of a dine in Chinese Restaurant instead of a take-out. It is a clean and relaxing environment. 

  I recommend Cook on Wok for their shrimp Chop suey lunch special. I support this recommendation with my signature of four stars.
