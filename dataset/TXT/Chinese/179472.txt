X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Hmm, what to say about Hakkasan... Well can't really tell you much about the inside due to the fact I couldn't get in; however, I do have some advice for my fellow yelpers and here it goes.

1) As expected for a Vegas club be prepared to wait in line wether it be prepaid, guest list, or general admission 
2) If there is a big DJ spinning purchase pre sale tickets (guy tickets sell out before girl tickets)
3) Guest list does not guarantee admission, we were on a guest list after being unable to purchase pre sale male tickets, waited over 2 hours, still had a bit of a line in front of us and were told "you may get in on time to see Calvin Harris"
4) If you see a long line on general admission proceed to the nearest exit and find another club to go to
5) If you just so happen to be a baller, this is one of those times it would be worth throwing down some extra dough to save yourself the headache

As for my night at Hakkasan, I was really looking forward to seeing Calvin Harris here on my first night in Vegas, as a matter of fact I was planning on proposing to him just because I love him that much haha. However, my dreams where ruined after waiting over 2 hours and deciding to go somewhere where we could enjoy a party from the inside instead of the line. As per many Yelpers recommendations my friends and I went to XS, end up seeing Rusko and had a blast!
