VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q This has become my go to for late dinners. It is one of the few restaurants open until 11 pm and service is super fast. Although they have increased their prices quite a few times over the years, they don't seem to have lost any customers. I usually get the sliced beef and enoki mushroom with vermicelli in spicy szechuan fish broth, but that was partly because it used to be part of a special menu that was cheaper after 9 pm. Now it still is a special but only $0.75 cheaper than making your own combo so there really isn't an incentive to get it. If I make my own combo for $10.75 I usually get the gingko and pepper fish soup with thick vermicelli. For toppings I like the pig stomach, pig liver, sliced cuttlefish, fish filet, and fish tofu. The cold special drinks are an additional $2.50 but usually decent.
