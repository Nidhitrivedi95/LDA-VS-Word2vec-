HQpMwOOrGND3GaRqMNV9ig The best place for a cheap and delicious bowl of piping hot egg noodle soup with huge shrimp wontons. The menu is short and sweet, just the way I like it! I always get the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce as well for my veggies.. For $2.50 you can't go wrong! 

You can also get a box of 12 uncooked shrimp dumplings for $10, so you can bring it home and make some when you're getting the 2am munchies.
