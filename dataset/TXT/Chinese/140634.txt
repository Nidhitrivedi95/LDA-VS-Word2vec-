r71RUi85E60aGuhVqXWjKA Hakka no. 1 is the no. 1 alternate to driving all the way to Brampton or Mississauga or Scarborrough in search of good Hakka food. 

I was fooled by the cover of the book, and was assuming the worst when I finally decided to give this place a try. 

But to my amazing surprise, the restaurant was the exact opposite of what I feared. It was clean, well organized seating, good staff and delicious well cooked Hakka food. 

The prices are the cherry on top. Delicious and more than filling lunch options for under $10......how can anyone complain after that?? The lunch menu offers so many options, that you don't even need to bother with the main menu during lunch hours 

Finally coming to the food:
Hakka noodles were great, flavourful, and a generous portion. Ordered Bombay chicken with fried rice. (You can change steam rice from the original combo to fried rice for a dollar and half). Bombay chicken was crispy fried, very well marinated and flavourful, tossed in green herbs. An amazing preparation. If anyone knows and misses "chicken kebabs of Bangalore", this dish comes really really close to it. 
Overall, dining here was a great experience and I found this place to be a wonderful find in Midtown Toronto. 
This will be a regular spot for us!
