R7-3MCD6_RL_VxN65yCh2Q The reviews made me believe this place was amazing, however I was super sick last night. We ordered lo mein, chop suey, beef and broccoli, and some egg rolls, even those tasted awful! Food was mushy, tasted all the same. Highly disappointed. I've waited months for some take out! But I was up all night with a horrible stomachache! Quality of food was poor!
