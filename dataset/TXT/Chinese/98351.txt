jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw The service here is so bad that my family and I would not ever come back to again no matter how much we crave for dim sum. 

The service ladies were not trained to be in this field at all. No smiles on their face, grumpy when handling our food and request. We asked for a high chair by the time they brought it out after many reminders, we were almost done. 

On top of the horrible services, they gave themselves a tip added to the bill of 15%. We really don't  mind giving tips if their service was at least half decent. But for this place I would not give them a penny in tip for the way they treat their customers.
