BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA It was not an outstanding. As for service. Really. First greeted with the question do you have a reservation.  Then we thought we were going to be turned away. But decided that we were worthy of a seat. We had to beg for a beverage.  It was beneath one of the servers to accept orders for beer and wine.  He made it quit clear in his demeanor that he rather be having a root canal then serve us drinks. I had questions about the menu. He was clueless.  He didn't know  what I was asking
 He said if I wanted to know look at the pictures on the menu. Seriously????????


I had brought family from out of town there. Never never never again. I would rather take them to McDonald's then step foot in that place again. At least at McDonald's you get greated with a smile.
