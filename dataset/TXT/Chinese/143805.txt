rROHsa0BQsKjxNnfYjBF9g There's a revolt brewing in Chinatown.

When Spadina's Lucky Dragon Restaurant went under last month, a few employees at next-door neighbor and late-night Chinese food giant New Ho King decided to leave and open their own establishment. Canton Chilli was born.

The menu is very similar to New Ho's, with many Szechuan and Cantonese selections. However, there are several Hakka-influenced dishes (Hakka is a region in southeast China). Your best bet is to go with choices you simply can't make at Canton Chilli's rival next door, such as Manchurian Chicken/Beef or Eggplant (for the veggies), or the Canton Chili Chicken.

The servers are very friendly and accomodating, because they are trying to make a name for themselves in a new venture. I received a free hot and sour soup upon my first visit without any provocation, and when I brought someone the second time, we were given free pop without having to ask for a drink. 

If you want everything you love about New Ho without the rowdy, drunken mob scene, you want Canton Chilli. If you want all of the reliable service you get at New Ho with some new menu options, you want Canton Chilli. The nearly half-priced late night menu kicks in at 9:30 p.m. every night, so trust me: you want Canton Chilli.
