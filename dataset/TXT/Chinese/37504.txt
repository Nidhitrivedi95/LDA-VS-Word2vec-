No wei!  We had to wait almost an hour for takeout food.  It's also wei expensive for a hole in the wall restaurant, dishes ranging between 
$8 to $14.  We got the orange chicken, shrimp egg foo young, mongolian beef, moo shu veggies and egg rolls.  For the price of the dishes I expected more....and that's mainly coming from being spoiled with family in the Chinese restaurant business that has been awarded 4 stars and charge just as much as this place if not less.

No chinese veggies like baby bok choy or chinese broccoli or etc.

The egg rolls were more like tiny spring rolls and came 1 per order.  It almost tasted like there was nutmeg in it and while it wasn't grease filled, I wish it had been filled with something a little more.

The orange chicken was by far the best dish.  Big juicy pieces of chicken, tangy sweet sauce...yum.

The egg foo young was pretty decent.  Tons of sauce, so at least it wasn't dry.

The mongolian beef was almost tasteless and not very spicey.  Tons more onions than pieces of beef.

The moo shu veggies were nothing to scream about and if it weren't for the hoisin sauce, I probably would have pushed it to the side.

On top of it all, when the food was ready to be picked up, no one knew where the order had gone or what had been ordered.  Three different people asked and finally after 10 minutes, the order was found and paid for.

So the only reason why I gave the three stars is because overall the food was decent.  I've had WAY worse Chinese food.  I'm hoping all the chaos was due to a new opening.

However, mark my words:  if I try this place again and it's just as unorganized and frustrating, I will take my stars and go home!

The upside is that lunch seems to be reasonably priced, maybe that's what I should wean myself into.

Oh...and no liquor license yet....but I gather that's the city of Surprise's fault as I heard the same thing from other businesses.
