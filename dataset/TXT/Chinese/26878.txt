7wgKazvblPECOzBrd6N50Q Needed our chinese meal on the first day of the new year, visiting from NYC although as native vancouver-ites, our expectations are always "low"..  Wonton with noodles was arguably as good as anything we have on the east coast so far, not quite traditional, but with all the main checks.  Beef haw fun, was old school good.  Yeung chow fan/rice was ok, a touch greasy and not quite expecting the onions, but had all the right things plus chinese sausage which always a happy point for us.  For $30, about as we can get on the east coast!
