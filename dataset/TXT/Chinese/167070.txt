VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA First thing's first: Dumpling Haus is located in Hilldale Mall, so make sure you don't drive past it looking for a standalone restaurant. Now for the review:

When you first walk into Dumpling Haus, you are greeted by a clean, modern, but not pretentious atmosphere. The chalkboard menu obove the counter is fairly big but also straight forward: it's just noodles, dumplings, and a few other dim sum items) If you look straight from the door, you may see somebody making dumplings by hand (so you know that they're fresh). However, you may or may not be greeted by the person at the counter; she may never make eye contact with you even while placing your order. Manners aren't terribly important to me if the food is good, but it should be noted.

We ordered xiao long bao soup dumplings, shrimp dumplings, black bean pork noodles (because it sounded similar to korean black bean noodles, jiajang men), and sesame kick (because it sounded similar to dan dan noodles). After ordering, we brought water and sauces to our table since it's self service.

The food came out pretty quickly, but it wasn't good. Both noodles had no texture to them and very little flavor. The shrimp dumplings had a fragile, mushy texture to it with very little flavor. The xiao long bao was ok. Maybe I ordered the wrong things, but the food did not live up to my friends' recommendations.

Since the menu is so big, I'm going to have to come back. I really want to like this place.
