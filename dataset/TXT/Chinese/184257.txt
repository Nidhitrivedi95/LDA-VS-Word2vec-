xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A Lulu's serves pretty bad food but they have a genius business model.  

All they did was take the normal chinese food distribution model--those tiny bits of pork with the red outside and brown inside, general tso's fried maxo, greasy noodles--but glazed it over with a bit more of a college aesthetic.  You know, a menu with a bigger font, pop music blasting (which is actually kind of great), and non-drab, colorful decor. 

Service is slow, like your momma slow.
