DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA I've been to this specific Sam Woo location a number of times.  With my old employer, it was sort of a tradition.  Sadly, it seems to get worse each time I go...

Quality of food, quality of service and the quality of the restaurant itself have all gone to crap (seriously, there's a layer of funk all over the mirrors, the walls, etc).  I order Scrambled Egg & Shrimp and get a confused look from the waiter...I repeat "Scrambled Egg & Shrimp, Scrambled Egg & Shrimp".  I was as dumbfounded as he was.  I've had it several times before, as several Sam Woo Restaurants (including this one), so I crack open the menu and there it is..."Shrimp and Scrambled Egg."  Really?, your English is so 'bu hao' that you can't take take my order?

No liquor license, can't accept credit cards...hell, they don't even have bottled water!!  This will probably be my last time at this Sam Woo...next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be getting my fix at one of Chinatown's other restaurants...
