x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg Unlike other asian legend, this location is spacious. I was here in a late night around 8:30pm. The restaurant was not full. 

We got served very quickly, and food comes right after. The food is not average comparing with other locations. The food is not hot enough. We ordered a few dumplings, and snacks. The food portion is reasonable based on the price.

The overall experience was average.
