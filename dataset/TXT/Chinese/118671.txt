All of the above was taken out of context from the conversations at the table of course. :p

Kidding aside -- I'm referring to the dishes we ordered (dumpling and dessert  balls), yoga talk, and planning of a future foodie crawl. :)


Jennifer K and Wayne C - can't thank you enough for quickly organizing this dim sum lunch. You guys are funny. Lot of laughs. :)



Regal Palace is a clean and tastefully decorated Chinese restauarant located in Richmond Hill beside the infamous London Pub. It's theme I would say is modern and classy. Large chandeliers grace the high ceilings. Tall windows surround the perimeter bringing in natural sunlight. In combination this gives a nice 'open' feel. 

Interior colors are white and gold and the uphostered chairs were most comfortable too!

Now for about the food - authentic and fresh. All dishes tasted good and weren't overly oily or salty. So a good choice for those watching their waist lines.


We had:

Har Gow (shrimp dumplings)
Siu Mai (shrimp and pork dumplings) - edit * ordered but we didn't end up getting this after all. :p 
Steamed chicken buns
Bean curd stuffed with mushrooms
Beef Rice Roll 
Deep Fried Taro Dumplings
Black Sesame Rice balls


Regal Palace made a great dim sum restaurant choice.  To start it's one of the classier dim sum places around, food was prepared fresh and the price of our lunch quite reasonable at $12 per person .
