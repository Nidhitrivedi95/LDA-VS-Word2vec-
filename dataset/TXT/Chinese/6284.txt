0HRNeFrQt31b-lD9kVdHog Once a month, I visit local eateries by our house.  This one is always a favorite, because every dish seems to be really fresh and really hot.   For the same money (No really!) as a fast food meal, you get a freshly cooked meal.  The Sesame and Orange chicken is always a favorite, but the spicy beef and broccoli is my personal go-to menu item when I'm not feeling adventurous.  It's lean beef, not fatty, not drowning, not spiced to death - just the way you'd want to eat it with just enough flavor and spice.

The waitress is always ALWAYS friendly, and never overbearing.  She takes your order, refills your tea or Pepsi, and leaves you alone to enjoy your meal.  The restaurant - if I'm not mistaken - is family run.  What a nice group of people with a quaint atmosphere, and not interrupted by televisions.  The price is absolutely right.  

On the rare occasion when I'm sick, I order take-out of the egg-drop or spicy soup.  The soup has a similar effect on me as when Popeye eats a can of spinach.  Suddenly the color returns to my face, my arms bulge out, my tattoos clap together and I go outside and beat up a bad guy, usually some loitering post-pubescent scarpocked punk at the Charter School Academy just two storefronts down.  

It's that good.  Crime fighting good!
