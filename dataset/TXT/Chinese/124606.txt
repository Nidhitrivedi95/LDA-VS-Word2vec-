otKF8cBMSC0kARaBGLMHtg This is your basic Chinese food offering located in a food court

2 items and rice or noodles for $8

Lots to choose from for meat , chicken or pork but only had veggie tofu or mixed vegtables

They have a daily special as well that saves you some change or if cannot decide

The flavoring is very generic to satisfy everyone so you may wish to grab a packet or two of hot chili sauce

The nice thing about Chinese food is that they have to cook everything from scratch (maybe not the egg rolls which are frozen) so if you are avoiding frozen patties and fries then New Wok is a healthier alternative
