ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg The food is simply not good for what you expect at the bellagio, especially for this price range.
I ordered the Ginger Fried Rice - the dish was salty, extremely salty... I barely finished half of it before I was done. My wife ordered the veggie spring rolls, were not good as well :-/ 
The dim sum was actually ok, but that's just a starter dish and not what you come here from.
The service was pleasant so it does deserve a 2 star, but don't go out of your way to eat here, there are much better places to eat at!
