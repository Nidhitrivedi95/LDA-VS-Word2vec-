Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w In reading these reviews, I feel like it's my duty to champion the Siam Café. We've had a very intimate relationship over the years. Many sit-ups were done in the name of the Siam Cafe. 

When it is my birthday, when I come into town, when it's Mother's or Father's Day, after church when all the other places are closed, when I got dumped, when at the stage of a relationship and I wanted to see the unnatural limits of how much a human body could consume, I went to the Siam Café. 

There are multiple waiters that I have seen come and go, but there is only one that you will ever want. He's a tall Asian man with the skinniest looking, drawn in moustache you'll ever see. The man is a matradee.

Don't order fried rice, noodles, lo mein, or anything that you have ever ordered at a Panda Express. If that's what you want, stay there, but here in the Siam Café, be bold and take chances with your diet: the clams in black bean sauce, the boiled chicken, seafood platter, the wonton soup, and the beef tenderloin.

I won't argue that the place will get busy, but like others said, they are catering to parties of ten or more. Don't be shy here. Raise your hand or yell out for a waiter. If the staff doesn't get to you, the hostess or host will find you. Rarely do I ever see anyone simply standing around here. 

"Long in the tooth?" An expression that is such a telling statement on itself. The place was a converted family restaurant and not too much has changed but I don't go there for the atmosphere. I go there for the food. It's my hopes that anyone who goes there goes for that single purpose.

The Siam Café is the place to take your loved ones and if you have love great food. If you ever need a recommendation here, feel free to message me. I am the Siam Café's People's Champ. But if I get back into town, you might have to treat me.
