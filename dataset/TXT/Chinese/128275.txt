I have been a patron of this restaurant for 20+ years because we have consistently eaten great meals from this place. We usually do takeout a couple of times a month. I think it's the best Chinese restaurant on the westside of Cleveland. We love their Pad Thai which is very flavorful. Their other dishes such as the Sweet and Sour Chicken and General Tso's are equally delicious. Plus they don't skimp out on their meats and the veggies are always fresh. Their sauces are very tasty. We always ask for extra sauce and get it at no charge. I highly recommend this establishment for sit down or takeout. You can't go wrong either way.
