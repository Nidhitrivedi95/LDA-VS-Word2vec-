dWB0HT1nXQ2N8n3bvPKJuQ I had been wondering what happened to Saigon 88 since I was craving some pad Thai. I stumbled upon johns instead and was very quickly disappointed. We sat down in a booth (only people in the restaurant) and another 10 minutes later our waitress took our order. She brought over some wonton chips in a basket. I picked one up and ate it and noticed there were ANTS crawling in the chips ! We notified the hostess and left immediately.
