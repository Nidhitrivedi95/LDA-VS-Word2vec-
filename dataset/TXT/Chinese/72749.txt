fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA Maybe I'm spoiled. Maybe I had a bit to drink. And maybe I got unlucky and my friends stole all of the lamb dumplings from under my nose.

I thought these dumplings were pretty damn average.

These aren't bad dumplings. They're pretty tasty and superbly cheap. The ingredients are good, and but the steamed dumplings felt a bit too doughy. I vastly preferred the fried dumplings, but even then they were only pretty good.

Honestly, I can see myself eating frequently if I lived here, but it's nothing to write home about. Come here for solid, cheap dumplings.
