safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg living across the street, I've been to this place a couple times. I went in there today and it took two ladies atleast 10 minutes to even acknowledge me. then another 20 minutes for my two items (chicken fried rice and fried shrimp) when I got home, I didn't even get the fried rice. I don't know how she could have misheard me as I was less than 2 feet away from her. not worth the mess for the prices they have.
