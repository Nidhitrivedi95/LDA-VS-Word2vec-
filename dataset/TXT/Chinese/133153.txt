puPY7gVy7RCz8bK1zkzdoQ I ordered the sweet and sour shrimp and egg foo young and was dissapointed with the lack of flavor, the dry texture and the overall quality. I have good interactions with an employee there, so I added a star.

The egg foo young was a dry, flavorless, seemingly premade patty. The sauce was alright, the chicken and veggies were good. Part of my disappointment is that I prefer a freshly made patty with the veggies and meat mixed in and a slightly thinner sauce.

The sweet and sour shrimp wasn't high in flavor and was dry and could have used some more sauce.

I believe I was dissapointed with the food the last time I ordered there as well, so I'm going to have to scratch this restaurant off of my list. It seems a lot of people like this place, so maybe it's just that my preferences don't mesh with this restaurant's output.
