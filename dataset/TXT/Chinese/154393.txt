tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg SOOOOO GOOD! I've been looking for a good Chinese place down here and so far every delivery place I've tried has been mediocre until now! We got the sweet and sour chicken, Kung pao veggie dish, and fried/white rice. All delicious and the delivery man was really nice too! (Took a little over an hour though) 100% recommend!!
