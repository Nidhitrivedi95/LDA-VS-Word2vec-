An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg This place is excellent.  You get to customize your noodles and soup base.  We ordered the laksa noodle and fish soup noodle.  On the side, we ordered the turnip cake and chicken wings.  The turnip cake is not your regular congee queen style.  The pieces are massive and flavourful.  I would come to this place again.  Milk tea is great too!

Tip:  you can also order just the fish base soup to go, a large container for only $4.  Great for making homemade soup noodles, vegetables and dumplings.
