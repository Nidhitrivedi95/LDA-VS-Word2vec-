t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA I was a fan of Golden Harbor when it was in Mahomet. I am glad that they moved to Champaign and with so many more tables. My favorite menu is crispy tofu, basil chicken, and wu lur fish. The food here is more toward the greasy side and kinda pricey, but if I look for chinese food, it's definitely Golden Harbor.
