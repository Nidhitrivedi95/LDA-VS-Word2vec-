During my most recent visit, I came here with my family who lives in Vegas. We came here on a Friday during lunch, which wasn't so bad because it wasn't busy. We were greeted quickly and asked to sit anywhere we liked. 

The staff were ready to have water amd menus out.  They also answered any questions we had quickly. We ended up ordering two different bowls of Pho and 3 orders of the sandwiches. The sandwiches here are SOOO delicious. They have the best Vietnamese sandwiches I ever had. Definitely a must try.

Also, their huge drink menu is yummy as well. The milk teas, boba, and smoothies are so yummy!
