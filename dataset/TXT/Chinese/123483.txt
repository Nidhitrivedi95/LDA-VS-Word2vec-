OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA Slowly becoming a regular here. Seating is a little tight / squishy if you are only a party of 1 to 4 as you won't get one of those big round tables, and you will easily hear your neighbors' conversations and/or them yours. Service and food have otherwise been excellent so far.  Food comes out fast and if you are lucky, you get free Chinese soup to start your meal and/or you get free Chinese dessert (tofu fa) at the end of your meal. Both were delicious and were a nice treat. We got free soup one time and we got free dessert one time. Not sure if it was because they had extras or if it depended on what we ordered. It will be our little mission to try to figure it out :)
