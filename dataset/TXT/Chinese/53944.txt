cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ I've got mixed feelings about this place. The decor is unique and we were there during the face-changing/mask-changing performance. I'm not sure if that's a weekly or nightly thing though. So overall it made for a very unique buffet experience.

In terms of the food itself, it is generally higher quality than most Chinese buffet places. They serve up Peking Duck, which isn't exactly a novelty for buffets in this day and age in the GTA. While the quality is generally higher, they also seem to have a smaller spread than what you might expect, so there's a bit less variety. Compared to the space of the restaurant, the buffet section is relatively small. Desserts were also better than most buffet places. If you're a fan of seafood, there is some, but it's a weaker selection than what I've seen in the buffets out in Brampton.

Overall, it's a decent place. I'd recommend giving it a shot if you're in the area looking for a buffet, but it's definitely not a place I'd frequent, nor make a special trip for.
