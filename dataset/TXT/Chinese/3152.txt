_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA i will always have to come here at least once every time i visit Vegas! an alternative for drunk late night eating steak & eggs! it's not the fanciest place so don't expect a whole lot. the prices are a bit over priced for a chinese place but its Vegas!

+duck, yummm-o
+fried rice, yummmy!
+soups, mouth is watering!
