u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ The staff is a hit or miss which is awesome for a Chinese restaurant! 

Most recently I had a nice female server who returned often and was very sweet. 

The complimentary bitter melon soup is delicious to start.

I'm a big fan of their honey walnut shrimp and their crispy pan fried egg noodles is my favorite in town.

The seating is very close to each other. 

The pricing is average for non Americanized Chinese food around china town.
