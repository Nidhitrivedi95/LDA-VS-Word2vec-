But our dumplings still took some time to get to our table because when we sat down, they were already processing tons of take out/delivery orders! You can see the adorable group of women filling dumplings in a row, decked out in baseball caps and bright pink polo shirts, in the back kitchen thanks to the large glass window :)

The hot tea was very pleasant to have since it was a chillier day than we've had yet, so we kept warm while we waited. With only two of us, and 15 dumplings per order, we could only try two different ones, so we went with the steamed pork and mushroom, and the pan fried curry beef. The pork ones came out first, and boy are they DELICIOUS! The beef curry ones were up next, and YUM - a bit juicier than the pork for some reason, so we had to be careful with each bite. You have soy sauce, vinegar, and hot chili oil on each table to create your own dipping sauce. Service is fine since even with a small space they fill up immediately and then a line forms outside, so they do try to politely get you to leave asap - or at least that's how I felt. And its so freaking affordable! God, I wish we had them right next door to us...
