tZ-h-gFhIWnrC4TR_N9K_Q This place is bit pricy compared to other similar restaurants like congee queen...... but it always fully packed. I guess this a good place for the people live   In the north. But for me I would rather drives 10 minutes more to the congee queen on Hwy 7. Two meat combo with rice cost almost 14 dollars after tax!!! What! And it doesn't come with soup..... errrrrrrr, hello??? The other places usually cost 7 or 8 at most.

The food taste ok but still can't figure out why it charges more than the other same restaurants.....
