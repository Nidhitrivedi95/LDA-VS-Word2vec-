5YUoTimGDPbbmRfw6SJgTQ Since moving to Madison, I have been in search of a decent Chinese food option. I don't need the food to be absolutely to my liking, but I do appreciate the effort that China Kitchen puts into my order. A few things that makes CK above the rest here on the west side of town: you can order right here on Yelp with minimal trouble, you can pay either in cash when the food comes to your door or you pick up OR you can pay via a credit, debit or Paypal, which is so convenient. As mentioned in previous reviews, the delivery fee is only a dollar, which is terrific. Our family has been very happy with our past two orders, as we get a nice assortment of crunchy vegetables with our every entree.
