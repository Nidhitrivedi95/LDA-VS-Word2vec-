68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw I don't understand the hype here and the 4 1/2 star rating. I ate here yesterday and had the roasted chicken and fried rice. The chicken had good flavor but for $10.81 for a quarter chicken and white rice I think that is crazy but if people are willing to pay that on a consistent basis no need for them to lower their prices. NOT FOR ME. The Fried rice was not good at all. Strange smell and didn't like the flavor at all. Also, this dish was $14.06 which was a total joke. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the 2 girls that worked the counter were total sweethearts and very pleasant. If this place gets the business and gets those prices God bless them but they will not see me again.
