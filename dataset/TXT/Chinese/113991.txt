Ms_el67lrNsKBmdEXVxl6Q When I have a hankering for Chinese food this is my go to place. The dining room is simply decorated and clean. I am always greeted with a smile. Service is quick and the food is pipping hot. I love how spicy many of the dishes are. The serving sizes are pretty big so I usually end up having leftovers for the next day. Prices are right on for the food. I have only ever been here for dinner and it has never been very busy. I notice many people get their food to go. I would replace Panda with Liu's Kitchen any day.
