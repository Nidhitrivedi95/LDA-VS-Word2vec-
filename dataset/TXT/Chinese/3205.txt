_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA In Las Vegas there's nothing like a hot bowl of fresh noodles to top off a night of drinking partying and gambling.  I wish it was as good as some of the best noodle places in Chinatown and LA but it isn't.  Plus a star because there really are no other alternatives and I'd take their beef noodles any day out here in stony brook.  

Make this part of your Vegas weekend.
