mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ This restaurant is quite new in Vegas. We found it accidentally and was very surprised with the excellent food and services. We like the beef wrap. It looks like a burrito but is good to eat. They use good aromatics beef and cilantro. Don't miss the fried rice with pickled vegetables. It is not greasy at all. 
Service was very good. They were very attentive. I went back a second time for takeouts - better than airplane food.

Easy parking and convenient
