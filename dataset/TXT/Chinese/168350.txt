Voy_shxcm2YnHQOtfUj1KQ I am really suprised by the mediocre overall reviews for this restaurant.  I have been to Spicy city about 6 or 7 times, and it has been consistently great.  The only explanation for the mediocre ratings perhaps could be that people are not ordering spicy food at a restaurant named "Spicy City."  Whenever I go, I order spicy food that makes me sweat, and clears my sinuses.  Yes it is hot, but it is GOOD.  Indeed EVERY spicy dish I have ordered at this place has been at least good, and often is great.  
Indeed I would say that this restaurant has become my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas when both cost and flavor are taken into consideration.  Don't go here if you don't like spicy food.  Don't go here for a romantic dinner for two.  This restaurant is like other authentic Chinese restaurants in being very utilitarian and non-fancy.  Go here if you like really spicy Chinese food that is delicious.
