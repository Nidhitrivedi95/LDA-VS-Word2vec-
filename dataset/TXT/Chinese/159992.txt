U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Food was ok. Service is terrible just as all the other reviews have indicated. All the people that work here look like they hate their lives and their jobs.

Prices were also high, but this was expected as the restaurant is inside a major hotel. The honey pork pancake wrap was pretty good. The chicken lomein was a little bland.  

Overall, we wouldn't eat here again. But for a convenient location, it wasn't that bad.
