_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Finally got the chance to try out Fisherman. After seeing all the hype with the lobster mountains, I was a little disappointed that my whole entire experience is just average.. I was expecting the food to taste amazing and out of this world, but I guess my expectations were a little too high..

Reservation process was weird. One of my friend called in to book a table for 12 people, but was told that there was a $500 deposit needed for such a large group. Then another friend called in the next day and made a reservation with no problem and didn't require any deposit for a group of 12 ... I'd like to point out that the second time my friend spoke Chinese, whereas the first time it was English. HM.. weird and inconsistent, even feel a little discriminatory but whatever LOL

It was cool of them to show us all the seafood before it is cooked, I believe we added another crab and lobster fried rice to our combo. This came up to a total of $900 after tax and tips, for a group of 12 it was $75 per person so not so bad! 

Honestly ... I found the lobsters and food to be quite bland. The seasoning on the lobster and crab was superb but it didn't soak into the meat so the meat was so flavourless ...there was also a ridiculous amount of fried onion on the lobster mountain plate too like holy crap LOL if there was ever an onion drought you'll know whose fault it is  my favourite was the lobster fried rice, the least bland dish there was LOL it is REALLY filling though .. we took a bunch of left overs home so it is worth the money but taste wise I'm still debating ... I wish the meat wasn't so bland I'd enjoy it more .. 

I will return later in the future of course because the seasoning was too die for !! I recommend going in a large group and getting the bigger combos, you get more selection and the experience itself is really nice :)
