tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg We came here with a large group. 14 people. We had a reservation at 8:30 and we were sat pretty close to that. The waitress was perfect and even split the bill without asking. 

The food was good. We got crab puffs they were AMAZING.  I got teriyaki  chicken. It was good.  The pear saki sucked though! :( 

Everyone loved their food and they didn't mind our rowdy group of 14 girls who had been drinking the last 8 hours. 

I would recommend this place for dinner.
