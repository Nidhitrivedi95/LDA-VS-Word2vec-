6I4twTs8oFMuDsuTwS7IgQ An update about the hotpot... I've been told about the hotpot in the basement of this place by many friends. Today was the first time we were able to try it.

Assorted soup based and dipping sauces, crab, shrimp, thinly sliced beef/pork/lamb, standard Chinese veg, udon, ramen...for £15.99 per person all you can eat, and the quality is pretty good. Not the best I've had (which would probably be in Beijing), but pretty good indeed (especially for Edinburgh).

Good with friends and worth coming back! Bring cash - no credit cards accepted!
