hf2oiNqYYWoF2-iNYSnOMg First of all, my review for Chinese food is always going to be more harsh, since I have tried some of the best Chinese food.  Plus a Chinese native that traveled to Hong Kong once a year, nothing beats authentic food in HK!!!

I placed a delivery order, and it got here within 20 minutes. I have the lunch sha cha shrimp and fried potsticker. The flavor of the shrimp is pretty good, and it's jumbo size shrimp. However the sauce it's bit too thick to my taste. There's nothing to said about the potsticker, just out of the package kind, but the dipping sauce has a bit of sweetness and spicy to it.

Lunch combo is $5.65, price not bad at all. Oh and they gave me package sauces that going to last me a month lol... 

I will order from this place again on a lazy day that I don't want to drive out for food.
