For me, Saturday mornings usually consist of either dim sum or congee.  I love both and for me, My Kitchen is a fav place to go for Congee.  This review focuses only on breakfast time.

Pros:
Lots of congee to choose from
Many side dishes 
Food comes out fast

Cons:
Not many seats

As I said, I love my congee.  Sure, there are the usual suspects for congee (Congee Wong, Queen, Time etc.), but I like these small places a little better.  They have a more homely feel which reminds me of getting congee back in Hong Kong.

My Kitchen has an extensive list of congee.  Most places have about 10-15 different types for you to choose from.  My Kitchen has at least 40, I stopped counting after getting there.  With so many choices, you will never get bored.  congee comes out super fast and hot.  I actually prefer the congee here to a lot of places.  It's always spot on and very much the like the ones I got in Hong Kong growing up.

My Kitchen also does some very good side dishes.  Their steam rice rolls are very good.  Like all congee places, you need to have your deep fried dough fritter and My Kitchen is no exception.  The fritters here are a little smaller, but they have a better taste in my opinion.  You can basially skip the congee and just order side dishes if congee is not your thing.

The only problem with these homey hole in the wall places is that they are usually small.  If you don't come early in the mornings, expect to wait a bit.  There's no table larger than 6, so if you come as a big group, it will be tough for them to seat you all together.  This isn't something necessarily their fault, but it does hinder your experience when you have to wait long for seats.

All in all, My Kitchen is a great place to go for congee.  Just show up early to avoid any wait.
