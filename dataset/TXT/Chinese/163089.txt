UpbTdzW9OoVrnbpHyxnMWg I'm not under any illusions that this place is an authentic Chinese restaurant. I mean, they serve pizza, mashed potatoes and roast beef in the 'white people food' corner of the buffet line. Mandarin is great because it offers a variety of well made dishes. Let me clarify, well made buffet style dishes. For a buffet it's pretty decent, you have to admit. The restaurant itself is cheesy in its decor, but the staff are friendly and attentive. Not a bad place to spend 20 bucks.
