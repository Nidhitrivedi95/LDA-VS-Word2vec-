The interior is really one gigantic space, but seems like a big labyrinth with multiple rooms and halls due to the tall partitions set up throughout.  There are many dining tables and a bar tucked away in the back.  Some drinks were creative, others were easily available elsewhere, but they'll all run you $15-$20 each.

The menu has many appetizers, sides, and entrees to choose from, as well as a few tasting menus available, which require four people in your party to order.  For a party of six, we ordered four tasting menus and a few other dishes to round out our meal.  For a set menu that is meant for four, it comes with a surprising amount of food that easily filled up the six of us.  Nothing was disappointing, but the standouts for me were the crispy duck salad (they do not skimp on the portions here, if you enjoy duck, get this dish), duck with truffle oil (again, good portions), and the wagyu beef stir fry.

The food was well prepared, in generous portions, and left all of us feeling satisfied.  The part that makes Hakkasan hard to recommend is the pricing.  The tasting menu we ordered was $118 per person, and most dishes are $30 each.  Total for our meal was over $1,000, which is ridiculous for six people eating Chinese food.  Fortunately, and the main reason we came, we were able to enjoy a promotion that got us 50% off our entire bill.  In the end it was around $80 per person, which is much more reasonable, but arguably still a lot.

The pricing at Hakkasan makes it hard place to wholeheartedly recommend, but unlike other Asian restaurants on the Strip you'll actually end up with a good meal if you decide to spend the money here.
