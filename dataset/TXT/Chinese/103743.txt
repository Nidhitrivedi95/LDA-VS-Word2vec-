Km0sT7E_dc2U1BkyRoy1xA I have to disagree with the review that mentioned the rolls are of great 'quality'.  Brought my daughter here for Christmas break celebration and was very disappointed in the size and amount of roll for the price (which is totally built into the bogo 'deal'). The avocado in her California roll was browning and speckled and the avocado in my cherry blossom roll was mushy brown-completely rotted in 4 of the pieces. I brought this to my waitresses attention who sent whom I thought was the hostess over (come to find she is the manager) and asked if we wanted another one or for it to be taken off the bill. My daughter was still hungry so I asked for hers to be remade, but I had lost my appetite and didn't want a replacement for mine. Check came charging for all rolls. When I questioned the manager and stated she had said that she would take it off the bill, she completely backpeddled and said she could only give 10% off if I don't want to remade. Any business that is ok with serving food of poor quality and charging their customers full-price is not one that one where I will choose to spend my money! Disgraceful!
