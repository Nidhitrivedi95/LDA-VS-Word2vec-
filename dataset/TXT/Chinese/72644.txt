fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA Wandered in here for dinner, ordered a plate of large lamb dumplings and kungpao chicken for a party of two. I love lamb dumplings,  so I was excited for dinner.

Unfortunately, the lamb dumplings barely had a hint of lamb at all. It was green in texture and I had to ask the waiter whether there was in fact, lamb inside the dumplings. The waiter said that other people had asked about these dumplings before and that they were supposed to be like this. So stay away from these if you actually want lamb - I couldn't taste any and was actually wondering if I had just gotten ripped off.

The kungpao chicken was tastier, but I was annoyed at the charge for white rice (more than a dollar). Chinese restaurants should not be charging for white rice with an order of an entree.
