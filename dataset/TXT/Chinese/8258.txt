1czIVv2iyOHc3WMgtUWXCQ My daughter and I happened upon this place on our Sunday walk and decided to stop in for lunch.

Opened only a few weeks ago.  Father/son team where Dad cooks in the kitchen and the son works up front.  I think they both came from Zen Fusion and now are out on their own.  

Ultra-friendly service from the son.  He spent time talking to us, finding our likes and tastes preferences and made recommendations based on that.  

As for the food...They have set the bar for Chinese food in Charlotte.  I ordered the Kung Pao vegetables and my daughter ordered lo mein noodles with shrimp, but plain otherwise.  They completely catered the dish to what she wanted.  When he saw me douce my plate in Sriracha (yes, it's on the table) he made a recommendation to next time let them know I like it spicy and his dad can use fresh chiles.  

The spring roll was made in house and the time commitment is worth the results.  Much better than places that just use frozen rolls.  I could have ordered an entire plate of spring rolls.  

My daughter tends to be a picky eater and normally I have to battle to get her to touch her food.  She almost cleared her plate.  The next day she even talked about how much she liked it.  

I can't say enough wonderful things about this place.  I'm so happy they opened and can't wait for many returns.  YUM!!!
