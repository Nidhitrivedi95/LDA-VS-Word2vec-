SRYM6FaIF6LuXldcC1PY8w Ate here for a work event and while it definitely had space for a big group the food left a lot to be desired. The wait staff was attentive and always checking to see if we needed anything and the on tap beer selection was decent. I just wish they had more along the line of tastier food. Wasn't a huge fan of the honey chicken (overpriced in my opinion for what you got).
