ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ The best boba drink in Toronto area.
We tried so many different places during our trip, and they all suck besides Chatime, a Taiwanese "international" chain boba place.
Too bad we do not have it in San Diego or LA area :(
I also tried the one in NY Chinatown. It was good too!

For a regular size grass jelly roasted milk tea, it came out $5+, it's a little pricey.
However, if I ever come to Toronto again, this is the only boba place I would go for sure.
