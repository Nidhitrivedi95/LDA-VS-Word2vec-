6MhY_9EkUkKCvvN8rzXZzg Don't be fooled - the place looks condemned from the outside - however the food is great!!! The inside is OK. I will come here again. Be sure to clarify your order after you make it. Otherwise the service was super. The portion size was average so if you are hungry order the "big plate." The soda was flat this visit but they substituted another drink.
