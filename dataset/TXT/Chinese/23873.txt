6Y5TyCM_zb7BmosuFzbzdg This is a typical Indian Chinese restaurant. Even the owners speak Hindi ;-) I guess is a family run restaurant, and deals with you very cordially

Few of their typical tasty dishes include Chilli Chicken, Manchurian Chicken, spicy Chicken Lollipops, Sizzling Beef, and Chicken Pakoras

They serve halal meat, i think

This place is a bit for large group in terms of space though!

Overall verdict: Good food, value for money!
