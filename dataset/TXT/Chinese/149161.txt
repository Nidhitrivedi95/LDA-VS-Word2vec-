sOaeX1zQWuqbPcclvjtdeA We ordered $60+ order of food last night for take out. We had a large order because we like leftovers for the weekend. We were eating our meal and my husband noticed something hard that he was chewing on from his chicken fried rice. Spits it out and found that it was a FINGER NAIL. We couldn't believe it. It was so disgusting. We called the manager that night by the name of Nick and he reimbursed us for just that fried rice dish. We should have had the whole meal reimbursed since we just trashed the rest of the order. When you see a finger nail in your food you just can't look past it. Will never order food from them again and you shouldn't either. I wish I can rate it with zero star. Picture is attached.
