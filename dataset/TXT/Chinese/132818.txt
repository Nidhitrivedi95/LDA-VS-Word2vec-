prHnRsgY-PuM7vxe8-RwEA Terrible. We ordered chow mien and got a package of crispy noodles smaller than my palm. Seriously?  This place is NOT Chinese and NOT gourmet.  The other food is over sauced, salty, and i must say i was underwhelmed.  Mostly, the lack of customer service or even taking responsibility for their wrongfully named "CHOW MIEN" was just deplorable.  No more...never again. China One up the street is 10x better. Go elsewhere.
