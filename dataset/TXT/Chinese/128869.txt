PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Definitely recommended! Family friendly and a great value, dishes are super fresh, delicious, dining room is bright and cheery, and the staff is ready and willing to help.  Owner came over to talk to us because we clearly weren't local. He was just as welcoming as his staff, who not only recommended some great selections, they sat down at another table and ate the same items they were selling to us, which was great to see. When we travel I make a point of hitting local spots and Yum Cha is a winner for us. Took my two dim sum eating kids and they downed the baked bao, polo egg buns, and fried rice, but the coconut rolls are just spectacular and they have a number of more exotic dishes as well. Loved the malaysian pancake and curry sauce. Solid add to the local scene, Yum Cha beats the pants off Orchid Gardens for straight ahead dim sum. Get off the strip, already, and see what the local food scene is about--it's places like Yum Cha that make it worth the trip!
