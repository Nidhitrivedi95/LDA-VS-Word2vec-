fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA Honestly, I don't know what some of these other reviewers are smoking.

I have had xiao long bao (soup dumplings) almost everywhere including at Ding Tai Fungs in Taipei (original location, twice), Seattle, Sydney, and this one (4-5 times). Hands down the xiao long bao here are the best. A place that is comparable is Joe's Shanghai in NYC.

The xiao long bao here are incredibly juicy and soupy inside, which is the way they should be. No, they are not cheap, but you can get cheap almost anywhere. Try the xiao long bao here. You won't be disappointed.
