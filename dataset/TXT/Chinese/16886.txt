Also funny that they said very specially 12% tips is minimum, and they charge you tips (after tax) because many customers do not pay tips, so they need to make sure their waiters get paid tips.

Food was alright. Too greasy and spicy to my taste. The decor and atmosphere is not bad, but they really need to work on their service.
