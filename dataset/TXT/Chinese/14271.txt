3cAy1gxlprn1ue0q3L_ziw I love Pad Tai however I would not reccomend this place for this particular dish. It was very light if not minimal on sauce and a lot of chilli flakes. It had no flavor! Tasted like hot noodles with chilli flakes. Save yourself the disappointment.  I'm so disappointed with how flavorless this dish was, that I will not try anything else on this menu.
