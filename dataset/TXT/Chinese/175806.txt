wKygoTySngb2gaL6edvoDw You know what you are walking into when you decide to eat at a chinese buffet. Of course it is not going to be some gourmet Asian fusion cuisine; just the good ol' basics, well actually americanized basics that we have all come to crave from time to time. You know, sweet & sour chicken, fried rice, beef & broccoli, potstickers, crab wontons, etc. As long as you understand this concept then you will not be disappointed! They have tons of choices... Mongolian BBQ.... Sushi (not my favorite obviously for the reason explained previously but decent enough)...and hand scooped ice cream. I particularly enjoyed the walnut shrimp and hot and sour soup. Crab legs at dinner and it's only $11.99 per person for dinner (lunch is $7.99). Service is great too so don't be cheap when it comes to tipping because its a buffet. Would you want to clear a table full of crab-leg shells, spilled butter, filthy napkins and greasy utensils on more than one occasion within one dining experience? Worse than fine dining tables I am sure...;)
