csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA Noodletasia is kind of the jack of all trades when it comes to Asian cuisine in this area.  Everything is good with, of course, a few stars! 
Ambiance is great in here.  They have 3 different rooms and each has different seating/tables.  Staff is typically really helpful and courteous.  
The food never takes too long and always comes out correct and hot! I strongly suggest trying the mongolian beef sometime!  Sushi is good...not too flashy but they do have a couple superb rolls (green catepillar + two face are my favorites).  

All in all, a great place to go for a date, with a group of friends or even get take out from!  Definitely a local business that deserves some patronage!
