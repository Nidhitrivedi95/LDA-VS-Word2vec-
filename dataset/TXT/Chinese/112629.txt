MhnihE0alud0ereVInSt8Q I ordered a few orders of white rice & chicken lo mein. There's no real way to mess up white rice so they were a shoe in. The chicken lomein was tasty. I asked them to make it spicy and they actually did. The delivery was pretty speedy and the woman was very polite. I'm a native New Yorker where there are Chinese restaurants EVERYWHERE so I'm sure that's why I wasn't used to the ridiculous prices.
