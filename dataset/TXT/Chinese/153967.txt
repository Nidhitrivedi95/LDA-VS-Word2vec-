td-NOo-k4xhfVmO5X92uAg It just dawned on me that my gf was absolutely right about me.  I am a hardcore smacker.  Whenever delicious food is present in front of me i slurp, smack, chomp, and moan in the nature of good food. 
I don't think it's ill manner, but more as a compliment to the chef since i am sincerely enjoying my meal.  

I love, love their homemade Pork Dumplings.  They have a slightly, wicked crunch on one side and a very scrumptious filling in the inside.  They babies are well prepare and are a must every visit.

Our favorite dish has to be the Beef Nuggets Noodle Soup (spicy)  So much aroma and spice packed in the broth that our tongue is always dancing after each slurp.  Noodles are made in-house and are also incredibly delish.  Our lady server mentioned we can substitute our noodles for other kind, but we love our bowl just the way it is that we never have to.  Be warned it's a very hearty bowl, but in a good way.  So don't make plans to do anything physical afterward because it's just not going to happen.  Your stomach is always going to tell you, "just one more bite.."  Well then, slurp away my friend.
