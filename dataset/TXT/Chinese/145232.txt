For lunch, their lunch selections of dishes with rice are pretty good.  I like their mabotofu with rice.  That's a spicy mix of tofu and minced port that is the typical signature dish of Szechuan, but most of the food is well above acceptable.

For dinner, they have takeout combos of Chinese dishes that comes with a proportional serving of rice and soup.  The servings are very generous.  A family of five can easily have a full dinner with just a 3 dish combo.  I've tried many combinations of dishes and they all came out tasty.   The 3 dish combo comes out to about $24 with tax included.

Among my favorites are the fish fillets with seasonal vegetables, Chinese style beef (sweet and sour), chicken with Chinese sausage and onions and garlic in a pot, sweet and sour fish filet, diced chicken gong-pow.  

You can have more exotic or more tasty dishes in other places, but if you have a few hungry mouths to feed at dinner, run out of ideas, and want to get good value, this is one of the best places in Richmond hill to order takeout from.
