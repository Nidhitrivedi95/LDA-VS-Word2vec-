IDPbmH1OIhEbb9OIQyDJgw I don't usually go to vegetarian restaurant as I would eat fair bit of vegetables with meat, I don't need to go having a vegetarian day once a week or once a month.

wanted to try out this place as many people told me this is a good place.

Mixed tofu sheet rolls and gluten pieces, it's probably the worst presentation I have seen. it's like they took few dishes of left overs from other tables and put them together.
the tofu pieces has no flavor, not salty nor sweet. the red gluten should taste sour, was just flavorless. and the one should be a curry taste, was simply hot with loads of red pepper seeds, but no curry spice at all...(well, may be some coloring?)

at this point, we were ready to cancel all the other orders and leave.

the other dim sum arrives, these are dim sum made with all vegetables or with imitation meat. the looks really resembles regular dim sum. but the wrapping on the steamed dumpling was so thick and chewy, it's not good eats.

I won't go again, and I wouldn't suggest anyone to go too.
