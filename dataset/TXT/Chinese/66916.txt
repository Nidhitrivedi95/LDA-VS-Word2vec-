ejdBoVvEdn5fdycuJRen8Q I have lived here in the CHAMBANA area for 20 years now, and this is the only place  I go to get great tasting, affordable Chinese cuisine. They don't waste their money in fadish decor but instead puts the money into providing fresh and quality produce and meat in your meals! Don't waste your money on restaurants with gaudy store fronts because their food can be a digestive hazard. Try FIRST WOK and experience a happy culinary experience.
