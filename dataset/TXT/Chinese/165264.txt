uytrX0s6etYPCcMVC07KJw What's not to love about Jade Star? HUGE portions, great service, unbelievable prices and yes - YUUUUUUUUMMY food!  Brought a large group here over the weekend and we all ordered combo dinners for around $9.00. Food was excellent and the leftovers even better. Some recommendations: General Tso chicken, chicken fried rice, spicy pork, chicken & mushrooms, Kung Pao chicken and egg drop soup.
