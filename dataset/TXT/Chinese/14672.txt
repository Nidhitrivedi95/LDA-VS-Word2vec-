3HeX5ZAaPesR0psjGHtI6g In my quest for good bubble tea in Ontario, my friend took me to this place right off the highway. 

My first impression was that it was large. I mean, seriously. I'm used to intimate tea shops that provide for some cozy mingling amongst friends, but my friend informed me that this was the place to be at night (we were there early evening so it wasn't exactly bustling.) 

I ordered a lychee rose tea with tapioca pearls, and honestly I'm surprised at the price of bubble tea in these parts. In Vancouver my drink would rarely surpass $5 and it's size is the equivalent to what is considered a 'large' in Toronto. Here a regular size still clocks in at about $4 - too much for poor little me.

But back on topic - my drink was on the sweet side but so far it's the best bubble tea I've had so far in Ontario, which is saying alot. Overall, it's a nice place; there's a large selection of teas, calpis, and smoothies, plus food items like appies, toasts, and desserts, all for a decent price. I can definitely see this being a great hangout place at night, as there's ample space set up on the patio and indoors for groups. I'd like to come back and try the place out at night.
