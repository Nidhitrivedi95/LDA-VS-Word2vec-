1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Bare bones establishment that's all about the food.  There are literally 2 people who prepare all the food and server the customers.  That's probably how they keep their prices insanely low.  Almost every dish was under $5.  My group of 10 ordered at least 2 dishes per person and everything was delivered in a timely manner.  

Highlights 

- Get the salt and pepper chicken wings.  Best I've ever had.  Seasoned and fried perfectly with thinly sliced peppers.  I could eat these all day.  

- Hoi Nam Chicken with chicken rice.  Love you can choose dark or white meat.  Great dipping sauces.  The rice is sooo good.  Make sure to ask for ginger sauce too.  

- Thin Rib Eye - Thin cuts of rib eye with dipping sauce (like teriyaki, but not as sweet?) and potatoes.  I don't know if this is Chinese, but it was good.  If I were to do it again, I would probably go for the thick rib eye.

- Roti w/ Curry Chicken - Tasty roti, but wish the curry was a bit thicker.  Big chunks of chicken in the curry

- Surprisingly good Thai iced tea.

We over-ordered for 10 people, the bill still came out to $90.  I wish I had a Big Wong's in Seattle.  This is my kind of place!
