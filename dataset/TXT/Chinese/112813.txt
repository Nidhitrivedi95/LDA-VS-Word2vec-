Mkpg9S2j0ZrZc3q-VjfLsA The selection of congee offered at Congee Queen is simply amazing.  I noticed the previous reviews either simply mentioned the availability of congee, or the very typical congee like pork and preserved egg congee.  But what you want to try here is the congee varieties that are not typical.

We went to Congee Queen on the last night of my visit to Toronto.  But we weren't too hungry so we decided to split two bowls of congee and the House Seafood & Mixed Vegetable Fried Taiwanese Vermicelli between us.  For the two congees, we ordered the Fresh Geoduck Clam Congee and the Assorted Fungus & Six-Grains Congee.  I've never had geoduck in congee before so I definitely wanted to try it.  My aunt was eating with me and she had mentioned earlier how she tried and failed to make congee from brown rice, so when we saw that Congee Queen makes a congee out of six different grains, we knew we wanted to try that, too.  The grains in the Assorted Fungus & Six-Grains Congee consist of: brown rice, hulless barley, French red rice, rye berries, purple barley, and Japanese rice.  I'm pretty sure I have never eaten half of those grains before.  

Both of these congees were delicious and the texture and consistency were just right.  You could really taste the different grains in the Six-Grain Congee, and I especially liked the geoduck in the Geoduck Congee. 

While we were eating, I noticed that they also offer a Pumpkin Hot Pot Congee with Rock Crab Meat & Vegetarian Shark Fin.  Had I seen that on the menu earlier, I would have ordered it, too.  Next time!
