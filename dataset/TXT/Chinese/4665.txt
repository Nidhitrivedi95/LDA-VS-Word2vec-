_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w We ordered a 5 lbs lobster with rice and veggie combo. The lobster was cooked "HK style", which comes with fried small fishes and garlic! It was fantastic!!! We also ordered honey pepper fried oysters which was good and very peppery! The combo came with a chicken  soup which was cooked for hours! Very yummy!  We could not finish the lobster and took most of it home! Overall the experience was amazing and there was no "over charge" on the final bill! We shall meet again soon!!!!!!!!
