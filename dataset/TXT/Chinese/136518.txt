qGLEE1yA1bK0YdlGI-S39A Probably one of the best Chinese restaurants in Mississauga. Had the beef brisket + shrimp wontons in egg noodle which only cost $5.50. The portion was large (the wontons are especially huge) for the price. Wait staff was nice and service was super fast (ordered and got my food within 5 minutes). The only downside was the price of the vegetables was a bit high for the small portion. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend this place for a quick meal!
