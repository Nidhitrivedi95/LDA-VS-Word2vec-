ABRgXNwdOX_JyqChNr8IYw We took a stab at this place since we were in from Cali and was awesome.  Small place yet the food was as good at higher in places I've been too in San Francisco.  Everyone was super nice.  Only thing the 5 of us agreed we would change is to add more than Budweiser to the menu.  Roasted Duck is a must and we ordered more even after being totally full.  Oh only catch we just found out...CASH ONLY
