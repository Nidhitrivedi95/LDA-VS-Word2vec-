wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA Yes off the strip because recommended from a friend. BUT so worth the trip.
SO happy we came here.
From appetizer to dessert.
Everything was incredibly tasty & encouraging us to try these dishes at home. Food is uniquely amazing!!! 
The squid & yellowtail were my 2 favorite dishes. The best was finishing with the lychee sorbet. Absolutely delicious!!
Jong the owner seriously pays attention to your happiness and every detail.
