W8xPHUqL088jdcmNZyH-eA I've been here twice and the food is pretty good.  It's different but in a good way.  We tried the beef pancakes, dumplings with spicy sauce, the beef rolls and rice with ground meat.  The sauce they use is all homemade and none of the food was salty.  I'm sensitive to salt.  The boba milk teas were okay.  I think the powder they use is bland.  I'll probably try the stews next time.
