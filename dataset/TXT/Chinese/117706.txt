nH9sGGOaW0ONeIYcmsK3EQ Every Christmas, we have a family gathering at this restaurant, and my overall impression has always been positive.

The cooking style is admittedly not 100% authentic to Sichuan (my family is from there). The freshness of the spices and the levels of spiciness are certainly different. Nevertheless, the food is still authentically Chinese. 
We usually reserve one of the private "rooms" and order a set of dishes, which come at a good pace, until the whole table is covered. Portions are generous, and everything is consistently well prepared.

Always a great meal to look forward to.
