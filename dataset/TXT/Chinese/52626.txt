Cjs6QghR-nIninfgAoErvw I got some take-out here last night. The food was great, for a take-out Chinese place. Their prices are reasonable at about $8 per dish. As other's have said they're a little slow at the prep. They said my order would be ready in 25 minutes but when I got there I still had to wait another 10 or so minutes.

Their decor is interesting. It's all stone tables and walls. They use padded benches instead of chairs at the tables which is an interesting twist. The front of the restaurant opens up so during the summer you can enjoy the weather while digging into your noodles.

There's a 10% discount if you pay cash.
