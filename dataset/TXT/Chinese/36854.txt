AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw Yay, they brought back the homemade egg rolls!!!!   Had those and crab puffs at Happy Hour last night and would order both again.

That said, they really need to get their breakfast cook in more often.  They only offer breakfast on Sundays....and their breakfast is one of the few things on the menu that doesn't come across as reheat and serve (ie, not made on site.)   Showed up at 11:00 sharp for breakfast and guess what, the chef leaves for the day so you are out of luck if you show up any time after 10:59.   As regulars, that was more than frustrating.

Oh, by the way we love the owner and the bartenders....super friendly and always make you feel at home.
