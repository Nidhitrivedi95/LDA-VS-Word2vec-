THsmhy9NXI6WOEhVnrv01A Great food, great service. Can't complain.

If you like authentic Chinese food and are in the area, King Wah is the place to go.

Their roasted duck is absolutely amazing. Oysters and roasted pork were delicious. Everything tastes fresh from the market. The food is reasonably priced. The service is great, they may not speak English too well, but I think that just adds to authenticity of their food. Straight from China. 

I'm definitely coming back!
