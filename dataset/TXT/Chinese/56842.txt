d0_yLkH7u16tlcvvU-zIxw Nice looking restaurant inside but could use some music. Kinda that awkward quiet. But on to the food. Started with pot stickers, veggie spring and egg rolls, as well as some soup. ..all amazing and wonderful.  We were off to a great start. Then the main courses came. One with beef and the other with chicken. Bad. They were aweful. I couldn't even eat more than one bite of the beef. So bland and bad. The chicken was over cooked and just tasted wrong. I would come here again but only for the appetizers! Never a main course!
