pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA A little pricey? Yes, perhaps but I find most sushi places offering tasty fresh sushi usually are. I had a quick low key meal here at the bar so I cannot really speak to the actual decor of this restaurant. I ordered some sashimi (toro & unagi)...both were good but the unagi was so delicious I ordered another piece. I had the Neo Tokyo Roll as well and while it may not have been anything "super fancy" I thought it was tasty and would have gladly eaten another piece or two. I also had a cocktail (a strawberry martini type thing) which I also thought was very tasty - very fresh! I would gladly go back to SS.
