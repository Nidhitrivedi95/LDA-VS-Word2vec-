8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ Drove all the way from the west end to try this place for dinner upon my mom's friend's recommendation.  They were fully booked for the night and we didn't have a reservation, but after a bit of a wait, they managed to fit our group of six in. The food was definitely worth the wait. We ordered fish maw soup, fresh bass two ways, snow pea shoots in a conpoy soup, free range steamed chicken and cantonese style pork chops.  All of these are items that can be found at any Cantonese restaurant, but Dragon Boat goes above and beyond with their attention to detail and luxury. The soup included fish roe which I've never seen at any other restaurant.  The pork was very tender and seamed to be braised before being fried.  It was a premium cut of meat. Most Chinese restaurants buy the cheap cuts and try to hide the fact by soaking it in meat tenderizer. The staff was also very attentive, replacing your plate with a clean one every few minutes. Finally, the complimentary dessert consisted of a trio of items - A peanut cookie, a mango pudding cube, and white fungus sweet soup.  Usually, I'm not a big fan of the white fungus dessert soup.  It usually doesn't have much flavour other than sugar and some sort of squash or melon. This one however was loaded with lotus seeds and longan, giving it a much more complex and satisfying flavour.  Overall, this restaurant is a bit pricier than the average Chinese restaurant, but the quality is well worth the price. I look forward to returning here again.
