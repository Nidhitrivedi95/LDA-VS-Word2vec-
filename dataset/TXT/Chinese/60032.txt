dltDW0fS4HzxZ0A7PDT5jg Came her for dimsum and a set dinner for 8 people. The service is prompt and attentive. You will still need to waive down a waiter if you would like something but the environment is nice as they recently renovated. Their dim sum is push cart however you can also order from paper if you ask. That annoyed me a bit because when we asked, they replied " what would you like?" - this made it apparent that this service was only for a few folks. For dinner, in the set menu for 8 people there was Peking duck cooked two ways, birds nest (taro nest with seafood and broccoli ), soy chicken with these delicious candied walnuts, vegetables, fried rice and Cantonese chow mein. There was plenty of food and it was delicious. The service in the evening was wonderful however it wasn't very busy for a Sunday evening. I also loved how there was no wait for dim sum as well.
