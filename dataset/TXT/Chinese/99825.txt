JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA Squish squish so you can Eat a Dish. How Crazy is that? They even provide wax paper just for squishing down your food to CRUSH as much as you can into the tiny dish.

I was a first timer and didn't know the squish thing or even had an idea what the wax paper was for until I saw OTHER PEOPLE displaying humiliating , embarrassing ,  disgraceful behavior crushing down food and then piling maybe as high as 10 inches above the bowl. Some people actually had to jump in the air to squish. ( I am sorry now I didn't video and send this up to You Tube.)

The meats and vegetables seemed fresh and I didn't notice any vegetables being canned (like at the Gag Us Chain) But I really didn't like the watered down sauces. Unlike the other stir fry places here you need to add maybe 7 ladle's of sauces to get the correct flavor and then you get a BOILED vegetable dish. YUCK!

I know MOST people enjoy coming here and doing the squish thing eating a boiled dish of food for approx. $10 but I can go to my favorite Chinese and get a rice bowl that taste better and is bigger and not crushed food for only $3.50 or spring for the whole lunch plate for only $4.95 so you won't be seeing me here again.

As for Stir Fry Places I like the independent Stir Fry place on Bell Rd is better than this place or the Gag Us Chain because I don't have to squish down food , I (don't) but I can go back and get as many Stir Fry's as I like at that place and the sauces aren't watered down so the food comes out better.

 To each his own . Different Stir Fry's for different folks Eat what YOU like!
