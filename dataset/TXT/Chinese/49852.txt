CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw We were a group  of six and were sat without much hassle.
It was a Saturday night and the place was pretty full but we were well accommodated.
We wanted dim sum but they had run out.  They still had plenty to choose from though.
We all opted for the prix fix menu, soup (I opted for wonton soup) was good, and had nice flavor with plenty of wontons.  The spring rolls were fried, I thought they would be fresh, but still were pretty good.  I went for the bbq pork pad thai and it was really tasty.  I asked for it spicy but it wasn't.  Still good though.

Two of us had to leave early and asked for boxes, it took them a bit of time to box things up, but they did a great job packaging things for us in boxes, with utensils, sauce, and chili sauce.

The service was pretty good despite being busy and the drinks were always full.

The noise level was good too despite the place being on the smaller side.  We had a good time and I would recommend going here with friends in the future!
