There is a guy that sings at night on weekends which is kind of funny not terrible just weird match. I wish they would fix their cords on the stage its an eyesore. The rest of the place has nice wood ornamental cabinetry and Thai decor. 

2 thumbs up regular place for us. online ordering works well too and better to use if you want things a special way.
