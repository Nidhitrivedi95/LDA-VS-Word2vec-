I need a volunteer who can show me what to order at Chinese restaurants like this.  I can order at panda express, but these type of places I am confused.

So. I just point at a few things on the menu.  I got a pork cutlet and some noodle dish.  I had the whole shrimp fried - I am not a fan of that.  Overall - The food was good.  I was happy.

Then, some real Chinese people sitting next to me got their order.  It looked so good!!!  I almost asked if I could buy in on there dinner and eat with them.

The place was super clean.  Probably the best service at an Asian restaurant in Las Vegas, too.  

I think I will read through some reviews and take some pointers on what to order and go back.
