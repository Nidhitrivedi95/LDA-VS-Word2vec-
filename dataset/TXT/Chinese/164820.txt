UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w Ports O Call is a great value just off the strip.  We took the bus there, and it was pretty convenient to reach.  We did the lunch buffet, which was less than $10.  The food was quite good, especially for the price.  Granted, it's not a five star restaurant, but for $10, you get an above average buffet with a great variety and a pretty good selection.  Not everything looked appetizing to me personally, but there is food for every taste.  Even the sushi was pretty good, and the dessert selection is very, very good.  Go!  you'll certainly get good value for your money.
