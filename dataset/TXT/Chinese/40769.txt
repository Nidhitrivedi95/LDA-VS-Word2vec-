b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag First I like you o know that I travel most of the time by myself, and with that said I,  I had one of the most amazing times at Chin Chin!!! The three people at the bar were awesome made me feel like I was one of their family members. Never felt like I was alone sitting there Dana was one of the most attentive bartenders I've ever met!!! Again I travel for a living and bartenders like that our award winners! I have eaten at chin chins in California most of them, by far this young lady takes the cake of bartenders at Chin Chin, she has a  award winning smile that Chin Chin should have for all there employee! The sushi chef was also awesome Ben! I had a great time to talking to both of them and the third bartender. Chin chins you have 3 great individual people working for you! Hats off to you!!!
