vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Like all my reviews, food is 3 and service is 2 to add up to 5 stars. I gave them 2 stars for food and 0 for service. 
This place has such bad organizations, we ordered our food for to-go and waited over an hr for the food to be ready. 
The waitresses did not bother to tell us if our food was ready or not or any update on it. It is ridiculous of how long they make us wait. I was so upset, it's not even funny. 
We asked them to check on our food and the lady in the picture that I took kept ignoring us. 
I don't know why it takes them this long to cook the food bc it took them OVER AN HOUR to do it. 
I love this place but they're just so rude to us. 
We were ignored and they were not friendly about it either. 
I've worked with customers and you apologize and give them an update. 
Idk maybe it's just that day, maybe it's just the waitresses that was working at the moment. 
Hope this helps.
