ujUEnwAAhfNOe_LMYEFJrw Just had a chow mein and it was by far the worst I have ever had. Luke warm and dry. Also had chips which were undercooked and hard. The meal was ready in about 3 minutes which isn't enough time to cook anything properly. It looks like a lovely clean modern place but I will never be back. Disgusting!!
