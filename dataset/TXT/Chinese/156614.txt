If you sit up front it is better. My Mother's dinner was in the back booth at the end of the bar. It is noisy because of some machine making noise (blender or something). It is dark and out of place. The staff travels by you all of the time as that is where they go for pick ups. If you sit at the front it is 5 stars.

Staff 1 star
Speaking of which we were unhappy with the back booth so asked if we could move up front where there was an empty table. They fussed about then said ok. We ordered oysters and beers. We were content and happy. Then the guy comes back and says we can not sit there because the next reservation needed physical accommodations and for some reason I do not know couldn't sit in the back booth. Upon leaving we did not notice any problems with the guests. There was no wheelchair, crutches or cane. They looked perfectly happy (and fit) to me and that was probably because they were sitting up front. I also felt we were ignored for awhile after the 2 moves. There was no sorry or thanks a lot....nothing really. Nothing said on the way out either. No good bye or have a nice day. We are nice family and were never rude so I must conclude that they just do not care or are oblivious. Lastly,the night was typified by the fact that the other tables had nice lilies on them but not ours. :(

Food 3 stars
Oysters are oysters but they are sourced well and of excellent quality. Hamburger and fries is good. Nice shoestring fries that go nicely with mayo. Burger is juicy and well conceived. The reason for 3 stars is that I went and month or so a go and had the fish and chips. I did not dig the soft coating. It was like mush. 

Best thing about the place is the 4pm - 6pm oyster and drink specials. Slurping oysters is awesome and $5 Beau's pints nice on the wallet.
