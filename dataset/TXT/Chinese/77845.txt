GhGYQ5WI4LdH53591fUMMA I barely remembered what I ate here, that's how un-memorable and poorly put-together the food was.  I even predicted it would only be a matter of time before they closed their doors...and lookie loo. 

It doesn't matter anymore, but I had some bland, limp summer rolls, to go with the bland limp noodles of Pad Thai.  Seriously, microwave Annie Chung's grocery Pad Thai is better.  (The previous reviews say it all.)

(I read today on a restaurant blog how the whole Park Towne complex is having issues keeping tenants, since Montford is hoppin' and only a skip away and the rent if cheaper.)
