O_J5e6aoskxhGx8meOm1Og We've tried this restaurant 4 times, ever since we "discovered" it. Every time we visit we've had different dishes, and everything has been delicious (we're in the process of eating our way through the menu). This has become our new, favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley. Not only is the food great, and the portions large, but the service has been wonderful. Last, but not least, the decor is delightful.
