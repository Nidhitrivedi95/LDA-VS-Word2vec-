I live all the way out by Lake Las Vegas so my delivery options are not huge but on random Chinese delivery cravings China Joe's does the job, The people on the phone are always nice foods decent noting special. Their Generals chicken is good but they put it in a styrofoam box and it's a really hot food so the box looks melted when it gets to you not a big fan of that. I'll probably order from them again, hopefully i remember to tell them no styrofoam boxes.
