The beef pie ( not spicy nor flaming hot ) was delicious. The fish I ordered was a little mouth burning hot even my tummy seems burning for hours after that, but I just couldn't resist the way it done that my brain kept signalling it wants more. Also, the wonton soup's interestingly different than all other Chinese or Korean I tasted so far. It just different and big, very delicious indeed.
