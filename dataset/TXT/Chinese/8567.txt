1jNteKQ2JuF6Sk1SI9X23Q I always seem to get dragged to PF Changs in the States by people who hate Chinese food, but LOVE! PF Changs. Now, I've been dragged here in Toronto. 

Simply put, an even more Americanized (Canadianized?) version of the already Americanized Chinese food available in typical Chinese restaurants. Nothing tastes right. That's not to say it doesn't have a good taste on its own, but it doesn't taste like Chinese food at all. Atmosphere is fantastic. Energy of a bustling bistro. Food of Chilli's or Friday's off of their "Asian Inspired" menu. Don't be fooled and taken in by the trappings! With all of the fantastic Asian Food in this town, you can do better...much.

If you think Manchu Wok in the mall is great, this will blow you away. It seems to attract Prom dates down in the States.

FYI, this is one of those places where the appetizers are better than the mains, so if you must go just pig out on the apps and your experience will be a bit more tolerable.
