gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw we are big Shogun fans which is just north of this restaurant, but a clear altenative for a change of scenery and sushi and sashimi choices.  hasn't been too crowded and we always feel welcome.  the sashimi was fresh and a generous portion cut for the smallest selection.  we are now frequent diners at Iron Chef
