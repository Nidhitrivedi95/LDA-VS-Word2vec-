C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ We came here on a Saturday evening, a little before 8pm, and had their dinner buffet for 
31.54 (Used a 15% off dinner coupon that I received in the mail) 

- Right before we walked in 2 Asian men came out arguing about Lobster! Literally, "Let's take this outside!" Hot commodity. YES! 
- Pay before you eat like a casino buffet. 
Items to grab a second time
1. salmon sashimi 
2. Lobster - like at a dim sum restaurant
3. Prawns - like at Makinos
4. Crab legs 
- Disorganized seating. 
- Like most Asians, you come for the seafood. They do have the normal Chinese buffet food and the sushi rolls that no one gets. Fillers. 
- No dim sum. No tempura. 
- Oysters taste just like the sea...yuck. Good thing they have lemons and chili paste.
- Exactly what I expected. Great food, sloppy venue. If you can get over that, then you'll have a wonderful time. 
- Full-filling. Cheap. No dates. Family + Bring GM+GF type of place. You challenge yourself to AYCE, then leave with that  greasy upset stomach feeling. haha
