tbMAjldMYhvDUS2gG5Fdxw Ok I eat here and the food is good and whatever. Let me tell you first off, I have a stomach of steel. But it seems like every time I come and eat here, I get the worst stomach cramps, filled with vomiting and diarrhea. I know they haven't had consistent ratings with health inspection and I can't help to wonder why.... This is the worst place
