uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw This place is always packed, expect to wait 10-30 minutes for a table. There is nothing fancy about this little restaurant at all. It's all about the food here. I find the soup base to be very very flavourful, and their hand-made noodles are cooked al dente. All the noodle dishes are very very good. Their skewers are not up to par though. They are too dry, and tough. Either they need to marinate it longer, or use more fatty cuts of meat. Their cold appetizers are really good, flavourful, and the portion size is just right for 2 people to share. I wouldn't recommend getting any of their deep-fried dishes, they tend to be way too oily, every time. Most of my friends from China would say this place isn't authentic, and they had better noodles elsewhere. I think this place is still great, and considering their opinion of authenticity, would definitely recommend this place as a training-wheels for Northern China cuisine. I actually frequent this restaurant maybe once or twice a month in the late evening, they are open 24 hours. A large bowl of noodles for me every time!
