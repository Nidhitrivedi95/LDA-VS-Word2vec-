VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Flo's is the bomb-diggity. My family has known Flo since she was the cook at Eddie Chan's in Scottsdale. I loved that little hole in the wall Chinese restaurant and was sad when they closed and reopened in Cave Creek as an expensive up-scale place. But Flo's is still affordable. The portion sizes are good (I can't even eat a whole kids order of sweet & sour chicken) and they now have steamed bbq pork buns *drool*. The atmosphere is a little nerve-racking though. Maybe it's the bare floors and high ceilings but it always seems loud and chaotic there.
