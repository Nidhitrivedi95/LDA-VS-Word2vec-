ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Excellent meal and very nice ambiance.  My fiance and I ate on the patio.  We started with a special grilled octopus appetizer which was good.  He had the wood grilled octopus.  That was amazing!  Such a wonderful broth, and the seasonings were delicious.  

He also had an old fashioned which was made well.  

For dinner I had the seasonal vegetable plate.  The yams were perfect.  He had the pork ramen with gluten free noodles.  This is wonderful for him with his gluten allergy.

For dessert I had the chocolate pudding.  I really did not care for it at all, too sweet and not much flavor.

Overall, a wonderful place.  We will go back!
