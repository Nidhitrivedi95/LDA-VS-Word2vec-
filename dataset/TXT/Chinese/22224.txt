6I4twTs8oFMuDsuTwS7IgQ Lian Pu is decently priced yummy Chinese. Some people are fans and others are skeptical. Well it is a popular place for many Chinese students and has sizeable portions at decent prices. 

Now quality of  food is standard quality but that more greasy goodness we all need occasionally. However, some of their dishes can be lighter and boast some of those home comfort feels, like their chicken and egg noodle soup. 

It's also great if you want to get more traditional Chinese dishes, such as beef intestine. Yes, they have that. But if you want to get the more popular Chinese dishes they have that too. Mabo tofu is really good, nice and spicy yet light tofu. New favorite may be the beef ho fun which is so nice for the fried noodle cravings. 

Also, they serve bubble tea! The bubble tea is yummy. Downstairs they have hot pot and little grills if anyone is thinking of a more all you can eat type experience.
