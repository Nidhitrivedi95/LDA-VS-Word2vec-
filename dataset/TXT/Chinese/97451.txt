JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw So delicious!  We came for dinner about 5pm and though he was not going to hand pull the noodles for a couple of more bowls he did it anyway for us. What a show and talent! We ordered the beef bowl, the pork bowl, the chicken and mushrooms with shaved noodles, the chicken chow mein with shaved noodles and the beef pancakes and potsickers. The beef pancakes were awesome! I don't know hown they get them so juicy inside and the flavors were fantastic. The noodle bowls had excellent flavor as well and my mom said the knife shaved noodles in her chicken chow mein were the best. The staff was willing to give small extras, like some extra chopped green onions and the micro radish greens gave just enough bite to cut the richness of the appetizers. Definitely coming back and will recommend Shang Artisan Noodle to others!
