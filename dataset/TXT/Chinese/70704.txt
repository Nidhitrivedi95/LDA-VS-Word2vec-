F9h98ZFHLCHG7SdVbXMz0g Bayview / York Mills finally has a dim sum spot! Normally we go up to Highway 7 or east to Scarborough when we need a dim sum fix. We didn't have high expectations of Kwan but were pleasantly surprised. Prices are higher than typical Cantonese restaurants but so is the rent in this plaza.

The traditional steamed shrimp dumpling (har gow <U+867E><U+997A>)and Chiuchow fun gor (<U+6F6E><U+5DDE><U+7C89><U+679C>) had quality fillings but the glutinous rice wrappers were a bit too sticky (too much water in the dough?). 

Their modern dim sum creations were innovative, well-executed and quite delicious. We will go again for the deep-fried eel and soft tofu, exquisitely bound by a strand of seaweed. Also looking forward to the flaky baked eel pastry. On a roll here with the eel, lol.

The stuffed rice noodle (cheong fun <U+80A0><U+7C89>)that we ordered was a winner too. High quality fillings and a personal mini-pot of heated soy sauce. Fancy!

The male server didn't greet us at all when we entered but once we were seated, he was friendly and professional. Later, we heard him welcoming a group of Caucasians. I think the restaurant management should train their staff to greet everyone - not just patrons who obviously speak English.
