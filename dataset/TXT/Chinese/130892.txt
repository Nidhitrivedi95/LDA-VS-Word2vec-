pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Some of the best quality salmon I've had in Vegas. I'm a regular diner at Mizumi over at the Wynn, however SushiSamba gave Mizumi a run for their money. Normally, I spend about $100 at Mizumi per person including tax and tip to get full which at the Wynn is about the standard price of a nice dinner meal. 

I got more food that was still incredible quality for half the price. I left SushiSamba spending $55 with tax and tip per person to get more full on a larger variety of fish and amount. Another awesome thing about SushiSamba is the fusion they offer with their other dishes. Be sure to try the Wagyu Beef potstickers; they were very interesting and definitely worth trying. Additionally, make sure you order Toro!!!
