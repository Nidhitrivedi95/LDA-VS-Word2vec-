hjDe9ndGEdtUREYUTXvqsQ Three stars at best. Kept hearing about this from friends and family members so had to try it out. Went with my mom. She had the beef brisket and I had the shrimp and pork wanton noodles. Mom found the brisket to be very salty.  The wanton are comparable to   most mediocre chinese restaurants. I personally think chim jai Kee is way better. At least their wanton are huge.
