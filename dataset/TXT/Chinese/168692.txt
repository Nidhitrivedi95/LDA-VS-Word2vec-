Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA This place is great. Friendly staff everything is fresh. Noodle soup is great lots of meat not loaded with veggies like most. And I love hot food but this place takes the heat scale to a new level so lower your usual number but those of us who like hot this is your place. Wish the menu had a larger selection of conventional Chinese options just because I'm sure they would be great
