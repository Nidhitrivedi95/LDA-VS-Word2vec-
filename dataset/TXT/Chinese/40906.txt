b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag Let's be honest - nothing in Sin City is cheap. For Vegas travelers on a budget, finding an inexpensive place to eat can be tough. 

During a trip to Las Vegas for the 2008 CES, my parents and I had dinner at Chin Chin at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino one night. The three of us agreed on this place as we had been looking for some Chinese food for some time. The prices were generally lower than those of other eateries in the area, so it seemed like an attractive place to eat. 

Unfortunately, the low prices were just about the only good thing about the restaurant. For starters, many of the dishes were over-seasoned. Case in point, the fried rice was extremely salty as it was literally drenched in soy sauce. The other items we ordered also had similar problems, and it was rather hard for us to eat the food as we prefer lighter tastes.

The three of us also ordered some raspberry mousse cake for dessert. This, too, turned out to be a mistake as the cake seemed to be extremely heavy in fat and sugar. It was actually so greasy that it caused me to lose my appetite the following morning. I had split the slice with my parents, but even that didn't seem to help.

The quality of service was not impressive either. It took the waitress five minutes to bring us the dessert menu, even though there were few other guests. After we ordered the cake, it took another five minutes for her to bring it to us despite it being a pre-made item.

On the whole, I would not recommend this place. I understand one can't really judge a restaurant with a single dining experience, but my impressions are telling me to stay away from Chin Chin in the future.

-- TL;DR version --

Highs: Prices are relatively low
Lows: Slow service; food is over-seasoned and greasy
Bottom line: You get what you pay for in Vegas. Low prices aside, there are better options.
Final verdict: 2.5 stars (rounded up to three)
