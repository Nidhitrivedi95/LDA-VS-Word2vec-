uP2-0N59oW5lggIyvdfWkQ Fortune Cookie!  I finally figured out what was bothering me about the dining experience at Chung King Garden.  Last time I had Fortune Cookie at a Chinese restaurant in the Markham area was....... Never?

 2-course Peking Duck.  While the French fatten up Ducks for their Liver, the Chinese fatten up Ducks for their SKIN.  The server came out carrying a plate with the WHOLE Peking Duck then took it back inside.  We got JIPPED!  While the Duck looked steriod-style plump it was anti-climatic as one of the highlights of a Peking Duck is the Chef's presentation.  It's the same as a Teppanyaki Chef doing their Onion Volcano presentation.   3.5  *Star*

My Foreign Friends were sitting table side and it would have been completely awesome to see her shock as the Chef grabs the Duck by the Neck and skinned the Peking Duck piece-by-piece in front of her.   :D   Alas no table-side presentation as the plate of Peking Duck comes out from the Kitchen to the table directly.

Duck Skin & Pancake Wrap  -  Crispy Skin.  Low-Fat Duck Meat(Meh).  That's why you eat the Duck Meat with Hoisin Sauce/Scallions inside the Pancake Wrap rather than on its own.

Minced Duck & Lettuce Wrap  -  Excellent savoury flavoured Minced Duck Meat mixture balanced out with the refreshing Lettuce Wrap.  Water Chestnut and Deep-fried Rice Noodle gave some contrasting texture to the soft Minced Meat.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Sizzling Plate Beef  -  Extreme Sizzling Plate that explodes sauces within a 15 cm radius.  The dish had flavour but the Beef seemed overly tender for some reason.  Nonetheless I'll eat it.

Seafood in Taros Nest  -  Scallop, Shrimp, Squid and Mixed Vegetables sit inside the Nest made of Taro.  As good as the others I've had in the past.
