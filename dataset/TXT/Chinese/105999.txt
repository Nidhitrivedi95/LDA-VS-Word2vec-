ky5L-EfUwU9chSPcIeXM5w I've been wanting to order from this place for a while. I finally did and was extremely happy with my order. The egg rolls were really good and the NY style chicken chow mien was amazing. Veggies were plentiful and not overcooked. The hot mustard was in a cup and actually hot. Will definitely order again.
