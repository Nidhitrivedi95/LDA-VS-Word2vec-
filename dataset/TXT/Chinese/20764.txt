64ZPMllrqdrVNXMEQIvXhw Place sucks. I've never had a horrible tasting chinese food until I had their food. Bourbon chicken is so bland, chicken is so dry. Mongolian beef is not mongolian beef at all! There's no beef, just carrots and onion and it was sooo spicy. it taste so bad. Also forgot to give us 2 rice for 2 entrees order. Horrible place. Take your money elsewhere.
