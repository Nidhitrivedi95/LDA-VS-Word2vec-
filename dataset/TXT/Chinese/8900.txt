1MrJJ9tyNyfFrxaNZ67xFg Hello my new friend....Wow.  Just had dinner there at the behest of friend who recommended.  So glad we did.  Nice place, classy and clean!  Had  the hot and sour soup to start - tasty, hot and spicy, then fresh spring rolls, crunchy and fresh with nice dipping sauce.  My husband had the stir-fried (note, not deep fried chicken doughnuts) General Tso and I had the spicy beef with broccoli and cauliflower.  Outstanding.  Fresh, spicy, beautiful and just well done.  Service was wonderful.  Our server was charming and helpful.  We will return, soon I'm thinking.....
