9BBWtaSvsootDkKTVBgv_A This is the best value for price of a buffet I have ever seen. It was about $9 and there were six or eight of those buffet tables with food, a hibachi grill, and a sushi bar. The variety in food is ridiculous. There were several tables for asian style food, one table for american style food, one table for fried foods, a raw bar of oysters and mussles, a salad bar, a pudding bar, an ice cream bar, and a dessert bar. 

I was pleasantly suprised by the amount of fish offered, the salmon and whitefish were quite good. There were however very few fully vegetarian dishes, I think the only thing they had was a green beans dish. The hibachi looked very popular but I did not try it. The sushi bar was pretty sad and I didn't really trust the fish. I definitely did not trust the raw bar, the oysters looked very slimy. 

The desserts were ok, the ice cream was pretty good.

Overall the food is not the best, I would say subpar to your regular old chinese takeout, but for the price and the variety this is definitely a very good deal and there's plenty of seating.
