R-EGIdIgtoFzl--OudANtA This place is awesome!!

I'm a pasty white guy who can't understand the menu, but point and order has worked a treat for me. 

I will admit that the place is small, and some would consider less than immaculately clean, but the food is fresh, hot, and quite good. 

The lovely young woman who serves me every time I go there, knows that I can't figure out the menu, but remembers what I order each visit and asks me if I want the same thing or something new. 

The prices are super affordable, which always makes me leave more than a 20% tip.

Give it a go, I doubt that you will be disappointed.
