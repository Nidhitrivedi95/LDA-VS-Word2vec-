pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og We came on a livingsocial. The place looks great. Looks hi quality. Looks like the food would be good. However, that's where it stops. We had 4 types of sushi. All were very average. All very small. The rainbow roll was again average, as well as the rest. Basically a nice place with avg service and nice looks, avg food at a very very overpriced bill ! Will not be back.
