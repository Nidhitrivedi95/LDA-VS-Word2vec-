C8Ehjy_oDzYcy3-wf32Y4A The food presentation is a solid 4 star. 

$11+ for seafood pad thai & $8+ for egg noodles soups & specialties. Maybe they skim back on the quantity because food has great quality. However, if you want a to get a decent portion to fill you up with this price, visit Lac Vien. My expectations were fulfilled but I wasn't full after finishing my bowl of Shrimp Egg Noodle Soup. 

Reasons why I couldn't put 5* because:
* Shrimps were not deveined. 
* Coconut milkshake had way too much ice. By the time it was drinkable it tasted watered down. 
* Short staffed. It was 6pm, there were 5-6 tables with around 3 people each. Only one server was present at the front. 

Other than that I'd highly recommend this place if you're in Mississauga. Better than Pho House by miles, cleaner & better food. Soup was flavorful & not too overwhelming with MSG. Pad Thai had just the right amount of sauce & they use the thick noodles as tradition.
