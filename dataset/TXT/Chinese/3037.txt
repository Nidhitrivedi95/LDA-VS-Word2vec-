_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA This place is good however it is quite pricey for Chinese food. But hey you are in Vegas and this place is located in the Venetian so what do you expect right? I have been here several times and have ordered several dishes which were quite good and satisfying. The 3 stars is because of the price ( which I know I can't get for cheaper in SF) and the so-so service.
