keQlXWfz2K7GukqaReVyow OK. 4 stars for the food 2 stars for the experience.  The place is crazy, when we got there it was fairly quiet except for this waiter who ran around like a bull in a china shop. The staff were all yelling at each other and there was loud karaoke or something coming from the back room. A waitress approached us who was so soft spoken, I could not hear a word she said. It was bazaar.
That said the Ma Po tofu was outstanding (albeit off of the veggie menu and loaded with pork)
