szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A Meh, I'll give it three stars.  I do not really recommend this place over C-Fu and Mekong unless distance is an issue.  I went to Great Wall around 1pm on Monday (a holiday, and they were pretty full) for dim sum,  I tried (using.the English/American terms):
Rice cake
Bbq pork bun
Shrimp dumpling
Pork dumpling 
Coconut custard bun (the best item I ate)

Everything was decent.  Not amazing, not very warm and steamy, but just solid three star food.  The coconut custard bun/bread was actually much better than C-Fu's though, which was a delight!

They were out of many things or only had two of something so you had to choose a third item of another type (which may be one you didn't care for).  I was unable to try the sesame seed balls and custard tarts because of this.  They also did not have a lot of what was on their takeout menu, but to be fair C-Fu only has their full selection on weekends, so maybe Great Wall follows this same practice.

There was nonexistent wait staff (since we only had dim sum and didn't order from the normal menu?), and we had to ask one of the cashiers/hosts for water.  I was tempted to just grab a pitcher myself!  I actually did grab my own to go container (I do this all the time at C-Fu).  Some of the cart attendants/servers were very nice, but a little difficult to understand.

Decently priced, but very sketchy location (their shopping center is pretty empty and anchored by a thrift store).  Lots of people (almost all Asian) were around and the immediate parking area was quite full though.  

At least it was almost right down the road from the business Costco, so I was finally able to go there (was tempted to check out Los Altos Ranch Market too, that's for next time though).
