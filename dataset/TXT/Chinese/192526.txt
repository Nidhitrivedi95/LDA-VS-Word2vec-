Z4MvEVylnZPW_vddQc2Ihg I went there for dinner yesterday with my hubby.  Food is ok.  Near to the end of our meal, the waitress came over and ask if I have a voucher (We didn't ask for a bill).  I did and gave it to her.  According to the bill after tax is around $50 something and with my voucher, the balance is about $11.xx.  My hubby gave a $20 bill and as there's not much service, so I'm thinking whether to give 10% or 15% tips.  No matter what I assume we should get the change, but after waiting for over 15 mins (since we're still having dessert)  nothing shows up.  I think that pretty unappropiate not giving your customer the bill and even change, right?  So wanna warn all of u planning to go there, pay by credit card!!
