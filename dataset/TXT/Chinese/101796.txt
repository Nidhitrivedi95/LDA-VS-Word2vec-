kD1u5HwZpWOH2bAU_W0ARQ Hmm all right.  So I was stuck inside having to work on a take home exam and I was craving Chinese food.  

Pros: Very efficient.  I live in a zoo of an apartment complex and I am super impressed that someone arrived at my door lickity split.  REALLY impressed with the service.

Cons: The food. 

I got some won ton soup, crab rangoons and beef and broccoli.  I was really impressed at how many of those noodle things were in the won top soup.  Normally when you get a small you have like one, maybe two of the noodle thingies.  But my little cup was jam packed with them.  Score!  The meat inside of them didn't taste all that great though.  I just took the meat out and ate the noodles.  (My dog enjoyed the meat filling!)  The crab rangoons (a fave of mine) were very meh.  I'm not really sure if the outside or the inside was the problem (or both), but I've definitely had better.  The beef and broccoli was also very uneventful and not super tasty.

So overall, I'm not entirely sure I'll order through them again.  If I do and I order something different and it is yummy I will be sure to write an update and adjust the rating accordingly. 

At the very least, you can't go wrong with the service.  And maybe I just did a bad job in my food choices.  Maybe they're known for something else.  If you order from there and like what you got, make sure you write a review so I can try it next time! :)
