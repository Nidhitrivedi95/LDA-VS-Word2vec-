6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag I go to China Mama every time we go to LV, which is a couple of times a year. It is very authentic and a great value. Most of the time we have great service, once in a while service is a bit slow. If you decide to order the soy milk, get ready to wait, they make it fresh so it takes at least 30 mins! And it is a big bowl, not individual serving. 
Pretty much everything on the menu was good. The deep fried intestines were the best! If you didn't know what it was, you would never guess what it was.

Good food and good prices!
