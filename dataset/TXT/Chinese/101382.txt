kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A My kids' most favorite Chinese noodle soup is the Shan-Xi dao xiao beef noodles.  Very happy to Yelped this place while our visit to Vegas. It's a cute small place not far from the strip, so location is great. Service is fast, that's 2nd plus. Soup is very flavorful and the beef is tender. The only small imperfection is that thin noodles don't have the hand pull noodle texture and the shaved noodles is a little over done, as we prefer the shaved noodles to be more "al dente".  They also have very good home made dumplings. We will go back if we are in town again.
