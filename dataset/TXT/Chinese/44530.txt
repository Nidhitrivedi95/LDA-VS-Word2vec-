BJW6rCMoWcn8fDFhbMVyEQ Meh is what comes to mind. Expensive, very average American-Chinese food is what we got while being surrounded by a crowd straight out of Del Boca Vista (Think Seinfeld)
For starters we ordered 2 very expensive New York egg rolls. The waiter described them as filled with pork, shrimp and veggies. I found no proteins in our egg roll. We also ordered sizzling rice soup. It was fine but no sizzle. 
The mains were fine and generous but nothing really stood out. With a tip and no alcohol ordered we left $96 on the table.
