One of the employees at Superior Pho actually referred us to this place. We had one of their soups with homemade noodles, the scallion pancakes, the braised pork, literally everything is good. You really can't make a bad choice. The employees are extremely friendly and the prices are way lower than you would expect. I now order delivery from here pretty often.
