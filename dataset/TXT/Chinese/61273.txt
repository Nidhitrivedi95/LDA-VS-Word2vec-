DQMaUSbKsRtB5lJD3egqxQ Love this place! The first time I came I ordered three things and I keep ordering them every time because they're so good! The potstickers are flavorful, fresh, and doughy, with a bit of a crispy crust. The Singapore fried rice-stick noodles are amazing. The noodles are flavorful, fresh, and full of shrimp, bbq pork, egg, and peppers, all extremely delicious. The Beef stir-fried rice stick is in a rich, sweet brown sauce. The noodles taste very fresh, and the sauce has an intriguing depth. The food is pretty salty, so be sure to drink a lot of water, but otherwise a hit!
