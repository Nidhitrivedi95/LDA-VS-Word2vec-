xftWto4IdilizsGdE07AQw I loved the food and the people are very nice, I don't understand why people are reviewing this getting angry that the food wasn't caviar on a silver platter and such. It's a nice little restaurant near the neighborhood that you can go to when you're feeling lazy and not wanting to cook at home :)
