B4ZuEVKHnr2blYg-QiGOkw I love Pei Wei and I have been probably one of there best customers. I go pretty much daily since they started . No one seems to mention this here in this sorta forum , but everyone I know verbally complains about the temperature. Many times I had to leave with groups that just refused to eat there unless the weather was nice outside.

Perhaps because they already left and never ate is why not or few complaints on yelp! But its too cold in there!! FREEZING!! So for those who love the place as I do SPEAK UP ! With negative reviews, perhaps we can persuade them to be more successful despite themselves! :-))

 Its not just this location either, Rain tree is just as bad. 

When I say something to the manager at the Rain tree location he actually said he welcomed the complaint and said its his # 1 complaint! 

He wished that more people would complain to corporate ( which I did ..TWICE). No Response as of yet.:(

 BTW at Greyhawk the day before, an employee in a winter jacket stated that everyone complains but he cannot change the temperature as its set by corporate ! So I left!

 Lastly yesterday I ate there at the counter talked with the manager whom responded,  "Yes I do get complaints , I get even more in the summer."..  I set it at 75 degrees. He then  turned around went on about his business!

Sure a 1 star is as harsh as there inept responses that I believe are fully supported by there lame corporate imbeciles:(

But hey , aside from that," I love the place"! :-)) ( REALLY) For most of the other negative responses, I have found that  most things they will gladly comp or fix any negative food experience you have. 

Just don't you dare ask them to make it comfortable while your eating ! :-))
