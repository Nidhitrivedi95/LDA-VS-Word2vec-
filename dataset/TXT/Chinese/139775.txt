qy6RM3qsgXTanVH-TlJaXQ Went here with my sister for dinner! We got the matcha green tea smoothie, and passion fruit tea with boba, both which tasted great. To eat, we got crab rangoons and sesame chicken. Flavor is awesome and cooked well. Also, the service is so nice! Overall, a great place for smoothies and food :)
