UELnOgcu9BBUcHv8cqEq_A What can I say, this is Panda Express.  So, not "great" chinese food, but pretty good for fast food...  I'm obsessed with the orange chicken (who isn't?) and the chow mein.  This particular location is the cleanest Panda I have ever been to... and they have a decent outdoor patio too.  Nice to have in the neighborhood.
