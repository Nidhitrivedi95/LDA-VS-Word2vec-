wShT0KXCW0ZAnNKdJr_1pg I have only been to Panda Express once before and had a bad experience at a different location. I needed something quick for lunch and decided to give it another try. The guy who helped me, Nathaniel, was extremely kind and had great customer service skills. I don't like when I walk into a place and the people are miserable. He greeted me when I first walked in and it was just a great experience overall.
