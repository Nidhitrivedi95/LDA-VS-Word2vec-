_xt4ZyvtgY8Xu_O6SpSB5A Sorry Markham/Scarborough, Chi's Congee is our favourite congee place in the GTA.  Whether you feel like having something light or heavy, veggie or meat, this place will satisfy.  We like getting a congee super bowl (seafood) and sharing various sides like the dumplings, fish skin and turnip.  \

Like others have posted, the staff are very friendly.  They seem to be owner/operators because we see the same crew most of the time.  They welcome you with a smile and unlike some Asian restaurants they are quite warm towards non-Asians too.  That says a lot about the amiable vibe of this place.

We were running late one night and stopped in for a snack before closing.  We fully intended to be out of there before close (11pm), but they did not know that.  The staff still welcomed us in and never rushed us.  We were out the door by 10.50pm, happy and content.  Chi's Congee & Noodle House never disappoints!
