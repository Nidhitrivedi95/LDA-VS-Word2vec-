jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw I never taste so bad Cantonese dim sum until went to the Harbor Palace. I ordered the steamed chicken feet black bean sauce and steamed beef in rice noodle roll. I always go to the Rowland Height where has to much Chinese restaurant to enjoy their dim sum. So, I know what is good or bad. I tasted a little bit steamed chicken feet black bean sauce and steamed beef in rice noodle roll, I fell it is sourer and so bad. (Those two staff don't taste sourer in normally.) I told the manager something wrong with steamed chicken feet black bean sauce and steamed beef in rice noodle roll. She was so rude to say, she not grantee steamed chicken feet black bean sauce is fresh today, but she grantee steamed beef in rice noodle roll is made today. She just cancel the chicken feet for me, and didn't allow me return the rice roll also. She look like so much unhappy, and the waiter and waitress have bad servers, too. And the price for staff are little bit expanse. I never go to here any more.
