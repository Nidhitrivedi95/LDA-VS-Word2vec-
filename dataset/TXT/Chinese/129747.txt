pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I am working next door to The Palazzo at The Wynn Hotel and I eat out here 5 times a week.
I heard Sushi Samba is famous from New York. I dine there so many times and love their food. Shishito peppers is amazing,Tuna slider is a must order dish, California rolls is OK but all the fresh fish is yummy and fresh. The portion are tiny just like how all the fancy restaurants on the strip served their food.

I like to sit at the bar because I believe in one on one service. When dinner time arrived the bar will more likely full. The bartender/waitress 80% of time hardly crack a smile and sometime busy with her text messages and 9 out of 10 time I have to kept asking for the refill my drink or order another beer.

Also be warn about their napkin since it will give you lint all over your dark pants or your skirt.

I wish the service can be better because the food is absolutly tasty for strip sushi.
