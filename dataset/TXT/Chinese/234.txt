Ambiance: I can't speak to the ambiance of the inside but the patio is nice when you want to enjoy those Cleveland summers. However, said outside ambiance can seriously be ruined when you have a table right next to you chain smoking and playing poker (wtf?) with a screaming kid

Food: The cabbage salad we order was quite delicious. The drinks listed as cocktails actually ended up coming in martini glasses which was really odd considering they have a section of drinks specifically listed as "Martinis" and then another section listed as "Cocktails" presumably because those drinks have ice in them. Not a huge deal but just strange. Now this is only the second time I've ever had Pho but boy was it a disappointment! It had this strange sweetness to it which I didn't care for, maybe that's how Pho is supposed to taste?

I might return to try some other menu items considering I loved the salad and disliked the Pho. I really like being able to sit outside on E 4th and enjoy the hustle and bustle of a Cleveland night!
