l9vx-OTdDPU-oHZ17aVxdg The food here is pretty good especially when you consider the prices. The place has great to core and an extensive menu. Probably one of the better bargain places in Markham. The waitstaff struggles with English and can be difficult to order from at times, but again this is forgivable because the prices are fair. 
I would recommend checking it out if you're in the area but there's nothing about this place it's going to blow you away.
