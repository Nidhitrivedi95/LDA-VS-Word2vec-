Iov02yUKZVj-Z3A3u37ExA We were in the area and felt hungry, so stopped in this family-run place. First thing to notice was the kindness of the owner who greeted us. We were seated in an empty restaurant, wherever we wanted to sit, in a spring Saturday afternoon. 

Place looks very average and old school, check the photos on the wall and just look around. it is like going back in time, but that doesn't bother us.

Menu has a lot to choose from, we were struggling, but made a choice of Shanghai noodles and some other noodles. That was a mistake, as the noodles ended up being too oily and it looked and tasted a bit weird. One of us lost her appetite on Shanghai noodles, while the other had to share her reminder with her :)

Food was cheap and portions big, too bad we couldn't finish it all. 

Do not feel like giving another chance, as this place is just average and there are many like that in the Hogtown.
