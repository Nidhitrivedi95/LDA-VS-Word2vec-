EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q This is our go to place for Chinese food. We absolutely love it!  The dinner combos are a lot of food for your money. I haven't tried anything that I did not like. My family loves the orange chicken and the sesame chicken. I like chicken and mushrooms, moo goo gai pan, and chicken and broccoli because of all of the fresh veggies they put in it like zucchini and carrots. This is the kind of Chinese food you eat, and you feel good after eating it. Not like places with all the greasiness. The staff is nice too.
