vVdY2qDO7dkUrU8LXYZ1uA We stopped in here because they advertise that they don't use MSG.  My wife is allergic to preservatives.  The food was plentiful, and OK.  Nothing great, but not terrible either.  However, not long after eating there my wife started getting her normal allergic reaction.  Not sure if they indeed did use MSG or not, but there was certainly some sort of preservative on the food.  We won't be back.
