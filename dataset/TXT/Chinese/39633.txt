awQmoQI2TRAt7VdeRKOR1Q The Vegetarian Green Curry was incredible 

I asked them to a little asian eggplants, snow peas with the Tofu Puffs. 



They were very open to my requests

They even had a couple of lichee in it. 

I wish I had taken a picture ! 

Presentation was excellent. 

We took table D'Hôte ($28 person)

Friday night it had a nice crowd and nice clientele.

My girlfriend is vegetarian but I liked it and would eat this regularly!

Be sure to also order the Thai Salad!
