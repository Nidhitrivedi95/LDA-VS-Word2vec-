X3ixtoD0xjiVtxROlU_2wg My regular therapist retired to a desk job - yes I cried- so, in desperate need of a massage, I made an appt here because of the reviews and it's amazingly close to my home. Booked with Julia based on another review and I am so thankful I did! I asked for back and neck only because of pain and she listened and focused on those areas. I think I circled 8/9 on pressure preference on the intake form and that was perfect - Julia also checked in during the massage to make sure I was happy. She used a combination of massage styles - swedish, a sort of thai style stretching, deep tissue and hot stone plus a face and scalp massage- all rolled into one 60 minute session. Basically I left feeling like well kneaded playdough, and I even accidentally drooled at one point- yeah that happened. At the end she offered me a choice of cold or hot water. The price for this amazing experience was $60 and I got a coupon for $10 off next session and also a punch card - after so many treatments you get discount on another visit. I did not have a foot massage - you can add that to your massage for extra and I am going to try it next time. I will definitely be returning for regular treatments! Thank you Julia and Lilac Massage!
