XUDOc980cjB0PZvVS-T6Eg I'm picky when it comes to Chinese food. This place ROCKS! Fresh, tasty, and large portions. I ordered Moo Goo Gai Pan for lunch with egg roll. White rice was sticky and perfect. Chicken was lean and tender, sauce was delicious. We ordered takeout, so I never went inside. The containers the food was in were solid, easy to eat out of and easy to clean up. Jimmy Wan's is tops!
