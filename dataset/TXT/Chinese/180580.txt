X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg This is the worst club in Vegas!! Dave Wagner is the most unprofessional corporate security manager out there! My friend got accused of something she didn't do and took her out the club. When we talked to him about it, he responded by saying "sometimes we get the right people and sometimes we don't". What kind of response is that?  Seriously, what a coward! He didn't own up to anything.The security guards are all cowards as well.  Please save ur money and go to other better clubs in Vegas!
