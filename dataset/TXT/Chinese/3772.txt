_k3PJI3mSS3eIpV8FZ6Tqg When it comes to skewers, I'm pretty expert on it. I tried some and they were deep fried and masked with seasoning. How unfortunate. I also ordered the pork feet to see how it stacked up to other great Chinese places I been to. It's almost there... but not quite.

The decorations and staff were nice. But the food could have been better. The pork feet was braised pretty well but the sauce lacked the taste and punch I would expect from an "authentic Chinese restaurant." It's something you can't describe but you know it when you experience it. The rice was kinda hard. 

I ate the spicy and sweet chicken with rice too. It was neither spicy nor sweet. But the rice was hard like the rice on my plate. SO at least that's consistent.

If you are looking for some random food to eat and $1 PBR beer, then this may be the place for you. Random as in chicken gizzards, etc. on a stick, and like pork feet. Not too many places serve those items. I just wish they did them well instead of mediocre.

Steak and Shake just opened down the street on Mill. Probably better to walk 5 minutes, get some cheaper and better tasting food.
