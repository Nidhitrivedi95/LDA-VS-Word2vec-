WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg My friends and I have been going to this place for years now and it never gets old.  They recently renovated and while the changes to regulars are subtle, I'm sure new customers will appreciate the decore more.  The big upgrade for me was the washrooms!

While I've seen some negative reviews on the service we've rarely had issues.  This place gets BUSY at lunch with the work crowd and the services can get hurried but a little patience goes a long way.  The staff is personable, friendly, and we always have fun with them.

Though I haven't had a lot on the menu, I have to recommend the chili chicken.  Hands down an amazing dish.  The hot & sour soup is AMAZING as well.  

If you're expecting high quality you won't get it here.  But the price is definitely right for what you get, which is a greasy but delicious Chinese food experience!
