BCga5CbMqcZLCpxAuln57w To start, this is by far the cleanist and most updated Chinese restaurant I've ever dined at.  Got the szechuan chicken lunch combo that came with fried rice and an egg roll.  Rice was good, egg roll was good, but the chicken had entirely to much sauce on it that gave it the consistency of a stew.  Server was great, food came out pretty quick, just wished I liked it more.
