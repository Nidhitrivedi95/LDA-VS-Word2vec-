dqeUvrlMxTAk0VL2n1ukaw This cafe has excellent food. We took 12 people. Everyone had tons of fantastic food with plenty to take home. It was only $92! Every dish was delicious and piled high. The waitress was always very helpful and bent over backwards to make our time there comfortable. We definitely recommend this place!
