5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ Ordered lettuce wrap and salt and pepper calamari for appetizer, taste was ok, nothing special. For entree, ordered seafood chow fun, it looked good but sadly did not taste good. Actually, no taste at all. I had to put a lot of chili oil to make it eatable. Food was not worth the price.
