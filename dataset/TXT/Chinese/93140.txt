iyPtSR0s6EkvaQFbdJ_jVA Came here for lunch with my co-workers today.  After reading all the bad reviews, I was a bit concern especially since I was introducing dim sum to one of my co-worker who has never had dim sum before.  The hostess was very friendly and asked if we liked to sit inside or by the patio.  It seem a little dim and not too appealing inside so we picked the table by the window.

I was really surprised that the dim sum was really good given that all the reviews that I read was so poorly rated.  The portions were good and we ordered 8 dim sum dishes for the 3 of us and we were really full.  The portions were big which I was not expecting.  All the dishes were really tasty especially the stuffed eggplant and calamari.

I agree with most Yelp reviewers that the dim sum prices are really pricey but given that it is in the theatre district, it's expected to be higher.  Our total bill wasn't too expensive since I had a $30 value groupon that only costed $12.  Even without the groupon, we would still come back.
