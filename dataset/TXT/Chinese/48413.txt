C5bmtDRAtl5iMGmBCF5prw Not to good of a looking restaurant on the outside, or the inside either, but the place is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is ALWAYS hot and fresh.  They do use msg, but that's okay, we only eat here once or twice a month.  The selection is "small" compared to some of the new, bigger places, but the food taste awesome. Check em' out!
