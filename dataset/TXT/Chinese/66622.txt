EhlOUjd2dh52SV_XfoORSA Do not come here with kids. No changing tables in the bathroom. Food is decent but over priced. They put a pot of hot tea down on the table right in front of my 9 mos old after we had very obviously cleared that end of the table away. Our server did not even ask if we wanted drinks. No chop sticks or soy sauce unless you ask for it. Interior is dark and dated. Watched the owner play video games on his tablet while two servers were responsible for the whole restaurant. Don't waste your time unless you just want to sit at the bar and drink.
