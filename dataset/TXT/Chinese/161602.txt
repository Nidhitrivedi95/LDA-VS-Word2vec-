uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw GROSS FATTY MEAT. DUNK IN A BOWL OF MSG AND NOODLES THAT NEVER BREAK APART. 

The meat was such a turn off. Whatever cheap eats but still. The noodles were the only thing tolerable. I just feel like they should improve the quality of their meat and maybe raise the price a little? Overall it was okay. The broth was whatever.

My boyfriend and I came around 6pm. The place was slammed. We called and they said there was no wait for 2. Yeah okay, Lairs. Then we were told the wait was for 10mins. We waited for 30mins. 

Once we for seated, we were rushed to order. Can u flipping believe it?! So much for dining experience.
