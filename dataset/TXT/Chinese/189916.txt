ygJshif4VuxL1ijnRJnuYA All hype unfortunately. 

We ordered three dishes to share that night

1. birds nest with mango and chicken
2. shanghai noodles
3. fried rice with chicken

it's a very popular restaurant, expected a lot from the hype and the zagat ratings. 

unfortunately, sloppy cut prep on the meat and vegetables, taste is okay yes it's not manchu wok food court but it's not like something one would get at Ding Tai Fung in Markham either. 

Fried rice was cooked right, light and fluffy, birds nest taro tasted great. 

Interior nothing to write home about either.. I think it's playing on it's popularity .. cost is too high imho for the quality.
