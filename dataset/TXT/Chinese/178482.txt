x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg Came here for vacation about half a year ago (going through a backlog of restaurant reviews right now). The xiao long bao was great; my Shanghainese grandparents approved of them. The cold meats sampler was lackluster. We got some kind of vegetable and I think another seafood item as well, both of which were pretty good but nothing special. Still a solid choice, though.
