mRubgo8WfjraJkE5Bvbf6w I came in about 15mins before closing. I hate doing that, but I was hungry and I can eat fast (hey, I was in the military!)

The food was pretty good. I was a little scared that it would take them a while since it was close to closing but they got it out in a jiffy and it was well made. I even liked the veggies, which is good considering that I am picky with my veggies.
