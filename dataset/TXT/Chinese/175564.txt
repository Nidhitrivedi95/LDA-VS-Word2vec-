wJnhUJCOYkncLPZAwaMffA We were only in Charlotte for 2 days but this place was by far the best out of all the places we tried. It's like a hidden gem because it's in an odd corner of a building. But don't give up looking for this place if you are looking because it's worth the stop. 

We ordered the Philadelphia roll, which comes with smoked salmon. We don't really care for smoked salmon so we asked if they can make it with fresh salmon and they did. It was very fresh and great portion. I only wish I could have ordered more. We also ordered the spicy tuna, it had just the right hint of spice and the tuna was very fresh. 

We also ordered the chicken pad thai - this dish was good but it had a bit too much sauce. I would have preferred it to be less soupy and a little more thick on the sauce side. The house fried rice was absolutely delicious. My mouth watered with every single bite, it was fresh and it wasn't overly greasy like in other places. This place is a must try. If I ever go back to Charlotte, I will definitely be back.
