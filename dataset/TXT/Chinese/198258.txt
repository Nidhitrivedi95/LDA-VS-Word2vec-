zXJilaBN28oUdX7Owf0fRA I've eaten in the restaurant as well as had it delivered.  My experiences both times were good.  Nothing to complain about.  

When I ate in the restaurant, I had a lunch bento box and everything in it was cooked well.  My 2 y/o daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal together.  She really enjoyed the tempura and edamame.

I recently had some sushi and some Chinese delivered to my house.  The sushi was great and did not disappoint.  My daughter enjoyed her chicken with broccoli, as well.

Now that I know they deliver, I may be frequenting this place more often.  They are fairly priced for both Chinese and Japanese dishes.  The food is nothing spectacular, but definitely satisfies those cravings!
