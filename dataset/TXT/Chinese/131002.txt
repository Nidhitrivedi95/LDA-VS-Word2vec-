pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA We were starving, and thank goodness this place was opened late in the area we stayed at. 
Service was slow, not attentive. They did not seem very busy at the moment either. 

We wanted only a quick bite, so we got an appetizer and an entree to share. Food is super pricey, quality of the food was alright, but at least it came out quick. Sashimi was fresh, the gyoza's the server recommended was good. We also got the Moqueca which comes with mussels, clams, squid, and shrimp and rice. It was like a soup based dish, and it was pretty good. Somewhat filling, but the green soy rice is too much.. My boyfriend didn't even like the rice at all. 

All and all, I'd dine here again, maybe... But it would be an last option. It wasn't all that. Honestly, I was expecting too much.
