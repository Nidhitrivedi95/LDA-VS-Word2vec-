Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Small place off of Durango but very quaint.  Fast and friendly service. If your used to thai food in other joints I recommend ordering 2-3 spice level lower. I have eaten thai food in many different states and this is up there with the best. Penang curry sauce was amazing, the drunken noodles and the mango tiger shrimp salad were also very good dishes. Price was fair bur portions were smaller than most in Vegas, which I like as I  not a big eater, but if you have a big appetite order an appetizer, salad and entree. Will definitely eat here again in the near future.
