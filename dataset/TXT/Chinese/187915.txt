Best broth, best ingredients, standard price, and did I mention best broth??

Anyway this places other food is decent, spring rolls are the only thing that Id say are subpar, but really, its all about the PHO PHO PHO. 

Im from SF, lived in LA and now Vegas, and this place is it. Everyone has heard of it. Its like an Asian mecca, every girl I meet goes here and late night its a stripper haven. One time I was waiting on Pho to go and a girl dropped a dub in front of me. My girl was sitting on my lap and she saw it first. Shes from Vegas so instead of doing something kind, she tapped me and let me be the moral judge (sorry XTI but we all know u aint readin this...) anyway, I grabbed it  and tapped the girl. She turned around and it was a stripper from my work in SF. (I actually got fired because of her and her amazing butt) We laughed embarassingly and said hi. After exchanging pleasantries I mentioned my life and nodded at the guamanian in my lap and the convo halted (still kicking myself for thatttt) Point is, this place holds it down and word spreads. Good, late, cheap., clean granite tables, huge fishtanks...great place to have a mellow meal. Just wash your hands after that Jalepeno.
