_xt4ZyvtgY8Xu_O6SpSB5A I went to this restaurant around 9:10 PM on Thursday. Upon entering, we were offered two seats; to either sit facing the entrance (which was too cold) or beside the entrance. We asked to sit near the cash, in which case the waiter thought about it for a bit, but let us. The menus and tea were given to us after we sat down. 

We ordered a seafood congee and the beef stomach. The food came quite fast. I really enjoyed the seafood congee because of the many ingredients in it including scallops, shrimp, fish, squid, and crab sticks. The beef stomach came on a bed of lettuce. I have to say, they stewed the stomach quite well, however I found it to be a bit too salty. 

Overall, the food and service here was good. It was my second time here and I am pleased with the friendly staff and service.
