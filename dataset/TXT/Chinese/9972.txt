1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Went there for the grand opening special. Free meal with purchase of a $1 drink. I thought it was going to be a little sampler it something but it ended up pretty good. Ordered the special fried chicken with rice 5a. The chicken was crispy and juicy, not greasy. Loved the dipping sauce that came with it. They have choice of rice or noodles for each meal. The noodles came with soup in a big bowl. They just opened so everything is clean. Service was pretty fast considering there was a bunch of meal there. I placed my order went to wash my hand in the restroom, got back all our plates were there. they did have a long line out side but its because there wasn't a waiting area inside wait, just put ur name on the list and waited 15 mins checked the other stores around so it was quick. I think today is the last day for their special so ill probably go there and try something else. Meals regular are about $4.95.
