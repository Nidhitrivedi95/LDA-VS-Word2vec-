X2zVoSi1X-Hgz_95hzvF8w Ordered lunch based on posted sign (big one up on the wall). Guy took my card and charged me a lot more. I  complained. He pulled out a menu, showed me small print and said sign was old. So, I refused to complete transaction. He said, "okay." I never signed credit slip and left without food. They charged my credit card the overcharge amount. DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR CREDIT CARD!
