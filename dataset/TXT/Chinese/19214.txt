5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g I ordered #5, the sliced beef noodle soup, and was not disappointed! The beef was tender, there were tons of noodles, and the broth was great. Ambiance was underwhelming - almost nonexistent decorations, bright lights, and a loud fridge right next to the table, but the food made a good enough impression to make up for it!
