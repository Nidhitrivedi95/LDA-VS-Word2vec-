I got take out so I can't really comment on the service but everyone seemed friendly. 

I had the sweet and sour bites which were almost like small sweet and sour chicken balls.  It was so delicious. I walked back to where I was staying in the rain and I was deeply satisfied with my food when I got home. 

The whole Toronto area does a good job with keeping vegetarian options open. 

I'd really like to come back again to try some more dishes here and I'd love to try the tea ceremony that this place holds (from what I understood on the posters they have it on certain fridays)
