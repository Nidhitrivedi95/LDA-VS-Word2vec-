2. No window in the entire dining area.

3. The waiter basically gave us the menu and asked us to write down the orders for him. (Hello? Are you serious about asking customers to do the job for you? It was 4pm in the afternoon so it was not busy at all. )

4. The chicken they served is very old and dry, not fresh at all. Yuck!

5. We ordered 3 dishes plus 1 small cold plate, costed us $110.

Enough said?

Definitely will not return!
