4oVN8DPTpUF4TySkpOU19Q Two of us went here for our hot pot fix after nearby Liu Liu was full. We noticed several other patrons eating hot pot, so we thought we would give it a try. On the plus side, it's all you can eat, and they bring you a ton of food right off the bat. I can imagine language barrier could be a difficulty if you don't speak Chinese; luckily my rudimentary abilities let us communicate which ingredients we wanted, sparing us from having to eat our way through a plate of spam or offal out of guilt. The broths were serviceable, but lacking in flavour. Also there is only one type of dipping sauce, a sesame paste that must have some other ingredients added to it because it didn't taste like normal sesame paste that you get at a place like Little Sheep hot pot (the gold standard of hot pot as far as I'm concerned). Overall, this place satisfied our craving for hot pot, but we much prefer Little Sheep--too bad there isn't one downtown--and even making it yourself at home is better.
