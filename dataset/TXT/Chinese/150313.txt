STzLrBgOr_-Y_cVs3t7jFw Big Mouth Kee been here for ages but it is no longer the same place I remember it to be.  The decor is the same but that is about it.  The food is not the same as before and the place is super dirty now.  The unique decoration of the place is still cool making it look like we eating on the street. Sitting is uncomfortable but that is the style they are going for.  I still love the sizzling plate chow mein with chicken and the steamed oyster with black bean.  They have lots of seafood but it is hard to order cause they have a lot of specials written in Chinese all around the place.  The place is good if you want to eat after parties and club as it opens till 5am.  Big Mouth Kee is a shell of itself these days but it does bring back the fond memories.
