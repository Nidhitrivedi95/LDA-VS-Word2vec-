I2ymNzdo4nZG30U1TAmSew There isn't too much going on for this place. 

One and only Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood, so I had couple takeout. 
Their lunch special is cheap. I mean cheap! Starting at 3.99 and it shows Very small portion, barely fitting half of the container they put it in. Taste isn't that great either, I would prefer food court Chinese food over this place any day.
