hlDcfzRGfmSmL5LpYcRqKA I ordered my food an hour and 17 minutes ago.  I'm so hungry, why won't you bring me my food?

I get it, you're probably busy, then don't take my order.  I'll come pick it up, I promise.

edit: Called them once at an hour and once at an hour 20, each time they said he just left 5 minutes ago. Totally ridiculous, I will never order from them again. The teriyaki chicken skewers were really good though, so I'll give them 2 stars, but barely.
