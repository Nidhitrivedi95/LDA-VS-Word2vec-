KYxiIkANSVjLhdO939GK6A Tried this restaurant out on a recommendation of a neighbor. Had the General Tso's Shrimp which was good but would probably be a lot better if you ate it in there dining room. If we order that again to go we will definitely get the sauce on the side to prevent the shrimp from being soggy. Wings were just OK and IMO the fried rice was kinda dry. The food was just OK,  nothing to write home or brag about. May try them again on a late rainy Friday night.
