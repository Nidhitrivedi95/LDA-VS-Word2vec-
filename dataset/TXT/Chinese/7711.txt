0VjHFdczi6Nln_nn8bucJQ I struggled to find a Vietnamese joint to get my fill. This is hands down the best Vietnamese food I've had in Vegas. The food is so simplistic, yet so full of flavor. Staff is super friendly and incredibly helpful in understanding the dishes and their ingredients... and they are very flexible in making accommodations and substitutions for certain ingredients (I'm talking to all you vegetarian/vegan peeps out there). On the outside, this place may not look like it has a lot to offer, but it is a well hidden gem for a reason. Try them out, you won't regret it!

Also, get the Thai ice tea. It will quench your thirst with this infernal heat going on.
