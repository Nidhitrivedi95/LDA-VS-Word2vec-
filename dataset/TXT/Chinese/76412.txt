G7Ull-QUaNXyPwtEErHZ8g Man, what can I say about Mr. Hunan's? The food is sub par but the entertainment is great. The decorations insinuate that it's Christmas year round, and boy, does it feel like it! The yellow walls make me uneasy. Those girls really know how to dance too. They get down on the half stage next to where you order. If you tip well enough you get the tip, you know? Ask about the items that are off the menu, it's where all their best "dishes" are. Remember it either comes with a soda or an "egg roll". Go for the second one, you'll get farther. The abundance of plastic forks also makes me uneasy. I once saw someones head stick down out of the loose ceiling panel in the right corner of building while looking at a fire sprinkler, that really made me uneasy. Anyways I really like this place sometimes. The employees want to give everyone jello shots to get us all way more hyped but they can't at this 5 star establishment. Yeah. It's really good for kids, they don't like them. Be sure to make reservations on the weekends. On monday they have poker.
