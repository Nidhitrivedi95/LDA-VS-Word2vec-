zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I had high expectations going in considering this restaurant's popularity and reputation, but overall I was disappointed. I had their summerlicious menu which was a good deal ($25). The chicken wing and pork bun were delicious, but the main course wasn't memorable at all. I had the clam noodle, and the broth did not have a great flavour. The clams were cooked fine but not seasoned much with anything but salt and the noodles were very bland. My boyfriend got the pork belly ramen, and that broth was much more flavourful, but he said he knew places where you could get much better ramen in Toronto. The cereal and milk soft serve was actually the highlight of the meal - creamy and delicious, very reminiscent of Rice Krispies with milk. The waiter was nice enough but nowhere to be found when we wanted to pay our bill. Took us a long time to get anyone's attention at that point, which was a bit frustrating. 

Meh, don't think it was worth that large crowd, think I'll head to Spadina next time!
