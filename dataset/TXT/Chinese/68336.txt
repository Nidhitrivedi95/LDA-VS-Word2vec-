eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ My husband and I were craving Thai food. Unfortunately, we don't have many choices in the North East side of town. We are regulars @ Archis Thai Bistro but since we did not want to drive way across town we decided to give this place a try.

I called and placed an order for take-out... we each ordered Shrimp Pad-Thai, an order of Egg Rolls, Crab Ragoons and Thai Tea. 

I rate the Shrimp Pad-Thai a 3/5 it was pretty bland- my husband enjoyed it but he is not as picky as I am
Egg Rolls 2/5 I can get better ones at Costco 
Crab Ragoons 3/5 
Thai tea 5/5!!!
