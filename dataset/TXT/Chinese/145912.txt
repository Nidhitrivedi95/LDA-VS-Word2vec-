Came here for lunch today, and it's official-  this is a Scott P. spot. I crave this shit, even just a few hours after eating it. Granted, this was only my second time here, and that's a big soon for a five-star rating, but I'll be duckfucked if this place doesn't make me smile in a big way.

For starters... they serve BOILED PEANUTS and daikon radish as soon as you sit down. Did you hear me?? I said:  THEY SERVE BOILED PEANUTS!! When's the last time you had some boiled peanuts!??! Have you EVER had boiled peanuts?? I know it's a Southern thing, but it's just one of those unexpected treats in life where you're like:

"HOLY SHITSTEAM! This place serves one of my favourite foods without me even asking for me!!"

Yeah.

So anyways- their noodles = I crave. Especially the 'hand-shaved' noodles (style E). THey just absorb whatever sauce they're in, and their texture is just MM MM MMM goodness.

Yeah. I'll shut up now, but I really have to say that you need to at least try this place. You owe it to yourself to try this place. And bring your mom.
