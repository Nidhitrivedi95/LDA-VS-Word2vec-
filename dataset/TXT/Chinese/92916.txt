iuIkzvQRb4DVWOMhE4GI3g Last weekend, Kay and I were returning a piece of furniture to IKEA and needed grub, so we headed to Ya Fei, an Asian restaurant that fights to the last against Robinson's many chains and stands tall. 

Now, we both found Ya fei's steamed dumplings to be a touch underwhelming despite their heft. Each dumpling was about as big as a toddler's fist but were filled with a dry pork that resembled bad chorizo sausage in flavor and mouthfeel. Methinks they forgot to add the eggs. 

Everything was aces when it came to the entrees, however. Large portions, ones that were easily fit for two, graced our plate. Enter: Pineapple Shrimp and Pineapple Duck. 

In both cases, weighty fresh chunks of juicy, tropical temptation along with bell peppers, carrot, onions, broccoli, and snap peas surrounded either plump, popping shrimp or crisp, lardy, candied duck. Fluffy, generous helpings of white rice served as beds for each dish, but when we ran out of rice, we had no problem devouring the remaining vegetables, fruits, and proteins. 

With so much on our plates, we bypassed desserts and took what remained of our meals home. 

Ya Fei is not everyday Asian cuisine; it is truly gourmet, done graciously, brightly.  

And it is in a suburban strip mall. Go figure.
