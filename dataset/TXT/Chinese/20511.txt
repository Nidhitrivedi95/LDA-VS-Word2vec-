5zk3LxFzijmY2JipVZ7Xdg I've had lunch and dinner at this family owned restaurant and I'm always leaving happy and full.  And it's clean inside, too.
The servers are always friendly and have wanted to give recommendations about other dishes to try.  Last night, she told me that fried foods were not actually fattening, so I took that as a cue to devour both my egg roll and deep fried shrimp!
It's always made to order so everything comes out hot and fresh.  Aside from the deep fried appetizers, I think this place can actually be a healthy place to eat, too.
The dinner entrees with chicken were about $7, beef $8, seafood $9.  Lunch specials were around $5.
