Fb7QbeQVasGej9GPIL2koA Ok Seriously, if I can give this place negative stars, I would.  We paid $50 for two dishes and they were absolutely horrible.  Mind you, it maybe because we are vegis and they didn't have much vegi options.  However, both dishes tasted exactly the same and it was just like they added steamed veggies on top of the rice & noodles and tasted yuckie. The guy came and asked us how everything was and we did say, horrible.  We barely touched any of our food and decided to get real dinner after we left this place.  I would never go there again because in all honesty, for the prices they charge, when a customer tells you that the food wasn't good, at least attempt to find out if you can fix the situation.  However, it appeared that they were only interested collecting the money, not really making sure they served food that was pallatable for their customers.

So, I would recommend to stay away if you want decent tasting food and good service.  Another thing.... this place really doesn't have "true" asian foods.. maybe has something to do with not having too many people there who know what real Asian food tastes like.  Thanks.
