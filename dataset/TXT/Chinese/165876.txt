v9RUMrIlWzjs08qQITnS9Q I was really surprised at this place. Got a little scared when I found it empty but was pleasantly surprised. I can't speak for the sushi. Personally I never eat sushi during the warm months especially in AZ. But my daughter had the orange chicken which I usually hate because it's usually mushy from most places. This was crispy and great. I had the Mongolian chicken that was a bit spicy but not too spicy. I can't believe Pei Wei get's so much business cause it stinks. We will definitely come here again.
