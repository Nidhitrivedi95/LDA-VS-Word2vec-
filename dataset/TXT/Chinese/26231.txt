7rh29SPJMkyeI2BJcjqzLQ Solid 4 stars here.  This place is within walking distance of me so I usually place an order over the phone and walk over to pick it up.  They aren't super busy all the time, but the staff are super friendly and I have not had a bad dish/order here at all.  There's a large dining room that is neat and orderly and the food often comes out super quick.

Being off of South Blvd, they have a small parking lot to the side and back - but you can't ask for a better location.

There menu is pretty extensive. The usual favorites you will find at other Chinese places but they also have some "chef specials".

Solid take out experience here too. They will include the utensils and napkins if you forget to pick some up on the way out.  Very efficient brown paper bag packaging and clear order receipt stapled on the top of the bag to eliminate any confusion.
