ropJyZdmv6NeDU2Vz1I_Hg Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.

Ordered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. 

The combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. 

The sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.

Garlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. 

We then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the "customers" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....

It's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.
