BzZNKx6Des02RuAtT-uOPw I'm going to give it four stars for the ambiance rather than the food.  Fate is a cute restaurant in a small house.  The inside is modern, with an invisible DJ on the second floor.  The woman who waited on us was great.  She gave us a few tips on the food and the wines to try, and allowed us to "taste" a wine, which turned out to be half a glass.  (gotta love that).. that being said, most of the food was great.  We loved the spinach buns, fried tofu, the garlic noodle special.  The only thing that I didn't like was the curry... tasted like curry paste, no spices...  I would go back for sure.
