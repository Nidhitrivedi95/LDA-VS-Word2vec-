lSxAQR1FeSljX9zeVJTEWA This is a great restaurant. The staff is so welcoming and friendly. The hot tea is yummy and they are very generous with the rice, which pleases me. This is one of the few Chinese restaurants where the General Tso's chicken is labeled spicy and actually tastes spicy. It's good! I've also tried the curry chicken, which very much lives up to its name. I love that their dishes have plenty of sauce and the portions are quite large. I love coming to this restaurant. On another note, they have an adorable sink in their women's restroom.

eta: Eat the duck sauce. It's delicious.
