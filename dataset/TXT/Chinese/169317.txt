vsoEZauF4lrADIqCYXySFQ Their shrimp lo-mein is the only "alright" dish. I tried the shrimp with broccoli once and it was garbage. A guy told me this was the best place ever. We aren't friends anymore.

2 stars because both Lai Lai Wok and Cravings are better than this place in my opinion. And they are right the corner from chopstix.
