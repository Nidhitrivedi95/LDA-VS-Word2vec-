VNBJZ36URHCwwF2UqM7xWw Easily the best Chinese food in Charlotte.  Probably would only get 4 stars in larger cities where there are more options but you gotta take what you have in front of you.  I prefer the normal dinner menu over their dim sum and hot pot.  The prices are good and the food tastes good.

Good and consistent dishes:
Ma po tofu
Hong Kong style pork chops
any of the chinese veggies stir fried with garlic
