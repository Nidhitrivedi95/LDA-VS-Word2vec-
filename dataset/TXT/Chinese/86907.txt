HQpMwOOrGND3GaRqMNV9ig The menu was simple and a few items to choose.The place was not so hard to find and quite relaxing atmosphere to have lunch. The wonton noodle soup was the best one I have so far. It was huge with lots of shrimps in it. The food arrives within a minute of ordering. The price was also cheap.Bring cash with you.
