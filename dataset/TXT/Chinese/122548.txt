OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I was super grumpy and starving the morning (really early afternoon) we went here. I was prepared to hate it. I didn't.

Service was fast.. they had me gnawing on duck bones and slurping up dumplings with in 3 min of walking in the door! 

They have some of the best egg tarts I have eaten in this hemisphere. 

This is a pretty traditional Chinese place, not much English is spoken, the good thing is for Dim Sum Brunch, they bring around a cart, and you point to what you want to eat and chances are it will be good. 

Dim Sum is good. Chang's is good. Eat here.
