GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Food: 5 stars. I got the "Like Water for Chocolate" roasted quail and rose petals based off of one of my favorite books (Como Agua Para Chocolate). The guacamole was superb, and I am probably the pickiest avocado-eater on the planet. It was prepared mild (because some people couldn't handle the heat), and the chopped jalapenos and fire sauce were put on the side for me to mix in my own portion. Best guac ever. The tortillas were handmade, thick, and everything you'd want in a tortilla. I put spoonfuls of guacamole and the Queso Fundido with chorizo (which was also excellent) and made little tortilla wraps. YUM!

Service: 5 stars. Our waitress was adorable, friendly, and very helpful. We took her advice on everything we ordered. She explained every new dish, its components, and the best way to eat it. 

Tea: 5 stars. Call me corny, but I like to try new things. We ordered Jasmine tea and wanted it mild, so we were given a heavy, metal, Asian-style teapot and a sand hourglass with three different times. We were to steep the tea for as long as the respective timer said. Three minutes for mild, four minutes for medium, and five minutes for strong tea.

Dessert: 5 stars. We shared a serving of flan which came with candied pineapple and a Magnolia flower. I ate the flower, it was an edible adventure. The flan was like creme brulee without the hard brown sugar top. I have yet to find a flan that compares.

Decor: 5 stars. Asian flowers, Lucha Libre masks, dragons on the walls, it all makes sense. Fusion, in every sense of the word.

Overall: This is probably my new favorite restaurant. Everything I love about Asian cuisine, mixed with the familiarity, comfort and spice of gourmet Mexican. Orale.
