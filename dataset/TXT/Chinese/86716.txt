hPTx2Y5e4Czbr21XcbDN8g I can boldly state that this place has the best Taiwanese Beef Noodles in the GTA (that I've tried). Don't let the odorous stinky tofu discourage you from entering their doors! 

They have many options to choose from: Dried noodles, noodles in soup or beef, beef tendon or just plain beef broth. Their noodles are very nice and chewy - great for people like me who likes texture. The beef is tender, and never rough or stuck between my teeth! Hooray for that. The noodles are usually topped with pieces of bok choy, and a smidgen of pickled diced veggies. 

Their stinky tofu is honestly just fried tofu with the stink. I find the sauce that accompanies it to be too salty, but I love the pickled cabbage it comes with. I would also skip the cold appetizers like: tofu w/ thousand year old egg or the pig ears. 

They don't do this anymore, but I used to add dumplings to my beef noodle soup. They are the best dumplings ever. Seriously. The skin is thick but just as chewy as the noodles, and the insides are filled with juice - Almost like a XLB (xiu long bao). You can purchase frozen dumplings to make at home too! 

There's usually a line during dinner time, even on weeknights. The wait will be worth it!
