N7wlv3nrhDPuDDY8yX6QvQ Pretty decent HK style cafe in the area. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly. They offer free delivery service if you order more than $30 before tax. We ordered a couple of things for dinner and they all came in very good portion. The pork chop was well cut, not just fat that you'll find in most places. They also give out free dessert. Will come back again.
