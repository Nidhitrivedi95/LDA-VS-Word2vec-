nTc-Qj_-ABZrpM9YSpJ6jA Pretty much what you'd expect from a fast food Filipino restaurant.  I actually only go here for the halo halo.  It's not the greatest but for 5$ I think it's pretty decent.  
I only go in here when we decide to shop at seafood city (mainly when I want to try and make those Filipino dishes lol)
