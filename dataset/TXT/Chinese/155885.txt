tnvZOd2vNCLPQS1KEZxqog Dim Sum Cafe is a new establishment in a retail strip. The inside is seemingly budgetary, with plain tables and chairs, and just a few items of decor placed haphazardly. The menu was a piece of paper in a binder sleeve protector. So, contemporarily designed, it is not, but...dim sum...at night!
The staff was friendly, and quickly brought beverages and answered any questions we had. We ordered shumai, spare ribs, dumplings and the server's recommendation of soup dumplings. The items were great, especially the soup dumplings. Those were sweet yet savory, squishy and full of beautiful, tasty broth. I could eat them every day.
I should note that there are other entrees beside dim sum items. So for those who like traditional American Chinese, there is something here for you as well.
The bill for two with just soda/tea was under 20 bucks, and well worth it.
We will eat here again.
