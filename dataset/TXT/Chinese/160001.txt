U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Given that it's located in Caesars Palace, I didn't expect this place to be cheap, even if it is Chinese food. However, I thought that the pricing was way off of what it should have been. Don't get me wrong; the food is good. We had the braised beef brisket hand pulled noodle soup, xiao long bao, and Beijing beef pancake wrap. All three were good, just not great. And for what it was, it simply wasn't worth the money.

Some problems I had with the place: the hostesses were unfriendly, the service was a little slow, and they didn't have a bunch of the desserts listed on their menu.
