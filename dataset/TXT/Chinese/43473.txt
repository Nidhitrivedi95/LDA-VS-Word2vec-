bfF90MspMbqLWdcEU9JLcg I've been here several times, as I work right down the street, and usually it is ok.  But today was absolutely terrible.  I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, white rice and a veggie egg roll.  My co-worker ordered sushi, and lettuce wraps -- her food was very good! Mine on the other hand was absolutely terrible - I asked the waitress if she maybe mixed up my order with the next table because she brought out our orders together.  What I had tasted was NOT chicken, I was thinking maybe it was the sweet and sour pork - but it had a "fishy" taste - I told her it was not eatable - That the "chicken" I was eating was dark and chewy and really hard to eat - I tried a couple pieces and had to spit them out into my napkin.  

She turned to me and confirmed that it was in fact chicken, and that she was sorry - then she dropped off our check and never came back.  I left the restaurant only eating the steamed rice on my plate and the veggie roll (which was good).

I'm so disappointed in the food this trip, but what compelled me to write the review was the poor treatment and terrible customer service.  No wonder why the place is always empty!
