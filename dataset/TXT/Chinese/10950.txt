What's nice about this place is that it has something for everyone. It has the classic, Americanized Chinese/Korean/Thai food that a lot of people enjoy. There are also more authentic dishes for people who like that kind of food.

It's not too expensive and it's definitely a better option than anything else in the nearby area!
