CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw This is just the meal we needed after a long day at the Foxtail pool. We shared three dishes. One dish was a made to order fried rice (Hakka Fried Rice Pot) made tableside. Not as much flavor as I expected but still it hit the spot. Our favorite dish with something called ants climbing a tree which had minced chicken with a clear vermicelli a noodles. Very flavorful. I would definitely go back. Great for lunch or late night snack. Casual and not too expensive.
