9WAnQD1nj1j3zLZ7ONtvfQ Great little sushi bar inside the plams.  Only open for dinner but dont let that deter you, they had some really solid rolls, including several inspired specialty rolls.

A couple friends also ate chinese off the dinner menu, the ornage chicken and mongolian beef, both looked great for anyone who cant get down with the raw fish.

bottom line: If you like sushi, you'll love this place.
