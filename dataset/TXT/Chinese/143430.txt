rntKF4Dm9JIJoSNi5XqRsQ First time here at this shanghai food restaurant. Green onion pancakes were very good.
Boiled Dumplings and fried dumplings were a bit bland. 

First 3 dishes came very fast. However waited another 20 minutes for Shanghai noodles. 

Comparable to ding tai fung and asian legend.
