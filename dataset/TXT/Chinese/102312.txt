khwoDxH5p-D9pLjCvV_Y6A I only order fried rice here, because I'm not a fan of shopping center Chinese restaurants, and know that most of the dishes are  batter fried lumps of meat in a salty, sweet, sour sauce with maybe a few vegetables-- which ain't my idea of Chinese food.  I get fried rice and ask for extra helping of fresh veggies mixed in, for which I offer $2 more, and always get a good count.  It's always OK, but for some reason, sometimes it's really amazingly good.  Nearly every time I go in there's a different cook, so that may be the reason.  The people are very nice, and food is fast, cheap, and plentiful.  Their veggie soup is top drawer too.  Don't know about General Tso's chicken-- and don't care.
