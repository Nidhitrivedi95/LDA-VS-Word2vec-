yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA RE-TRAIN YOUR STAFF TO SERVE GOOD QUALITY SERVICE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS! I'm a shift manager at a restaurant and I dont even treat My customers the way your cashier (it was a Guy) treated me and My friends. To you MR! Leave your nasty ass attitude where you came from! Stop being a grouch! 



I do not recommend this place .. there's a lot more places to eat than here.
