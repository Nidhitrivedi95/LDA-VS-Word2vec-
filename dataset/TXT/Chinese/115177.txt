n_rEQNgsCOLNfMzGqFhn1g We purchased a Groupon to try our lunch at this place on a saturday afternoon. It was dead in there! No wonder they are on groupon! It doesn't seem like they even care if they get any business or not, as every single employee we encountered was cold and acted like they didn't want to be there. Very unfriendly. My husband and I both worked in the restaurant business during college and know about good customer service. For the food: My husband had some sort of beef dish with peppers and onions and I had the chicken and broccoli. Both dishes were very hot which was the only redeeming quality, but were incredibly generic. Nothing stood out about them whatsoever. The spring roll served with the meal was probably the worst Ive had so far. Very bready and not fresh tasting like you would expect a spring roll to be. Wont be back. Theres too many other places with great food and good customer service!
