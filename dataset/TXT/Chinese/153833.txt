TBOKIAMxv0OHKJbarNvSeg I have been going to Green Tea for a decade at least.  I believe it is the best Chinese Food I have ever had.  It is a restaurant seating a fair number but I always pick-up via take-out.
They use quality food and it does not taste overly greasy.
The egg rolls, spring rolls, Chilli Chicken, Beef in Black Bean sauce, chicken balls and noodles are my typical take-out order.  The chilli chicken is nice and spicy and my favourite dish.  The chicken balls are full of meat and not greasy like most Chinese restaurants.
Lastly, the owner is tremendously friendly and outgoing.
Love it.
