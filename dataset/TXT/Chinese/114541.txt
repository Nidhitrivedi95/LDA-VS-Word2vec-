mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w Currently my go-to spot when I am craving dim sum. The food is great with lots to offer. You are served pretty much right when you sit down and it is non stop food. After each cart visits your table once it starts to slow down and you will need to flag them down if you want more. 

My go-to dishes are the chow mein, shrimp or pork shumai, steamed pork buns, shrimp har gow dumplings, seasame seed balls, coconut bread dessert
