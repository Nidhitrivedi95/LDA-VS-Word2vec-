First time here at lunch time, I tried the chicken mei soup, only to find out it was not really a soup, rather just chicken with juicy noodles. It was good, but not what I expected. 

Second negative point: the place is DIRTY! I went to the restroom and the toilet was disgusting, many tables both inside and outside were still dirty with previous dishes. I saw a lot of employees wandering around, but clearly no one pays attention to the neatness of their workplace. 
My dish came out with some noodles that were already outside the plate. 
Is that how you work people? 

I don't think I'll come back unless desperate. Too bad since I work nearby.
