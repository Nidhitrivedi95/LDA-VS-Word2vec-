0dr1FgqQSEMbaTu9SDqiIg Most patrons complain about poor service, but I need to say I'm rating them very low because of excessive service interruptions...seriously!  First, she brings those pasty fried strips with the red sugar sauce, then takes my order, returns with the food and no table settings or napkins.  I'm not the type of person to be rude, I actually try harder to be patient, so I know it's not my attitude toward anyone.  But patience was a bit stretched with the further trips to my table. How many times can you ask if everything is okay? It became a game when at least 4 of them came to my table a total of 12 times since I sat down.  And all I had was a measley, pedestrian cashew chicken lunch special, after the usual lunch time.  There was nothing exceptional about the food,  which I expected based on prior reviewers, but I just needed a place to sit after hours of shopping.  And a place to work on other reviews.  So many unnecessary interruptions...think I'll go to Panda where the food is a touch better and nobody harasses the diner looking for a little solitude and productive down time.  Really disappointed with this ludicrous experience.
