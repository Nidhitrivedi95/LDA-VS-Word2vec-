PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Yum Cha has the friendliest workers for an Asian restaurant. They are always making sure we are taken care of and are very polite when they speak to us. They offer both dim sum and meals. It doesn't take long at all to get out food and I have not been disappointed yet with it. If you go you have to try their baked lava custard bun, it's the perfect texture with a sweet and savory filling. So far my favorite dim sum place.
