An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg I came here on a Sunday when it opened, so we got a seat real quick. The decor is very nice and spacey. Waitress and waiters were at the opposite side of the entrance, which was a little odd, but perhaps it was too early in the morning. 

I ordered the tomyum soup with glass noodles, beef tripe, pigs blood, and while my partner ordered fish soup with pork intestines and beef tendon. Both our dishes came with some vegetables as well. We also got to get a drink as side - he ordered HK milk tea and I ordered almond milk. My order was so delicious! I loved every aspect of it. My partner's however, was a bit too bland for my liking. However, he seemed to enjoy it. There was so much noodles in my dish that I didn't finish my order at all. I ended up giving 1/2 my noodles to my partner. I do have  comment for the drink - mines was insanely grainy. 

Overall,it's really good if you know what you like. Service was fine.  I am definitely coming back!
