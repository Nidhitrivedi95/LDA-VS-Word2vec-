D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw I am a big Thai food fan and have to say this is the best I've had in Vegas. It is off strip, but visitors should definitely go there if they are tired of expensive strip restaurants or fast food and snacks.

The food is great! I've had all their curry dishes and a few of their noodles entrees and everything has been great! The service is always good and the restaurant itself is clean and set up nicely.
