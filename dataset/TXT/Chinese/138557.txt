QP8rKSa_kKYpc9iz9f5UfA Had a Panda bowl with chow mein and broccoli beef, pretty standard for Panda Express. Only problem I had was with the broccoli not being cooked enough it looked and tasted like they threw it in last minute.  

 Overall restaurant was clean, fast, with very friendly staff and good portions he could barely put the lid on. : )
