CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw This is my first time at a noodle place and I was pleasantly surprised by the selection and taste. I started with the chicken dim sum and it was very flavorful. The waitress suggested using the sauce on each table and she was right. It paired together quite nicely. Next we ordered the ants climbing a tree and the Crispy Ocean shrimp and split them. Both were really good. The first was made with mung bean vermicelli and although it was a little difficult to serve with chop sticks was pretty yummy. The second was served with shrimp (head on-luckily my dinner companion was willing to handle the removal for me), and bamboo shoots. It was a close race but I think the crispy ocean shrimp was a little better. I loved how the noodles were a little crispy in some spots. 

I also tried shaved ice for the first time. The small bowl is definitely enough to split between two. I ordered the strawberry shaved ice topped with strawberry, blueberry, camelized peanuts, and topped with honey. The waitress suggested we eat with the chop sticks and she was right. It was really good! Definitely going to come back to try more options. Yum!
