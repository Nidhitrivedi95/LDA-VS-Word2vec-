FUmy99Q3EZByy2GcCJlxyg Best chinese restaurant in Quebec (sorry Chez Chili) in terms of food. 

Ho Lee Fook (holy f*ck in chinese) the food. Most amazing chinese food I've had in North America (ok I haven't been to many places outside Montreal, but still). 

Mapo Tofu: Good mix of spicy and tangy. Very flavorful 5/5. The waitress didn't think we'd survive the spiciness but having dated a Sichuan girl for 3 years, I did ok. You can ask for less spicy. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's sichuan legit (as the colours and taste were kinda off), but it was fooking GUD.

Braised Pork + Sweet potato noodles: Meat mainly consisted of fat (from under the skin of the animal). The fat and muscles were very tender and tasty, but lacked a bit in flavor. More spices could have been added in the stew that cooked the meat, but it's still worth a good 4.5/5.

Cumin Beef: Cooked well done but very tender and flavorful. The taste of cumin wasn't as strong as most cumin meat dishes I've had. The onions look like they've been stir fried for a long time, for they were kinda burnt and dried out (almost like chips). This intensified the flavor of the onion.

The decor was pretty simple, the entrance not eye catching, and the service average, but some items on the menu are definitely worth braving the winter for.

Seeing a lot of non-chinese folks ordering General Tso, singapore noodles, chow mein really hurt me deep inside. Give a chance to authentic chinese cuisine by ordering items that don't sound familiar (or just ask the server), they're just so much more tasty than, say, mu shu pork and orange beef. You'll thank me.
