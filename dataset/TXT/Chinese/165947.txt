vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw Found this place by accident and it is a gem! Great Chinese food for a very good price! I absolutely love the beef chow fun! The portion size is enough to split with someone and still  have left overs.  

The outside looks sketchy but the place makes great food!

And their lunch menu is the best in town at $5
