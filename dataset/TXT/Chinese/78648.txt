GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog We've been here five times over three years. Never had a bad meal. It's a little unusual so I can understand why it wouldn't work for some folks. But if you go with the servers' recommendations and you're a little adventurous you'll have a great time. Also, the lamb potstickers are amazing.
