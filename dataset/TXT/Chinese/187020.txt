Quick, efficient, cheap and quite good. 

I've never had Vietnamese Bahn Mi so I don't have a reference point. I will say that their vegetarian sub with tofu, carrots and mushrooms was incredible. Flavourful, not too dry and grilled to the right temperature. 

The service was really quick and polite. 

If you're looking for a quick lunch - this is your place.
