I guess that's because the ownership is straight from the mother country and hasn't been distorted by American tastes. A pit pricey, but worth it, The menu offers lots of stuff I've never tried and I will have too go back many times before I can say that I'm familiar with the food. I will say this, going back will be a pleasure, especially given the staff's great attitude and the pleasant decor. We had the lamb with cumin, the hot and sour soup (warning the soup comes in huge bowls fit for at least six), the fried pork ribs, the cold beef, and the chicken hearts. They were all great. And, there was none of that bloated, salted, and msg-ed effect that so often follows eating Chinese. What a delight.
