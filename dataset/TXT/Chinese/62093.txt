DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA I went a few months ago for a late night food run. Going oooo I love Sam Woo to my BF thinking it was just like the ones in Cali. 

First off, they didn't say cash only except for a dinky sign....had to make the BF do a little ATM run. Ugh. All the other Sam Woos took card so I didn't think of it.

The Hot Pot of Eggplant pork and Salty Fish was actually pretty good in flavors and the right balance with the salty fish. I liked this a lot but the rest is so inconsistent. 

The roast duck was a bit dry . I'm used to the fatty ones with plenty of juiciness... how does a fatty meat get dry? Granted it was a bit skinny....and usually half is plenty but it wasn't. I had to order some BBQ pork and it was dry like it was sliced this morning and left out. Boo. 

 I have gone to Sam Woos in Cali and they are a good chain of restaurants there....did not hold very true here. First those SW take card. They are very clean and have good service. The food is consistently good and the place is usually housed in a big space and it actually fills up. One even gave nice hot desserts at the end for free like a bowl of sweet corn or taro with tapioca. I liked Sam Woo in Rowland Heights, Ca so much that I indeed was a 1-2 times a month regular with my mom. 

Sorry, but Sam Woo will stay on my CALI repertoire but not here.
