Yecau5RHd7hjMlsZFBccFQ Nasty, nasty, nasty!!! Food was not edible. The oil was obviously old and used to overcook our food to a burned crisp. Yet, they sent it out to us anyway when it was dark brown and so hard that you'd break a tooth if you tried eating it. Then, upon our complaining, they proceeded to give us an excuse that "they turned the burner up so that's why it was overcooked." Well then, why didn't you recook it before sending it out to your paying customers? Insulting. The dumplings were undercooked and tasted weird so we were actually afraid to eat those. Especially knowing what the place looks and smells like on the inside. I won't be ordering from here ever again. You would think they would try to keep their customers happy since there is a Chinese delivery place literally on every corner.
