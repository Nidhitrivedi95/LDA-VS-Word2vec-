TSGBM2z5BTeJvYQAznz8Fg i have been there couple times, i like the food there but one thing i do not like is the way of server looked at me when i got sushi and oyster. The server put salmon and oyster with a little amount, then when i got all of these salmon or oyster, they looked at me like i was stealing food. I felt uncomfortable for that look.
