kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A This place is overrated not sure how it has so many stars. The noodles are huge and heavy. Ordered B1 beef noodle no flavor. Also order of beef pancakes The beef fell right out of the middle of the pancake no flavor either. The servers are very nice. If you want to go watch some guy make noodles this is the place for you. If you want great tasting food this is NOT the place for you. Seating can be a challenge. We will NOT be back for the noodle men. I approve this message J K KUHL
