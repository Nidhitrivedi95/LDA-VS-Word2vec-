cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A Came here yesterday with a friend. Ive been to the Chandler location before so I was pretty stoked to find a Chinos near here.

Dont expect anything fancy. Really. The place is filthy. And thats being nice. But the food, is really good. Not amazing, but foe the price and how fast it is, it really is good. 

You get your choice of having your food burrito, or quesadilla style, or traditional (in a "bowl"). I usually choose the bowl type deal, Im weird and like seeing the colors/grains of the food Im eating. 

Their jade red chicken is crazy awesome. Same with the BBQ Chinese Pork. You cant really go wrong. But I would study what you want before coming. Cause their line builds up pretty quickly.

The place is pretty big. You order your food in one part of the place, then walk over to a good sized room to eat. Its like a cafeteria really. They hand you a written ticket, you give that ticket to someone else and pay and get your drink. 

And it helps its also a Pokestop. My only complaint is the windows. I feel like Im an animal at the zoo. The windows are huge and theres no blinds/curtains. And the windows face a parking lot. So people can be chilling in their cars and watch you stuff your face full of food.
