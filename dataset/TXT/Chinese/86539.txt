HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I've been wanting to come back since the last time I came to lunch here with friend and fellow Yelper Dyanna L. Since it was my birthday, my Dad wanted to take me out to lunch and I knew this would be the spot to take both him and Joel! Boy, I was right! Still totally sticking with my 5 stars. Wish I could give more it was that good. 

This time we split the Duck Bao. The duck was tender and had a little piece of skin! Can you say PERFECT! It's so hard to pick what you want here. Cause I want ALL the things. I went with the special, which was the PBBLT. It was Pork Belly with Bacon, lettuce, tomato and a spicy aioli on Sourdough Bread and a side salad. 
Joel got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese with Fries. He can not stop talking about this sandwich! He said it's not just the best Grilled Cheese he has ever had, but most likely the best sandwich he'll ever have!!!
My Dad had the Crispy Duck Leg with Rice. He was so impressed with it all. He cleaned his plate and picked every piece of duck off that leg. 

The Staff is so friendly and very informative of all the dishes! I have to say if it couldn't get any better they have a Coke 100 machine! So I can have ALL the Diet soda flavors!!! Including my current favorite Coke Zero Cherry! 

YAY Fat Choy's! I can not wait to be back to eat more of your delicious food!
