hjDCsuzS_yU60FFffqpt-w I am a big fan of Asian buffets, mainly because the meats allow you to avoid carbs. I read the reviews on this place and almost didn't go in.  I figured what the heck, if I don't like what I see I am in control to leave or complain. The male server was very professional, didn't feel any pressure, and the quality and selection were great for the price. I wasn't going to leave a tip walking in, but I ended up leaving a tip cuz the kid with was cool, even after I just ordered a water with lemon.  I would recommend giving this place a try. They could clean the walls, and offer WiFi to paying customers without handing your device over for them to enter in the password,  but it's a good spot. Give it a try. I think the music was ok, too. I don't remember.
