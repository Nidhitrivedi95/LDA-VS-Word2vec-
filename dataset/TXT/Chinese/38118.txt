aTbz9GdpAf2M5MeAHVNhWw My friends and I came here a bit ago to try them out during dinner. It was pretty empty in the restaurant when we went so the service was really good. They were quick to take orders down. 

We ordered their spicy duck gizzard, cold spicy noodle, Chongqing street noodle soup, fish and tofu special, and their lamb pot. We ordered each at either medium or hot spicy. 

Everything looked great. However, the taste was way off. Why? There was no taste. Aside from the spiciness, there is literally no depth to any of the dishes we've tried. 

The tofu and fish special and the lamb pot were in huge pots. It looks big but it's not as big as you may think. They pretty much steamed the food and them pour a spicy chili oil on top. There wasn't much flavor to the dish aside from that. If they had cooked it in a sauce, it would've been better. The Chongqing street noodle also lacks some flavor .. or perhaps some MSG. The spicy cold noodle dish is decent.

I probably won't come here to dine again. Not my cup of tea.
