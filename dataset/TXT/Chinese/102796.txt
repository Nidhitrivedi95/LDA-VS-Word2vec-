kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA My husband and I were in the MGM and decided to try this new restaurant we ended up sitting at the bar it was a very happening place we were greeted by a friendly bartender named Brittany she is amazing she explained all the drinks and recommend the Hakka mmmm so good I had two.  She also recommended crispy duck salad it was yummy too.  The service here is 10 stars if your ever in the MGM try this restaurant and sit at the bar Brittany will take good care of you!!
