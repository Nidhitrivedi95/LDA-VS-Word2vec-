There are lots of dishes to choose from off the menu (Chinese to colonial European-Chinese fusion) plus lunch & chef's specials posted on the walls.  I opted for the lunch special chicken & rice Macau style which comes with soup and coffee or tea ($1 extra to make it ice).  

The main itself didn't look that impressive when it arrived, very simple with a bowl shaped mound of rice and chicken & onions in a yellow sauce.  The sauce is coconut based with a hint of curry which was tasty and not spicy.  The chicken pieces were deep fried and tender but more bone than meat and the onions were pretty much raw.

Overall the meal wasn't the greatest but the efficient and attentive service made up for that which was a nice surprise in Chinatown.  I probably ordered the wrong thing but will return to try one of their popular baked dishes next time.
