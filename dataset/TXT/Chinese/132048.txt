PM2u75n_bJA_hvWcvko_tA I was just at this location. I was totally ignored despite the fact there were the front workers in the lobby. One steam cleaning and the other two talking very loudly in Spanish. I waited a while at the counter while they talked at the table in the lobby, finally one came up and just stood there and said, "what can I get you?" while still talking with the other girl over me ordering my food. Very rudely served me... I got half scoops of everything (no meat in meat entrees!). She didn't talk to me at all and I felt very uncomfortable although I wanted to complain about the food she dropped into the Beijing beef tray because she wasn't watching what she was doing and scooped it into my tray anyway... I didn't because she was so aggressive and I wasn't in the mood to argue over my lunch.  When I only drove down the street to my office, the food was all rubbery because it had been sitting in that hot table sooo long and I got no meat in my beef and broccoli and two pieces in my kung pao. Just to top it off I was halfway back to work and realized I didn't get a drink so stopped to get one somewhere else (they normally ask) no big deal but still annoying. I will NEVER go back. Terrible service and horrible servers.
