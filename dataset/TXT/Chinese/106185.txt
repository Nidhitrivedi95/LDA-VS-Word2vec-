kzuQsq0KPWLeKFtnLXXyHg Now I wanted some chicken yesterday and found this place on Yelp!  My girlfriend and I ventured out to find this hidden "hole in the wall" and after passing it, we realized what people really mean.  Quite literary a hole in the wall.

So we take a look out our car windows to find barred windows, doors, and a solid concrete building. (I was wondering if they actually lived in the back of the place) I saw two people standing in line to order in this small window and saw a small chinese lady yell at the top of her lungs "Order 22!" "Order 22!" "2 Egg Rolls!" 

So instead of getting two orders for ourselves, we decide to get a combo which is priced higher and not to waste any money if we didn't like the food.  I decided on Cashew Chicken and an order of 6 Crab Puffs. Total = $11.86.  Cheap, not too bad.

After receiving our food, we started to head back to our place since there was no seating there nor would you want to sit there outside in the dark.

After opening the containers I will say that you get a lot of food for the price, but you also get a lot of oil and grease as well.  The food had no flavor, the cashews were old, and I wasn't quite sure if the chicken was really chicken.  On a good note, the chicken fried rice and crab puffs were really good.  

After a few bites both my girlfriend and I decided it wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. On top of that, it felt I had a grease lining in my mouth and down my throat. Additionally we smelled of the fine Chinese food that we ordered.

Needless to say we threw out the food and went back out to scrounge up something a little more tasty.

*Best to find another place for chicken without the side order of grease.
