U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q *** Review is for Restaurant Week 2015 menu ***

This was the last of my Restaurant Week visits.  I have been intrigued when I've walked by Beijing Noodle No. 9 and seen the whiteness of the interior.  It does grab your attention.  Aside from that, I wanted to try their noodles.

This was a four course meal.  For the starter I chose the tomato and egg drop soup.  I haven't seen this combination and it works well.  The tomatoes were partially blanched so they had texture to them and weren't mushy.  The soup was very hot and tasty.

For an appetizer, I chose the spring rolls.  It was three fried rolls with sweet and sour sauce.  They were standard egg rolls.

For the main course, I got the Sichuan Dan Dan noodles.  These are hand pulled noodles with chili oil and minced pork and scallions.  It was very good.  The spiciness was good, but I chose to add a little extra from the small container on each table. 

The menu said dessert was a mochi sampler.  It was two pieces of chocolate mochi with raspberry sauce.

Serviced was very good.  The courses were spaced nicely and my iced tea was refilled without asking.

This was a good Restaurant Week choice but the place is expensive due to its Strip location.  For noodles in the future, I'll stick with the shops in Chinatown.
