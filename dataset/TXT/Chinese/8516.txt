1fQWV5PVyo6Gsu16KbotPQ Great service for a very affordable price! I was previously going to an Acupuncturist 2x a week for 3 months and paying about $60-$70 a session. I didn't achieve any major results but after a few sessions (about 8 sessions!) with Daryl and Ash (amazing and caring, always remembered details about my health history, etc) my horrible monthly cramping already seems to be improving. Cannot say enough good things about this place!
