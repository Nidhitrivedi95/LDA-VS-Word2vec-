kHKGaaK4yAOT1End-XS65g It's time to mutate more tongues on ducks. I can wipe out a dozen of them in a dozen minutes if I'm pacing myself.  The flavour slightly outperforms a handful of other Chinese Duck specialty shops and you can see it in the colour of the marinade.  *3.5*

For a spicy-hot version, they'll ask if you want hot chili oil mixed into it and I highly doubt anyone wants it without.  It takes awhile for the mala spice to activate but once there you'll keep on snacking.

The shop much like others have various other duck parts available; head, neck, wings.  The wings definitely had enough time in the herb, spice marinade.  After all the exposure to duck parts the last few years, I think this is as good as it gets here in GTA.

Outside Canada, now that's another story...
