YwTtrKCE_9OaMe9xASCOkA My Cantonese chow mien was terrible.  AVOID it at all costs!! When I got it, there was no seasoning at all.  The noodles barely touched the wok.  The "sauce" was liquid from the veggies, there was no cornstarch to make it shiny and slippery, there was no soya sauce, no pepper, no oyster sauce to make a cantonese chow mien sauce.  I sent it back and told them to keep their money but to tell their cook it's terrible and do something about it.

I won't be coming back here.  It's fast food, but seriously, make it edible.
