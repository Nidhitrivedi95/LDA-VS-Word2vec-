jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow One of the best buffets in Arizona, I would compare it to some casinos. It is new and modern, the layout is good not like the old dirty buffets you see most places that are outdated. The food selection is better then most buffets too, I still have not tried it all yet. Big parking lot which gets packed, the place is fairly large too and is its own building. I recommend it for family,friends or you can just be a pig and go by yourself, haha.
