Ysz-Xvo6QT9oaQDH4ephlw We have had a lot of dumplings in Toronto and Markham and 7 Dim Sum is our favourite. The soup and steamed dumplings are better than mother's dumplings and Dumpling House in Markham. The owner is really friendly and takes great pride in his food. Everything is freshly made and you can tell by th springyness of the wrapper. The noodles in the spicy beef noodle soup are definitely homemade and delicious. Nothing is too salty and it a all very flavourful.
