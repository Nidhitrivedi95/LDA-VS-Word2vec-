Dzm3_K2lnLLcGPVLZBZtog Tried this place out for the first time and not impressed. I placed a pickup order and ordered hot and sour soup. They didn't ask me small or large size and charged me for a large. I did not want that size. I ordered kung pao chicken with fried rice and the rice had this strange undercooked, rubbery chicken that did not belong in fried rice. Literally the chicken was so chewy and rubbery I feared we were going to get food poisoning.  My husband couldn't finish it. The rice was mushy and flavorless and tasted like it was not fried. We couldn't finish our meal. Two stars for the lettuce wraps- it also lacked flavor but was decent to eat.  $30 for food I had to throw away. Never coming back.
