3f2dKT9PgLipoNi6vebnDQ Ordered the general Tsos combo dinner. Little over 8 bucks which isn't a terrible price and it was ready quick. The food was so bland I couldn't finish it. The chicken hard barely any hint of General Tsos sauce on it and was pretty much dry. The "fried rice" was so plain I could hardly manage a forkful. Friend rice is supposed to have onions and possibly some other veggies and egg mixed in and this was just white rice that looked like it had been coated in oil while cooking. Portion size was smaller than other places I have had as well. Very disappointed.
