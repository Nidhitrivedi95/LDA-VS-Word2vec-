xL-Ckvr8k8vEBJxC1wsCqQ We came here on the weekend ot eat the Lobster (we had black bean flavored). My fiancee who is Korean really enjoyed the meal, but for me, I would still prefer my lobster grilled and dipped in garlic/butter. Was not a huge fan. 

We also ordered some Chinese Broccoli and it was cooked well, but I have still had better. Service was very good, but considering the price, I personally wouldn't return for the food. Since my fiancee seems to enjoy it very much and wants to return with her friends, I give them an even steven 3 stars!
