ANbBHDf1PZp5bQCkEa8YsQ I've been to this restaurant twice, and actually find the food very well done.
The first time was using a $40 for $20 coupon.  

The second time was for a lobster dinner for 2.  But we brought 4 people, so we ordered an additional dish.
The bbq pork was quite small and only had a few pieces.  Next came a hot and sour soup - there was enough for about 8-9 bowls, it was quite good - not too spicy, while still having a bit of a kick.  The stir fry vegetables were quite small, mostly celery with a couple of pieces of broccoli.

I don't really eat lobster, but it seemed quite small as expected.  Last, was the crispy chicken.  This was quite large, and this restaurant cooks the chicken perfectly.

We ordered a tofu with scallops as an additional dish, since this meal was only meant for 2 ppl.  With a black bean sauce, it was done very nicely, with firm tofu and perfectly cooked scallops.

Lastly came dessert - red bean soup, with some almond cookies, and tapioca jellow.

For 4 people it was $30 for the groupon + 30 additional, so $60 for 4 ppl.  

The first time the food was very good, the second time was good.  
  
They were confused the first time as to how we can use the groupon as everything had to be ordered through a set menu.  But they understood the second time.

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you don't speak cantonese, because their english isn't very good.
