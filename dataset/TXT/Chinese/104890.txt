KRoJhHyPWORMJn1UO5kAkA First time to try this after seeing the good reviews. Place looks nice . Not a lot of choices on the menu. Ordered pomegranate ribs and beef cube in maggi sauce which both are good. The other items recommended to us like the sesame chicken and vermicelli with fish I find it nothing special. Portion is really small when each order is around $12 to $15.
