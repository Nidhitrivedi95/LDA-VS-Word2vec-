jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg My girlfriend and I visited this place a week ago, and the experience was yelp worthy.  When we showed up we were greeted by a very nice young man.  And he proceeded to explain that their hot pots were just a little different.  He was very helpful.  He even took us over to the dipping sauce station and told us his favorite combo of sauces.  The hot pots were amazing.  Unlike some hot pots, everything in the pot was edible.  And our server also mentioned a house brew iced tea, and it was pretty good itself.

I would suggest this place to anyone who is looking to branch out and try hot pot.  You can't go wrong.
