QI0PGXbGkIdInOOBeq6ieQ I went to Tokyo Sushi before, I feel that at TJ Buffet Sushi and Grill, they definitely made the interior a lot cleaner and new.
The food was so bomb, especially the calm and shrimp.
The sushi was okay but all their other stuff is really good!
Not too salty, not too sweet.
The waiters were pretty nice too.
