I like the idea of dim sum that they walk around with; our table went with the Kim chi. We had a party of 9 and everyone was happy with the atmosphere and the food. In fact, some folks walked by the restaurant where we were sitting outside and asked if we would recommend it, to which we emphatically said, "yes!"
