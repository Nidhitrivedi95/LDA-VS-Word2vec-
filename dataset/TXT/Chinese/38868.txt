AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA We wanted a healthy veggie lunch and I had this place bookmarked for a while. The place was quite busy when we reached at 1 p.m. and since there were just 2 servers, we waited for 10 minutes before asking for a menu. The waitress assigned to our table was pleasant and quickly brought our drinks when she had a minute.
We ordered 2 lunch specials-crispy beef and vegetables in tamarind sauce.
The vegetarian crispy beef tasted really good and the vegetables in tamarind sauce was ok. 
The lunch special comes with rice or bun and the good thing is that they don't charge extra for brown rice. It also includes a small bowl of clear soup which was tasty and healthy.
