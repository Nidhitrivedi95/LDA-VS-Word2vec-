HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I can't figure out what the mystique of this restaurant is and why are all these reviewers swooning over it. 
 The waitress was sweet, there was zero wait on Saturday at 10pm, it has a cute look of a 50's diner with a few Chinese decor accents. And the fries were tasty. 
 That's about it. The food is heavy, fatty and greasy. Most of the flavor seemed to come from fat. Pork belly bao, to be fair, should be exactly that- fatty pork belly, and it was. 
 Fat Choy burger patty was fatty and juicy, but not especially tasty or well seasoned, and short rib topping overpowered everything else.  
 Lastly, short rib grilled cheese- again, fatty and greasy with no amazing flavors to speak of. 
  Altogether, I'm glad I knocked off another spot from my bookmarked list, but I see zero reason to come back.
