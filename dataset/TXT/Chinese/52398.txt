cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A Chino Bandido from the front of the restaurant makes one curious if they should be going there. As soon as you step foot inside however, one realizes it was built for quality of food, and the atmosphere came second. They have a vast menu with creative and unique menu options, and one gets to build their own meal on a form and within 10 minutes, your food is out and you get a little cookie. It is a great place if you want to try something food, or just can't decide between mexican or asian food.
