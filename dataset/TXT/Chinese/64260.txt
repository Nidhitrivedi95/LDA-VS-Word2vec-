But...the General Tso's wasn't spicy enough for me.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't up to par for me.  I don't believe I ever saw a pepper in the sauce at all.  I suppose I should add that this was part of a large order placed for delivery.  With it being delivery and all that jazz, you would expect it to come with utensils or maybe even chopsticks.  None came with it, or maybe it did, the bag seems to have disintegrated when attempting to take the order to it's destination.  So if there was utensils of any type in there, they may have been lost.

I will order from here again, but next time I'll be sure to mention that there is utensils with the next delivery.
