p_PAW92e0bw9ROebQxM2SA It has been a while since I last came to Prince of Seafood (at least a year). They have done changes to the restaurant and it now looks cleaner. The food is also better than what I remember, however today the har gow wrapping kept falling apart when we picked them up.  We stopped coming here because my father in law was not satisfied with the food, but now he is very happy with all the improvements, so I will probably be coming here more often.
