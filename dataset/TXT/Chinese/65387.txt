EbgUkmDxPUa2fr0rc8EFJQ I don't know why, but it's always hard for me to get overly excited about a chain restaurant.  I like PF Chang's and it's a nice place to have an asian-inspired meal.  It's especially good for people who are reluctant to try different types of food outside of the usual american food (it's a good place to take that first step).  For some reason PF Chang's has a hard time getting repeat business out of me unless I'm meeting up with friends and they picked the restaurant.  

I went to this location on a Wednesday evening to meet a group for a birthday party around 8pm and this place was overflowing with people.  I have never felt so grateful to have a reservation.  We had one waitress for a group of around 11 people and she did a surprisingly good job of keeping all of our orders straight and staying on top of drink refills.  At the time I was trying to watch my calorie intake closely and there weren't too many low-cal entree options.  I ended up ordering the chicken lettuce wraps with extra spice.  They were decent but probably not something I would ever crave.  The hubby ordered some kind of spicy chicken-coated-in-sauce entree that didn't seem to have too much flavor.

Overall, ok food at slightly above average cost.
