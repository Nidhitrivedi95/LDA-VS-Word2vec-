They then cut it up and serve it in many ways. It's massive enough to feed like 6-8 people. 

This type of place is generally a bit much for me. It's really loud, I find it a bit gimicky, and it's definitely priced on the high side. that said, the food is actually really good so I have to forgive all of that.
