6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ Such amazing food! Very authentic and love the fact it's also a boba/smoothie shop. It's located in the strip mall where golden tiki, pho Kim long, and doh is.

We ordered: chicken and vegetable dumpling, scallion pancake, egg drop soup, steamed pork dumpling/buns, and pot stickers.

Everything was extremely clean, huge portions, and came out very quickly! It was quite busy at 9 at night on a Sunday so we were suprised how quickly everything was prepared, and with superb quality. 

The restaurant is clean and spacious, and the staff were very friendly. Our waitress kept our waters filled and constantly checked on us even though it was busy! I was definitely be back.
