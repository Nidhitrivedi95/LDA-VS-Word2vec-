5aGYZbjkXpCecz4QH2ZKFg Good food for a buffet.  One of the better Chinese Buffets in the area.  This is not a place to go if you want sushi, because while they have it, it is not a center piece, but a after thought.
  
They have some of the better crab rangoons that I have had at any restaurant.  3 serving islands with hot food.  The popcorn butter shrimp is very good.  The Egg Drop soup is hit or miss, the days that it is on it is great, the days they are off, it is like yellow water.  I also recommend the pepper pork, Mongolian beef, and chicken and broccoli, as they are all good.  

Of course my 4 year old son always wants to go because he gets the ice cream dessert.
