Qn5QMHOV6f5uHbxvrTPGRA Wow we finally got to try this place after a few misses and now we are hooked!  It was great my only disappointment was the shrimp dumplings had chicken in them and I wish they were just shrimp. I also think a side dish of edamame would be a nice addition.  Their sauce was one of the best I have ever had!!!  We caught them at food truck Friday at Sycamore which was a nice addition to their line-up.
