It's *almost* authentic, pricey and has smallish portions in a vain way to elevate and differentiate their cooking from a comparable Chinatown restaurant where you'd definitely get more value.

We had the Peking Duck which tasted great but didn't have the crispy skin essentially to a Peking Duck experience.  We also ordered their house special pork which did not look like the dish pictured in the menu.  The menu featured a photo of a beautifully sliced roast of pork.  What came out looked like a couple scraps from a Chinese BBQ store.  The same with the rest of our dinner - from the soup dumplings to a shrimp dish - all of the "not quite" variety.

Parking is very tight, but overall, TAO is a pleasant enough restaurant for special occasions or impressive dinner meals.  Just don't expect to get a real Northern Chinese meal.
