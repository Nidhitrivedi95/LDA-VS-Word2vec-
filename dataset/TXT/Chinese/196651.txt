zO57PdrDDbcgBhXYItAGoA My family enjoyed a delicious meal here, the food tasted very fresh, excellent quality and the portion was generous. We had the hibachi steak and hibachi chicken. The servers did a great job, also. The chef came out and was very interested that we were enjoying our meal. We'll definitely go back again.
