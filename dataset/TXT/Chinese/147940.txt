Se63tFm5tLlO5wuUlyww8Q Most of the food was ok, the Mongolian BBQ was the best out of everything. I got way too much food and didn't want to waste it so I wanted to take some home for later. I knew it wasn't going to be free, but they wanted to charge $5.99/pound plus $16.88 for dinner. That was WAY too much money for me. I don't know if I'll come back here, the food wasn't worth the price
