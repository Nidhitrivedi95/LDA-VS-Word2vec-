JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA Authentic Taiwanese breakfast that can't be found even in NYC. Perfect ending for our trip.
Be aware that they open till only 3PM on Sunday. I was there 6PM....
But anyway, went back next morning and got so far the most authentic rice ball and Chinese cruller I ever had in US.
Too bad I had to leave at noon. Otherwise I'll have another meal there for their famous beef noodle.
