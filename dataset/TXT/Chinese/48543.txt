C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ I made an act. Just so I can rate this place. 
For some reason my aunt loves this place and it gets worse every time we visit this place. They have added more chairs which make it nearly impossible walking around with your plate with out the waiters bumping into you. Cleanness is far from it. Serving spoons are not clean and used for more than one dish. Floors seem to be not mopped in days. Be careful of the ceiling fan they don't clean it and dust is clearly on it. 

Now the food. It's not bad. I mean it's the kind of food that you can tolerate to eat. But when you are done eating you feel disgusting. Disgusted that you at at this place. 

One thing about this place that I commend is the waiters though. They are poorly understaffed and they work really hard. In fact I didn't see one of them stand around.
