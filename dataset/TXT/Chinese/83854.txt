He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw Food was not good to say the least. Waited for "non shared" table, only to be seated in a table smaller than the non shared. We ordered the lamb satay hotplate, it was as if lamb was the garnish for giant onions slices (there was so much onions and they were cut to the size of watermelon slices). Second item was popcorn chicken, which looked more like fish sticks or chicken fingers. However, taste-wise was what you expect from Taiwanese pop corn chicken. Third item was pork ramen; broth was overly salty, soup was luke warm, and the pork had giant pieces of fatcap. Last item was the mango pancake, which we specifically asked to be served after our meal, the server agreed. Regretfully, it came before the lamb dish, so if it was supposed to be served cold, it was room temperature by the time we ate it. Because we were sharing, we asked for a small bowl, the server acknowledged our order and never came back. Overall the experience was bad and I'll never visit again, nor will I recommend this place to someone I care about.
