yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA As bad as it is to say, this is possibly my favorite pho spot in town. Back when I was a young'n this was the place that introduced me to pho.
Anytime I had a bad day at work Pho Kim Long was there for me. Anytime I was drunk as a skunk and stumbling out of the clubs at 4am, they were there for me. When I broke my leg and needed a good meal, pho Kim long was there for me. 
The pho is pretty good. On the rare occasion it had been meh, but I put my faith in them. I absolutely love their spring rolls and their peanut sauce. It is to die for, and I use that peanut sauce on so many dishes.its one of my foodie little secrets. The staff is very friendly, sometimes they get a little overworked and hectic but they do work hard and always aim to please. If you're new to town, or you want reliable pho, gotta get some pho Kim long
