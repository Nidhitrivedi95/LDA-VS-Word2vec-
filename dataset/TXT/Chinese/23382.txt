6tY0tn39Mb8FCLYBAXXOUw We have been eating here for years!  We absolutely LOVE the Sesame Beef!  You can order it mild or spicy!  Also, ask for the HOT OIL to add to it for even more great flavor a more of a kick.  The won ton soup is rather drab so we've stopped ordering it.  The fried rice and egg rolls are okay.  Good HOT mustard and sweet & sour sauces for the egg rolls!  I'm sorry that I cannot review more dishes but the Sesame Beef rocks and I have to order it every time I go (which is only about once a month or so).  I did try the General Tso's Chicken several years ago and it was good, but not great.  I would highly recommend ordering the Sesame Beef!  Also, we were just there yesterday and it seems that over the past couple of months there has been a change in ownership?  staff?  We don't recognize any of the people.  The fried rice and egg roll used to be better than it was yesterday.  The Sesame Beef was still awesome though!
