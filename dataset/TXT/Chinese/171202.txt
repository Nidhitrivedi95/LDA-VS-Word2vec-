vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Good dim sum for a casino.  I was referred to this restaurant by a local Las Vegas resident.  The beef chow fun was tasty and the dim sum is above average.  Prices are not even too expensive for a casino ($2.88 for a medium and $3.88 for a large dim sum item).  The restaurant was clean but the casino itself is pretty old and dingy.
