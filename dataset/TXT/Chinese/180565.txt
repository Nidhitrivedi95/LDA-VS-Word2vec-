X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Came here to see Tiesto on a Friday night.  Place was beyond capacity - i'm talking at least 500 people over what should have been allowed to go in.  Paid $85 for a ticket with a disclaimer that said, "Guaranteed entrance before 11 p.m.".  Tiesto didn't play until 2:30 a.m.  

I'm paying $85 for a ticket.  The least they can do is reserve a spot for people who paid money in advanced. (I am aware that this is a growing trend among clubs...which is total bullshit!!!)

Anyways, got in, realized it was way too crowded (to the point where you are almost touching hands with whoever is next to you), and walked towards the back of the club.  Even though it was a little bit better, these spots were right behind the bottle service tables.  The people who had bottle service stood on their seating area (totally reasonable as they paid for it), making it impossible for anyone near the back to see the main stage.  

Overall, pretty terrible experience as far as how the place was set up.  The sound systems weren't set up well and the sounds were piercing at times.  Visual effects were extremely mediocre. 8oz bottle of water (half of your normal water bottle) was $9. 

1 star for Tiesto.
