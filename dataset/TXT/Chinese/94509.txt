I'm a student at CMU and I used to come here a lot because of its convenient location. The food was subpar for its price and often led to upset stomachs, flatulence, and the itis. 

The main reason I stopped eating here was because I could not stand the extremely rude server named Stanley (he's at the cashier and will take your order 99% of the time). From the multiple times I've eaten there, he has aggressively told me to shut up, denied my requests to order on multiple occasions, and told me multiple times to get out in a hostile manner once I was done eating, all taking into account my attempts of being polite and initiating friendly conversation. Because of this foul treatment, I had every reason to tip next to nothing every time I ate here. I even addressed the cause of the low tip to Stanley, but he never understood and was always unsatisfied calling me words such as "jerk". 

After a few times of this, I checked my bank account to see that the amount I wrote on the check was increased by 1 dollar every time I went (I pay with debit card). Summing up all the money, it equated to about 5-6 dollars lost. I let it slide and went back in for another meal. This time, the service from Stanley was horrible. He refused when I asked to order, stepped on my shoes, gave me water with grass and dirt in it, and took the new glasses of water back to the counter when I got up to get new glasses of water. I looked at him in the eyes and said, "Are you serious? The water you gave me has grass in it." He then said, "Why'd you put grass in your water?"

I could not believe what I heard, so I just promptly left and will never go back. 

P.S. Their meat is not fresh and who knows what they put in your food. If you want Asian food, I would recommend Lulu's Noodles or Little Asia down Craig Street. It's only a 1 minute walk from this establishment.
