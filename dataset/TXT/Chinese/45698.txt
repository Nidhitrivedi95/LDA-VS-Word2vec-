BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ This place was really good.  Good fresh flavors, we had a veg and tofu dish, a pork dish and a chicken dish it was all good.  The food came out really fast.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the hostess was a little scattered and came off as quite rude at times.
