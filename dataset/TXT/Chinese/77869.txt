GhWMl0J2gOOH61BhBMTAAA The food is great and they have a lot of great options.  All the veggie looked fresh and tasted great.  They have tons of sauces that you can taste before you pick and great seasonings.

My only real complaint was the service. We went the first week they opened, so I'll give them a break, but they had about 12 servers just standing around & gabbing instead of refilling drinks/doing any type of work.  

I'm sure they will work out the staffing kinks and we plan to go back soon!
