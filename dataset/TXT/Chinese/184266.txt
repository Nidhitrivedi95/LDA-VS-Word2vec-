xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A My pad thai was very sweet and had no discernible spice at all. The chicken seemed to be of low quality. I also ordered a side of fried rice which was bland and unappealing. Finally, the mango smoothie (which has been good in the past) tasted like ice cream this time.

I have never enjoyed the food on previous visits, but everyone raves about Lulu's, so I keep trying to give it a chance. I am consistently let down, so I don't think I'll be visiting Lulu's ever again.
