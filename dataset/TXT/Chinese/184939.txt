xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw Genghis has been one of my favorite go to restaurants at Tempe marketplace! One thing for sure is service is always superb, they make it an have too go to experience! Always ask if you been here if you haven't they'll throw down the spill! But once you get seated, you go up and pick your size bowls, 3 bowls small, medium and of course large! First time here oh say? I'd stick with the medium you'll either eat it all or have some leftovers! You pick your protein from sea food too meat meat! A column of vegetables also; and then seasoning! They also have side cards in case you can't pick out your own or create your recipe! Last but not least is the sauce from basic soy to a yummy dragon sauce! Which is amazing! Then pick your side aka, base carb like rice to even spaghetti noodles I think they also do lettuce wraps too so it's evolving as time goes by! Drink specials are awesome and they have a great happy hour, all very daily as well! Hungry from shopping or trying to escape the heat? Come here! Well, stay hungry Arizona !
