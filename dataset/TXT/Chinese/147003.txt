S9CrHJJnns3cqdGca7mQWQ The food is ehhh and the "chicken" tastes horrible. Always bad but I'm insane because I continue to order from them simply for the convenience but the quality of the food is poor and prices way too high!!! Not worth it. I'm going on a diet and will not order from them anymore! The drivers are always super nice though.
