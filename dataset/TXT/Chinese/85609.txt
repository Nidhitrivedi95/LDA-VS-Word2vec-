Hm2YntlJzqP4reNZRlkCEA Came here after 2:30 for afternoon tea but then there's not much options on the menu so we just ordered BBQ pork with which was pretty good and a bit disappointed with the udon cuz it was nothing special about it...Fooled by the name loll and one con is their food portion was a bit small so it might not be enough for a guy
