Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA I called for a pick up order only to drive there and find out that that their credit card machine is broken and that it's cash only. I didn't have any cash so I just left with no food, wasted gas and the worst part of it was that they didn't even apologize about the fact that they didn't tell me on the phone that it was broken before I drove there. Also I asked them why didn't tell me on the phone that the machine is broken and they basically just looked me at and said nothing with and "oh well " face. If I just wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have came back, so I brought cash with me and they tried to hand me the old curry I ordered had to ask them to make it fresh for me and looked mad about it. Ridiculous!!
