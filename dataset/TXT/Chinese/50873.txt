Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA Straight to the point: Great place and staff (my buddy said drinks are good too), but food sucks big time. I tried PF Chang twice and let just say the chinese food here is just chinese food in name only. Most of the items came out were way salty and just plain not good. I realized that alot of people like PF Chang food and I respect that, but if you like authentic chinese food, this is not the place.
