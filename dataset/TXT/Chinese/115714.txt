*I came to Patois around 11AM and the restaurant wasn't too busy, well at least no 1 hour line up. 

*The vibe was laid back and unpretentious. The decor is quite odd with colorful chairs, inflatable buoys, old photographs and a bright red Juicy Jerk sign - but somehow everything just went together!

*The service was amazing and our server was really attentive. 

-Patois Egg Benny (Cocktail beef patties, poached eggs, jerk mortadella, hollandaise, watercress green salad) - $13
The egg was poached perfectly with a creamy Hollandaise sauce, and the patties were hands down one of the best I have had in a long time. The pastry was super light, tender and flaky with multiple layers. The beef filling was aromatic with a hint of spicy and still moist inside, and who doesn't love that the beef was filled to the max!

-Quinoa breakfast fried rice (bacon, sausage, egg, crispy homefries) - $12
Surprisingly the quinoa tasted just like... regular rice LOL. The fried rice was a bit too salty for my taste which I think came from the Chinese sausage and the fries were too crispy, otherwise the dish was incredibly delicious and flavorful!
