Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw Probably the most "authentic" Chinese restaurant in this area. Could be the decor, but overall, the service was good, food was really good, and I like that they package your leftovers for you. Makes it a little classier. It's slightly pricey for things like soup and fish dishes, but not too bad.   General chicken was delicious, schezuan chicken salad was fabulous, veggie chow mein was so-so. Wish they had brown rice. :)
