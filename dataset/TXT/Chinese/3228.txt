_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Highly recommend people to check it out if you're staying at Venetian and Palazzo. This place is surprisingly authentic, however, very pricey since it is situated inside the hotel.

Service is great, sometimes there's a line, you'll get seated faster with a smaller party. 

I love the beef noodle soup they have. The broth is flavorful with a kick, the noodle is chewy, and the beef is tender. Their fried chicken wings are A+++. It is crispy and juicy, I could not stop eating them. 

They also open till 3am so it's perfect for after clubbing comfort food if you don't want to go far. Will be back for more of those noods!
