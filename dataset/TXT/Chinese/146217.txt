S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A There aren't a ton of Asian restaurants in the valley so of course I was very excited to discover this hand-pulled noodle shop. I stopped in after shopping at Lee Lee's supermarket. The ox-tail noodle soup hand-pulled noodles caught my eye. 

My server was very polite and took my order and also bringing me some hot tea and water. The ambiance is very quaint and traditional looking like Chinese hole in the walls. I got my order and found it to be very delicious, authentic, and hearty. It definitely fulfilled what I was looking for. 

As I paid for my check, I was told that my credit card wasn't working. It appeared that because my credit card had a chip, it was giving them trouble charging it. They asked me if I had any other forms of payment. I only had enough cash to cover my meal, but was only able to give a 5% tip with what I had. I apologized profusely and they told me genuinely that it was okay, and not to worry. 

They are very kind, but I would recommend bringing cash just in case, or another credit card as backup. All in all, a great experience!
