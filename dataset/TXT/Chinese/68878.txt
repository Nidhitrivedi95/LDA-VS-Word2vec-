eW6HLU-M3xJOpGyKLrWxUg My fiance and I stopped in for lunch. It's a small restaurant with very little ambiance: your typical Asian take out restaurant. It was really hot though. No air on and in the 80's outside. We both ordered a lunch special. I had beef and broccoli and he got General Tso's chicken. The eggrolls were meh. Mostly cabbage, not great flavor. I enjoyed the beef and broccoli and it was a good portion size for lunch.  His chicken was overcooked and the sauce was just average. Not a bad experience but we won't likely return.
