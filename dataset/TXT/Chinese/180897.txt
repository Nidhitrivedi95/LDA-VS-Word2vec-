Hua Sang was always known for seafood so it's no surprise that we ordered lobster (lots), clams, squid, shrimps, scallops, oysters, and lots more food. Other than the clams, everything was excellent, including the efficient service. I enjoyed everything but my favourite dish was the sizzling chicken in hot pot.

Highly recommended!
