6MhY_9EkUkKCvvN8rzXZzg I was super excited to eat here but then was a bit let down.

The fountain when you walk in is nice but the rest of the restaurant is pretty run down.

Service was efficient but not very friendly.

Food was the biggest disappointment.

Ordered:
Vegetable Spring Rolls - cheap, came with two small ones, my youngest was happy
Beef Lo Mein - beef had pretty good flavor and texture, good dish
Vegetable Mu Shu - worst flavor of Mu Shu ever had
Vegetable Egg Fu Young - over fried and not that tasty.

I would not choose to go back.
