QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA This is our go to place for Chinese food everytime we go to the airport.  The first time we went the service was terrible, but the great food brought us back.  

We visited the Palace again last night and it was 100% better.  We had a gentlemen as our server and he was humorous and very tentative to our party's needs.  We ordered our food and 5 minutes later we had all four dishes in front of us (fresh and not pre-made).  My personal favorite is Szechwan chicken.  However, everything we had was great.  The food is very good quality Chinese food and it isn't overly greasy.  I love Chinese food, but it doesn't always love me back (if you know what i mean)!   The ambiance is very nice and the noise level is very tolerable. 

When you check-in using the yelp app it says you will receive a free dessert - but they don't honor it for some reason.
