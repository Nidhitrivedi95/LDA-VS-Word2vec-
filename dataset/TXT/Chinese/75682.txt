Came here one evening for a late dinner -- ordered some dumplings, snowpea leaves, noodles, and some bean curd/tofu thing. Food came out reasonably quickly (with the dumplings taking the longest, not surprisingly). It was enjoyable, but nothing particularly special.

My only gripe is that I found everything to be a bit on the saltier side. Everything -- except maybe the dumplings. It just seemed to be really grease/oil-heavy overall. This especially bothers me when it comes to the stir-fried veggies; there's really no need to oversalt them, especially with something as good as snowpea leaves. That I found the place salty does say quite a bit, because I find myself to have a pretty high tolerance for salt compared to most of my compadres. As far as the dumplings go, these are some of the best Chinese dumplings I've had in awhile (personally I've developed more of a liking for Korean dumplings lately).

Service was pretty good as far as Chinese places go.
