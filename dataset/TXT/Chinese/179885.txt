X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Bought pre-sale tickets to both Omnia and Hakkasan. I know there are other techniques to get in, however; I didn't feel like buying bottle service just to have gold diggers drink my alcohol. Getting to the bar was a nightmare, but the dance floor was accessible. The best part was the DJ just randomly started opening a pizza box and handing out pizza. Fun experience but overrated.
