tWtuHpIFtQHMQq8q8DG3dA Love this place. I try to hit it up at least once a week. The joint is Asian based with a Cleveland spin. Do it right, and you'll have yourself a tasty, cheap, and healthy lunch. I have tried most of the menu - love it all. May not be authentic, but then again that is not what they are going for. Perfect for a quick mid-work day lunch or light dinner. Great lunch spot for visitors also.
