2gI7dlktBQXPZiuOW-HWvw I should start with the caveat that I'm giving it four stars considering its location.  Anywhere else (San Francisco, Seattle, etc.) I think it would be just average Chinese food and sushi, but for Arizona I think it's definitely four stars.  The sushi is decent--nothing amazing but it's not bad either.  I've been pleased with the entrees I've tried and the servings are generous.  My family of four usually gets three entrees and a large soup, and we have plenty of leftovers for the next day.
