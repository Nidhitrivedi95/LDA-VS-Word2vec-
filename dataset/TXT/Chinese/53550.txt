cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg On Chinese New Year I craved chinese.. go figure. 

Once again Yelp has not let me down. I got the beef noodle soup and Hubby got the spicy chicken and we split dumplings. When you walk in and you see someone hand making the dumplings then you know its going to be good....

The soup taste like your Chinese grandma's comfort food. It warms the soul, for real. And the dumplings?!?!!? yes....

Now the place isn't very big or super fancy but that's what I expect from a place with amazing food. Home style asian restaurant stuff... sorry I'm from the Bay Area in California and that's what I'm used to. 

Plus the price is amazing!!! 

Over all I'd say : shut up and take my money! Its a five star for sure.
