It starts with the food. This is clean delicious Vietnamese food. I get the Cabbage Appetizer with Tofu and it is unbelievable and healthyish (ok the Tofu is fried). I love the rice paper roll appetizers with plum sauce as well as the Bun (it's pasta, no wait it's a salad, no wait...who mixed my salad and pasta and why do I love it). 

Service service service. The service is fast and efficient. Late to the Cavs game or that show at the H.O.B? You can be in and out with a delicious meal in 30 minutes. Want to drink? Best prices in town!

The best part of eating at Saigon is I always feel fantastic walking out. Riding that natural high that comes from eating great food at a great price.Get your valet ticket stamped, there is usually a few buck discount!!!
