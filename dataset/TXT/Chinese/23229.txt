6sATfFam9_q9uod0I2aCsg I honestly love this dim sum place. The fake "meat" tastes so much like the real meat. I'm not a meat person, but I love dimsum so i have limited options when I go to dimsum places. So this place is great for me. The dim sum is also really fresh. The service is great too! I love the pumpkin filled seasame ball. The outer layer is crispy and the filling is super tasty without it being too sweet. However since this is a vegetarian resturant I would recommend checking to see if it is one of those Buddhist holidays before coming. Because they usually don't eat meat during those days, so it can be quite crowded without reservation.
