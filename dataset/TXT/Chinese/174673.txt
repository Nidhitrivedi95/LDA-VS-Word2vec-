WfgupKdYx1h0mKBmOmNQ3g Ordered twice from this shop, delivery both times. I want to like it, but I can't help but feel like their chicken was frozen? Something about the texture and the dryness was certainly off. I'm no picky eater, But there was certainly something funky about that batch of orange chicken.

twice.
