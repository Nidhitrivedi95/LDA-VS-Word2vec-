pofDmHoIsdvPcSKzb2iMag Sky Dragon was busy when I visited for lunch today. Although it was busy, the 5 of us were seated within 10 minutes. It's a little difficult to find this place. When you walk into the mini mall, immediately turn right and take the elevator up (or walk, because the small elevator gets packed!).

The push-cart dim sum was not that great, even for the low price ($2 per dish). They have the usual fare that they have at all other dim sum places. We had the radish cake, deep fried taro, shrimp/beef in rice rolls, shumai, shrimp dumplings, etc. I've had way better dim sum in the GTA (#GTARocks).
