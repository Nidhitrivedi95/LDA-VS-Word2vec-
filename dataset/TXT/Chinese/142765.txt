RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw Left here having mixed feelings. We dropped by at 8pm on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was crowded. Although the restaurant was bustling, we waited for only about 10 minutes before we got a table for 2. It was nice to see that the restaurant let parties of 2 sit in booths that easily sat 4. Most smaller parties sat to the corners, while the larger parties sat in the middle of the restaurant. 

We were pretty much salivating at what we saw at the larger tables, so our expectations rose with every passing minute! All of the larger party tables had typical shared family style entrees on their tables. Unfortunately, since we were only 2 people, we couldn't order the breadth of what those large parties had on their tables, but we went with the item we saw the most on yelp, the Lobster with Ginger & Green Onion Chow Mein! We also ordered a side of Chinese Broccoli as well.

To sum it up, the Lobster Chow Mein was disappointing. All of the disappointment was attributed to the fact that the noodle was too soft and chewy.  It was an obvious sign that the Chow Mein was not fried enough. Good Chow Meins consist of crispy fried noodles and this had none of that.The lobster was good though and there was plenty of it in the order! The ginger flavor of the lobster meshed very well with the noodle, which sort of helped save the disappointing noodles. 

Some other observations we had were that, like many Chinese restaurants in North America, the service was quick and swift, but not extremely friendly. Also, the parking lot outside was pretty small, but spots opened up quickly.
