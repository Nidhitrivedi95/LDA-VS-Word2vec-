YjPWt-V5oMkakdRWrALb8g Literally one of our go-to places for a light snack (all the steamed buns have been great, and the bahn mi was delicious), a frequent for "takeout Chinese"dinner too, and the absolute BEST bubble tea/smoothies we've found in Charlotte! Only downside is it can take a while sometimes if it's crowded, so if your in a hurry I recommend calling ahead. Or if you're not in a hurry, then use the time to browse all the amazing selection of Asian/Hispanic/European groceries they carry at Super G Mart.
