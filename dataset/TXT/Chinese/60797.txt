dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ With a previous night of drunken debauchery in Sin City - Vegas we leave our beautiful suite at Palazzo and look for some good sober-up yet cold-weather warming food. Votes in - and THAI food it is! But where? So I remember heading out to Chinatown in a prior visit to Vegas a couple months back at Kung Fu! CHEAP, GOOD, and did I mention...GOOD!
So 15 minutes later we're there and were seated promptly. Luckily, it was already after lunchtime  so we didn't encounter any wait time. 
We all chose to order dishes and share the portions. Tom Yum (HOT - of course), Pad Thai, some beef salad, and shrimp fried rice! 
The guys were digging the food but like myself, they agreed the service was aiiiiight! Could have been better (hence the 4 stars). SO - if you're in vegas and have a hankerin' for some Thai/Chinese (good decent and reminiscent of SGV style) hit Kung Fu up! It'll make you say...."HAAAAY YA!" LOL!
