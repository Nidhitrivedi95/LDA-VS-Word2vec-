I always order the duck and roasted pork combo and it's only $11.99. The duck is pretty good too but just a little bit too greasy. 

I also tried their noodles and it's okay. I like how you can customize your toppings and which noodles you would want. 

Honestly just stick with the roasted pork and duck and you're set!
