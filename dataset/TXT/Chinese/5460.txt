0BFzeEDYXR_w9Ni6qNj9OQ We ordered 12 spring rolls, chicken balls and 2 beef dishes...I can say I have never had spring rolls that I could wring the grease out, Bravo. I don't believe putting 12 spring rolls, and 6 chicken balls right from the fryer into a paper bag and nothing more, was the best idea. The only thing I can say is that the delivery guy is super quick cause the oil dripping from the bag was still super hot and almost burnt myself, A+ for him.

Will never be order from these guys again, unless I feel like getting 2nd degree burns on my next New Years.
