13ngZbrJVhnngzhc-MlXYg YES, I want me some take out chinese.

I was actually walking to another restaurant that was closed on Tuesdays so I was already bummed and was starving.  Once you walk in you can see large pictures of their menu.  (I think all places should have real pictures of their food.)

This is comfort food that has the right amount of grease (which did not seem old) and not too salty.  Had the Beef Chow Fun and once I ordered it the cashier barked out the order in cantonese to old school short order cooks in their greased up whites, I knew this place could be for real.  Especially since I am from Texas and everything there is made by our amigos...

My order took less than 5 minutes - as it should with a hotass wok.  

I will be back.
