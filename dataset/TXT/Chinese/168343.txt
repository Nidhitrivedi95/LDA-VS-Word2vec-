Voy_shxcm2YnHQOtfUj1KQ Worse restaurant I have ever been to. I'll give it that the combo fried rice was okay but when we got our half roasted duck and it was incredibly over cooked. IT WAS BLACK. I am not joking as I state that. I have never had badly cooked duck before.
The service was definitely negative stars, the waitress paid more attention to the damn television. We also never got our water. We don't even get that?! Really?! Over priced for what they serve. Even if it was half the price I would still never ever try their food again. The table cover was also filthy. They can't even change their table covers? Nothing amazing or good about this place. Everyone else that has reviewed this restaurant to be exceedingly horrible are not exaggerating. IT'S TRUE. You might as well save your money and head to McDonalds or something. Uncaring employees, especially with their food. I can't believe this business is even open. 
DON'T GO HERE.
