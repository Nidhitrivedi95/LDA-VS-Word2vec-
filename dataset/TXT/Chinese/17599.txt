4t_RBsTtU7hhVYJweh46Uw I've dined at this establishment many times and love this place. The food is good and price is great. Before, for Chinese fast food dining I use to go to Richmond Court, I found Richmond Court was too greasy, and quality and presentation below average. Decorations inside this restaurant gives it character, and the high ceiling certainly improves the dining experience.
My favourites: fish cooked in clay pot, rice noodle with beef, beef brisket in clay pot (these are not correct names from menu - just from my memory)
Service is above average for a Chinese restaurant establishment, certainly leaps and bounds better than Richmond Court. Be warned that it can get very busy during Friday and Saturday dinner.
