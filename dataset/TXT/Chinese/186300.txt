YaEPtPnEqh3WSsGq7cL44Q Great little family owned spot, I had the ginormous eggrolls, fried rice and beef with broccoli. My rice was pretty greasy and my beef was just OK, the eggrolls were a meal in itself, maybe it was an of night when I went but everything was just "OK", I may give them another shot on another night.......IF they're actually open for business.
