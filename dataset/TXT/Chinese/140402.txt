r6WO_jkx4rkMMauvPvMDeQ 8/12/17 I Order the personal dinner with orange chicken . IT WASNT worth the MONEY . The orange chicken didnt have enough flavor it seem like frozen food and wasnt fresh . The egg roll was smell and it was vegetable and I asked for one with meat . The delivery guy was nice & polite . He arrived a few mintues early
