IcnJlauqhHfelo_qp9uKuw First and last visit . Ordered Kung Pao Chicken lunch. It comes with soup and unfortunately a smelly soup spoon. Rice didn't taste fresh and was mushy. The chicken in the Kung Pao didn't have the right consistency, seemed undercooked. The sauce tasted great and the veggies were crisp. Soda only in cans. My preference is fountain, so no fault there. The egg roll that came with my lunch was crispy, hot and tasted great! I just wish I could say the same for the soup, rice and entree.
