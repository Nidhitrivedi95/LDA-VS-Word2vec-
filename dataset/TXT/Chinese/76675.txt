Their wine and beer prices were super cheap, but would have been even cheaper if we weren't using the coupon (can't be used in conjunction with their awesome happy hour prices). We ordered the spicy tuna, Philadelphia, Tiffany, Phoenix, spicy salmon, and Arizona rolls. Our waiter informed us that appetizers are 99 cents if you order a roll, so we got an order of edamame, gyoza, spring rolls, and crab puffs. He walked away and I immediately began freaking about how tiny my stomach is versus the amount of food we just ordered. I figured I should maybe stop drinking my wine to save room for the sushi. Spoiler alert: I didn't.

Our appetizers came out and they were small and standard tasting, which we were okay with since they weren't even a dollar each. But our sushi came out and WOAH. Looking delicious atop a large bridge with a glowing plastic ice cube in the middle, I could barely get a picture before we started in on it all. The fish tasted fresh and, even more importantly, I could actually taste the fish. I can't tell you how many times I've gone places that do a Philly roll with a little bit of salmon and a LOT of cucumber and cream cheese. Iron Chef did not disappoint. The flavors complimented each other nicely in their Phoenix, Tiffany, and Arizona rolls especially. 

We did note that their wasabi really lacked the normal spiciness. My friend spent so long adding more and more wasabi to his soy sauce, trying to get to his normal heat, that I nearly Hoovered all his rolls. 

In the end, when the others gave up on their sushi, I finished it. All. Next time, we're coming back during happy hour. I want more of that Tiffany roll.
