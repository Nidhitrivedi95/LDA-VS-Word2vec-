Their pakora are awesome.  The tangra chicken is seasoned the same way as the pakora and equally delicious.  Their chilli chicken isn't anything to write home about though.  The crispy beef is a better and tasty substitute.  People at the counter have always been nothing but kind and courteous to me and other members of my family that frequent this for pretty regular weekend takeout.
