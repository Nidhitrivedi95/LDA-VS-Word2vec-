xyskSLRWf5ixBWSYk5hnDQ Anyone who doesn't love this place has got to be a little bit crazy in the head!  I absolutely love the Mongolian BBQ/Stir Fry type places, so this was right up my alley.

The first thing you will notice when you come here is that it's not YC's.  The slices of meat are thicker.  The veggies are fresher and more plentiful.  The restaurant is actually bright and very clean.  Most of all, you will probably notice a lack of a chalkboard with a gazillion hand written recipes telling you how to make a sauce.  Instead, you will find the totally sweet owner standing behind the counter asking you what flavors you're looking for.  Then he'll suggest the amounts of each "sauce" you should add to get what you want.  They take their time here to cook your food, not just fling it around and make a mess.  They even place it in a nicer serving dish than just a bowl.  Nice touch.

Aside from the fantastic food, that literally bursts with fresh flavor, THIS PLACE HAS CHINESE DONUTS!!!!!! Woot!  I was so excited!  I was really disappointed however to notice that they were all out by the time I went to get some.  However, when the owner stopped by and asked how everything was, I mentioned my sadness and he quickly threw together a batch and brought me a napkin full of them to take home.  How sweet is that?!  I absolutely love this place and I look for any and every excuse to come here.
