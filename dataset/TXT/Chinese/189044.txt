yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA The worst restaurant in all of Vegas. Warning, stay away from this place. When we first arrived we were  rudely greeted by a big hispanic guy dressed in black clothes with an ear phone like he's a club bouncer. We asked for a table for 6 and there were literally 15 empty tables everywhere and hr told us we had to wait. Really? Then finally after 10 minutes he sat us down at 1 of the 15 empty tables. Next we waited at least another 15 minutes just to get water. Then another 10 minutes to order food. 

The food sucks too. Stay awya
