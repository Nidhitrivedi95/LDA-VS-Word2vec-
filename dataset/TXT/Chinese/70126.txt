f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ Hit and miss sums up this place.  Some of the dishes were great and fresh like the lotus leaf rice and the coconut buns other dishes were not so fresh. The ha-gow was very dry and rubbery and the BBQ pork buns did not have much for flavor. Food carts came around often with great verity. Staff was friendly and most spoke English well. The restaurant appeared very clean and prices were average.
