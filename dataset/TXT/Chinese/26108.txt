7OKQ4ENVfPfxtDqFOG7x0g this food is cheap for a reason.  The egg rolls are floury, the fried rice was cold and tasteless and although the veggies in the vegetable lo mein were crisp and fresh, it was so full of garlic you couldn't even taste them.  The location is on a grimy street although the restaurant is clean and fairly quiet.  There are so many chinese restaurants in Madison, I don't know why anyone would go to this one.
