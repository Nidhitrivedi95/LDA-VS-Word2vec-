LbeJgPgKKHw5qH0f02NHEQ Chinatown Inn hasn't changed its decor or menu since I've started coming here, it hasn't changed since my mom and dad started coming here, and it's not likely to change anytime soon.  And that's the way we all like it.

I came here with some of my union brothers and sisters after a training seminar.  We all had a hankering for some good old Americanized Chinese food and few other places around here could satisfy our cravings.  We all started out with some soups (I tried the egg flower-delicious) followed by a mix of appetizers such as vegetable rolls and steamed vegetable hand-rolled dumplings.  I went for the broccoli chicken, but we all did a little family style sharing of our dishes.  So we all did a little sampling of ginger and garlic shrimp, curry roast pork, and some vegetarian dishes.

It was a great evening with some great colleagues.  Oh and my fortune cookie?  It said "You are a person most generous.  Pay the check."
