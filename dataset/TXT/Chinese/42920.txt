beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw We were expecting more from this restaurant after reading the reviews.  We ordered the wagyu beef and ribeye.  Do not order the wagyu.  It was totally not worth it.  The meat was chewy and looked more like bacon where half of it was pure fat.  There was no marbling of the fat and the pieces were so tiny!  The ribeye was very good and that was worth the price.  The side dishes on the conveyor belt were not very appealing.  We only chose the green leafy veggies to add to our hot pot.  The spicy broth was very spicy so I would recommend the least spicy of the choices.  Will we go back?  I don't think so.
