yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Yeah, who woulda thought a place called Pho Kim Long would actually deliver. Every time someone would tell me they liked this place, I just laughed inside thinking there's just no way I can take a place with such a name seriously.
I came back here for a second try, since for my first try I wasn't in the right mind set at 3a.m. to be making any type of accurate judgement call. I just HAD to come back and double check. 

I went back here for lunch, and the broth is by far my favorite for pho in Vegas. My faith was in viet noodle bar when they first opened, but they've gone downhill for me over the past year. Annie pho is also popular, but I never enjoyed their pho broth much either.

DON'T STOP, PHO KIM LONG, cuz you da bomb.
