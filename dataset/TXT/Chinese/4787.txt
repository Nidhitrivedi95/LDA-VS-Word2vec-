_xt4ZyvtgY8Xu_O6SpSB5A I have developed a serious love for this place. There are days where we need to remind ourselves not to go back so soon..

In the times I've been there, they definitely did not disappoint. 

They're quick, clean, and the food is authentic! 

The portions are huge! Where in Mississauga can you get non-westernized, authentic, Chinese food for under $10 a plate?

Their congee - hearty, not at all watery, lots of meat/seafood. I've always stuck with my two favs; Lean pork w/ preserved egg and salted egg, or seafood congee. Huge difference compared to Congee Dynasty, Sam Woo and Emerald. 

Rice and Noodle dishes are great too. 

We tend to think with our stomachs when we order, and because of the large portions, we always end up with boxes of takeout for the next day. 
 
Beware: If you visit on a weekend, or even during peak dinner times during the week, this place will be packed and you're in for a wait. 
If you're super hungry, didn't come with a large group and don't mind adopting the 'Dap Toi' sharing table practice, you'll be sure to be seating before everyone else. It's a common practice in restaurants of Asian culture. 

And again, as my fellow yelpers have mentioned, cash only!
