3WKPtBiuph0SelrE9COngA This place is awesome.  Huge amount of food for the price you pay.  We always go home with leftovers.  Lunch specials are pretty much the same as the dinner potion, just cheaper!

They are very fast and everything is fresh-made--not sitting in a pan ready to heat up for you.  The employees are very nice and patient when you can't make up your mind.

This is my new favorite fast-food chinese place!

UPDATE:  The owners of this restaurant have changed.  The four star rating is only applicable to the previous owners.  I might update it if I ever go back.  The new owners say the food is the same, but it's not.  The previous owners were much more personable and knew what you liked and how you liked it prepared.
