t-LnJne10SHAWATKYdQdJQ Came here with a huge group the other evening and we were promptly seated. The servers were great and we got started right away. This is the second Huhot I've been to and I didn't have high expectations since it is just a chain make-your-own creation buffet. That being said, I thought this place did a great job,  from the little show the chefs put on with plate balancing to the freshness of the options. There was a good stock of pork, beef, chicken, and imitation seafood. One piece of advice I would give is that to ensure you have a tasty plate, definitely do not skimp on the sauces. I would go with their recommendation of 5-6 ladles of sauce to really get the flavors in. All of the different sauce options are great and you can mix and match! Also, if you're not a big fan of continually trying new combinations and just want a meal, grab two bowls at a time -they'll throw them together for you. Overall a decent place I'd come back to.
