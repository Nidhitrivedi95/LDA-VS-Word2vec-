1uPQTz5XZSWr0ti7kUpaDw Dumplings galore!!! This tiny Chinatown joint serves up Montreal's best dumplings. They come either boiled or pan-fried, with pork, beef, lamb and seafood offerings. A variety of secondary ingredients are offered with each one and as well as vegetarian choices. I love the pork, oyster and pickled Chinese cabbage and it is the best when pan-fried. Really brings out the flavoring of the oyster. 

I also tried the pork, leek and egg dumpling and that I would recommend as well.

I only wish they served tea here.
