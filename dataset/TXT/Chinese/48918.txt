CbAZZVel3mXEUepuqtn_0w We have been ordering from Red Rose for 20 years. The food is delicious, fresh and perfectly seasoned
 I think that the ownership may have changed and the menu has increased to include newer fusion type items.  We have tried other Markham chinese take out places which are good but Red Rose is still the best!
