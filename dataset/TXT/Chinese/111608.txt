M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g Decided to try this place out to see if it would be any different than the regular Chinese places in Chinatown. Big place, very spacious, not cramped at all (similar to LA Chinese restaurants). Came here for lunch, ordered the items off their special menu. Portion arent too bad but could be bigger, taste is good. They definitely put in some work in making each dish taste good! 

They have a large selection of seafood if thats what youre looking for. Next time going to try their other dishes!

Check it out!
