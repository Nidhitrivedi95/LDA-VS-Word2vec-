ze-xCiBLB-QSfNXHiPY5Qw Been here a number of times, good time to write a review. 

I usually come here around lunch time and their lunch specials are pretty good price-wise because their portion sizes are large. Sometimes I even have leftovers. 
Dishes I've tried:

~Cantonese Chow Mein: A lot of the time when I order this dish in other places, the noodles are way too greasy. From this restaurant however, the noodles were the right texture and flavor and not greasy but it had the perfect amount of the "sauce" if you will. Vegetables in the dish were flavored nicely, and there was a generous amount of them and the chicken. 
~House Special Pad Thai Rice Noodle: I order pad thai a lot. It's one of my favourite dishes to eat. It didn't look like your typical authentic pad thai dish, but hey there may be different versions of it that I don't know about. (I'm no food expert). I think that overall there was more of the noodle than any of the other ingredients, but the flavours were delicious. 
~Pork Chop w/ Sweet and Sour Sauce: I really enjoyed this dish. Flavours were great. Generous portion of the rice and pork. Tasted authentic. Not much more to say about a great dish. 
~Dinner for Three: 3 Egg Rolls,  Chicken Mixed Vegetables, Sweet and Sour Pork , Beef with Mushroom, Steamed Rice, 3 Fortune Cookies: Overall my family and I really enjoyed this meal. This was enough food to feed all 5 of us. Again, great flavours, and everything was just cooked well and just right. 

The restaurant itself has a nice peaceful atmosphere. TVs if you want. Very clean and presentable.
