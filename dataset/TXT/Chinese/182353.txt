XIX4xuzrt3IzvjX9MtHr9g I am extremely disappointed with this place. Their large entrees that cost 10.50 don't come with any rice or anything on the side. And the large can be considered a small. 

I ordered the shrimp and garlic which had no flavor at all. I had to order a side of some sort for a separate barge. They didn't have brown rice and I ended up getting mushroom chowmain which was cooked with no effort. It was practically raw. 

Very very overpriced! $40 for Chinese food should go a long way. However all I had was two entrees and lo mein. 
I wouldn't recommend this place.
