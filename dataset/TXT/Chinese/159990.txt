U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Located inside Caesar Palace. I like the ambiance with white steel carved white decor and huge tank of gold fish. I am surprised to find the meal pretty appetizing despite the bad reviews. I can understand the price is pretty high and the service is not the best but I liked what we ordered. We had 
- Beijing pancake that consists of honey BBQ pork pancake;
Clay pot beef tendon and 
Chicken mushroom with hand pulled noodle which was tasty. They charged $5 each for hot tea and also $4 for a bowl of rice.. They should have that free accompanied the meal. I may be back.
