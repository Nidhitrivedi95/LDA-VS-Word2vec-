K3J4zvnQ_G1d5xfffPf2Wg I've never really been a fan of Chinese food, and I don't know if this qualifies as Chinese food, but this place rocks my socks. I love the menu and the options are very easy to choose from. Very tasty, and I love the flavor in each bowl. The tea variety is alsoA cherry on top. We will definitely be back again. Had a Groupon so that helped, otherwise it is a little bit pricey hence minus one star
