jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw Craved for Chinese Food after a late night shift (10pm). This place is open until 5am! Score. Went here with a friend who actually recommended this place for being good & inexpensive. 

Fish maw soup... Delicious! Sautéed greens... Amazing! Special fried rice... Scrumptious! And half duck... crispy goodness. To top it off the service was amazing! Very friendly & attentive :) Defiantly will be coming back... What more can you ask for? Friendly staff, good food & amazing prices
