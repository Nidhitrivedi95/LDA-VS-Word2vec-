BsyNabKZJOVIHWmwUghreg one of my favourite restaurants, i love the all you can eat menu. the staff is very accomodating- my 'date' didnt want to do all you can eat while i wanted and the server accomodated that request. also, once i found some kind of a pit in my food and i got the meal for free. food is soooo delicious! i love spring rolls!!
