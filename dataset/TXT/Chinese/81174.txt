GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg Ok, it's a big jump from my last review, and I know I said it was my last time going, but what can I say?  We really did love this place. 

So I got rid of my jerk face (yes, that is an adult term) fiancé but we decided to stay friends- because that idea always works.  So, for old time sake we wanted go back to "our spot" for a friendly dinner.  Keeping up with the T.M.I. of this story, we got into a huge argument at the restaurant, and we haven't spoken since, but that aside...

The food was GREAT!  As I mentioned in my last review we would go to this place 2-3x's/week so when the wait staff saw us walk in, when we hadn't been there for nearly 3 months, they treated us like royalty.  

We were seated at the best seat in the house- at the beginning of the conveyor belt where you can see the rolls being made AND you get first dibs on fresh ones.  Our crab puff appetizers came out within just a few minutes and were so hot I had to let mine cool off.  They remembered that we ordered rolls with soy paper and the waitress even remembered one of the rolls we always got.  The seaweed salad off the belt was crisp and cold, the rolls were cold too.  But best of all, our special order of soy paper sushi rolls came out just as ordered and all of our food came out together.  WE ACTUALLY GOT TO EAT OUR DINNER AT THE SAME TIME!  

Thanks Seksun for redeeming yourself.  I will be back soon.  And next time I will be jerk face free.
