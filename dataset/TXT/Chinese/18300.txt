5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A I love Thai house. This is mine and my fiancée  favorite Thai place, we've been coming for years. Back in the day I always played it safe with pad Thai and lemon chic but now we've expanded to the Tom nam soup, freah rolls, spicy eggplant mint, duck curry, Kung pao, spicy chili mint and red curry. I can't say one bad thing. Everything tastes awesome!! Flavorful, spicy and hot. Adding fried tofu to any dish makes a great veggie option for all of us vegetarians. A must for all Thai lovers!
