a5xUI7TvsNhM5gZr6KowDg Been here a few times now, usually when I'm headed to the mall or to Gabes. 

The lunch menu is reasonably priced and the portions are very generous! Some of the things that we have sampled include the egg rolls, coconut shrimp, pork dumplings, amazing chicken, and Singapore noodles. 

Everything is well made and comes out of the kitchen quickly. Service is always great and the tea is also delicious! 

Can't wait to go back!
