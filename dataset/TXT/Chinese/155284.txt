TjuSHnbPtB83R-1FzdBBgA I have had their Sushi and last night their red curry. Both times I have not been disappointed. Food is fresh with lots of flavour. Service is also excellent and staff very friendly staff treats patrons like they want you there( which for some reason is really hard to find in most Newmarket eateries always puzzles me?!) This will be my go to place for Asian cuisine:)
Thanks for a good meal!
