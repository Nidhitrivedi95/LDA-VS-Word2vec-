BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I've been frequenting this restaurant for years, and quality has plummeted recently. The service is the absolute worst, where we waited an hour for our food, which did not come out fresh. The pancakes were dry and the soup dumplings had no soup inside. Do not waste your time or money here. The staff doesn't even care about this experience, and encouraged me to write this review instead of resolving this negative experience. WOW.
