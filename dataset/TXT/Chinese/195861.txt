ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg There's something about Congee Queen that makes me lose my mind. As in, I completely forget about propriety and stuff my face until I have to be rolled out of there lest I burst right there in the restaurant out of fullness.  It's their fault for serving food that's so goddamned tasty. 

First, the House Super Bowl Congee is the bomb. I'm usually a chicken congee kind of gal, but the House Super Bowl has changed my mind. The seafood in the bowl is always tender and never fishy. My next favorite dish is the Seafood and mixed vegetable Taiwanese vermicelli. I'm drooling just thinking of the tender shrimp and noodles, with bits of scrambled egg. The portions are gigantic, but we order family style and over-order so that we can have delicious leftovers the next morning.

Luckily, the food here is served fast -- it's the waiting around for a table that can be a bear. This location is less crowded than the one in Thornhill, so you'll have less of a wait, but it'll still be at least 15 minutes for a table. Use that time to think about all the delicious congee you'll practically pour down your gullet. Yum.
