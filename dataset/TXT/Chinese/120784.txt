O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw This is our go to dim sim place, always good food,fast service and good value. 

There are usually line ups on the weekends, but don't be discouraged, they seat you fairly quickly, and it's worth the wait. 

Dim sum is ordered through a menu that you check off, very simple, but not the standard style of cartts moving around the dining room. 

Love the fried  squid tentacles!!  mm mmm mmm!

This place is very consistent, i'll always be back
