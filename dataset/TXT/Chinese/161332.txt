Ue2H-ajY-uBKwGoBDQutCA First time here, wasn't gona step in cuz reviews here are horrific lol but my boy eats here on a regular said it was good so I tried esp cuz it was his treat lol portions were hefty but food is flavorless. With sauce would be ok but they didn't give me any and I forgot to ask o_O no red sauce and no duck sauce n no soy sauce? Come on mannnn

Like it literally tasted like nothing lol which isn't baaaaaad but Def not good lol atleast it wasn't a lot of bad tasting food?

I'll go again if someone wants to go, I'd only recommend if you live in the area and are on a budget then yes.
