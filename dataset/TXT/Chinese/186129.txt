Y6Vw0FF8Qz9XD8fY4Z9Vfg Hands down, five stars, the best boba in AZ.  New owners make complete turn-around from Lollicup.  Boba is cooked perfectly each time.  They taste their drinks before serving.  I come at least once a week, and the quality is consistent every time. 

Personal favorite: honey milk green tea
