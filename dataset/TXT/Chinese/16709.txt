She would have an attitude and shake her head when I would ask for some mustard sauce to go. A couple of times ago I got in an argument with Marsha about getting mustard sauce. I have never argued with a server or manager before. I told her that I would happily pay for the sauce even though you get it free when you eat in the restaurant. 
Each time we order to go there it is a battle. 
This time I said on the phone to include it so there would be no surprises and so she could charge me if she felt she needed to. I got my order and she said the mustard sauce was in the bag. I knew it wasn't so I asked for additional. She shook her head, said something in a different language and got the mustard sauce.  I got home and as I predicted there was no mustard sauce in the bag other than the additional ones I went back for. 
It's not like this sauce is difficult to include, it is in plastic to go containers. I really don't understand it. 
I do know that I will not be back.
