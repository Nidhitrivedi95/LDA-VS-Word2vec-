wShT0KXCW0ZAnNKdJr_1pg I'm updating my review and giving Panda two more stars for their additional of more shrimp dishes on the menu!  I've been getting the Panda Bowl with Peppercorn Shrimp lately - and I have to admit, it's pretty tasty. Like the fact that this dish is made with asparagus as the main veggie ingredient along with the shrimp. More please!
