ZL9sk7Imc42BNRhcjgnqPw It was a Sunday, it was late, and I was desperate. After my first 3 choices (including Kazu- insert sad face) were either closed or unfindable, I stumbled upon this place. I asked an exiting patron how the food was. She said it was good, cheap, and recommended the eggplant dish. I entered. I had the eggplant dish (#36) and steamed dumplings. The dumplings were mediocre. I've made better tasting ones at home. The eggplant dish was fine, but again, I've had much better Asian eggplant dishes. It was a large serving with huge chunks of fried tofu. I found the sauce to be bland. The service was cut and dry at first, but he eventually warmed up a bit. With all the other great options around here, I would not eat here again.
