Not as much oil used as a lot of Chinese restaurants use nowdays and the dishes seem to have more veggies, good flavor and generous portions. Try the Mah-la chicken, spicy and oh so good! Mu Shu is always good too. The owner Kenny is a nice guy and appreciates his customers, I get take out here a lot.
