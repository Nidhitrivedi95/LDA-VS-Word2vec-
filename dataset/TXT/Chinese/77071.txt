GdnLwnezKcZwoP-fnVtPNg This particular Panda Express has my favorite pepper chicken with celery, so kudos to that! Also I sampled their orange chicken and it was actually good. It wasn't too sweet or too saucy or anything like other locations. I love their white fried rice too! A good location when your in the mood for Americanized Chinese fast food!
