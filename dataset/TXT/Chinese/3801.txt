_mkObKf2FTg4pRcCFZBf4w Parents insisted we come here when they saw the newspaper advertisement for $11.99 per person. Food was quite terrible and everything was drowned in either sauce or oil. Best item here hands down is the ice cream but it's the generic ice cream found at sushi buffets anyways. I would recommend others to go to a McDonald's for a better meal in terms of cost and taste.
