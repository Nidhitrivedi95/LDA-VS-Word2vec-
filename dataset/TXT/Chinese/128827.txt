PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ We went to this restaurant, today, based on the reviews.  The only negative I had read was one that referred to the slow service.  I figured that was out weighed by the great reviews on the food.  The food was awful and the service was terrible.  The waitress, instead of believing the customer was right, argued with us and didn't give us our change.  We will never go back there again and I don't recommend it to anyone!
