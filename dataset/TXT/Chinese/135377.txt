QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ Yes.. Awesome steamed dumplings!! In search for Toronto's Xiao Long Baos - I stumbled upon Yummy in the downtown Chinatown... Apparently for actual XLBs there's another Chinatown but that was farther out and will have to wait for another trip. Anyway this place was very clean and had a variety of dumpling options..

We tried the fried chicken and cabbage dumplings and the steamed pork and chubs dumplings.... So they make all the dumplings in house you can watch throuj the glass... Interesting enough they have the option of boiled or steamed... Usually in Ny they seem to be one in the same and generally mean boiled but here steamed were cooked like the XLBs...

Both dumplings were really good small tho but they give u a good amount...
