I have NEVER been so discriminated in my life at any business until I went here. I went with a group of friends to check out their nightclub and upon entrance the bouncer pulled me aside asked me my name where I lived then ACCUSED me of being on drugs cause my eyes were big. I have natural big eyes. Next he ACCUSED me of being too fucked up and I can never enter the club again. I was sober and told him to breathalyze me or do a drug test and I'll test negative. He refused and just kicked me out. He said I was walking weird, I'm pidgeon toed! He was then mocking me with my big eyes by opening his eyes wide and talking really slowly like as if I'm stupid. 

I have never ever felt so discriminated. Hakkasan ruined my experience and I am NEVER coming back here. If you're in vegas looking for a club to enter please go to Marquee or XS. This club needs to enforce better bouncers.
