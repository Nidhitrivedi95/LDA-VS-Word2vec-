qqU3d8IpcIw2BJrsGxSL9Q I totally agree with Ann R. I also went to the Square one location. I come here a least twice a week.  Bad service. The service is horrible. I come to this place a least a couple of times a week. Today the cashier, (its usually this one).  I'm not going to say her name but it begins with a J.  She is really rude. She treats people who are Cantonese speaking in a very disrespectfully.  I see her treat Caucasian customers and theirs who speak mandarin extra nice. I seen this myself and with a friend of mine who spoke mandarin to her and there is a big difference.Today was the worst with her she deliberately severed someone else before me even though I was ahead of them in line. The service is bad with most of the other staff too One star I wish I could give no stars.
