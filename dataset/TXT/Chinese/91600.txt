ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg This is the first time I've experienced an actual authentic Chinese restaurant. I only ordered one dim sum dish that was pretty tasty. My Main course was the szechuan chicken and my friends dish was the Thai curry chicken. I requested the dish to be extra spicy which it was not, nor was it even slightly spicy at all. In the end when we were paying for our meals separately and they charged us an extra 10$ (5$ a piece) for no apparent reason. We asked about it and two waitress tried to argue there was no mistake. One tried to say its for taxes. There's no such thing as 5$ for taxes with 10-15 dollar dishes. Eventually another waitress came by and said its wrong, which after we got 5$ each in cash for being over charged. Besides the non spicy dish I ordered and being overcharged, I MIGHT come here again, just for the "authentic" experience. **Make sure you're not overcharged.
