The food was pretty good, I would give it 5 stars but you get the same typical service at any other dim sum places... so 4 stars :) The ladies that push the cart aren't hasty or pushy but the server brings your water and is gone forever. No biggie to me actually, I'm use to it. Didnt see any roasted pork and the shrimp balls didn't have the flakey wonton breading. Spicy salty shrimp was not spicy, salty nor crispy like I'm use too. One bonus tho, the roasted duck wasn't too greasy. 

Great way to get the family together for brunch :)
