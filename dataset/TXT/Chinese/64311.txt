e7M2GgkCfDYTxdPN1LL1sQ I've ate here extensively and have to say I still love them.  Food is great.  Everything I've tried so far has been good.  Their Beef Chow Fun could be better but good enough.  My go to is Crab Rangoon, Chicken-on-a-stick, egg drop soup, Lo Mein, and my new favorite Young Chow Fried Rice.  I've been ordering online and having it delivered too though they just added more fees.  There is a minimum order, a delivery charge, now an online order charge.  Overall, still a good place to eat.  My favorite Chinese food place so far in the city.

I want to give 1 star to their boba drinks.  They suck.  Their boba is undercooked and has no flavor.  *hint* add some brown sugar when cooking.  Also, the one kid that made it for me gave me a drink that was lukewarm.  Seriously,  I had to ask for them to add ice to it.  Luckily their food is still good.
