U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Located on the main ground floor of Caesar's Casino, close to the registration desk. The restaurant features very extensive selection of traditional Chinese dishes, including large selection of noodles-based dishes. When you order food, you get a choice of using pre-made noodles, or asking for the noodles freshly made right in front of your eyes - similar bad experience as traditional sushi restaurant. I had seafood noodle soup  Shangai style, and it was delicious - perfect amount of spice, not too salty, flavorful broth, honest amound of seafood with fresh shrimp and scallops. Also had a selection of Mochi for dessert - delicious, especially the red bean (vanilla and green tea were excellent too). All in all, excellent meal at a very reasonable price for the prime Las Vegas casino. 
Friendly and helpful service. 
Definitely recommended.
