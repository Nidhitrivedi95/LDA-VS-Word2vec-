-cuzw1pcZ_UcdA4Qxc5YYg Ahhh, a delectable new little gem in my hood. Just had the lamb pilaf here and must say the flavors are sublime and portions surreptitiously generous. Service is genuinely friendly and welcoming. I'm generally not a big fan of northern Chinese cuisine, but I'll definitely be back for more of their Northwest Chinese inspired menu for sure. Right now, the place is still new and undiscovered, and although I'd like it to stay that way, I doubt that will happen if their standards hold. An A+ adventure from the Food B for sure...

Venture forth my fellow foodies!
