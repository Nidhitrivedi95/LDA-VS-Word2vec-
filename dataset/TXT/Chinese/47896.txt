C16dsL_IEOb5UzRWYhxiKw The food is pretty good. The prices are great. They don't deliver but, the take out is fast - about 10 minutes. Sometimes it is hard to communicate with the employees but if you don't need a million things changed in your order you should be fine. I have always been happy with my food
