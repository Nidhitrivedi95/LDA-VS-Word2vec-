szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A I have eaten at the Great Wall a few times now but always part of a banquet or function. So this might not apply for a regular experience. Most of my Chinese friends and organizations have functions there so I am assuming that the local Chinese believe that this is good food.  Food is very good and plenty of it.  Love that creamy shrimp,carrots and walnut appetizer. Duck is good. Mushroom dish is very tasty. Service can be slow but when a couple of hundred are in the room, you can't expect them to be perfect. 

I have yet to try the dim sum but have heard from my Chinese friends that is the best in Phoenix.
