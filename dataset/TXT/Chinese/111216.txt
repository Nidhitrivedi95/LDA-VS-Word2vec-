M4JY5zYBcDoudg9HGc6mEg I went to Janelle as a first timer with acupuncture and it was simply amazing.  Not only is her office welcoming, calming, and professional, but she is very well educated and down-to-earth.  I never felt more comfortable in a situation that was new to me.  I went to her 3 times on a one-week vacation to Arizona, and it seemed to drastically help my sinus and stomach issues.  I wish I could pick her up and move her home with me!  
I will definitely make a point to visit The Hive Healing House on all my vacations.  I would recommend Janelle to everyone who is looking for the solution to a healthier and more positive life!
