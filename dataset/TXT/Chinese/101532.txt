kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A I was surprised (in a good way)to smell the spicy peppercorn when we stepped into the Noodle Man and this smell was so delicious!  The deco was nice and they served water and tea in mason jar mugs, so non traditional for Chinese restaurant. We did not sit in the area where you can view how your noodle were made but no big deal for me.  I only care about the taste!
We ordered black fungus salad as appetizers-recommended by waitress, it was great just the way I want it.   We also ordered spicy pork wonton, pork with leak dumpling, Chong Qing style spicy and sour noodle. Everything was delicious and had the right spicy flavor, but to me most of our dishes were too salty, especially dumpling. But will come again when visit Vegas.
