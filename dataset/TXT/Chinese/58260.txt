dblGQtHAzNy1ACis1m2shw We order from this place A LOT and their food is delicious, but time after time we never get any of the extras that we ask for. We only get soy sauce enough for one person, we didn't get any sweet and sour sauce for our egg rolls. No silverware at all. It's just kind of frustrating that we never receive any of the things that we list under the notes section. I had to send my boyfriend to get me silverware and a bottle of soy sauce which kind of defeats the purpose of having your food delivered since he has to go somewhere anyway.
