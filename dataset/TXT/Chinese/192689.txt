z9lOfnUorcbWR_xS0DSeHw My first time here. The space is rather barren and visually unappealing. I started by ordering one of their interesting-looking sake varieties by the glass, only to find out they are now served by the bottle only (at $20 and up). I went with the Ozeki, and the server didn't bother to unscrew the cap for me. I ordered wonton soup and the seafood and eggplant hotpot.  The soup broth was hot and savory, and the wontons meaty. The "hotpot" was served before I was halfway done with soup. It was more like a tureen, and the food color matched Fugu's interior - yellowish green and brown. A large portion of eggplant and not so much seafood, just a few small shrimp, scallops, calamari and krabmeat, served with basic rice. The sauce was fine but calamari was tough. I imagine they focus more on carryouts judging by the disinterested wait staff and constantly ringing phone. I won't be back.
