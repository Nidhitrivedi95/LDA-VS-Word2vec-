fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw After spending the day at the hospital with my baby I called this place on my way home to order General tso-chicken to go. 5 minutes later I was there to pick it up. When I got home excited to have a meal what a nightmare, it was the most disgusting thing I have ever tried I can't even describe what kind of chicken they had sold me. We ended up eating white rice with NOTHING ELSE.. It was 8pm so I decided to stop by on the next day as it was already a long exhausting day to me and my family. Next day (Sunday) around noon I went there with my baby and just told the ''gentleman'' that they had served me something else instead of GTC, he immediately started screaming at me in front of all his customer ( Even when I tried to make it as discrete as possible). He said that if I hadn't returned it at the same day it was my loss... He wasn't going to refund my money or anything. I told him  that I was giving him the opportunity to make it right but as he was so ignorant I wasn't going to waste my time instead I was calling my bank and disputing the charge (Exactly what I did). Anyhow, this place should have been closed a long time ago. PS: Drive few more minutes and go eat something tasty, affordable and with an excellent service Rice and noodle on Rainbow.
