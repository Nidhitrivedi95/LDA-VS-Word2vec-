2meb5cwKh125tF5IwUiIJA We were wondering about Chinatown when I had a craving for a cocktail bun. I saw the great reviews on yelp and made a B-line for this place. The place is PACKED and rightly so. You get to pick a tray and put all the tasty treats you'd like on it and they pack it up and send you on your way for a pretty reasonable price (~$1.00 a bun). They are also busily stocking the shelves as you shop ensuring a great selection and super fresh product. I grabbed a cocktail bun and a hot dog bun as I was in a bit of rush. The cocktail bun was still warm and filled with lots of coconutty goodness. THe Hot dog bun was also warm and satisfying. Can't wait to go back and try a wider selection.
