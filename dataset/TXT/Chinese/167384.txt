VGwPrBPlbD24SZAT_b0JBw My work orders food from here very often as it is very cheap and they are definitely not stingey with the amount of food they give you. They also do delivery which is another plus and very convenient for companies such as mine to order good Chinese takeout. They deliver the food pretty fast as well (and that's ordering food for 10 people). As for the food, it's great. I have no complaints.
