CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Laksa noodle soup! It's not an easy find, but this place has it. I thought it was really good too. It's really about the broth and noodles, both were good. It's not for everyone though, especially those who aren't into seafood or a fishy taste in their broth. I do like more seafood selections in my soup. They should look into doing that. But again, the broth and noodles made up for it. I do agree with my fellow Yelpers that spicy dishes don't quite hit the mark here, especially if you request very spicy. Service was fine and the prices were tolerable for a place in the Bellagio. I'd return if I ever get the chance again.
