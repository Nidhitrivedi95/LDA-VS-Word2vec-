_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Love this place !!!  Was staying at the Venetian for business and had nothing but large business meals planned most of the time - but wanted something small, fresh and good.... this place hit the spot.  Had the ramen with which was terrific, also the gyoza - which has a different kind of dough around it, tasted okay, but different - more thick then traditional...  all in all, wish I found this place a few days earlier...
