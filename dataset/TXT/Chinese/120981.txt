o56LV-WnalGB0URVvoOh4A I agree with the other reviewer the house chicken is good, and very well priced for the amount of food you get. My girl friend is a great fan of chinese food so we eat here everyother week it seems. I am not a huge fan of the egg drop soup or wor wonton soup (not enough veggies), the crab puffs are good but the house chicken is what brings us back, give it a try and see how you like it. it will feed 2 if you order a few other things like a soup.
