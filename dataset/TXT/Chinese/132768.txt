prHnRsgY-PuM7vxe8-RwEA I should've looked at reviews prior to eating here.  Went next door for an oil change and figured I can grab something quick while Midas gets their job done. As I was walking in I noticed employees hanging out on their phone so I wasn't sure if they were open. I then Walked in and the employee half assed the greet and continued to pretend to work. I ordered the orange chicken and it was absolutely disgusting. The chicken was cold, re fried and inedible. Hard as a rock to the point I couldn't even bite into it. I ate the lo mein from the dish considering I was hungry. I regret that I did. Should've simply asked for a refund and handed the food back as I tried but the employees wouldn't even look my way. They were to busy trying to hock a loogie. Made my "dining" experience even more uncomfortable. 

The place is disgusting and it's been years since the last time I had it. I remember now why I said then I won't go back. Do yourself a favor and move on to the next Chinese spot. Gross!!
