lv3h7WwuxPyJNLTeWeL5LQ Back in the days when Chinese food/grocery only existed in China Town this was one of the few Chinese Restaurants that existed in Scarborough/Markham borders.  This being said, the business here was INSANE and it was as crowded as any Canton Dim Sum restaurants back EAST.

How things have changed around here as development of Asian Malls and Plazas mean that next to a Chinese restaurant exist another of the same.  A never-ending vision of Chinese food supply more than demand.

This place still holds its old time charm that was there from DAY ONE.  You'll have to walk through the mall all the way to the BACK of the building to find this place as you past by Hair Salons, Snack Places, and Empty Stalls.

Food and Service is good and now that it isn't as BUSY as years before, you can actually CHIT-CHAT with the staff on Weekdays.  It's one of those places that have LARGER tables so finding a table for a big group isn't as much a worry as some others.  

They have nice spacing inbetween the tables, so you won't have to worry as much about Push Cart Ladies knocking your arm or hot Tea spilling on you like other restos with TIGHT spaces.

This is definitely a place to YUM CHA with the Daily News as long as you are OKAY hanging with a crowd of retirees.  The good thing is that they won't even notice you because they can't even see that far.  They can only see as far as the newspaper they hold with their hands.
