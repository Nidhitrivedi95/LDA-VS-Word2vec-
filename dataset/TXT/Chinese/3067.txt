_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA I love this place go there every time I am in town just haven't gotten around to write a review.
Food is a tad bit on the higher side but taste wise it is right on the money.
Service can be a bit slow on a weekend lunch time.
This is what I love on the menu 
Fire house chicken wings
Shanghai style noodles 
Wonton soup 
King pao shrimp or chicken 
Seafood fried rice
Dim Sum
