rntKF4Dm9JIJoSNi5XqRsQ Seems to be my only go to place for dumplings now as they are one of the only places I know where thier dumplings are juicy and not dry.

My order usually consist of:
Pork n Leek Dumplings
Xiao Long Bao (soup filled dumplings)
Salty Sticky Rice Roll
Onion Beef Pancake Roll
Cold Potato Shreds with Chili Oil n Garlic
***Pretty solid list for a homey feel

Although the food does have MSG, do consider it's a common practise amongst many oriental restaurants to achieve that Umami flavor sensation. Trust me the stuff they put in cheap fast food restaurants will have you downing more water than worrying about MSG.

Service is good as long as you are polite and patiently understand that they do try thier best to communicate in English. It is a mom and pop place so just give them a wave if you need anything, it's not a big deal.

Overall I come to eat here as a comfort meal and I usually head to Tracy after for dessert. Pretty good combination in my opinion.
