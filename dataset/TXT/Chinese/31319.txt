9prl00viUUFrEcPIpXZDOw Back in the days before Yelp the good old fashioned way to find a new restaurant is just follow the crowd and see which place is busy.  Well searching for some dim sum in Mississauga near my house I came across this exciting new find but apparently I'm not the only one.
They have dim sum from the menu (no cart service) and since I'm not a traditionalist let's try this I say it. The crispy tofu was a hit good and almost gone. The crispy noodle wonton soup with shrimp dumpling was excellent.  The pork dumplings only ho hum and the weak link was the fried octopus which was to rubbery and greasy.  For only $20 we had enough food for almost four people.... Portions are big. 
I definitely will be back
