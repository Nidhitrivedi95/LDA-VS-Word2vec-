z5hh524-H3q-65CfVXIi4Q Where to begin explaining how much help Lori's acupuncture and massage treatments have done for myself and the friends I have recommended her to. The first time I received help from Lori it was in the form of massage due to severe neck pain I had been having. The massage I received was unbelievable and it alleviated the discomfort about as much as the weekly visits to the chiropractor was. She told me after that initial massage that she could treat my neck pain more aggressively with the use of acupuncture. After a few acupuncture treatments I stopped going to the chiropractor all together since the treatments worked much better than the occasional adjustment. Learning from Lori the many healing applications of acupuncture I started asking her to treat other ailments like chronic arthritis and stomach issues that I suffer from. All in all I highly recommend the services Lori can provide you with no matter what ailments you suffer from regularly. Professional, honest, and extremely caring. Give her a call!!!!!
