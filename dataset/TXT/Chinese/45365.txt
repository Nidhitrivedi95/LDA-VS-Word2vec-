brAUHv7Kmxx5nclssCPldA We walked into the restaurant at 5:45pm and was told by the hostess that they only took customers with reservations between 5 - 7:30pm. Since we didn't have a reservation, she would not seat us even though the restaurant was almost completely empty. Unbelievably  ridiculous. What kind of restaurant is this that turns away customers?
