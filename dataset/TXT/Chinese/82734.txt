hbuVhfMb8r3kVNZ-thX16g Little dumpling came up on grubhub, my boyfriend works graveyard so we ordered delivery thinking it wouldn't take so long, it got 4 stars on grubhub so we thought it'd be good. I order my food at 7:30, they said it would be ready by 8:30. 8:30 comes around and still no food and I leave to take my boyfriend to work. I come back home, my roomates answered the door and had my food for me, and the 2 thai iced teas that I ordered where forgotten. So 2 hours for the good to get delivered and they forgot my thai iced teas that I paid for. I'm so mad I don't even want to taste the food, the service alone has left a bad taste in my mouth.
