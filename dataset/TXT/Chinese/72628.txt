fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA We've been going here before the renovations and it's one of our go to favorites. I'm surprised I hadn't written a review! We always order veggie dumplings and hot and sour soup. They are my favorite dumplings in Toronto. It's a bit tight but we've always been able to accommodate our stroller and baby. Staff is always fast and efficient. Cash only!
