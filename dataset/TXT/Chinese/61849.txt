DuUt446iZMHowlt9AQ5kNg A great place for a traditional chinese dinner, the food tastes like really good home cooking. I appreciate that the dishes aren't doused in oil, pickled in salt or overly fried. It feels like you are trying to be somewhat healthy and don't need to immediately make better food choices after the meal. I would highly recommend the Chiu Yueng Style Marinated Duck. It's well seasoned, slightly sweet and not as fatty as most duck dishes. A great dish that is worth reordering again. 

The service seem to be a little confused during my latest visit. They delivered one out of three dishes, but the next dish they brought us was the complementary dessert. Our waitress seemed as confused as we were when we pointed that out, but she seemed to figure it out somehow and the rest of the dinner went fine. I would not hesitant to point out if things aren't quite correct, it seems to help them along.
