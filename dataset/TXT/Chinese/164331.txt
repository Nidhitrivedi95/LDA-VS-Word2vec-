UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ What a wonderful dining experience ! We ordered several dishes and a few appetizers. The springs rolls were hot and fresh served with spicy mustard and sauce. The potstickers were great also. The dishes we ordered were the beef and broccoli,general yang shrimp, house chow mein, chicken fried rice,Singapore chow fun, and orange chicken. I rated the general yang shrimp and house chow mein the best dishes of the dinner. Now the customer service was exceptional....our waitress was attentive and made us feel welcomed. I will be back!
