However, Asian Legend, a Toronto chain, is a pleasant exception to the norm downtown. Skillfully prepared food in a nice clean pleasant environment. I can't count how many visitors to Toronto I've taken to Asian legend and none have been disappointed. Highlights include: the braised eggplant, seafood hot pot, and lemon chicken.
