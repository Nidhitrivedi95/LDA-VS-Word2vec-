bsjBLLHR4TMVR5eAeLAI9w I was in Montreal and for some reason, craving spicy dumplings so we found this place. It definitely satisfied my spicy dumpling craving and more. It's a traditional dim sum place. It's a large restaurant on the second floor of this building filled with random shops and restaurants. You can see the name of the restaurant from outside the building if you just look up. They have tables of all sizes and on a random weekday, they were coming around with carts. They had all the standard shrimp dumplings that I love and they definitely seemed fresh and delicious. The prices are reasonable. The tea was quite good. The place was fast and efficient. The service was what I would expect at a dim sum place, a bit rough around the edges but there to serve effectively. Definitely en par with some of the dim sum places I've been to in Manhattan though I have also been to better.
