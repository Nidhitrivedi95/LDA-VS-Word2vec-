vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA So far the best food I've eaten so far. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated because it was packed. Service was quick, food nice and hot and delicious. We had the sesame shrimp rolls and potstickers as appetizers. Biggest potstickers I've ever eaten and the sesame shrimp delicious. We shared a Mongolian beef and Yang chow fried rice also delicious. The portions are big enough for sharing. Didn't have dessert because they only had mango pudding and creme brûlée. I was stuffed anyway, had no room for it.  We liked it so much we are going back tomorrow

Went back today and as the first time the food and service didn't disappoint
