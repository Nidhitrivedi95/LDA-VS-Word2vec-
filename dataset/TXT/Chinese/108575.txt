LjCrhp_Rys2bCIJHz5EGBA Sooooo,  I just ate there on Saturday.  My friends and I have been making fun of the "Golden Freakin' Coin" for years.  HOWEVER, at my age, I'm getting brave.
And, here we go.

Bullet hole in the window (Okay, maybe it was a BB.) Gives it negative 1 star.
-1
Sourfaced girl who took my money is one star.
+1
Small selection of food is 3 stars (what?  you want me to give it less than 3 stars??? Remember people, it was $5.65 AFTER TAX for an all you care to eat buffet!)
+3
Nice older (not OLDER, just older than the sour faced young one) lady that brought me water, took my plates, and gave me water refills and the cook that gave me a big smile is 3 stars.
+3
Food was fresh, piping hot, and the egg rolls were actually delicious-there is not a lot of spice here, but the flavors are good.  ONE BIG EXCEPTION-the sweet and sour pork--NO WAY am I eating that-so how about 2.5 stars?
+2.5
Now all I have to do is add all this up and see where we go from here.
Yup, it's a 2 star establishment.

Great if you're pre-menstrual and all you want is as much food as possible---ambience be damned!!

Very scientific--but not too much fun hunh?  Not true. I had a blast!
:)

OH!! CASH ONLY!!!!
