3PsmvwxetLz1Tzb-6mNhgA I went 4 consecutive weekdays to find a 2 hour wait. "Woah. This place must be awesome!"

When we finally got in, we were not very impressed. I got a lobster sauce dish that was largely flavorless. About a year later, I decided to give it another try, thinking that maybe I had ordered the wrong thing. This time I stuck to more familiar territories and got some sort of bulgogi inspired dish that was being called out on the menu (I wish I remembered the name) and my husband got the Singapore Street Noodles. My dish tasted odd to me, with a very strong, bitter even, taste of orange zest. His was a bit better, but neither of us enjoyed it. I didn't even enjoy their crab rangoon, which I usually love. 

I have had authentic Chinese and Americanized Chinese food, all types of Asian cuisine...and somehow the fusion P.F.Changs delivers tastes odd to me, bland when it shouldn't be and too intense in others.

The staff and ambience are very nice, but ultimately the food is not simply not for me. Since then, I have been (affectionately) calling it P.F. Chunks.
