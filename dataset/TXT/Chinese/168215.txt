vMpJzMFst_9GP4boeqWIRg Yummy salt squid...so so pad thai but gorgeous in appearance. I think it lacked flavour n it tasted artificial sauce wise. Cantonese chow mean was yummy yet couldn't help but think that it too had an artificial tasting flavour in the sauce. Beef sizzling plate was nice. Over all nothing to write home about. Its nicely decorated also has a cased in duck n BBQ room .
A little music would have been nice to drown out the kids and general kitchen noise.
Customer service is one of the worse I've ever encountered. No hello no greeting just a stoned faced person w a samurai expression asking if we know what we want. At the end my husband gave the wait person a $50 n $20 dollar bill to pay the $53. Dollar bill and gave him $7 in change. 
My husband had to ask her for the other $10

Will I go back? Nah...this was a test run.

Dismal customer service
