9BgLsbR7bIhI7njaLLkMig Que Ling is the former Boston Steak House, although if you look very closely at the exterior sign you'll still see a Boston Steak House sign there. In fact, if you miss Boston Steak House, Que Ling still has some of the offerings that Boston Steak House had.

The pho menu is very simple, practically zero exotic offerings. I had the cooked beef rice noodles. Didn't had high expectations given the setting, but it was okay. Portions were quite large, but not surprisingly the noodle quality and broth quality weren't there at all. For $7, however, I wasn't too upset by it.

Service was average Asian quality. They're mostly the same employees from Boston Steak House, so whatever treatment you got from there, expect it from here as well.

I likely won't return as there are better options in Scarborough for pho and HK style cafe.
