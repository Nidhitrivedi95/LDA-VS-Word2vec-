-poor customer service
-brought out wrong order
-overcharged our party


Our party ordered a beef chow fun plate among other things, then our waiter called our order back to us, everything was fine. Then everything went wrong. Our chow fun noodle plate didn't come with any noodles. When we informed our waiter of this he promptly said no we didn't order the chow fun dish, just the regular beef dish, even though he repeated it back to us.  We told him that we even pointed it out on the menu to him as he looked at it and wrote the order, which he then gave the excuse that he couldn't see it. He took the order away (which was weird, usually places just bring the correct order out), and said he'll being back the correct order. When it was brought back, it was fine, however that wasn't the end of our problem.  After getting the bill and paying for it, we thought our bill was a bit high, so we went to check the front desk's menu to find out that he added four dollars to the price of our dish. We left in disgust as our party wanted to be somewhere else. DON'T EAT HERE, but if you do...DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL!!
