I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this review.  

I came here with some of my classmates one evening after class at ASU.  Luckily, two of them were native Mandarin speakers, as well as my professor having lived in China for a couple of years, so they were all business when it came down to ordering food.

Since going to this restaurant, I am addicted.  There is no other word for it.  My friend and I go at least once a week where we order the same things.  In fact, we go so often that we are immediately seated at the same table by the staff, and sometimes not even given menus.  

What do we eat?  We eat: cold noodles (liang fen), fuqi feipian (cold spicy beef tripe, tongue, and other parts), and water-boiled beef (we ask for it extra-spicy).  

After numbing your mouth, I suggest taking a sip of water OR ordering a Tsingtao beer.  You'll be amazed at how sweet tasting the beer is!

I am moving out of the Phoenix area to New England soon, and I am more than distraught that I will no longer be able to enjoy Szechuan Palace.  I've threatened to kidnap the chef, but I'm not sure he'd enjoy being stored in my kitchen.  

One of the main suggestions for this restaurant is: DO NOT ORDER THE ORANGE CHICKEN.  (hint: it's not really chinese food) Instead, ask one of the servers what the chef's special is for the day.  Or, try out one of my fave dishes.  You won't be disappointed!
