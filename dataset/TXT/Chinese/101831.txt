KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA Indian sports bar? 
I have never heard of this before! 
I felt like I was inside Jack Astros with An Indian twist.
This place rocked! 
Awesome Indian dance music, tv's, comfy booths, amazing service and wicked food!
There was a dance floor and projectors and lights in the back of the restaurant which I saw on Yelp the place turns into a club?
This place looked like everyone was just having a good time! Tones of large family groups and friends were just hanging out and drinking. There's a huge bar people we're relaxin at.

The only thing I'd change is that they should let you decide how mild or spicy you want the food to be. We ordered Garlic Nan, Goat Biriani, Chicken Tika, Veggie Pakora and rice and it was delicious my boyfriend loved it and so did my Mom - I brought her home left overs! 
The portions are huge !!

For a late night drink and dinner this place is great!
