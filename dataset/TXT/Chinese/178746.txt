X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ I have been to Vegas only four times, and these visits were in the span of 5 months, in 2014. Island Malaysian Cuisine was my go to for comfort Malaysian dishes, such as Kueh teow, Nasik lemak, and Ais Kacang dessert. 

Maybe they played favoritism, maybe not, but they were quick, nice, and presented delicious dish after dish. I have no complaints in that department. We had the fried rice noodle(Kueh teow) just the way Malaysians like it, charred a but, with eggs, and shrimp. Yummy. The curry beef and rice is so flavorful, oh my tongue! Be warn, if you're not familiar with Malaysian dishes, then I would understand why my enthusiasm for this place is not shared by you. All out of the Malaysian restaurants I've been to in GTA, ON, SoCal, and here in Vegas, NV, Island Malaysian beats them all. Having said that, I truly hope they keep this up. 

C'mon, it was raining in VEGAS, and the bus we used in Spring mountain Road was busted, and we waited fourth minutes to go here. That's how much I love their dishes.
