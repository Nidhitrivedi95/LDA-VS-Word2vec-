6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ I'm giving Fu five stars because it flawlessly executes Asian American dining at the right price point. It's not highly authentic being that they cater to western tastes; however, the quality of the ingredients is fantastic and everything that I've tried here has been consistently satisfying. My favorite dishes are the Hong Kong noodles and Kung Pao chicken. I'd definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the Hard Rock as you'll get better value out of Fu than Nobu. Last note - service is very friendly and quick!
