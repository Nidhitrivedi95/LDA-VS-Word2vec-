a5xUI7TvsNhM5gZr6KowDg Pleasantly surprised by the quality of Sesame Inn! I was not expecting much because, realistically, how many great Chinese restaurants are attached to a Toyota dealership? 

Walking in, I found that the restaurant itself is very clean and presentable - first hurdle cleared! I was very impressed with the variety of vegetarian options they offered on the menu as well. We came in right in time for their lunch specials, so I ordered the lunch sushi option where you choose 2 rolls and a soup. I went with the garden roll and the tamago roll - both were great! Standard sushi quality, but with the low price, it was a fantastic deal. My boyfriend ordered the General Tso's Chicken which was very crispy and the sauce was flavorful without being too sweet or sour. The food earns our seal of approval! 

If I needed a reason to love this place even more, the waiter provided the best customer service. He was very friendly, attentive, and delivered our food and drinks very quickly. I couldn't have asked for better service.  I will definitely be back! Sesame Inn, I will see you at my next oil change!
