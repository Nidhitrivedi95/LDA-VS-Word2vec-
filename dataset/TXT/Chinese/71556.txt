fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A Pricey, mediocre at best.
Homemade potstickers are OK, not amazing.
Clams with ginger-scallion sauce are good quality, but the sauce is a too oily and unappealingly thick and not usable as a sauce you would actually eat on your rice. If you must, get the black bean sauce and request 'low oil'. You'll probably get 'high saliva' ha ha ;)
House Lo Mein comes out kind of oily as well. Again, ask for 'low oil' if you gotta get it.

Management is a bit odd, a holdover trait from the original Spring Mountain Road location where you get a completely different menu w/no specials (and a fork) if you don't speak Chinese.

Dim Sum here is pretty average - it may even make you realize that you don't actually like Dim Sum. Kind of like jazz. We're told that it's good and that we should appreciate it, but the nuts of it are that it kind of sucks. Eating lukewarm food that was cooked 5 hours ago off of a rolling cart is just dumb.

If you're hankering for Chinese and are staying in the Rio, you're probably better off hitting the Rio Buffet and at least getting some crab legs out of the deal. 

Free tea is cool. Good on them. I was expecting to get snuck for at least $2 per tea drinker, but didn't.
