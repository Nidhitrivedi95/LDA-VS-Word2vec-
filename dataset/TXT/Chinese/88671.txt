i_t_UJTSScw4srpb8aHUiw Five stars for standing up to one of the most arrogant, self-absorbed, entitled foodies in the GTA!  Thank you for refusing service to Charles Yu.   I took great pleasure reading him whine and bitch on Chowhound because he thought he deserved the lunch specials during dinner, and got all butthurt when you said no...   any restaurant that says FU to CY deserves my business!!  Keep it up boys!
