CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Surprisingly there are two Chinese restaurants in Bellagio. We tried with Noodle for a midnight snack. We ordered Beef Choy Fun and XO sauced green bean. The green bean did a great job, not the fun. The fun is not fresh, kind of hard, like has been stayed in kitchen for long. The waitress is nice, but not the greeting lady. We like the restaurant interior style.
