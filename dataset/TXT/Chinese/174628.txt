WF0I9AwErfaqkPPXM98ywQ I came here after the movies and decided to take a quick bite at this new Lucullus location on Enterprise. People have been raving about how nice it is, I had to go see for myself! I love how grand the finish is... with beautiful European-styled decor from floor to ceiling. The coffee bar is especially captivating. But sadly, that's about it.

Price point - on the expensive side and I don't see the value. It is not like we are getting amazing food quality here. Ok, fine... I give it that we eat ambiance too, and ambiance was nice.

Food quality and presentation - sub par on the sweet potato dumpling in sweet ginger soup. I give another star for the extra spicy ginger they used (I love ginger) but the dumpling was already falling apart from overcooking and had became mushy. And I'm really not impressed with the $6 rice combo. If you plan to go fancy on me, it is unacceptable to serve me a rice bowl in an aluminium foil container. This is no cafeteria. At least make an effort to make it look presentable. And the rice was dried out from steaming the whole day... awesome!

Service - what service? The cashier lady didn't even crack a smile nor made us feel welcome... she gave us a blank look. Thank god we don't have to pay tips.

------------------------------------

This bakery has an amazing amount of potential because of its prime location, but just need to up its game to survive in Downtown Markham. I do believe in second chances... I will come back to try again. Let's see if Lucullus can redeem themselves then.
