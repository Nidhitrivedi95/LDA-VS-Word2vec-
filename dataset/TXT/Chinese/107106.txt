L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA My husband and I stopped by for lunch after our plane landed in Las Vegas. Since we came in from the east coast, our internal clock is still ahead and when we arrived, we were very hungry as it was way past our lunch time and the places that we tried to go prior to this one had yet to open. 

We both ordered dumpling and egg noodle soup. I thought it was very tasty. They gave us plenty of dumplings and I like the baby bok choi that they put in the soup. The price here is very cheap - $5.95 for a bowl. You can't beat that!
