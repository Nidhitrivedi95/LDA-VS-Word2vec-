HG9m9eldYtnX_UeMt4Yy2w Been here a few times, but I don't come here often.  This place has been around for years and is definitely worth trying.

The Shanghai Streamed Pork Buns were good! The wrapper is not as thin as Asian Legend. The flavour of the juices is also really good. 

The Soy Minced Pork with Rice was also really good.  Very saucy compared to other places and sauce is usually good thing for flavour. I found the sauce to a bit too salty, but I think it's because I only ate half the rice.

Giving this place 4 stars because the pork buns (my reason for Shanghai food) are consistent and authentic.  Nice place for a casual family dinner!

Service was great, Micheal and he waitresses were very attentive. Hope this restaurant's tradition doesn't get lost.
