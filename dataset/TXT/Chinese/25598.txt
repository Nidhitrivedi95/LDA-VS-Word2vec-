7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ Ghost town! Me and my friend came here for dinner on Tuesday around 6 and were literally the only people in here during the entire time. The location isn't super central so maybe that's some of the cause. It's located down freemont street across from publicus.

Food wise everything tasted pretty good. I had the 2 pieces of chicken which came with a slice of bread and little mini muffins. It came out super fresh & hot and the flavors were on point. The price is super adorable too, only $8. 

This place could be so much better if it was just busier and more upbeat. I highly suggest implementing a happy hour during the week to bring more people in.
