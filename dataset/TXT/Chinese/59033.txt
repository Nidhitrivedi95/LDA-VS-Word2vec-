dHTGzM4_3kKEiQvab9mi9A Got this for delivery the other night out of sheer laziness.  I agree with a previous poster, as I too got Mongolian Beef and asked for Spicy and it wasn't.  However, it was really tasty and some at-home chili sauce got me on the right track.  The Egg Rolls are huge and crispy.  And my kid finished a whole order of sesame chicken, which he said he loved.  Delivery was fast and well packaged,  so I'll be doing it again.
