9AJcD4UfawSSgc5007SWAw Ocean Buffet is an ok place to eat if you're looking for quick Asian food without paying take out prices.  My fiance and I ate there at about 6:30pm and the food was a tad un-fresh for my liking.  Sushi was a little warm and oysters/clams have been out for a bit and not as cold as I think they should have been. Also some of the hot dishes had been out for a while and were getting dry.  The place was clean and service was ok.  I would say go there when it's busier so the food keeps coming out fresh, as business picked up mid-way through our meal and they brought out most all new fresh food.  If it's not busy I would say go elsewhere, you may have a better experience. But for the price it's not terrible.
