pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA This place was highly recommended by a friend, so we decided to stop by after watching Panda. It was a Thursday night, but the place is still pretty packed. But they were able to fit us in even without rsvn. The server was super friendly and quickly made recommendations after finding out its our first time there. All his recommendations were amazingly delicious, especially the seabass and porkbelly. But my absolute favorite: the roll with the foie gras, caviar, gold flakes on tuna (sorry, I'm bad with remembering names). You know that feeling when you put a piece of food in your mouth and immediately get overflown by amazing flavors that make your eyes roll back with a feeling of euphoria? yea, that good!
