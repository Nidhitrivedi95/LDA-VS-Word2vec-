AbQMlXCfWvMnNXADMaiMIw My friend and I dined in half an hour before closing (our bad). The service was blunt and we felt rushed to leave. We did the all you can eat and ordered a bit of almost everything. Everything tasted below average, and bland. The bill came up to $54 for two, and although that's an average price for all you can eat, this place was definitely not worth it. I wont be coming back here again.
