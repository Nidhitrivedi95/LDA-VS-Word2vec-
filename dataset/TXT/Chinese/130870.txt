pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA SUSHISAMBA is a restaurant you come eat at more for the surroundings and chic ambiance, unless you really enjoy overpriced Japanese food (er, I should say Japanese-Brazilian). Their fish is fresh, but I still don't think that justifies the jack-up in prices. We came here for lunch on a Friday and it was pretty empty, so we got seated right away. We ordered:

-Berkshire Porkbelly Ramen (Spicy Lemongrass Broth, Bok Choy, Bean Sprout, Cilantro, Cancha $18): Not a bad size for the price I guess, and our server was nice enough to split it into two bowls for us since he knew we were sharing. The soup broth is SPICY though- it's that spice with a huge initial kick but then peters out. They also don't skimp on the porkbelly, so that was nice. But I probably wouldn't re-order.
-Yellowtail Jalapeno $7: 6 pieces for $7- not a bad deal. It was a standard yellowtail jalapeno roll, nothing bad or good to say.
-Salmon Avocado $6: 6 pieces- probably the best deal at the restaurant. The size of the rolls were a little bigger, and salmon and avocado together are delicious!
-Spicy Tuna $7.75: 6 pieces I believe, and this was your standard spicy tuna, but less spicy than a lot of places.

I probably should have ordered their fusion sushi with foie gras and other crazy toppings if I wanted to be impressed, but I really couldn't justify spending $20 on one sushi roll for lunch.. In any case, come here to eat if you enjoy posh surroundings, and don't mind high prices.
