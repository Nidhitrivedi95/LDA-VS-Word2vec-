The specialty non alcoholic lychee drink was soo good! The bartender Alex, was VERY knowledgeable and able to create just the right beverage given a few details about what we're in the mood for drinking. I definitely would eat there again. Next time I'll venture off the special $8 app menu and delve into the menu wholeheartedly.
