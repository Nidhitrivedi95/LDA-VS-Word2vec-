EMh5InDTEfGGCowRy_pJZA Honestly i didn't even want to give this amateur company one star.. This place does not even have beef balls. This place has two kinds of beefs one which is advertised as new zealand beef, i am 100% certain it is now. This place is only 16.99 for late night ayce, it is really cheap but id rather go to hipot in the same plaza which is a bit more expensive but one of the best places ive been to. Do not waste your time coming here.
