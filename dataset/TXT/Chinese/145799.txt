s2oTzh21fWMXy4YrSAq_wQ I've been going to Cathay House for 6 years so I really bummed to see that it closed and another restaurant replaced it. But I've never been there so I decided to give it a try. 

The host sat me in the corner where everyone entered so there was not a point throughout my meal that I didn't feel like someone was hovering over me while I was eating. I sat for 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged my presence (it wasn't that busy) and the waiter just noticed me because I was flagging him down to give me water. He seemed irritated, passed by me muttered some angry words in Cantonese and proceeded to ignore my request for water. I asked two more waiters after that and they both ignored me, angrily as well. Everyone just seems to be angry at this place? 

After 20 minutes I FINALLY got my water, which I didn't end up drinking because the water was warm, glass was dirty and I wasn't even given a straw. 
The dim sum cart FINALLY made its way over to me after 25 minutes of me flagging down the people pushing them and having to look like a foolish person waving their hand in a restaurant. 

I only come to ever go to dim sum places for siomai and they didn't even have that. I asked if they would have more and the lady said it would be on its way (if another 15 minute wait counts as on its way I guess). I settled for the steamed pork. 

I didn't want to wait for another hour so I just waited for the siomai and left.
