LGZPjmhEg2QYeGZ2PKnpQw I have been to Yang's for dim sum once.  I found the decor very exquisite and expensive.  I perceived that they wanted to give the impression that they were very high end to 1) elevate the perception of their food and 2) justify the high prices.  Truth be told I didn't like their dim sum.  Nothing really impressed me to say "Oh, this is good".

And thank heaven, someone else picked up the tab.

Food - 3 stars 
Overall experience: considering the polite yet aloof service (nothing say blue blood like aloofness), the high prices, yet only average food - 2 stars
