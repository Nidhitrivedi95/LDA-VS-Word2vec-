_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA For a place I expected to be comparable to fast-food style Chinese food, I was impressed. Located in the Venetian casino, my dad and I passed by and decided on a whim to give it a try. We tried the stir-fried noodles with chicken, and the BBQ pork and duck rice dish (this seemed to be one of their most popular dishes - several of the tables around us also ordered this dish). 

The great thing about Noodle Asia is the good selection of dishes, they bring your food out quickly, and the food just reminded me of a good home-cooked meal. I'm not claiming that the food is super authentic Chinese food, but it's definitely a few steps above Panda Express or any other fast-food Chinese establishment. The food was hot and fresh, it tasted good, and you were given a lot of food. What else could you ask for?

The dishes ranged from rice dishes, a couple of dim sum options, moo shu, rice porridge, to noodle soups, wok-tossed noodles, and soups. With two, you should order at least two dishes, with each dish around $12-16. I wouldn't say the atmosphere is the best, because you're basically sitting in an open-area restaurant in the middle of the casino, but it suits the fast-casual experience. 

We came relatively early for dinner, around 6 pm, but as we left, a line was starting to form to get seated. Definitely plan on coming early, because I don't know if the food is necessarily worth a long wait.
