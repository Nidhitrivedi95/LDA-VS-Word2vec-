jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw I have been to this restaurant 4 times before and liked it OK. I find it funny that the menu is in Chinese of course, but also has subtitles in Tagalog.  I like it when ethnic restaurants are full of diners of that ethnicity; They're keeping it real.

Today I was craving the Walnut Shrimp. 
I pull into the parking lot and there's a crowd of people waiting to go in. What !?!? That's never happened before. I guess this is a popular place on Sunday morn compared to the weekday afternoons that I have been here before. I get inside and am seated quickly. And there are ladies with dim sum carts. I have not had that since I left LA years ago. The Walnut Shrimp can wait for another day.

Hot green tea was brought to my table quickly.

I got my food from the first carts to come my way: calamari, fried shrimp, steamed shrimp in a thin dough and 2 dessert type buns: pineapple and coconut. I liked it all. The hot food was hot; the fried food was crisp; the dessert buns were soft. It all tasted fresh.

Took most of it home since I was alone and could not possibly eat it all in one sitting.

I think the servers did a good job. They got people in and out quickly. There is a language barrier but to me that just adds to the experience.

p.s. After reading Yelp reviews, I guess it's a good thing that I have never seen the lady's bathroom LOL.
