URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg I don't know if it changed owners or what but the service was slow and no one smiled.  When we asked to be seated at a round table for four instead of a small square one--- NO was the abrupt response and no explanations.  Very rude!  Also, there were only 4 groups of people there.  Not even half filled to capacity on a Thursday night around 4 pm.  Ordered the Mongolian beef And orange chicken. The orange chicken was disgusting and very sweet. Also the chicken was very dry and over fried where it was hard and tough.  Panda Express makes a better orange chicken!  Shame!  

The Mongolian Beef was OK , but it was swimming in green onions and white onions on top of a crispy white noodles deep-fried bed.  Disgusting!  The only thing that was good was the hot and sour soup and egg drop soup. The rice was not even jasmine rice used!  Will not be returning to this venue. Very difficult to believe that this was rated highly on KAET channel 8 on a show called CHECK PLEASE.  In the end, all I needed was my check.  Thank you!!!!
