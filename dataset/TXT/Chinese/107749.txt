But then we quickly found out when all of the kitchen came out and gave us really ugly looks as though he purposefully held them up and they were about to leave for the night. The good thing is we still got our food, and it was fresh! I think the best part about this place is that there is a drive thru. The food does seem to have a lot of MSG in it and I was bloated from the excess of sodium, but the fried rice was super delicious! I would probably go back
