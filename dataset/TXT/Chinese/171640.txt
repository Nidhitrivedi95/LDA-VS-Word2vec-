VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Flo's is my favorite place to get Chinese in the valley. This location, especially. I am not a fan of the one in the promenade...
The hot and sour soup here is AH-MAY-ZING. Oh my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The broth. The pork. The shrimp. The mushrooms. Sooooo good. I hate when I order hot and sour soup from a restaurant and it tastes like salty beef broth with peas and carrots and those canned bamboo shoot things. I also hate when it's the consistency of jello. But Flo's is always perfect. Just the amount of spice and vinegar, the perfect thickness, perfect amount of egg that's actually stirred in correctly and not just giant globs... 
Their other dishes I've had are good too. The ingredients are fresh. Their noodle dishes are pretty basic tho, so if you like tons of ingredients, maybe don't get one. I however think they're delicious.
My only real complaint about Flo's is the service. Everyone always seems extremely stressed out, from the hostesses to the servers. Maybe they need a few more employees? But it's not a big deal for me, I usually just get take out. Or lunch. And it's actually great for lunch, super fast, and fresh, and you totes get your money's worth!!
