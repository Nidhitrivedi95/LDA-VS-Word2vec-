QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA Decent food... if you want "Sichuan/Szechwan" food you have to ask for the black menu. We noticed when Asians came into the restaurant they were only given the black menu, we had to ask for it. 

That aside, the food was flavorful and tasty, but, even "hot" dishes were far from hot, even though we asked for them to be very hot. 

Dumplings were a bit over done and soggy. While I've not been to china, this wasn't on par with Sichuan places I've been to in NY and other major cities. I do really want to try their 'Hot Pots' so am looking forward to go back for that. 

Service was swift and polite.   Knowing Mandarin Chinese or having a friend that knows it woudl help. 

So if you take the Szechwan part out of it, I think it's a decent place to go for what I can only guess is Americanized Chinese food in general.

The water cooked chicken had a very interesting herbal spice to it and was very pleasant with other dishes on the table.
