sadly, our group of 9 found they turned their kitchen down to zero.  not in quality - the menu and results from it are identical from the other locales.  but the joint wasn't full, so 2 hours to get some asparagus and sushi rolls delivered to our table....unacceptable.

I am always sketchy about the whole 'gratuity included for large parties' - I find that results in the net average work going down (not up) for a server - but this situation couldn't really be pinpointed on a server phoning it in.

based on my experience here vs Tao, Tao wins out - granted, the cuisine isn't identical, but the experience is largely better at Tao.

sorry Samba baby!
