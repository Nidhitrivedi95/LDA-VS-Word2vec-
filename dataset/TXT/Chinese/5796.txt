0c6PQILCLwRZ8FIB4AEsGw Eat here every week, Honey Walnut Shrimp and Mongolian Beef are my go-to.

When I'm poor and starving the chicken chow mein is the move for only $7.50.

Prob best China One in town, staff is friendly and they are always working hard to get your food out in ten minutes or less.

Love this place.
