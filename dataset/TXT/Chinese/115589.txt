N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ Just okay. Service was fine. The jerk chicken was pretty good. Everything else wasn't worth ordering again, but there also wasn't anything wrong with the dishes (i.e. no complaints; just underwhelmed)


I was surprised to see it on Toronto Life's best new restaurants list a few weeks later.
