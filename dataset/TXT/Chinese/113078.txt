I go to other places and it's obvious they just thawed out a frozen bag of veggies and threw it in the dish. Everything tastes fresh here. I originally went to get a quick fix for a Chinese craving and left very impressed. The House Special Fried Rice is a little spicy, aromatic, and totally addicting. Their streamed dumplings seem a little sturdier than the ones I've gotten elsewhere. I really enjoy the ho fun (wide rice noodle) dishes. Delectable flavor with tender noodles. The prices are average for the neighborhood, for a one person order maybe $8-12. I definitely recommend this place if you want Chinese, but are tired of low quality ingredients or sloppy preparation. They get it done right and are friendly to boot.
