On5sceeptZSlLeGWDDGiwQ I told my friend that if I didn't find any "foreign objects" in my sesame chicken, I'd give the place a five star rating . But honestly, the food is ok. The egg roll is slacking but the chicken was pretty good. I'm not gonna lie, the place is really dirty. If you go in the restrooms, you will be met by a family of cockroaches. They're friendly though so no worries . ***ACTUAL RATING***
Food - 3.5 out of 5 stars
Sanitation - 1 out of 5
Service - 4 out of 5
