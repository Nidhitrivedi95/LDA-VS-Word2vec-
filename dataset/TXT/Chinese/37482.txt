AOrWjg7SjqrtUtp_sw6MrA I wouldn't suggest anyone to go here unless you're really desperate and hungry for absolutely anything. This is not a place where you take a person to a date, doesn't look great and the servers are sometimes unfriendly. This place gets filled at lunch time by the near by high school so i would suggest any over over the age of adolescents to find somewhere else to have your lunch break.
