ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg As expensive and rude as the staff was you would think it was the BEST food ever. NOT! The portions are TINY! Even when we ordered 7 different things to share.....they just brought single portions and it was like a tasting party. We each got 1 shrimp, 2 pieces of steak or chicken, and some rice. We left hungry. Also my brother must have got a bad shrimp because he was sick for 2 days. Skip this place! Only reason I bothered going was the view of the fountain. Big mistake.
