Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw This place is great! This is my go to Chinese place in Higley. They are fast. The quality is great, the service is fast, and its tasty!  

Their pot stickers are awesome. Their soups are all good as well. Great to get your fix here. I have always ordered take out but their inside is clean and well kept. Looks like they have some good bar options if that's your thing. Their shrimp is good and fresh as well.
