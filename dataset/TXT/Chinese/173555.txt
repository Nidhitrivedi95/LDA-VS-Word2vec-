W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g Came in to grab my hubby something for lunch. I was greeted as soon as I stepped through the door, friendly face. The hostess was pleasant. Sat at the bar to order my to go meal and was offered water, that was a plus. Then as I'm waiting the hostess brings me a bowl of soup and says "relax have a seat and enjoy some soup". I didn't expect that at all. Don't know what my husbands food taste like but I will definitely be back with service like that.
