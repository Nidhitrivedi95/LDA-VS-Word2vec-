KK7H1bVOMAJnDqMhBv2zpA Desperate need for a Friday lunch so decided to get take-out for a couple of co-workers at this Hakka Chinese place.

The lunch specials were going for one meat plus rice for $6.99 each.  Had this in the past and I get the same thing every time.  The place is one of the favourites at our office.  Gave the restaurant a ring and placed the order at around 11:50 AM.  Everything was straightforward.  She told me that it would be ready in 20 minutes.

Went to go pick it up and my order was there sitting ready to go.  Yes!  It was tightly packaged and really hot.  Nice and neat.  Excited, I asked for one set of chopsticks as I only like to eat Asian food with 'em.  Cashed out and was on my way back to work.

After distributing to my very happy co-workers, I opened my styrofoam container... mmm... Manchurian Chicken (Dry) on Rice!

The food was good.  It never really had blown me away or was so delicous but it was good enough to feed the hunger.  It had a tiny bit of spice and okay flavour but it really was just fried chicken pieces on crappy rice.  Ate more than half and was satisfied.  I have had this dish with sauce in the past and it was a spicy, soupy nightmare. The food is not even close to my favourite Hakka restaurants but like I said, did the job, no fuss, no bust.
