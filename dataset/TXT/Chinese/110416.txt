LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA Fantastic Happy Hour.. 3-7pm, 1/2 off ALL booze and ALL Apps.. For about 40 bones, you can come here with a partner, and you can do some pretty good damage through their menu.. Highlights are the Calamari, and the Dumplings.. It feels a touch drab and sparce inside, and it lacks an energy, but the food is really good..
