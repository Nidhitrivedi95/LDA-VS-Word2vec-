U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q I have eaten here 3 times. The food is great! Not too greasy and very tasty. I was surprised at some of the negative reviews. 
The most recent visit was a few days ago around 6pm. Service was fast. I have experienced their slow service but they were very busy. The busiest times i went were in the later eve...after 9pm. Besides that....i think this place is worth visiting. I love the decor and the goldfish!
