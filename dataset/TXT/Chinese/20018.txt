We went twice while we were in town, and each time, we had to wait awhile for the host/hostess to seat us. But once seated, we got our drinks and orders taken quickly, and then amazingly fast, the food arrived. The sushi took a little longer than the Chinese food, surprisingly. 

We had the Mongolian Beef  (super yummy flavor & tender beef, and not filled with a boatload of onions, thankfully), Orange Chicken (skip it - this is fried and sweet and not very good, but hubby loves it, so....), General Tso's Chicken (skip it - it's the same as the orange chicken but with a different sauce; still sweet and gloppy), String Beans with XO Sauce (omg, get these! So much flavor, not greasy, and very delicious), and some spicy tuna rolls (decent, not very spicy though).  Good fortune cookie too. :-)

Only major gripe with the place is the prices, but hey, it's Vegas. That Mongolian Beef? that's $18.95. Yeah, ouch - hence the 4 stars. But otherwise, we enjoyed it a lot.
