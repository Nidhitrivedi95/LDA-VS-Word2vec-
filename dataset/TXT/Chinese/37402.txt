anhk98859Rmo3mL6X41jbg This Panda Express gets a -3 stars from me due to the fact that when I ordered my families  food, the little girl at the window said my order back to me, but yet after I got my food, and got all the way back home.. I was missing a plate of food. Mine in particular. So I drive all the way back to panda, tell them I'm missing a plate of food and the girl looks me dead in my face and said "you didn't get it cuz I didn't charge you for it". Excuse me? WHO'S FAULT IS THAT?!? I placed an order, was repeated back my order and was charged. I should've had two plates and a kid's meal. I only got 1 plate and 1 kids meal because"I wasn't charged for it". So I tell the manager what happen and she looks at me and was like "I understand you're upset. I can give you a discount on your meal." This discount was a discount of $0.78. W.T.F?!

I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS PANDA EXPRESS BECAUSE CLEARLY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THIS PLACE IS A F**ING JOKE.
