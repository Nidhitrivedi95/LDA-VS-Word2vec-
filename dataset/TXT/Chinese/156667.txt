TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ You probably get the most bang for your buck eating here. You pay about the equivalent of what you would pay at the leading Chinese fast food restaurant, yet the food is 10x better. Lunch specials are very delicious and includes soup as well! Unlike most dine-in Chinese restaurants, refills are free as well! Staff is very polite too!
