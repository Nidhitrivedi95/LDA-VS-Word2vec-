kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is I thought the food was extremely overpriced --even for a nice place like Hakkasan-- especially the dim sum (which was one of the very few dishes that didn't taste great). Otherwise, most everything on that menu was REALLY, REALLY GOOOOOD--and I don't even like Chinese food! :P

Standouts include tofu & eggplant claypot, duck salad, and roasted silver cod with Champagne and Chinese honey. That silver cod was the group's favorite.

As for cocktails, the Hakka is to die for! It's sweet and strong! I loved it!

Service is excellent!!! THEY WILL EVEN CHARGE YOUR CELLPHONE WHILE YOU EAT! 

Can't say I will be back because there are better tasting Chinese restaurants in Vegas (like at the Wynn and Encore). However, dining at Hakkasan and heading over for a little Calvin Harris action is an experience in and of itself. So, for me, it's a "maybe" I will be back for food.
