YAhRuV3oRkwGk3Or9PJ3Ww A friendly family-run take-out Chinese restaurant.  Quality is consistent and high because every worker is of the same immediate family.  There is a small dine in area.  Food is tasty, high quality and prepared in a consistent 10 minute time frame.  We go often and have yet to be disappointed.  A great place get dinner or lunch that far outstrips its fast food rivals down the road.
