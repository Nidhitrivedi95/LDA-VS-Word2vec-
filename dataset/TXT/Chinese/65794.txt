ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw The kids always want to eat here, so we did again, even though they haven't gotten any of our takeout orders right for 2 years.  I always object. Very unfortunate for us that we stopped in for more disappointment. 

Tonight, we ordered dine in. Big mistake. We ordered chicken chow main, lettuce wraps and the teriyaki crunch roll. All the food was just terrible, even the service: the server dropped our serving spoon on the ground with part of the food from the plate and never returned. 

The chicken in the lettuce wraps didn't have any green onions, or water chestnuts, and the lettuce was hot and wilted (brown rotten). There were some crumbs of dried "something" on it. Chicken?  Who knows. 

When I inquired, they said they'd run out of their ground chicken mix for that dish and substituted. (What?, dirt). Then why offer it?

This is a big company that doesn't really care anymore. LAST time going here and my next generation agrees.  

Unfortunately, they'll be out of business soon.  Maybe we'll try the "before divorce" PF Changs. Or, the Mandarin Buffet. 10x better with sushi and 1/2 the price. Still, you'll have no idea where the "chicken" comes from at either place. 

Peiwei said they would refund the lettuce wraps, but it would take a few days for the refund.  So, they can charge you immediately, and immediately debit your bank account, but you have to wait for a refund. 

They think you'll forget. I won't. 

Craziness.
