pdy6EAcJvZks1hKogxOj6Q I ordered delivery the other night because I didn't feel like cooking and I was very tired from unpacking. We ordered chow mein, honey garlic chicken, white rice, chicken fried rice and pot stickers. Me and the boyfriend did not like the food as much. The chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture. The pot stickers were hard like a rock. The rice was cold and not fresh as it seems like. The honey garlic chicken was "OK" it did taste like sesame chicken and the chicken was smothered with sauce and sesame seeds. 

This place is only getting two stars from me for the fast delivery which they said it would take about 40 minutes but it only was about 15 minutes from phone to door. 

I will not be returning to this place unfortunately and will stick with Abacus Inn.
