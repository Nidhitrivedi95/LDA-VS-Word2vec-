s3AG8m6Pzq-vON729pf0gw For a north east Mesa sushi restaurant this place is pretty good... and it may not be THE BEST, but the food is good, a variety of sushi and chinese selection, the place is clean, the patio rocks- perfect for day drinking since it is in the shade.  The staff has turned over recently so they are still finding their stride, but they are all very nice...don't go if you are in a rush, just enjoy their expansive bar selection and martinis and generous happy hour (ALL DAY SUNDAY, yes!!!)  Korean ribs are good, the sushi rolls are big!
