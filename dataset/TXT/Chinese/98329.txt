jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw We often go here for Dim Sum at lunch.  Great selection of well prepared dishes.  Dinner has some standard Chinese dishes but also has some very authentic ones.  This restaurant smells like and tastes like a real Hong Kong restaurant in Las Vegas.  We also see buses of Chinese tourists coming here to eat.  There are large rooms to accommodate them.  Good servie.
