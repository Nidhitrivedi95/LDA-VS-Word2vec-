C1JNZrYl3H-YzF1dys9SoQ This place is quite popular as there was quite a bit of crowd even during mid week. We came here for a birthday dinner (birthday person's choice not mine) as they apparently make a few dishes that are well liked. 
We could have gone the set menu route as they do have those and they cover anywhere from 1 to 10 people. The combos seemed OK as there was sure to be something that wouldn't be offensive and you can cap your expense.
We ordered the following
Chicken Corn (decent and is more inline with what one expects it to taste) 
Spring Roll (a big portion was piping hot and well like by some)
Chicken with Cashew nuts (OK not as light as I would like but does the trick)
Fried Chicken ball with sweet and sour sauce (Mostly batter and sweet and sour sauce wasn't good as well, I would say food court level)
Chicken Manchurian (poor not what I expected as a dish synonymous to draw attention with the sizzling platter was served on a plate taste was poor as well and didn't have kick and sweet contrast that one expects)
Tofu with Mixed Vegetables (OK, Tofu had a clean taste)
Vegetable fried rice (meh)
Shrimp with Hot Chilli (the best dish we ordered IMO we ordered it hot still it had a mid level kick)
I felt bloated after the meal. Expected I suppose. This is your run of a mill place and is caters more to the western palate. Prices are reasonable. 
I would say 2.5 stars.
