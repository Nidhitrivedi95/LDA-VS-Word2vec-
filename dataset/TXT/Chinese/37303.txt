ANbBHDf1PZp5bQCkEa8YsQ The dim sum here was good, and the ingredients were fresh.  Like the previous reviewer indicated, Commerce Gate Dynasty Cuisine offers the typical dim sum items.

But service was kind of lacking.  It could be because we came here on Labour Day when everything else but the Chinese businesses were open.  Chinese people like to celebrate Labour Day by labouring.  It was very busy here and so it was difficult to get the waiters' attention.  We ordered both a kettle of xiang pian tea and a kettle of pu er tea, but instead, two kettles of xiang pian tea came.  When the bill came, they almost overcharged us - whoever wrote up the bill added an extra zero at the end of the amount, making one of the dim sum items come out to some twenty or thirty dollars. Luckily my aunt caught this with her eagle eye of bill checking and we asked one of the managers to look into it and fix it.

I am a visitor from NYC, but I've visited Toronto enough times to know there are other dim sum restaurants with food just as good and better service.
