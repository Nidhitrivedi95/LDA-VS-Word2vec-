h8zFBTYBKSwDFcHuFgwpmQ Brought my parents to the restaurant 2 weeks ago, to celebrate mother's day and my father's birthday. Overall it was great experience and the food is great.

environment 5/5
service 5/5
food 4/5

I love the environment. The decor is simple and fitting. Also, the table is huge, so you have plenty of room (unlike many other restaurants).

Service is great. The server does does the "cooking" for you, and set the timer. In our case, the server was always there when the food is ready. We went on a week day, so the restaurant was half full. It might be a challenge if the restaurant is filled. Server is very knowledgeable of the food and the cooking method. Also, very friendly. My parents had a good time chatting with her.

For three of us, we ordered combo C for two and some a la cart items. They had to make a few replacement to the combo items, but we were not informed about it at the time of ordering.The congee base is a must. It tasted sooo good.The Spain iberico pork kebab wasn't that impressive, but the Spain iberico pork jowl meat kebab is great. The seafood tasted good and very fresh, but not super impressive. You can make your own sauce, but it's the typical selections you see at any AYCE hot pot place.

Not a cheap meal, so bring cash to take advantage of the discount.

Considering only the food and the price, I might give it 3/5, but the service is great and it is a very unique experience. So 4/5 overall.
