tZ-h-gFhIWnrC4TR_N9K_Q Glad to have Chinese food options without having to go to Hwy 7! This has become my weekend lunch regular spots. The restaurant is spacious and the decor inside is quite modern as well. Pretty good service, the servers are polite and food is brought over fairly quickly. 

Some of my favourite dishes are the Congee with Salted Pork and Century Egg and fried Taiwanese vermicelli. The side snacks like fried chinese crullers are great options as well. They also have BBQ options available, great for takeouts. 

Prices are very decent, highly recommend.
