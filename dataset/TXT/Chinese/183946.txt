xuD16x4Jlc__QMtl-AY6Xg I primarily come here for the dim sum, been to one wedding banquet. 
They still charge $2.68 for s/m/l dim sum all day and weekends except holidays, but they have recently changed their menu...and alot that disappoints me. They still have the staples such as har gow which is plump full of shrimp but the wrapper is pretty weak, but they've taken out some good dishes and added in special order ones, that cost $5-8.
but it's still the cheapest one in town!
