4STzP1q1uM8ONkKookifsw Noodle soup was okay.  I've definitely had better food, nothing to really write about, I wouldn't have log on to yelp them if it wasn't for the service.  Talk about discriminating!  Not sure if its because they don't like children or Chinese, or perhaps we just look cheap because we were in shorts and t-shirts.  Unfortunately they've misjudged us!  Normally we leave at least 18% for decent service, today we left them a 2% for no service. They made no attempt to check on us, made no attempt to refill our drinks.  I attempted to get the waiter's attention twice, and he totally looked the other way and ignore me.  I also asked him for bowls for my kids to share their noodles when he brought us our food, he ignored me as well.  Don't think I'm making a mistake because he keep his attention to the table behind us, they were a table of 5, all Caucasians, he went there to refill their waters when it was more than half full.  Figure he refill ours since he has the water pitcher, unfortunately he walked away and didn't even respond when I said "excuse me."  He went to the other table time after time to check on them.  Disappointing, so had to yelp about them.  The one star is for the food, so do take out only here.
