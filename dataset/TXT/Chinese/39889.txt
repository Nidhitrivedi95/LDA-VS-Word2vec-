The service is always on point. It's like a well oiled machine. High speed and efficiency! 

Ambiance:
Your locate neighbourhood HK cafe. Seating is usually tight, and expect a long lineup during peak hours like lunch and weekends. They recently got a makeover, so it now looks more modern and clean. 

Food:
This is one of my favourite spot to grab a quick bite. The food quality is always consistent, and the price is right. I never leave this place hungry. Most of the menu items are your typical HK dishes.
