yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Went here twice in one day.  Not because it is awesome food, but because it is open 24hrs and was accessible.  The Pho is great.  But my favorite is the beef cube.  The biggest disappointment this time was the chicken fried rice.  There was hardly any chicken and very bland.  Not sure if it was because it was 2:30am and they ran out or not.  But other than that, a good place to get your late night fix.
