5GcHJvxiTrIt23gB0qMdjw Located in a complex that is anchored by Sunny Supermarket, there are a lot of other choices. What drew us to this place was the promise of cold HK milk tea. On that front, it did not disappoint. I'd give this place 4 stars if that were my only criteria. Why I docked it one star: Around JUne '12 when they jacked up their prices. OK jacked up = started charging $2 for combos of soup and HK tea- which previously came with meals). Hard to adjust perception when you're so used to the cheap stuff. Ostentsibly they were trying to improve their image: menus became nicer, and colored paper stuck to the wall advertising specials, disappeared. Not sure it was worth the extra toonies ;)
