cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A I wasn't sure if Chino Bandido was a bit racist since it translates to Chinese Bandit, but it is so damn delicious I don't really care. The fusion restaurant steals flavors typically found in Americanized Chinese meals and combines them in bowls, burritos, and qusadillas. My favorites are the fiery Pollo Diablo, the savory Jade Red Chicken (similar to General Tso's), and the shiny Emerald Chicken. The jerk fried rice is addicting but its spicy peppers are not friendly on the tongue. I felt like I was robbing the place because of the huge portions at low prices. The meals also came with a snickerdoodle cookie.
