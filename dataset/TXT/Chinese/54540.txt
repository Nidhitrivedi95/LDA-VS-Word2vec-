csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA One of our favorite places to eat out (or get take out from). Even our 4 and 6 year olds love it. The noodle bowls are fabulous. Curry surprise is the best. Love the sushi and they even have soy wrappers. Not on the menu so just ask. If you are in the area and in the mood for Asian definitely give it a try!
