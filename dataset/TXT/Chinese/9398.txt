1rbb8ntTOpSolQv60CGcsQ Epic disappointment. $50 purchase and we would have been better off with fast food. 

The Orange Chicken is close to flavorless and worse, the breading is somehow both stale and soggy (worst I've ever had - not even a HINT of vinegar, crushed red pepper, garlic or ginger). 

The Moo Shu Pork is also devoid of flavor and the pancakes that come with are thick, dry, and stale. 

Ordered the Pao Chow Beef EXTRA spicy - it was not even mildly spicy. The beef was riddled with fat and the opposite of crispy. 

The pot stickers were soggy with thick fleshy wrappers... innards were almost flavorless. 

Honestly even frozen dinner Chinese food is better than this. Never again.
