A53Cd9oyCFXcD80mZLyTcA Regal 16 is literally 5 mins away from me but can someone remind me why I haven't been here for over 5 years for Dim Sum.  Oh yes, I remember now after coming here on snowy afternoon last month.  The Dim sum is as bad as I remember it to be. The service was slow and they keep bringing us the wrong dishes.

The rice-noodle wrap with fried fritter was the worst. The rice wrap just falls off easily and the fried fritter was rock-hard and I can tell it was from yesterday or something.  Disguisting!!  

Decor here doesn't stand out and the layout of the place is just weird.  The parkign lot is a mess as well as they never have enough spots during the lunch hours.  I would not come here anytime soon. Maybe another 5 years if they are still here.
