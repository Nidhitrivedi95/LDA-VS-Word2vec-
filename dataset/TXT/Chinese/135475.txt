qbDaSyxDfUZNheucJym2Pg Went there with a group of six people for dinner on a Sunday night and we were sat at a round table which was so wobbly you couldn't put your elbows on the table...so we all got up and moved over to the next table.  It took about 15 minutes for anyone to come over and wait on us even though there was only two other tables in the entire restaurant.  We ordered drinks, but my daughter wanted a 7up which never came.  After getting up to find the waitress, they finally delivered it only to have it completely flat without any carbonation at all.  Apps came out with the dinners and the soups were cold.  I just got the feeling nobody really cared.  :-(  Got my bill and it was $31.00 for one meal I split with my daughter...Since we had such a large "group", they already tacked on an 18% tip...nice for crap service and food!  Never going back.
