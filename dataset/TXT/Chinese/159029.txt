u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ I was brought here by my Chinese friend and his parents for an impromptu dinner. There were a lot of Chinese families and couples in there and it appeared at one point I was the only non-Chinese in the restaurant excluding the Mexican waiter. This is a good thing to see -  along with waitstaff wearing bow ties.

Eventually, other diners arrived who were non-Chinese so they must have received the memo.

This is by far one of my favorite Chinese restaurants and I've eaten Chinese in Hong Kong and San Francisco. With a very extensive menu, KJs has something to delight everyone on your party.

I asked my friend's mother about a few signs written in Chinese characters that were posted in the dinning area. She told me it said 20% off between the hours of 10pm and 2am. So next time you are in Vegas, forgo the steak dinner with the boys and hit up KJs in the Chinatown section of LV. You will feast on some of the most authentic Chinese fare and save a ton of money for the slots.

Cheap, authentic and great portions.
