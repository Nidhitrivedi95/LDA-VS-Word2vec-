h7As2jB8bhfFxCMCvdssWA I've been coming to this restaurant for literally my whole life and the food has been outstanding, till a couple of months ago. I don't know what's changed, maybe new cooks? I don't know but nothing tastes the same. I did notice new employees, maybe that's the cause? Whatever it is, it's not making me want to come back. I want the old cooks back!!
