gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw Wow, surprised by the previous reviews, and I'm glad I didn't read them before going.  

I was driving by and was starved so stopped here for a quick lunch.  I'm currently trying the no/low-carb thing so I ordered their sashimi lunch combo, which was supposed to be 9 pcs of sashimi plus a CA roll.  I asked if they could sub 2 more pcs of sashimi instead of the roll and they had no problem with it.

The fish was fresh and tasty.  The miso soup it came with was also good.  The ice tea I had was good as well.

All in all, a great stop, and I would come again if I were in the area.
