iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A I ordered my food via eat24, it took an hour, then they called and said it would be another hour so we said cancel our order. About 20 minutes later they call us from the parking lot. We had already gotten food from another place by then. Then they called us again like "oh you didn't want your food??" (We said that 3 times on the phone the first time) the lady was so rude. Will not order again.
