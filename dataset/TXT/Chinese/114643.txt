mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w I was looking for a good dim sum restaurant in the area to take the hubby for his birthday dinner and found East Ocean Dim Sum. This place had 3 stars and the low ratings usually make me a little nervous. But, I like to see it for myself so we tried it anyway. 

I have to say that we had an excellent experience. We were greeted with smiles and seated immediately. The first dim sum cart came as soon as we settled at our table and we tried the steamed pork bun, shrimp shumai, steamed chicken feet, smelt and fried wontons. Most of the dim sum orders came with about 3 pieces. We also ordered egg foo yung, shrimp fried rice, fried chicken and honey walnut shrimp. In the end, the service was great and everything was delicious!
