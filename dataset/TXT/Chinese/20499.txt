5zk3LxFzijmY2JipVZ7Xdg First let me start by saying that my family and I have been looking for a Chinese restaurant for over 2.5 years since moving from Miami, Florida. I think we may have just found it! We were sceptical at first but straight out the service was great. As soon as we walked it we were greeted with a warm hello. We got seated and ordered our food.. the wonton soup is not what I'm used to but it was delicious, the egg rolls were too.. honestly the only complaint is have which isn't a big one but their "fried rice" was just rice soy sauce and egg.. again not what I'm used too.. but oh so good!! Will definitely be back.
