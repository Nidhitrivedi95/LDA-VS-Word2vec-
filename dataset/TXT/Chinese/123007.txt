Oi-u4KqrcZbIWSYKnh7mJA I've eaten from coast to coast and Fortune Cookie II is the best Chinese food I've had. I now reside in California but whenever I come back to the east coast, I make it a must to visit this place at least once. 

I've ordered the crab Rangoon, shrimp fried rice, cashew nut chicken, shrimp egg foo young and several other dishes and they're always consistent in preparation and delicious. 

The food is brought out in a timely manner and is priced well. 

The staff is always friendly and attentive.  

This is definitely my go to spot for Chinese food in Charlotte.
