qAbXHsddBhmfQFegGiV7Dg Ordered via UberEats due to a promotion and actually threw it all away.

Deep Fried Rolls were over fried and tasted burnt.

Kobe Roll had chewy beef.

Neither the Kobe roll nor a Dragon roll were properly rolled or cut.  They fell apart at first touch.

Best part was the free egg roll and its all that was eaten.
