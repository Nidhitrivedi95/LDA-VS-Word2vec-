BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ I used to love Plum! It was my go-to place in Pittsburgh with really fresh fish, a decent wine list, and a nice ambiance. But something I happened the last couple of times I was there! I was there last Sat night and noticed that the sushi has gone seriously downhill- fish not fresh - seriously not fresh. And what was once a reliably bountiful yummy salad was now a sad, meager, wilted salad. The place was chaotic- open tables but lots of people waiting around for tables. My bartender was the only bright spot- he was apologetic about the general chaos and disorganization and did his best to compensate with wine and sympathy. 

But my dear Plum please reverse whatever changes you have made - whether it be with fish suppliers, chefs, or management! I want the old you back!
