This place has been bookmarked for quite some time, but I just had the op to visit it, and it's GREAT!

Initially, I was seated inside the 'Tea' section, but asked to be moved when an available table came up.  The 2 tables that were set up in the 'Tea' section were just too make shift, dark, and separate from the rest of the restaurant.  Getting service there would've been difficult 'cause it's behind a divider.

Highlights of all that was ordered (pictured):
-  Enoki Mushroom Balls - which were more like mini wraps, soo yummy!  The "balls" themselves were wrapped in seaweed and deep fried
-  Pan-fried Green Tea Cake - more mochi, love the flavour of the green tea filling
-  Asst. Seitan Platter - I've had this before, but it's a good dish since there are different flavours in 1 dish, bbq, sweet 'n sour, curry, etc.
-  Zen Garden Milk Green Tea - also very good.  Tasted like the "Milk Green Tea", sans bubbles, that you'd order, but better!  It did come out warm and slightly too sweet, so you hafta wait 'til some of the ice melts

I could've done without the Har-Gow, Sao Mai, Dumplings.  They were good, but the filling themselves were just too "loose".  Not as firm as they would be with pork, shrimp, etc.  Still good though, but I just wouldn't order them next time.

I wanted to order the Coloured Crystal Balls, from the Dim Sum menu, but they were out, so next time!

I wished that they had more photos on their menu.  It's more helpful if you read Chinese, but there are parts of the menu which aren't descriptive at all, re:  Dim Sum.

If you like Dim Sum, but not necessarily the MSG-coma, check this place out!  It's somewhat near the airport.  Service was nice 'n calm, not crazy/rude/rough/rushed like usual Chinese places.
