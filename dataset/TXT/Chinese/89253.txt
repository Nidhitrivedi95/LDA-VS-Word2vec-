I6oxEn1HT41S2GPrDKPPvA WORST RESTAURANT EVER! Must have changed management cause now there is a charge for tea (server did not notify us), no fortune cookies when paying the bill, and no credit under 20$. No sign letting the customer know of the cash policy and when confronted, the manager did not say anything except rudely stating that they "don't need a sign" after multiple attempts to an answer. Spring roll was cold and dishes took forever to come out despite it being 8am and pretty much empty. Perfect was always shady with poor service but today just took it to another level. I won't be visiting this place ever again and I don't recommend anyone else either.
