M28FGxlpihDrbPCuTfUB6w We ordered a variety of dishes from their menu. We had the hot and sour soup, it really lacked flavour and it seemed watered down. The onion pancake was good, but not great. 

We tried the juicy pork buns and pork with bok choy dumplings. They both seemed soggy, the dough itself was not that great. 
Mother Dumplings in one word, mediocre.
