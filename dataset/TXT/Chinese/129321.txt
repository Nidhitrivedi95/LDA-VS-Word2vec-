pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Food was awesome! Service was great.

My only complaint was the surprise liquor fee we were charged for a non-alcoholic beverage. We asked if this was a mistake and was told that it's a standard fee since its in the mixed drink menu. So a $8 drink magically became $16. They should just put the real price on the menu.

Other than that, we definitely enjoyed our experience at Sushisamba.
