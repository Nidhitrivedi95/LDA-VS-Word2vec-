CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ If you have never been to a hot pot  before you should try this one!
Hotpot is the process of cooking your food in a hot boiling pot infront of you.

21.99 for all you can eat dinner
+ 3 to 5 dollars for broth
3 for small
5 for large
If you share a pot with someone just gwt the regular broth in large ..they will bring it out in 2 halves one half will be spicy.

Food is great!
Fresh! 
Comes out fast!
Servers are patient and explain how the restaurant works in fluent english
Situated in china town montreal
Pot heats up quickly
Cooking time is fast
Free pop/ice tea
Free veggie spring rolls and peaches/pineapple on the side
They stack the dishes beside your table which is nice so you have space at your table if you are sitting at a 2 seater small table.
They have noodles, tripe, veggies, potato, seafood, beef,lamb etc. I dont believe there was chicken which i am thankful for as chicken is risky if you do not cook it long enough.
They fill your pot with hot water if your broth steams itself out too much.
They accept cash debit and credit -pay at the bar when you are done.
I would recommend walking into china town vs driving.
Great experience!
