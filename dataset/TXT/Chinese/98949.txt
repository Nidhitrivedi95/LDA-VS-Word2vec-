Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ The dimsum was good but it made me sick not to mention the rudeness of the cashier.  I went there to get food to go and the wait was ridiculous. Could not understand why considering they didn't have to cook anything and the cashier was so freaking rude not to mention it really made me so sick. Don't think will go back there again. Rude!  Ping pang pong from now on for us!  No more orchids garden for us ever!!  Typical Chinese service!
