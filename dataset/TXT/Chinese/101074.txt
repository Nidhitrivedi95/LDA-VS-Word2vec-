Keung's Delight is a typical Chinese restaurant, but for me, I don't find anything outstanding about it. Food is either slightly above average or mediocre. I'm usually here just because it's convenient or it's because my family wants to come here. 

My most recent visit was with a friend. We ordered four dishes. One of them was a deep fried calamari dish that was disappointing. No crunch to the batter, and the distribution of spices was awful (some pieces were super salty and the rest were bland). It felt like I was eating cold leftovers. Another dish was the baked spaghetti. That was okay, but it could've used more cheese. A lot more cheese. 
The other two (congee and an eggplant dish) were quite good. I think the eggplant dish (it's in one of the hot stone pots) is one of their best executed dishes. 

Service was standard. No complaints or compliments. 

I'm going to give this place a three to be fair, because it is an okay restaurant, but in my heart it's more like a two.
