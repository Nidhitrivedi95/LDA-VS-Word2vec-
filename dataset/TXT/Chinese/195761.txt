ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg This is a Chinese version of a Denny's. 
Fast, Filling, Family Style, and Friendly on the wallet.

Honestly, this is my family's go to place when we are too lazy to cook.  

Beware that the line can be out the door on weekend nights from 6:30-8 PM, with a wait that can be  up to half an hour.  Call ahead for takeout.

Recommendations:
Salt + Pepper Fish- their salt and pepper seasoning is like crack, it's so good
Congee (that's a given, it's named Congee Queen)
Any of their bbq meats are good (ex: Roasted pork)
Wonton Noodles in Soup
Hot Pot Rice (takes a while to come out though, about 20 min after the order)
Crispy Catonese Chow Mein
Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll
