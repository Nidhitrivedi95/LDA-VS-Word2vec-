UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw Stopped in at an off time and it had several tables full. Only one waitress was taking care of everyone. 

I feel like the Bamboo Club of old had a little more going for it.  The lunch portions are very small, the iced tea tasted old, the whole restaurant feels like it needs updating.
