BJ9GwNMo8vIgSuKc6B_mOw I had high expectations for Dynasty when I walked in. It was very different than my regular dim sum spot on Gerrard East, Pear Court. Table linens, no carts, beautiful space. We ordered WAY too much food and as a result maybe it spoiled our appetite, but I found the xiu mai inedible. No spices or any taste, they literally tasted like steamed pork. I did like the noodles and bok choy, but for the price there are dim sum spots leaps and bounds better than Dynasty.
