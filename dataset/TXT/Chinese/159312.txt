u3wWKIIdTZuAYqa2jHJoxA I love Hunan food, and have been looking for a good place in Toronto. This place is really good. The dishes were really flavourful (especially the lamb dishes). Great Hunan food. It's definitely spicy but not overwhelming. 

The portions are pretty decent. Two dishes (plus rice) would be enough for 2 with leftovers to spare. 

They have a membership where you pay $20 to join and you can get cheaper prices on most dishes... Il be signing up for that. Also looks like they have good deals on the lunch specials. 

Will definitely return (again and again)
