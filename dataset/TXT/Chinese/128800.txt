PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ The service was good but the food was sub-par. As the first dim sum place I have had in Vegas, I wished the experience was much better. The place is itself is nothing to rave about. I only came here as for convenience in location.

The selection was sub par. The har gow and shu mai was not very fresh tasting. Few times in my life have I not finished a dish and their har gow was one. The skin was not chewy with a nice bite. It was thick and almost stale. I enjoyed their taro dumplings but it was filled grease (grease residue means it was not sat out to let it seep through before serving).

I really wish the dim sum was spectacular but unfortunately it was not.
