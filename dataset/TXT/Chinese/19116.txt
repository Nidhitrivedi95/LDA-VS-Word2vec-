I stopped by for lunch and ordered the Zha Jiang Noodles.  This dish was very spicy, more than I expected.  The menu did have a chili pepper by the item, but I've never had Zha Jiang noodles that gave me the sweats.  Whoa buddy.

Besides that dish, I probably had the best beef rolls ever.  It was authentic style and they even added egg in it so it tasted like the Taiwanese breakfast Dan Bing.  Da Bomb yo!  Noodle pot taking it to the next Level baby! The only downside was it was really oily.  So you women prepare to start dabbing with your tissue.

I look forward to going back and trying the beef noodle that everyone is raving about.
