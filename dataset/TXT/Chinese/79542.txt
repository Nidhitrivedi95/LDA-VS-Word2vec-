GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Shout out to Brandon- OUTSTANDING SERVICE.  He runs one of the bars and navigated me from hangry to happy.   The mix of tacos and asian dishes are outstanding   The cocktails he makes are great too.   So good in fact, I've spent this weekend trying to mimic them- I'm close on the mojito.

Either way, both lunch and snacks here were great.   So good that I broke a rule and ate there twice on a four day work trip.

Highly recommended.
