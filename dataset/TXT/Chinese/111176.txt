When you first walk in there is hope for the place.  As you cross the threshold, however, you realize you were wrong.  Very, very wrong.  It was, again, $30 for us to eat and drink.  Fine.  Common for Chinese buffet.  IF ANYTHING WAS EDIBLE!!!!

The floor was filthy.  The table was dirty where we were seated.  We were told to go get our food first and when we came back it would be clean.  How appetizing.

Not only were all the selections WELL picked over, they were also cold, and tasteless.  I was afraid to select anything, let alone eat it.  All the silverware I pulled out of the cups was dirty.  Not water-stained - but had FOOD still stuck to it.  *shiver*

As I walked around choosing my food (carefully) I stumbled upon the section of BABY OCTOPUS.  Now, folks, I don't care what you eat... But I do not need to see 50 WHOLE DEAD BABY CREATURES.  That was what pushed me over the edge.  You can't have dirty floors, dirty tables, a dirty Mongolian bar area, serve CRAP CRAP CRAP skirt steak to my husband, have 100% cold picked-over food, and then have a TRAY full of dead baby grossness.

Can't deal.  Won't deal.  I ate one sweet-roll thing, hubby picked his food over... and that was the end.  I would not recommend this place to ANYONE.
