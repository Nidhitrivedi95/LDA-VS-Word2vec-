A 10 course dinner with dessert is ~$300, tax and tip inclusive. Great for celebrating special occasions with friends and family. The assortment is well planned and the quality is quite good. Also suggest coming in car pool because the parking lot is horribly inadequate. Park at the plaza next door.
