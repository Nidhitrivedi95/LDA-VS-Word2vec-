tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg Our family and I have been coming to this delicious restaurant for over 15 years and it's our absolute favorite Chinese Restaurant. The service is pleasant and welcoming. The menu has great dishes and taste amazing! Some of our recommendations are the Bean Curb Soup, Szechuan Eggplant and Dan Dan Noodles! Raymond the owner is loving and treats the customers with a great deal of respect. This is a must try-hands down!! Super Yummy!!!
