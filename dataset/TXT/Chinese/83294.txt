hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA After debating on what to eat one night, my house mate suggested Krazy Buffet. For dinner it's all your can eat for about 11 bucks. The food options are vast and the servers are on point with refills, clearing the table and just overall great service. 

The house mate commented on how great the soft-serv ice cream was haha.  I also noticed that the decor was very modern and clean unlike others. So far I've visited Krazy twice and the service has been consistent.
