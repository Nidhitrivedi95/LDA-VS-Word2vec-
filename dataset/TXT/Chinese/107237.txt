L8DX7Jxt5r6lS68AOG43hg I cannot tell a lie. Gulp.  I kinda, sorta, maybe, enjoyed my Panda Express...a little. The shame, the shame. It's an unauthentic fast-food version of Chinese fast-food (like Pei-Wei) and in a pinch, it'll do. 

It was one of those nights where I was at work, didn't know what I wanted to eat, but it sure wasn't the Healthy Choice frozen meal in the freezer. Then it dawned on me, I might as well give Panda Express a shot, since I haven't been there since my teenage years. 

On my plate, steamed white rice, steamed veggies, Kobari Beef and the Honey Walnut Shrimp. 

The Kobari beef was salty, slightly spicy and sweet...the shrimp, battered, deep fried and coated in a sweet sauce with candied walnuts.  

I felt guilty eating it.  It was obviously not the healthiest meal. (Despite the white rice and steamed veggies...I did a quick Google search and it turned out my meal had well over 1,000 calories, but let's not think about that.) 

Overall, it is what it is.  Fast-food American Chinese food.  The food isn't necessarily fresh-- although I do see fresh produce in the prep area...the shrimp did have a strange previously-frozen quality. If they offered brown rice and some healthier options, I just may hit it up again when the urge strikes.
