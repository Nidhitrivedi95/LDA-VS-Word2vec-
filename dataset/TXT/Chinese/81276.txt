GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg We have been looking for revolving sushi places since we got back from Hong Kong.  We found Teharu in Tempe and really liked it...at first, but after going back a few more times the charm of that place really started to fade. Everything from the seating, to the music, to the freshness of the sushi just seemed to be lacking more and more each visit.  I found Seksun on Yelp and had even driven up to this place before but I was a little put off by the parking lot...not very appealing...kind of deserted looking, and the place always looked empty, which is also off-putting, but my husband and I decided to finally get out of the car and go in and WOW we were so glad we did.  Hands down better then Teharu!!!  The seating is so much better, all tables, just the layout of the place is way better, has less of a "Walmart" vibe to it then Teharu does...and the sushi was very fresh  It's was so nice to be able to sit at a table and face each other and have a nice time. I like that all the sushi was clearly marked and listed what was in each item as they came around on the stainless steel conveyor. The waiter was super friendly. AND it's way closer then driving out to Tempe to be cramped up to the conveyor with very little elbow or table room!  I was even reluctant to write a good review cause I feel like it's our "new secret place!" but I also would like to see them stay around a while.  I really think that if the parking lot was more appealing, like Teharu's parking lot, this place would be crazy busy all the time.
