Unfortunately there's not much seating otherwise I'd rate it a 5, if they ever expand I'm sure they'll make a killing. 

I've tried the rice/chicken combos, good portions, great prices and tastes fresh, I believe everything is made to order.

I love going for the spicy beef noodles and stinky tofu, there's no other place in TO that can make it like Wei's, reminds of Taiwan night market. 

They also have frozen dinners, they can't compare to the fresh versions but they're better then ones you get from T&T.
