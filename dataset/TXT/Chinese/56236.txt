CZK8pOfcrG7QhhZTfeis8g There is a reason why we drive all the way from Mississauga to have dim sum at Yang's - it's cuz the food is AWESOME! We always complain that there's no good dim sum place in Mississauga, and as a result, we don't mind the hour-long drive for good food. We try to place our order before 11:00 am to get the early bird special (all small, medium, and large dishes are charged at the small dish price). My fav is the shrimp ball covered with almond slices. Their rice noodles are fresh, congee is nice and thick, deep fried shrimp dumpling is always hot and crispy and is packed with shrimp. If only this restaurant was closer - I would go every week! The decor is modern with chandeliers and high ceilings, without being tacky, service is excellent - the waiters are attentive and comes to refill our teapot frequently. First Markham place is close by, so there's a place to walk off the dim sum afterwards :)
