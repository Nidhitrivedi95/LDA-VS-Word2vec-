pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I still can't believe this place. The sushi was second rate and did not taste fresh. The red miso soup was good but the mushrooms did not sit well with me. I ordered the 5 handroll assortment and they were super small and flavorless.

The service was also extremely poor; our food for 1 hour to come out, the server barely came to check in on us for drink refills, and when we were paying the check she would take each credit card back INDIVIDUALLY to charge and then take the next couple's card back to charge... very odd.
