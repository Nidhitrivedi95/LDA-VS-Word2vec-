U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q I was very disappointed with my meal here. It is WAY overpriced, even by Vegas standards.

I had the Black Pepper chicken. It was like Beef and Broccoli, but with asparagus instead of the broc. Very bland and flavorless. Had to heap on the chili sauce to enhance the flavor. 

Others in my group had the mushroom & poor noodle dish. The noodles were very good, but the mushroom sauce was just mediocre. Another dish we shared was the fried eggplant sauce. These were limp and soaked in oil. The flavor was fine, but there just wasnt much going on with this dish.

We had 3 iced teas at a whopping $5 each!!! As well as a side (1 cup) of steamed rice ($3). The final bill was $80. Ouch. I wasn't even full. We used a $50 food voucher and and I STILL felt like I overpaid. 

I would rather eat Panda Express and I don't even like that place.

If you are in Caesar's, come here and watch the chefs make fresh noodles and check out the decor. It's a super unique finish. But then keep moving...Vegas has too many great options to bother with this spot.
