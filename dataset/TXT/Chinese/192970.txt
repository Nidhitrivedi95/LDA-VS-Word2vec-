ZckxLuc9lpz9LDAQlMKWiA My friend and I quite coincidently parked in Chinatown and then spontaneously decided to get dimsum. Because we didn't know a good place, my friend asked random Chinese ladies to recommend a place. Thus we came here. 

The food was really good except all the fried dishes has too little filling. And it was very oily. Everything else was very good. My favorite was the rice noodles filled with tofu! The service wasn't that fast but it wasn't slow either. I'd definitely come back here again if I'm ever in Montréal.
