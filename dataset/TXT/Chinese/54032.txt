cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ If decor is what you are looking for, this is the place to go.  It's amazing how much they spend on the decor of this place.  This is an AYCE Chinese place.  Their food is gross.  You can't eat decor!  I don't know how anyone can say how good their food is.  They are just not good.  It's no different than any of the other AYCE joints.  I gave them one star for the decor and another star for their service.  Waiters were really nice but their food is like how Chinese food was 30 years ago.  This is Toronto.  Home of the best chinese food in North America.  Do yourself a favour and eat authentic Chinese food and not Chinese food that was made for non-Chinese.  We are already in 2011 not 1970.
