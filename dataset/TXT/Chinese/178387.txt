X3ixtoD0xjiVtxROlU_2wg Lilly was great! Got the 30 minute foot massage which came with the foot reflexology, and head neck and back massage while your feet soak in warm water for $25. Everyone was friendly and professional. The facility is very nice and clean. I was in a room with a curtain entrance for the foot massage and the have rooms with doors for the full body massage. I was able to walk in at 4:30pm and get in without any problem. Upon leaving they gave me a stamp card and a coupon for $$ off my next foot and full body massage. I will definitely be back again.
