ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg Came to this luxurious cantonese spot for my birthday dinner in January. 
 The Eggplant dish was amazing and probably the most mouth watering eggplant I have ever tried by far! Our vegetable fried riced was a bit off tasting of fresh egg, needed some more ginger to tone that down. It was quite overpriced considering it was a vegetarian dish, nonetheless the portions are big to share. The best part was the most amazing green tea creme brulee ever! The servers were awesome and even brought over a mini mouse cake to celebrate my birthday. Sarah the manager was very nice and made sure we received the best  treatment. She kept checking in on us and I found that to be quite impressive.  I will definitely recommend this place again as it is super romantic, overlooking the bellagio fountains and the view is stunning from the restaurant.  Oh did I mention the 200 dollar rosenthal versace plates. Yup! They are gold plated. You get a crappy plate to eat on by when you first arrive, those are used as display plates and are quite exquisite! If you want a great dining experience then here is the place!!
