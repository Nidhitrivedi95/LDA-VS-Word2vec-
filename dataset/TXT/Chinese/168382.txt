Voy_shxcm2YnHQOtfUj1KQ Foods are authentic!  Most of the foods are spicy yet delicious, and the non-spicy Yun Nan rice noodle soup is the best for real!  In a flavorful clear broth, the rice noodles are cooked al-dente and makes good comfort food!  Always packed but the high turnover rate helps get everyone seated quickly.  The only bad thing here is that credit cards are not acceptable, meaning Bring Cash!
