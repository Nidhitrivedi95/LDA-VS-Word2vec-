Y22IfhXChXoRp3vKi6QwaQ So delicious and so real Chinese food!!! I'm grateful that we found a such good Chinese restaurant in Montreal.  They offer Sichuan, Cantonese, and Hunan cuisines. I've been here so many times and I must say each dish was very tasty and yummy! 
Oh, btw, this location was another restaurant called "new dynasty"; Now "Kanbai" take the place and did a renovation. It's very clean and beautiful now. And I have to say: foods in Kanbai are much better than New Dynasty!!!
