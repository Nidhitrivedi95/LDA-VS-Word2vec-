-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg I had lunch with a friend at Saigon recently and I have to say, the food wasn't as I expected. It was different than other Vietnamese restaurants that I have dined in. The food was good, but it seemed Americanized. I ordered chicken and rice with a side of veggies. The quality of the food was very good.  I poured my container of fish sauce on the dish and stirred it up. Doing that made the dish. Without the fish sauce, this dish would've been tasteless.  I enjoyed the texture and flavor of the rice.  The chicken had a funky, unseasoned flavor.  They need to work on that.

I'll probably be back to try something else, but if you can't get chicken and rice right, the return trip isn't deserved.
