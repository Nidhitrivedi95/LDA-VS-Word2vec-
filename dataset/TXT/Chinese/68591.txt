euksvHm653hJMJBqzcvMzQ This review is solely based on the service we received. Upon entering we were merely directed to a table and provided no menus. The host simply walked back to his stand. We sat and chatted, waiting for a waiter to at least bring us some menus. The delay took excessively long. We watched the workers talk in the back, only to have one person to run 1 thing out at a time. The place wasn't busy, it was a Wednesday around noon, so I can't attribute the flaw in service to being overwhelmed.  The waiter finally came to our table to take our drink order. We stated we had received no menus and, being new to the restaurant, had no idea what drinks were available. He stated he would get us menus after he got our drinks, ignoring our previous statement. We restated it, and the host rustled up some menus. The waiter then walked away to another table before giving us a chance to place drink orders at least. Overall the experience just felt very rude and we perceived it as them blatantly ignoring us. We proceeded to leave thereafter due to the poor service. Again, I have no opinion of their food because thr service was bad enough to cause us to leave before even ordering. Hope others have a better experience.
