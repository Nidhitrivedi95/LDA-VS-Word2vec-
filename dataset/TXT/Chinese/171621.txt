VZ7rS4awhk5iWiji6OuY-A Trying to find some good ethnic food in Mississauga, I came here with two friends for dinner.  Prices are quite inexpensive, food is plentiful and delicious.  We ordered naan, an eggplant dish, Manchurian chowmein, a chicken dish, mango lassis, and some chilli paneer.  All were almost completely consumed except the eggplant dish (slightly too much mango pickle in the sauce that also made it look somewhat unappetizing.)

Also - love the decor, which I think belonged to what was previously a seafood restaurant.  Maybe they could pass it off as "coastal Indian/Chinese food"?  Lastly, the music selection is super amazing too - one example- Gangnam Style instrumental with someone singing in Hindi on top.  YES!!!

Lastly, I think the proprietors also have a good sense of hustle - in their menus they touted quite a number of loyalty programs.  

I will be returning next time I feel like some Hakka food.
