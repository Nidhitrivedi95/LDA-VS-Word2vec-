hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q BEST NOODLES AND DUMPLINGS IN THE BURG! 

Hi my darlings! Hong Kong noodles are here to stay in Squirrel Hill thanks to Everyday Noodles. I ALWAYS want to try this place but a line out the door kept me at bay until recently!

I went to EN with new BF and got vegetarian soup dumplings, pork dumplings and noodles. I was in heaven! The soup dumplings are delicate and flavorful. The handmade dumplings...that you watch come together in the window...superb! The ratio of filling to dough is spot on and the broth in the dumplings is filled with rich flavors.

It's carb heaven here and oh so exciting to watch them hand stretch noodles right in front of you. I will come again and I would like to try different styles of noodles and preparations. I hear the crab dumplings are excellent.

Come here! Wait in line if you must! It's worth it ENTIRELY!
