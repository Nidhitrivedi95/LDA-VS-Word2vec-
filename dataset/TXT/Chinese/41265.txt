b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag I went to Chin Chin in New York New York hotel and Casino Las Vegas this evening and our service from water Oscar was incredible. He was very personable and polite. My boyfriend said "if I ever come back to Vegas it will be because of the great service we had here". I got the Vegas roll of course since I was in Vegas it seemed fitting and it did not disappoint. I was celebrating my birthday and Oscar and the rest of the wait staff brought me an amazing complimentary cheesecake. Highly recommend.
