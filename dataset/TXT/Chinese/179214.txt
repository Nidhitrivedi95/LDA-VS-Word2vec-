We had no idea the main venue was on the top floor until 3 hours into the night when I started getting the hunch we were in the wrong place. I even asked a bouncer if we were in the right spot for Tiesto and he said, "yes, he should be on shortly." 

After realizing Tiesto was upstairs around 2:30 we tried to salvage the night as best we could. 
THERE IS ZERO SPACE FOR DANCING. Unless you have a table, you'll have a rough experience. There's too many people and it's difficult to get a view of the DJ. Bouncers constantly make you move out of the way because there's nowhere for the general admission ticket holders to go. 

The one positive is the audio and visual effects. They are AMAZING, but I'll likely pass on the Hakkasan from now on for a more spacious club.
