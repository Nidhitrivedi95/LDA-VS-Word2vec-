AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I had the pleasure of having a late lunch with Christina W. I wanted to try something different so I got the crispy beef with spicy sauce, topped with peanuts. I thought it was delicious. The beef was definitely crispy and the flavor was spot on! I once again got it with brown rice. I had a thai tea (my new favorite drink!) and it was delicious. I wish they had boba for the tea. Christina got a 5 vegetable dish. It was good, but it needed a little more "kick". It wasn't completely bland per se, but if it had a spicy brown sauce, it would have been much better. The service was great. The waitresses are super friendly, and always make sure your drinks are full. I will come here again as I've yet to have a bad meal!
