jvwzhzA9vsfJHCdlbLkHZw Ordered from here and something told me not to but I did anyways. It was just on the other side of gross. It was delivered very quickly and that was nice and the lemonade was really good. That's it though, those are the two highlights. I ordered a shrimp dish that was so bland I couldn't tell which bites had the shrimp or were just white rice. The other dish was chicken and i took a few bites of it and wish it's only problem was blandness. Yuck.....those two dishes with one large rice and a large lemonade cost me over $30 never again
