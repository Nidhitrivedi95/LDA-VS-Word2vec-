JYtGcfc3iFvwj5Zi4oQg7Q One more vegan review from the meat eater of the group...

My vegan daughter and boyfriend ordered the pot stickers and curry veg fried rice (no egg). 

Our server was tuned in to the vegan order and without my asking, scored extra points when she told us the hot and sour soup is vegan. YAY! I love it when a server can anticipate your needs even before you are aware of them.

I ordered the tofu and garlic sauce, and loved that I could order brown rice!

The exterior is blah nondescript strip mall, but the interior is decorated nice and looks like any other American authentic Chinese wall decor. We were in at 1:40, well past lunch time but found four other groups enjoying their meals.

The fortune cookies were served individually wrapped, including nutritional information and ingredients, allowing the vegan to know that they are NOT vegan. (I think it was egg, but by the time I am writing my review I am not sure)

Next time I'm in Vegas to visit my daughter, we're sure to return!
