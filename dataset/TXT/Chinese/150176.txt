SRYM6FaIF6LuXldcC1PY8w P.F. Changs used to be the place to go for unique and flavorful Asian/ American cuisine. Not anymore! 
Over time this groundbreaking restaurant chain has slowly declined. 
It is sad because it WAS a great place to eat. Now corporate cutbacks and shortcuts along with the  gradual substitution of cheaper sauces and meats have rendered this eatery a mere shadow of its former self. 
We tolerated it for sometime but most recently it became intolerable.
Coincidentally the boys upstairs have released a frozen for supermarket consumers version of the recipes. It is marketed under the P.F. Changs name.              Frozen food!..Yuck. I might as well stay in, save money and put in a Marie Calendars or P.F. Changs TV dinner.
 
Did you not see  The movie "Ratatouille"?
This is the kiss of death.
