vYCBkwsQrdpb-RbkjWqG-w Wing heaven definitely was not my idea of sketchy, I would call it a "hole in the wall" it's easy to miss if you're not looking up at the tiny white sign . The inside was very clean , service was fast and friendly . 

The menu was limited, not a lot like other Chinese restaurants, but they had your average dishes like General Tso, etc. I ordered the pepper steak and added broccoli. The portion size was average , enough to overly fill your belly . You have the option of an egg roll or spring rolls. I chose the spring roll and wasn't impressed, but like most Chinese restaurants this spring roll tasted bland , filled with cabbage and onions . My pepper steak didn't have a distinctive taste , it wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again . I love the fact the steam white rice was an Asian brand vs . American. Asian rice is sticker and doesn't fall apart . I gave Wing Heaven 3Stars because my co-worker enjoyed his General Tso chicken, and the prices were fairly cheap , if I had to base it on my meal 2.5 , but this will not defer me from going back . Sometimes you may not order the right thing
