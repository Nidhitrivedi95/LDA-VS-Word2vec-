9WAnQD1nj1j3zLZ7ONtvfQ Great little happy hour menu.  I was out in LV for work and decided to stop and have some food here.  I sat at the bar and was greeted by a nice bartender named Doug.  I ordered some happy hour drinks and the appetizers.  The calamari was great.  It was different from the traditional fried calamari which was a breath of fresh air.  It had a great Asian influence.  The orange chicken and the ahi pizza were both very nice as well.  The experience was made by the Doug.  He was very nice and attentive.  I will be back.  The place was pretty dead though on a Wednesday night at the Palms.
