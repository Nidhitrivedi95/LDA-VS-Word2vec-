jDZJsIyc3jXjcTtJk_p8ZA Horrendous.  I had walked past this place probably a hundred times before I finally decided to give it a try.  Bad mistake.

I ordered General Tso's Chicken, which was pretty mediocre to begin with (much worse than the General Tso's at Lu Lu's, even).  However, I soon noticed a couple of hairs in my food, one of which was actually wrapped around a piece of chicken.  I complained to the waitress, who took the food and showed it to the chef sitting in the back.  He just shrugged and continued reading his newspaper.  Not even an apology from anyone.  Would never go back here under any circumstances.
