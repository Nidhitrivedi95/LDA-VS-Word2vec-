FanQrSh9QTDytonKHt9C6Q First time going to a vegetarian buffet, and I must say that I am really impressed. Their mock meat is incredibly "real", both judging from the look and the taste. The duck, the fish, and the general tao were my favorite. The fried taro and pumpkin balls were super tasty. 

There is a large variety of food to choose from, mainly mock meat dishes, tofu dishes, eggplant dishes, and sushi. The sushi were so so, nothing too special. After trying everything on the menu, it can get a bit repetitive, since the main ingredients are pretty much the same. But, at least they have different flavors and kind of mock meat.

I think the price is fair and it is worth trying. I'm sure you'll be impressed by their mock meat and eveb doubt if it is just not actually real meat.
