8MdMBYTVavXF-smJapxrQA Before I joined Yelp, I ate here and I vowed to never eat here again. I had a case of food poisoning and I'm pretty sure it is from this place. My boyfriend and I deduced that it was from the beef brisket noodle soup we ordered because it was the only thing we ate together and we both had food poisoning.
Without me being aware of it, I was bought here to eat again when I thought I was going to their other location. Aware to not order something similar I had before, I ordered their chicken wings and salad meal during their afternoon tea time specials. I had to pay an extra 1.50 to make my drink a cold honey lemon team, which I don't usually have to pay for at other afternoon tea restaurants. But anyways, my meal just came with 4 small Chicken wings and a potato salad with canned fruits. It was tasty, but the portions were small for the price you pay.
