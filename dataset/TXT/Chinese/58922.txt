First, we ordered edamame which were cooked perfectly and I appreciate that they didn't salt them so we could salt them to our preference.  The house salad was a nice size and I enjoyed their ginger dressing, although it was different from other ginger dressings I have had.  We then ordered several different rolls including the Smart Alex roll, To Die For roll, and the Hot Rod Roll.  The Hot Rod Roll was my favorite by far.  One thing I found disappointing was how many of their more interesting rolls had cream cheese in them.  Truthfully, I am a purist and don't feel that cream cheese belongs in sushi.  I also tried a couple bites of their octopus salad which was absolutely excellent and I would definitely order in the future.  

We sat at the sushi bar and had great service from Chai, the sushi chef.  Overall, it was a really great and fun atmosphere where we made new friends and had a few interesting (in a good way) moments.  While the sushi could have been better, I had a great time and would easily return.
