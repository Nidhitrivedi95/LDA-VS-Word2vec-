* Clear broth zajiang noodles soup. Delicious! Used sone of the spicy broth in the other soup to spice it up even. Really great comfort food 
* Chili oil chap shou dumplings. Excellent 

They serve appetizers last. They also serve a mung bean soup to neutralize any spiciness. The flavor is very pleasant and slightly sweet. Highly recommend this spot even for dates.
