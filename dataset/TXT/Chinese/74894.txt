fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg Stopped for a bite to eat after shopping, on 12 /13/14, we immediately noticed a young girl standing outside, we wondered why when there was plenty of space inside for the podium. The poor thing was freezing it was 47 degrees out. We decided to sit at the noodle bar, which quickly seemed like a bad idea, where as it was very cold due to the open door. We asked the server if they could close the door, he said " no we need it open for ventilation". The food arrived just warm, the meat in the shumai was tough, and our food quickly got cold, again due to the open door. I think they need to come up with a better way to improve their ventilation, after all this is Nevada. I can't imagine eating there in the summer when it's 100 degrees, is the open door the air conditioning as well?
