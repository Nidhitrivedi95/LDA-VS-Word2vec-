The price includes ayce grilled seafood, raw meats and seafood, and pretty much everything you find at a hot pot place plus special items on the menu too. There is an additional charge for the soup bases - there are large communal pots available, as well as personal pots. You have to order the meats through the staff, and the rest is self-serve (veggies and fruits, the sauce bar, and grilled seafood bar). 

Monday to Thursday is $28.99, Friday to Sunday is $32.99 per person. We were offered one pitcher of free plum juice, with an additional 15% off if we pay with cash. Overall, I would suggest this to be one of the most worth it ayce hot pot places for all seafood lovers!
