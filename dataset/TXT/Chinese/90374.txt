IFXL6wMLBgBSGSiLBjtViA This place is my new favourite hotpot restaurant in Toronto. The best part is not having to travel uptown to eat it :) The meat and veggies are fresh, the soup is yummy (I got Tom Yum & Satay). You have your own stovetop and pot vs. sharing one big pot which is a bonus for me, I tried one of their milk teas (Hong Kong Milktea) and it was really good, the servers were friendly and prompt if you needed anything, the decor is new & modern and probably the cleanest restaurant I've seen in Chinatown. I'm craving hotpot as I type this out... I give this restaurant a 5 star!
