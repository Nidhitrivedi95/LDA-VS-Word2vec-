UPF6nUKB_kbMM44xiEc66g I was here earlier in the week with friends for dinner.

I love the contemporary decor.  The fact that the west side of the space facing Scottsdale Rd opens up is great when the weather is nice.

The food was just OK.  We ordered the egg drop soup, house fried rice, beef with broccoli and a shrimp dish.

I'd definitely come back again for the atmosphere.  I'll probably order different items to see if I can find something that I like better on the menu.
