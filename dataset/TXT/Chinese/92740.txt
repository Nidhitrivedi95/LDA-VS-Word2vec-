iT9KMTR8NqYwSCW-zMUOxw The food here is quasi, a little price and the service is hit or miss. I've had waiters that were nice. But the owner , always has this cranky look on her face like you took her to court or divorced here.  I wouldn't make a special trip here.I had their udon stir fry, and general tso's neither was good. It was edible, just not good. lask flavors, oh wait, the flavor of salt. and loads of soy.
