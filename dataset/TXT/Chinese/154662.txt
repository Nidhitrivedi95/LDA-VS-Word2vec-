tEfvf1cznLZUIeTcKKpAIw Wow!  my fellow Yelpers really like this place? I am very surprised, I walked in when they had just opened and ordered their fried chicken by itself , they sprinkle some house salt  and black pepper on the chicken..it was too salty and not much flavor...

after I finished my food, the guy at counter asked "how it was:"? i was being polite so  I said it was good but little too salty for my taste, the guy kind of chuckled like i had no clue what i was talking about

I will never go back..

thanks for reading
