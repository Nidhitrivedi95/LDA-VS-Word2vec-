uoV4aDfXbRmvyHSezdn--w You come to this place for its authentic Chinese food. This review is for the reference of Chinese students who won't order orange chicken or broccoli beef. You need to order from the Chinese menu. Every dish that I have tried so far has been delicious. Portion is huge. Place is clean. Service is super fast. The only drawback is that it's a little far from campus area. But this place is way better than ichiban and Fugu. So if you really miss Chinese food, travel a little bit and come here!
