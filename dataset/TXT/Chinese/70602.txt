f9ERQpAPOAMv5Ay0kyD3Yw I'm new to the area, and I'm looking for a good Chinese restaurant. Sad to say, I am still looking. A few pros and cons in my opinion: Pros: food was hot, decent portions, decent prices. Cons: just bland tasting. (And they got my order wrong, but no biggie, we just wanted to try a few different things). Overall: food wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily good either. The search continues for awesome Chinese food!
