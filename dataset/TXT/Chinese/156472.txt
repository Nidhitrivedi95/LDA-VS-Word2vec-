trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ Seekers of the best oysters in town knew Starfish - unless you wanted to shuck them yourself, this was the next best thing. Sadly, Starfish has gone to Davey Jones' locker, but now there is Pearl Diver, the gastropub reincarnation of Starfish. The top quality seafood is there again, and the oysters are just as fresh, expertly selected and shucked as before. But now there is a microbrewery in the back with some pretty tasty suds. The wine list is a little shorter, but the selection is still thoughtful and reasonably priced.
The menu has been updated to reflect the newer philosophy. The seafood is still expertly prepared - perfectly cooked (and not overcooked!) but there are sliders and other beer friendly dishes there as well.
Definitely worth the short walk to get here, I am so happy that oysters are back in town!
