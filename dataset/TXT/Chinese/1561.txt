-RmFfWUyUU1RPIGtih7J-w Grand China is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants to eat good Chinese food! The staff are always so very friendly, if you need help with an menu item they are always good to explain it to you. If you don't have time to stay and eat they offer take out and delivery services to accommodate your busy schedule. The cooks prepare your food fresh with precision, the taste of the food is very tasty and delicious. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a Good Chinese restaurant for the family.
