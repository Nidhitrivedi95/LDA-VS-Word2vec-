8lPxiYChdJdTV24NJvOB3Q Split decision on this. My wife got the Beef Noodle with wide, thick noodles and I got the Beef Brisket Noodle with the thin wide noodles while my son also got the Beef Brisket with regular round noodles. Although the menu shows the Beef Brisket as being spicy (one pepper) it wasn;t really spicy at all, but my son and I still liked it. My wife found the broth in her soup to be a bit bland and used a lot of hot chili oil to bring the taste up. Meat in both dishes was good, not too much and not too little.We all are fans of the noodles, very fresh and well cooked. My son and I ordered the large bowl and my wife had the regular size. In all cases the portions were generous and filling. We also split pork belly skewers and that was very good. Service was very friendly.Total bill including 1 pop was $35 not including tip, I good deal in our eyes. Also, please note that as other reviewers have said, cash only.
In summary, broth could use some work but well worth visiting and we will definitely return.
