pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Wow, what do I say?

This place blew us out of the water. 

I'd gotten recommendations to dine here if I ever visited Vegas. Those people are on top of their food game. (Looking at you AJ) 

Sometimes, places are hyped up and I end up having a disappointing meal, even if it was good. This place was not that.

Our server, Jeff, was friggen awesome. He was so friendly and informative. He really knew his stuff and he didn't give us any pressure. Super attentive also, he came around like 3 times while we were going over the menu to see if we needed help. We ended up going with an omakase style of ordering. We gave him a budget of $80pp and told him our must haves and to just wing the rest. He did an excellent job.

Notable dishes:
JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA  - when this dish came out, I was a bit underwhelmed. It just looked like bland dumplings on a plate, but the texture and taste of this was just amazing. It was melt in your mouth, different textured, simple but tasty flavours. I would definitely have more of this.

ASSORTED SASHIMI & ROLLS - The fish was really fresh here. Any of the sashimi would be a good choice. I can't remember what rolls we got, but they were generally really good. There was one that was a bit bland and I believe it was shrimp inside. 

DUCK BREAST - Okay, so.. no joke. This dish ruined mushrooms and duck for me. After our table had this, we couldn't stop raving about it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. A whole duck breast, skin and fat on, seared a perfect medium rare, served on a bed of assorted mushrooms in an asian liqour sauce. Holy moly my, this was SO GOOD. Definitely the best thing we had all night.

So, given that our budget we gave was $80pp, it came up to around $115pp after tax and tip (and we gave a generous tip), and this included a dessert platter (which was delicious as well) and a beer each too. 

This is a definite must in Vegas! 6 stars if I could.
