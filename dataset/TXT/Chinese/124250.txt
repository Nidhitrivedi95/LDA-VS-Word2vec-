OqiGriMzxocWaIJR9tic_Q check the green pepper slices if you try the stir fry station... many still has grocery store PLU label still on them.

we went half an hour before closing on a friday night and had the worst buffet experience ever.

The staff was more concerned with cleaning the floors with a foul dark liquid and glaring at us when we questioned the green peppers that had obviously never been washed.

Regretfully we didn't try the stir fry station until after the first plate of mushy dumplings and terrible rice... we asked for a bill and left quickly... we did not get sick... but it was a roll of the dice... would never go back... who doesn't wash produce???
