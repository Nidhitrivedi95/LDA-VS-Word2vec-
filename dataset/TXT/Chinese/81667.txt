The chicken lo mein tasted okay, but the shrimp fried rice looked and tasted pretty meh.  There were barely any shrimp or flavor.  It felt like we were just eating brown rice.

The lady who took our order was very nice.  She was friendly and kind of humorous.  

Maybe the other menu items taste better.  Everyone else here on Yelp seems to love this place.
