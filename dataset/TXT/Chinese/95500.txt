jIc8lKpK0S265D18cgQKEw My work took me here for lunch a week after I was hired. I really enjoyed it. Good Chinese food, good portion size. Not authentic or mindblowing, but it was nice and filling. You won't find anything unique here, but you'll still enjoy it. This is a great place for a quick sit-down lunch.
