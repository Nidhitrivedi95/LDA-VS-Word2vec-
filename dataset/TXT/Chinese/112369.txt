mgLKu6pLiXEC_KdpdRDAvg I have been to Honest Kitchen a few time for both lunch and dinner. 

Not easy to open next to Maple Yip and serves similar Cantonese dishes at similar pricing. 

So how are the dishes? All the ones I tried were all quite good but nothing really memorable. I do enjoy their Deep Fried Ginger and Garlic Tiger Shrimp quite a bit though.

Will I be back? Maybe? Especially if Maple Yip is crazily busy.... 

Lunch Special though is decent, $5.95 with over 30 different items to choose from!
