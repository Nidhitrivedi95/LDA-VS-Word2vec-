SZmm3wOx_fcC2rblUVewGA Let me start by saying I'm no dim sum expert but I like food and my taste buds work. I was happy with my experience there. 
I enjoyed the variety of food carts that came around. 
The place appears sketchy because of its location(basement restaurant on Dundas St W) but my experience with these hideaways is normally really good food.
My only complaint was my $30+ bill. Wouldn't have been bad but I was alone. I didn't realize all these little dishes would add up. 
Will definitely go back. Food was really good. My faves: chicken feet, and the shrimp rolls.
