VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q Just discovered this place and so glad I did. Love their noodle soups! It's like pho but better! I have to warn you though. This place is BUSY. 

$8.95 gets you a big bowl or actually HUGE bowl of noodle soup. You choose from their list of soup base, choice of noodles, choice of two meats or veggies, and special price for up to two side dishes. The pork cutlet and fried fish side were both really flavourful and well done. (this is coming from someone who doesn't even like fried fish). 

I give them so many stars because I'm all about the value. Even though they were busy, service was fine and they were fast.
