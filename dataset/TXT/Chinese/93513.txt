j2kjfjODIZyNPxAu1Dow6A Don't let the name fool you, this is a "Chinese style buffet" inside an old Italian restaurant, but looks Spanish?! Pretty popular from my perspective, popped in on a Sunday afternoon, the lot looked full but the restaurant is so huge, it seemed empty. It's smaller (less offerings) than most all you can eat Chinese buffets. 

We were seated pretty far from the buffet, which can be a good thing, or not. Fellow YELPER Kevin C. joined me for dinner, heading to the buffet is where we parted ways. I headed straight to the sushi station and filled a platter with tempting offerings and a bowl of seaweed salad. Kevin found all his favorites, including Crab Rangoon and dumplings. 

For sushi lovers there isn't a lot of choices, but for 16 bucks you can get your sushi fix and fill up nicely. I had a huge bowl of healthy seaweed salad that I've paid 8.95 for at Yokoso! They did have salmon, red snapper, yellow fin, and sea bass, vegan rolls and crab rolls. As I said, not a lot of choices but the Sushi chef if right there making them as fast as they go. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the freshness. 

I did look around and found they had all the normal offerings found on Chinese buffets, General Tso's, sweet n sour, fried rice, noodles, green beans etc. 

The building used to be Tambellini's, a old name associated with the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. It looks like it could use some spiffing up as I noticed broken light fixtures, burned out bulbs in chandeliers, and outside, cracked siding and pieces of the roof laying in the parking lot. 

I'd say bypass this place and hit up some of the better buffets the city has to offer. Hokkaido on Brown's Hill Road comes to mind!
