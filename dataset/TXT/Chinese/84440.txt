HGuHk935tyokX6kveEviJw We were very excited to try this place because it's one of the few places we've found that offer Cantonese style dishes but we were really disappointed. We ordered take out so I attribute the lack of crispness to the travel, but the calamari wasn't cooked through. There was a thick layer of batter and only the outside was cooked. The crab puffs tasted stale and like they were cooked in old oil. The salt and pepper pork chop was good but too expensive. Overall we didn't enjoy our meals and it definitely was not worth the price.
