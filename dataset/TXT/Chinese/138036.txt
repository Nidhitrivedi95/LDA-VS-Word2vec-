QmNrHxN7UahtdliH_kAuUg If you're looking for authentic Cantonese food, Ka Mei is for you! .... Because it's your only Cantonese option in Pittsburgh. So if you're judging based solely on Pittsburgh, it's the best. But otherwise it's actually rather average. 
Cantonese cuisine relies heavily on fresh ingredients and not necessarily spices... So yes you can get a Cantonese styled steam fish here... But it's made from a frozen fish. So i don't blame the chef or Ka Mei, it's just we're in Pittsburgh.
I only come here when I'm feeling homesick otherwise, if you just want some Chinese food whether it's Cantonese or not, I recommend Rose Tea. 
As for service, I don't usually recommend a Chinese restaurant if your main objective is service. I believe the owner is from Hong Kong. And true to the style of Hong Kong servers, she speaks to you in a familiar tone but can also be curt sometimes. Which is ok with me, like I said, I come here if I'm feeling homesick. 
Ka Mei's preserved egg and pork congee is pretty decent.
