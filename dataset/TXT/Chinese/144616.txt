RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ I just signed up for yelp solely so that I could warn you all. I hate to do this but honestly- what is going on there? Has management changed? Maybe I ordered wrong- and so did my friend- and so did we both with the app- but everything tasted like a chopped challenge where the task was to make a "fancy dinner" with cafeteria food. 

Started with corn chicken soup for two-not even terrible, but bland af and honestly not even as flavorful as the straight up chicken broth I sometimes have for dinner when I plan to wear something skintight but accidentally ate a whole pizza and twelve beers for lunch. 

Both of us ordered off the back page of the menu which I would imagine is similar to backpage the website in terms of quality. I ordered shrimp in lobster sauce which is like ordering a stripper named Chanel. Cheap and ends in remorse. This beauty came with canned, prob microwaved cafeteria veg medley, bland warmed up baby shrimp and "lobster sauce" less aptly named than Apple Jacks. And way less nutritious. Probably a cream of something(?) can of soup I swear to god.

Friend had pork belly- also off ironically located and named backpage of the menu. He didn't eat it. He eats anything. For example, he dated me.  Rice was edible because it was rice and probably the only thing not canned and microwaved.

In their defense the menu is HUGE (yuge) so maybe there are some things that are not so cheap and bad. We just didn't order them.

Anyway I came here starving. Anything should have tasted good. But instead I left angry that I wasted money and calories on canned cafeteria food I could have made better at home. We got a frozen pizza and obvs stopped at the liquor store on the way home. 

Nice waiter good luck to him!!
