4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA I love good Chinese food, and this place is my favorite for it in the valley. Whenever I'm down in the area, I try to swing by and get some. The place is always just about full, which, in my experience, is rare for a Chinese food restaurant. If you're in the area, you should definitely try this place out.
