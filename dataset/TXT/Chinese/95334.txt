JhEtJbGjAqKDHCZ11i3qoQ When I was the young age of 3, my mom brought me to YC's. I have been going ever since. This place is such a pleasant change from all the typical restaurants where you sit down, order from a set menu, and then get served your meal. Here you get to branch out and build your own Mongolian stir-fry from a huge selection of raw ingredients from the buffet style food line. There's meat, tons of vegetable selections, other toppings, and various types of noodles to add. But the personalization doesn't stop there. You then get to create your own sauce either on your own or using any of YC's own personal recipes. At this point, you hand over your bowl to one of their "grill warriors" and watch them bring your stir-fry to life on the giant grills. The finished product always is perfectly cooked, has epic taste and flavor because it has EXACTLY what you want, and keeps you coming back! YC's also has crispy wontons, rice, and chopsticks (of course) to complete the meal! This is a place I will never get tired of because the possibilities are endless. Their facility is always clean and staff is welcoming and helpful. Not to mention, it is very affordable. I highly recommend everyone to "mongo" at YC's Mongolian Grill!
