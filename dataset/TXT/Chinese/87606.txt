HV3Q2JYwK9AvMHPYXcxzag Found a newly opened place between Frys & Filibertos.  
CLEAN. Nice Staff. Really Clean. Family owned.

The lunch specials are generous and when I said EXTRA Spicy the server actually believed me so I was happy.  Vegetables were all fresh and cooked with respect (nothing mushy).  

$10 got me lunch, drink & tip so I'll put this place in my work-lunch want to go out but only have an hour Rotation!
