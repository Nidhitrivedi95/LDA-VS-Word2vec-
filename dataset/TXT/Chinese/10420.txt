1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Service here was horrible. Our waiter acted as if he didn't want to be there. We asked for take our boxes for our 3 almost full dishes that we didn't finish and he gave us one small box. The food was ok. Big portions and cheap prices. I wish they had better service. Probably won't be coming back here again.
