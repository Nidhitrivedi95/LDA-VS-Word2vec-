jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ We use to love Pei Wei, but lately the foodhas not been that great. We ordered take out and my husband had the chicken terriyaki. He had huge chunks of onions in his veggies and was sweet. My Mongolian beef was very salty and I couldn't even finish it. The pork eggrolls were also oily when we took a bite. Disappointing. We will no longer be going to Pei Wei and just support the local restaurants.
