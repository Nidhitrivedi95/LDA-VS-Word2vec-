X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Ugh. Seriously my least favorite club in Vegas out of all the ones i've been to. There's too many people, and the edm floor is always too crowded to see the DJ that you came here for in the first place. :'(

I've been here for Tiesto, Calvin Harris, and W&W, and didn't really like my experience any of those times... Tiesto is a slight exception because my friends had a table in the hip hop room. This would definitely be a 1 star review if not for the hip hop room, it's more fun up there, especially because it's not as crowded!

This place is also suuuper expensive for guys, usually $75 and up for the good DJs, free for girls on guest list though (glad i'm a girl lolz, but sucks for my guy friends)! Sometimes the GL line gets insane though, my friends and I were waiting neear the door leading to outside before we got pulled in to go with another group of girls (PRAISE DA LORD), so try to arrive early or at least by the time your promoter says!
