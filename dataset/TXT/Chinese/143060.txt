rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g Stopped by for dim sum after waking up late today (since Hunter slept in til 10 am) so by the time we arrived was 2 pm. Worried there may not be a lot of choices but there was plenty! Started with haw gow and sui mai which were both excellent!! Got 2 beef churn after the first was so smooth. The tofu shrimp was very good as well. The chow mein was freshly made. Ribs were not bad, the only Negative was the sweet breads which was simply not very good.
