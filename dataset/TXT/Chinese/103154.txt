Dry Chilli Chicken (without gravy) is where it's at.  My girlfriend and I usually complement that with their hot and sour soup (awesome) and Singapore style fried noodles.  There is so much food that not once did we finish it all ... score! as we can make another meal out of it.  We have also tried the Masala fried rice and Garlic shrimp and you can't go wrong with those either.  

Pricing is very fair and if you happen to get in on their lunch special, they are equally as high on value.

Service is not the friendliest and the owner is a little brusque perhaps, but still it is always popular with consistent patronage so you know they come for the quality of the food.  

A gem of a restaurant and one we'll keep coming back to.
