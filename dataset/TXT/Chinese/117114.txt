nBwOIq5KI-zmxp061dTmgw New to the hood and taken out twice using the economical lunch special menu that runs til 5p EVERYDAY.

First things 1st, they DO use MSG but there are some items where they can omit it upon request.

Second of all, they DO have the REAL Chinese hot mustard. You gotta ask for it. They're not gonna give up the goods that easily ;)

Next, special orders are welcome. So, if you want that veggie delite;) minus the carrots, no msg, sauce on the side and a couple cups of hot mustard to go they got you covered!

Let me tell you C & W has got something going on over here you need to know about! They are quick quick and have VERY GOOD portion size for their price point.
