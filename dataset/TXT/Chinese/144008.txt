rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg Surprisingly great food.  The sushi is the best.  I don't feel the same for the cooked food.  I have dined here quite a few times and never ran into any issues with it.  However, I wouldn't recommend the walnut shrimp - didn't taste fresh.  The last time my hubby and I ate here, I got my sushi and a man who sat at the bar after us, ordered the same food after us, got his before my husband.  Just a really blah experience with the cooked food.

They get really really busy during lunch so you may want to come early or avoid the lunch hour.  These are the times we have had any and all issues.  The last time I ordered more sushi and it was made but never given to me.  My waiter disappeared so I had to ask the bartender for my food.


Overall the place is a great spot and I will def return!
