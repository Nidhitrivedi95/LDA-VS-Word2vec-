kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A I've seen the reviews and heard how amazing this place, naturally I had to give it a try. I ordered the Mongolian Beef Pancakes, more like pitas, which had great flavor. The spicy wontons were made with tolerable spice, something maybe only I can appreciate. LoL. The highlight of the meal, #B3 Shanxi Knife Cut Noodle Soup, made with such amazing flavor and reminds me of an island favorite, Oxtail Soup. Definitely worth trying and going back for.
