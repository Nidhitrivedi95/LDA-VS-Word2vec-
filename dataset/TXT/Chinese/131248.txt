pIB-Js9drl27qrrSjKK_eA We ("Aznboy" and myself) finally got a table at Artisan Noodle, a Xi'an style North York eatery. This restaurant is very small and very popular. (And very hot.) It's hard when to know is the perfect time to secure a table. We tried at least three times to eat here (once at 2 pm on a Wednesday!) but it was always too busy. Apparently an early Sunday evening is the best time to go?!

We ordered the following:

Pork Jia-Mo
Less than a year ago, we traveled to Xi'an where we tried this dish. If true Xi'an pork jia-mo is 10/10, this was a solid 7.5/10. Definitely not as good, but worth ordering.

Lamb Pao Mo
This was a decent portion, but it could have used a bit more lamb. As a result, you taste more of the herbs than the meat, but still very good and very hearty. Again, if the dish in Xi'an was a 10/10, this was a 7.5/10.

Spicy Fish Fillet Noodle Soup
I have a sneaking suspicion that as a white girl ordering this dish, they may have toned down the spice. It was still very flavourful, though! And the Sichuan peppers (the numbing kind) added a good amount of "heat." Excellent noodles and good amount of fish. I'd give it a 8/10.

Overall: This is a very small restaurant, and while it does not match what you'd get in Xi'an, the food still tastes pretty good and comes in decent portions.

(Also, speaking Mandarin would potentially help when ordering, but the servers speak English so don't be scared to try here if you don't speak Mandarin.)
