PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg We just swung by a friends house after they finished moving to this area and they were craving Chinese. 

Me (in my head, not out loud): "This sounds like the perfect opportunity to use the Yelp app!" 

Sound effect: Trumpets 

Me (out loud this time): "Hey guys, I found this Chinese place within walking distance, and Dave N. said it's good, I know that guy!" 

So off we go with our group of 6. First we get treated with those tasty Chinese crunchy chips. They must have been the Chinese equivalent of the chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant since we got them with our water. 

After looking over the menu, we all wanted to eat everything, which is not possible since this is not a buffet so we go for the family style dinner. Excellent choice. 

First up we get a very tasty soup and egg roll. After mixing and matching some Sriracha sauce with some other sauces on the table, we are ready to go with some main dishes. One thing we made the mistake of is choosing too many dishes with broccoli in it, but other than that, every dish coming out tasted amazing! 

By about dish 3 (mind you, we are sharing with 6 people), we are all really full and can't believe another 2 dishes are coming out. 

Service was amazing, my glass was never empty. At one point, the person I can only assume was the owner (the way his voice seemed to command everyone's attention and how we walked around checking on tables) was trying to full my glass with water while I was drinking it. Pretty funny. 

We all left with takeout boxes, extremely full stomachs and comments about how we will be returning again.
