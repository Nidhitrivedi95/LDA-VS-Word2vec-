xyskSLRWf5ixBWSYk5hnDQ Walked in at 2:30 on a Wednesday afternoon and there were a few customers eating. Good sign. This place makes for a reasonably healthy, quick lunch. You may choose from thin rice noodles, egg noodles, and a thick noodle (buckwheat?). They have a plethora of veggie to choose from as well as an assortment of meats. They cook everything up for you after you pick and choose what will make your bowl. They also have a little buffet at the end that contains an assortment of sweets, cooked meats, and two different soups (one was veggie, one was not). Our lunch was $18 and change for two lunches and an iced tea. Not bad on the wallet and veggie friendly!
