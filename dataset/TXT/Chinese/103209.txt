kKCJvvktaKxZ5iFKv3lxuA After reading reviews from others, I feel like we went somewhere else. I mean sure, the place was clean, but that's about where the similarities end. You walk in, order your items, take a seat and get your food - not much can go wrong there, right? Well... 

For a "quick serve" style restaurant, it shouldn't be that difficult, especially when there aren't too many people there. I mean we're talking noodles and rice, perhaps with a few proteins and a veggies thrown in. And when I mean a few, I mean a few. Look up the definition of "few", and you'll get "small number of". That dish you just ordered probably has perhaps 3-4 small shrimp or pieces of chicken, a couple pieces of broccoli, a rather outsized number of peppers and the rest is rice or noodles.

Almost the entire rest is noodles or rices - that isn't unusual.

There isn't anything wrong with that, exactly, and the flavor isn't bad, it's just that the presentation is so... off. I mean take a little time and chop up the protein, rather than throwing the carbs in the bowl with the veg and two proteins and it might be better (you know, more like an actual chinese restaurant, with little chunks and better presentation?). It just makes you feel better about it.
