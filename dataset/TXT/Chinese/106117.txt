KzLjbXEDH1e1WrfzrrzZKw I have lunch here occasionally, over the last year, the food quality and service has diminished. It was usually an OK place.  Understaffed for a busy lunch, you will see wait staff running.  Last week, chicken served freezer burned, tried again this week and the sauce had that distinct burned taste to it. I ate it, but it prompted me to leave the review.
