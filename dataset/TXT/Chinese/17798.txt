4Wnj4lg3vtcZMaibE54pmQ I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews on this restaurant, the food is delicious.  I grew up in Brooklyn, NY, married a southern bell, and spent 5 years overseas eating some of the best foods ever. After living in the Cleveland area for 6 years now, one thing this area lacks is good food spots. The food is great, the service is great, they deliver. The restaurant is super clean, and the food is actually seasoned well. My family and I eat here at least once a week and we can get enough.  This food is good, I will never travel to any other Chinese restaurant, enjoy!
