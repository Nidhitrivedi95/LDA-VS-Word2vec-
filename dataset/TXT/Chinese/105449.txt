kWkW6vVePpBox_fKfGgPjQ One word sums up my experience with this place and is reason enough for me to never return...ROACH! Yup, that's right...ROACH. We were eating a full meal at the bar last night when all of sudden "someone" decided to join us by making a mad dash between all of our plates. And then he decided to hang around and watch a little TV. We notified the owner/server, who said "oh, sorry" and proceeded to squish the uninvited visitor with a napkin, like it was nothing out of the ordinary. To add insult, she didn't even offer to take anything off our $50 tab. Not that we would have returned, but it's just the right thing to do. The food is good, but when you've got roaches joining you for dinner -- good simply is not enough. Ugghhh!
