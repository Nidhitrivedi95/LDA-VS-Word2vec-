A5Xd85djipsW546Bq6qIYA Probably the most underrated Chinese food in the city. Every bit as good as sesame inn if not better. Great for pick up or delivery but we usually eat in. Clean comfortable atmosphere with plenty of seating. Service has always been extremely quick and friendly.  Good quality, great portions and fair prices. The won ton soup is solid and my go to dish is the Hunan beer.  Plenty of fresh veggies and the right amount of spice. My wife likes to get the veggie lo mein and orange shrimp which is full of flavor. Only complaint was that they brought the boxes to is at the table instead of boxing the left overs for us in the back but that only happened once. Overall this is definitely our go to place from now on. So glad they're here on the Mount!
