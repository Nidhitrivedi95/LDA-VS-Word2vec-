BJ0pJxKFxzVGDtsknbLFRQ Ordered take out; food was prepared quickly. Chicken balls weren't greasy or soggy, the beef & broccoli was good and not overly salty. The Shanghai noodles was a bit on the spicy side. No complaints, only thing is it somewhat lacks the "fake Chinese" feel. I would however, order from here again.
