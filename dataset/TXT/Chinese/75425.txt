FykLjv4tIq618q8F2pvTKg I usually frequent the old Krazy Buffet on Sahara but definitely wanted to check this place out. The decor is much nicer with their mosaic tiles and glass light wall. They had most of the same food as the other one except they have a Mongolian bowl section where you can pick your noodles, veggies and meat and have them grill it for you. It was so good! I didn't even need Siracha! It tasted better than Chow Mien ! I wanted to try to have them make my bowl with rice but I didn't know if that was allowed. I was to shy to ask ...like usual. Some of my other favorite items to get here are the baked seafood in a crab shell, cream cheese won-tons, Lotus balls and Walnut Shrimp. Yum! 

If you want to get Krazy ...it's your birthday ...yeah ...yeah. They have a private room in the back for that. It's close to the food so if you had too much birthday cake but you can't say no to another plate of food it's in stumbling distance.
