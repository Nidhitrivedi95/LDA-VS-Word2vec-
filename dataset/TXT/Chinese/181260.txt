XCUXCTHvY8QVR4xU0DF__w Small obviously family run place where parents and uncles sit around reading newspapers and kids are taking orders and bringing food out. 
We ordered two dishes of dumplings and a soup, they give you complmentary hot green tea in a pot. We had to write the order numbers down on the back of a piece of paper and hand it to the waitress haha. Didn't mind at all because the food was cheap-ish and we were hungry and craving dumplings. 
Pay attention to the numbers you're ordering, some of them are out of order BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT THE NUMBER THAT'S ON THE MENU. For example 18,19,20,210, 22, 23,24 is listed on the menu? Don't tell her 21 if you want dish labelled 210. Tell the waiter 210. Idk why they have this like this, but I don't make the rules so.....
Probably would return for cheap dim sum IF I lived in Toronto, but if not find somewhere else
