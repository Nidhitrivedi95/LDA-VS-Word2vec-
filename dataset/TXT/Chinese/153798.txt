tbMAjldMYhvDUS2gG5Fdxw After receiving coupons for so long, we finally decided to try this place. DO NOT waste your money!!!!  It is the WORST place I have ever eaten!!!  Nasty!!!  No flavor, small bits of fatty boiled chicken and way over cooked rice.  I mean it's SO BAD that I wouldn't even have my dogs eat it!!!  Because the place was empty I'm sure the food was not fresh.  I picked up my orders.  I called to inquire why it was so bad but the guy would not speak to me even I was very calm and polite.  Nobody would call me back.  I've seen the other reviews on bad food & lousy customer service.  No wonder they give out so many coupons.  Save your money & go to PF Changs for the same price and get quality!!!  These people are a rip off & don't deserve to be in business!!
