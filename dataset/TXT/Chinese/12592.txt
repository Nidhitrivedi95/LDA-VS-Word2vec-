2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg The only reason why I stepped inside this restaurant is because I saw how crowded it was and thought to myself that lots of people = great food. That equation, unfortunately, doesn't always work. The place is indeed buzzing with people most of the time, it's loud and you'll be lucky if you flag down a waitress. The menu is gigantic with more combinations than you would normally expect at a Chinese restaurant. We ordered duck with rice noodles. The duck was so-so, but the noodles were bland and   covered with gooey stuff made of eggs. Suffice it to say, the noodles tasted awful. After my gf and I were done, we felt weird in the stomach and my gf even vomited at night. Yes, most dishes on the menu are priced in the $5-$10 range, but the quality of food is abysmally low, being greasy and bland. If you need some calories when you're feeling hungry, I'd recommend to walk a bit west to Spadina and then about 100m north to Ajisen. Ajisen's pork ramen is unbeatable, especially on a windy and cold winter day.
