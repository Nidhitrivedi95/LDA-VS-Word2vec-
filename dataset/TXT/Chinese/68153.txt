EQZPTDAy-lWijb0i8JpHNw Excellent choice for a delicious, cheap and authentic Chinese meal. It is actually my favourite dumpling place in the city at the moment. No other restaurants has their Xiaolongbao quite as authentic and soupy as these. The taste was just right: not too salty and not bland. The only reason why I'm giving a 4 is because I ordered the spicy shrimp wonton, but what they have me was some rather small sized wontons topped with a sweet hoisin sauce. I confirmed with the waitress that it was indeed my dish before I tried it. It was everything but spicy. It was just sweet. So I was kind of disappointed by that. But apart from that, I would recommend it. Personally, I would definitely go back, I just won't ever order the spicy wontons.
