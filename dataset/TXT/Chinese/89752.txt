IAqyeVG1ZMrv7hiV3FAB6Q This is the best chinese buffet in North Phoenix.  
Pros:  They have a sushi chef.  Try finding that anywhere.  They have all the regular dishes you'd expect at a chinese buffet.  Good quality and hot.  Cheap.
Cons: Limited on the salads.  Sometimes, something that looks like a salad or just plain lettuce.  The front door hasn't been cleaned since 1962.  The men's room urinal has had a black plastic bag on it since I've been going there for 3 months.  (Come on, fix the damn thing).  Both bathroom doors have not been cleaned since, well you get the idea.
Overall, I drive past a couple of other Chinese buffets to get here.  It's worth the trip.
