6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q Had the sweet and sour pork with the Red8 special fried rice. The fried rice was excellent. Not loaded with soundalike and garlic, it had a nice fresh flavor - a lot like the food stalls I ate at in Singapore as a child. The sweet and sour pork was a little over cooked and the service a bit slow considering that they were less than half full on a Friday night.
