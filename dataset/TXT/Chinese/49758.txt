CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Good food, good service, and reasonably priced compared to the other Belagio restaurants. I had the fried rice with barbecue pork, and it was very good. Also had the tempura shrimp which I liked as well. We easily got in without a reservation on a Thursday night. I would go back.
