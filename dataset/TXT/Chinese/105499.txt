I remember going to this restaurant when it had just opened and the decor was not finished and they did not have  a liquor license, yet the food we had was tasty enough that we figured once they get everything going this could become a regular place to dine at.

unfortunately, that did not happen. Every time I visited this restaurant with the hopes of a great evening meal, they were always shattered by bad and slow service. I had but one good experience here and I should have left it at that and never gone back yet I did a week later and it was back to the same story.

Here is a short list of thing this place can not seem to get right.

- Slow Hostess service - A couple of times the place was half empty yet the hostess asked us to wait to be seated. Thirty to forty five minutes later I was still waiting, so I left.

- Slow food service - Many many times the sushi order took an excruciatingly long time, which could be understandable if the place was packed, yet most of the times there were only 2 to 3 other parties in the restaurant. Come on speed it up. i could probably learn how to make sushi faster than it took them to make ours.

- Timing - The Chinese food is always done very quickly to the point that they bring out main course almost right after the appetizers; and because the sushi orders always seem to take longer than needed, the pace at which the food is brought out is terrible.

- Waitress/Waiter - The waiters and waitresses here seem to not care to be there. They almost never introduced themselves and rarely come by to ask if anything else is needed nor to refresh our drinks.

- idiot Waitress - This specific entry on this list is for the last waitress we had that made me decide, never again to set foot at this place. She brought out our Chinese appetizers, then told us she will bring the Chinese main course since the sushi was backed up. Again with the slowness and only a couple of parties in the restaurant. She did not wait for us to be done with our appetizer and brought the Chinese entrée. She slid the food from the plate it came in and onto a hot plate and placed that on the table as close as possible to us and left. The thing was so sizzling hot that it was spattering oil up at us and all over the table. Oil got all over our shirts, the appetizer plates, the seats. When she came back we told her about it and asked for extra napkins. She brought the napkins and said , "Oh sorry" in a very unapologetic way. She obviously did not care. She left and brought out our sushi and then our check. This bitch then had the audacity to say to us when we were wiping the seat cushions next to us so we could slide out and leave that we made a mess. I tell you NEVER again...

Bottom line: No matter how many opportunities I gave this restaurant, they blew it every single time. Be warned if you have a good experience here, do not go back as they will undoubtedly screw it all up.
