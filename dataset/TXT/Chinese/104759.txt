KqC7y46lAjWAksfKsWStWw Totally like being in northern China! Westerns beware this is not Chinese American Szechuan! It's"s Hot, it's"s soupy and it's all oily. It's a perfect way to warm up here. Despite the other review, not to chew and eat the Szechuan flower peppercorns will leave you without the truly special experience! They taste of licorice, spice, citrus, and flowers and then make your tongue tingle and go numb. They totally are the crack in the pot! 
  I was totally flushed with color like I had been at the beach all day when I left ! Enjoyed dumplings in chili sauce and beef and tofu pot. Nothing like toting a fire in the belly for the long cold walk back to the hotel!
