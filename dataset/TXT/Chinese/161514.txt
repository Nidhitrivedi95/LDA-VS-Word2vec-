uFNM9ICvZN0TEbURIpiIDQ Solid 3.5 stars. Delivery time was good, food came nice and hot.  Prices seemed a bit higher than elsewhere but the huge portions made up for it. Dinner for 2? You will have plenty leftovers! We started with the pork/shrimp and chive dumplings, Judging from their name and look of the dumplings, they definitely seem made in house and they are quite tasty (tip - if you love spice ask for the chilli sauce). The general tao chicken was excellent, not overdone in batter or sauce, so you actually know its chicken you're eating.  The special owner ni rice was good but needed salt for someone who likes salt. This was remedied by using a bit of soy sauce. The crispy duck came shredded and with the thin wraps and chives, while tasty the duck was a bit dry. Eggplant was great and not overloaded with sauce and msg. Overall - glad this restaurant is in the neighborhood would definitely order from again.
