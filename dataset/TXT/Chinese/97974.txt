JQWIZ8MT-VGZzO5W5XCB5Q I love 88 China Bistro and I've been going there for over three years now. My favorite entrees are the beef with broccoli with fried rice and chicken fried rice. The lunch specials are great deals and that's when I typically go for takeout. It's always ready in fifteen minutes or less. The food is fresh and doesn't have that greasy Chinese food taste that I hate. The owner, Kim, is very nice and always remembers me and my family members. In all the times I've ordered there, there's only been one mistake and when I called, they immediately replaced the order for me. I highly recommend supporting this local business and I won't have Chinese food anywhere else in Charlotte.
