T5iVkzBXvG5cG6de_TMquw Stopped by here a couple times 'cause my friend lives nearby, very nice and cozy little restaurant with good prices for the quality of foods served ......big portion sizes, the dishes are tasty and not too salty, the ingredients are fresh ...... highly recommended... They offer takeout options too and they are pretty fast, I didn't have to wait for more than 10 minutes tops....
