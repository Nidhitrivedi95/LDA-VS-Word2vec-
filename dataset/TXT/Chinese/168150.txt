vMpJzMFst_9GP4boeqWIRg We have visited this particular location 3 times and the service is just terrible. The staff is rude and arrogant. They may not be fluent in english but they can atleast be courteous and polite and greet with a smile. The light fixture above our table was covered with dust. Although the food is decent, the attitude of the staff compells me to not recommend this location. Poorly managed.
I have been to Congee Queen near Steels and Woodbine and its far better in taste and service.
