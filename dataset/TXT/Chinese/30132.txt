97V91GSG-OQvrvOc9GXoGA Excellent beef soup noodles. Delicious, rich-tasting broth. I never expected to get such authentic Taiwanese style niu rou mian in Cleveland! The scallion pancakes and pot stickers and three cup chicken were also delicious. The Hakka stir fry, with dried tofu strips, celery, and squid, was also tasty--but probably less to the taste of most diners. 

Very pleasant and helpful service as well. 

Highly recommended!
