GWNmYFQw3WitfTPt5uGMvQ This place is actuallky called Beijing Chinese Cuisine now, not Hot Wok.  Hopefully yelp will get this changed!

So I found out this was an alternative Chinese delivery restaurant to Cook on Wok up the street on Eastern.  Also, if you spend 40 bucks, they give you a free entree so I decided to give them a try.

There were some hits and misses.  I ordered way too much food to hit the 40 dollars though and ended up having enough food for over a week.  The portions are huge.

Here is a rundown of what I had:

*Spring rolls - nothing special here but were tasty. 
*Lemon Chicken - really overcooked and awful.  Had to throw some of this away.  Sauce was just grease and no lemon flavor.
*Orange Beef - very very very overcooked but flavor was good.  Actually tasted really good as leftovers.  I prefer Cook on Wok's to this big time.
*Sesame Chicken - this was the standout dish, really was one of the best sesame chicken dishes I have had.  
*Shrimp with Snow Peas - Very well cooked and very tasty.  Much better than Cook on Wok's version.  Shrimp was big, and I was very satisfied with the medley of vegetables in this dish.
*Combination Fried Rice - One of the better fried rice dishes I have had so far.

I would order here again but I would only order the sesame chicken, the shrimp with snow peas, and the combo fried rice.  The rest I would order from cook on wok.  I'm still looking for other places to do chinese delivery from (damn China a go go won't deliver down past Horizon Ridge).
