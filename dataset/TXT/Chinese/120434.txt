We tried PLENTY on the menu, beware of contents, some may be graphic.  I've been to many dim sum places in my day and we always measure the value, the size of food and the taste!

I love dim sum and I always compare based on the HAR-GOW.  The HAR-GOW was not the greatest, small and the skin was doughy and thick.  The SHRIMP RICE NOODLE was lots of noodles and little tiny shrimp.  We ordered the BRISKET and COW STOMACH, the brisket was alright, but the COW STOMACH (which I've enjoyed in other restaurants before) was flaky and gross.  

The TURNIP CAKE was delicious, full of flavor and with fresh turnips embedded in.  The RICE WRAPPED IN LOTUS LEAF was tasty, good size and taste.  My accompanies really liked the PAN-FRIED DUMPLINGS, they were huge in size and filled with fresh ingredients!  The BBQ PORK BUNS are always a fan favorite, and although they could have added more BBQ pork into it, the taste was divine!

The service... very interesting.  They pretend they don't hear you and are always giving you the cut eye.  But they hear you, bring you everything you ask for and is quite efficient in their service.  So, they get it done but they are kind of rude.  I am big on service, even in these mom and pops shops.  So that's my take!

Would maybe go back again, but I do think that there are definitely better dim sum places out there to be explored!
