This restaurant is a great place to get some quick boba! They're fast and delicious! My usual orders would be coconut milk tea with lychee jelly, taro smoothie/milk tea, and regular milk tea. (But if you're looking for some really fresh boba, this is not the place to visit.) As for the food, they aren't so fast. The food is pretty good but not great. I usually stop by this place on my lunch break. I love all their teas and boba drinks. As for the service, I'd give it 2 stars. Depends what day you visit. Some hardly speak English so they hardly communicate with you. So, they hardly come to your table to check on you. 

I'd come back..mostly because of their drinks.
