Y5c9_Inq1uunA96AB-8dVQ 3.5/5 but because the woman serving us were nice I'll bump it up to a 4.  

Thmor Da is a sweet find for me as it can close the loop on a Saturday afternoon food shopping activity with a pit stop in here!  The restaurant is attached to Kim Phat grocery store.  A crazy busy Asian market in MTL.    

Menu offerings are your typical Chinese and some excellent options of your basics:  Rice dishes, Soups, Chicken, Noodles, Pork, Beef, Fish, Lobster, Hot Pot, Quails and Duck and Vegetables.  For me this is a pretty complete menu.  

Starting off I ordered a HK Style Milk tea and what they brought out was a hot bubble tea with boba.  Not what I was expecting (a bit sweeter) but not bad none the less! 3/5.  

For dinner I ordered a #27 Crispy noodles with Beef and Chinese broccoli.  Serving size was good with a nice Cantonese Chow mein brown sauce which wasn't too salty but was nice to soften up the noodles.  Meat portion was adequate and the gai lan (chinese broccoli) was crisp and fresh.  

Ordered some food to go as the food was yummy! I ordered a Cantonese Chow Mein #28 and a #93 Thai Beef.  The woman serving me asked if I'd like the noodles separate.  They know how to serve takeout!  I had a taste of the Thai beef and it was nice and spicy!  My wife ate a bit when I got home and she said her lips were on fire.  I told her I was proud of her!  Good job Cheri I said!  Spicy food is good for the soul!  

Will definitely try more as I come back.  Pricing and serving size is generous and Asian inexpensive! 

For me I can become a regular at a place like this as price and quality seems good!

They have a lunch menu, serve General Tao chicken (for the Quebecois) and it appears they charge $1 extra for takeout.  Don't be scared however as price is very reasonable!
