bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg We ventured here last weekend, and I'm already looking forward to going back. 
The drinks were excellent!  We tried the Kaffir Lime Gin and Tonic and the Jungle bird. The gin and tonic was an interesting twist on a gimlet, and the hint of smoky pineapple in the Jungle bird really balanced the sweet, rich taste of the rum. Next, for dim sum, we tried both the steak tartare and pork belly bites. The steak tartare was a hit- a definite must try! For our entrees, we tried  the chicken Ramen and shaved flank steak noodles. The Ramen was so tasty- delicious miso broth, veggies, kimchi, and chicken meatballs blended together in perfect salty-sour-spicy harmony.  The flank steak noodles were not as exciting, but still tasty- I likely wouldn't order it again. I'm looking forward to going back to try more from the menu!
