cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ Besides the plus this place is Halal and has no pork products ts on the menu..the food is EXCELLENT. Best Pad Thai I've ever had. I even ordered it with ground beef which is rare for me. They don't just use ground beef, they use high quality steak and ground it up IN- House with the halal beef. Even the noodles they use for the pad thai were a bit thinner than the traditional rice noodles. Flavors were decedent and perfectly measured. I ordered a 3 out of 5 for spice. Little too high for me so if you like it hot they can accommate. We came here because of the halal factor but I will be spreading the word to friends that don't even care about that. this place kills Archies and Pin Kaow. If you happen to  like Indonesia or Bali food, they have that thin crispy bread here Rotoni (I think was the name) that you rarely find. I dipped it in my fiance's curry and it was over the TOP! They are local and made a few service mistakes but kindly fixed em and thanked us genuinely for coming. Well done!  We always hit the grove when we are in LA and go to our fav spot called Banana Leaf...guess what..got our fix here. This is thai on steriods!
