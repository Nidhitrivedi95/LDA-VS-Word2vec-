dKOrxsz6ygqa-AatwzpKyQ We had our own room set up for dinner here at Casa DeLuz at Woodside Sq

The food came out fairly unusual considering the waitress recommended the menu so we went with whatever she said was good 

Everything was fried and weird, but at the same time still was kinda tasty 

It was someone's birthday in my party so the waitress asked to get a lucky money? Lol 

The bill came up to around $1200 

and yes we all left still hungry. 

But by looking at all these dim sum reviews i might come back to try that! so i guess there's a little chance for a more positive review. stay tuned
