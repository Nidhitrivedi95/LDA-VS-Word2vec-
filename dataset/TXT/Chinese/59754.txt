dKOrxsz6ygqa-AatwzpKyQ It's been a tradition coming here when we visit Toronto. This Dim Sum and traditional Chinese banquet hall is grand in size and offerings. From the looks of it, I'll assume this place can comfortably seat 500-600 people. From a casual dim sum day to private room family dinners, Casa De Luz caters well. One expectation anyone should have coming in Is the level of service. Lets face it, they're goal is to get your food as fast as possible and take clear directions. Asking for opinions, would more likely annoy them unless you're planning a fancy private dinner. If you want no frills, fresh dim sum this is a must. This place makes you imagine how it's like in the kitchen when it's packed with patrons. So yes, be realistic with expectations, be direct, loudly call out the servers as they probably have 10 to-dos's at any given moment and I can guarantee you'll have a real semi-chaotic dim sum experience.
