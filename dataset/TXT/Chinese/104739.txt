KqC7y46lAjWAksfKsWStWw I've been there several times right before they close. They always welcome us even though it was closing time. The service was fast and the food was mouth numbing good.

The spice is what makes this restaurant so good. It's not spicy spicy but flavorful spicy. Expect to sweat because 90% of their dishes are super spicy (and good).

The price is always right. We go in group and share everything, and it comes to 10-12$ per person.
