LGZPjmhEg2QYeGZ2PKnpQw went to this place on monday for some good ol' dim sum. i have been here several years ago, but not for breakfast or lunch, just dinner. 

first off, the food was okay. there wasn't necessarily anything in particular that made me go like DEAR LORD TAKE ME HERE AGAIN. i ordered 

1. Har Gow or shrimp dumplings which is a MUST for me every time i go yum cha
 - this tastes okay; just rather dry
 - the shrimp was quite fresh

2. Steamed Turnip Cake with dried scallop
 - quite good 
 - not a fan of the little shrimps in there but still good

3. Sticky Rice with Chicken wrapped in lotus leaf
 - idk, but my mom didn't seem to enjoy

4. Pork Rice Roll (Churn Fun? Chun Fun? idk but all you Chinese ppl out there YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN RIGHT ?!?)
 - i actually liked this
 - i like how the outside is very soft and chewy-ish; hard and rough rice rolls are not the way to go for me
 - the pork was a bit too fat for my liking

5. finally the GOON TONG GOW ?! (shark fin and seafood? dumpling soup) 
 - relatively okay; could've used a bit more flavouring 
 - no msg (yippee) 
 - okay amount of sharks fin (i don't think it's real though?! idk LOOL) 
 - this was a special item so it was $9.5

SO YEAH; other than food the decoration and interior is quite nice. it looks very classy and you know very fine-dining-esque. waiters were okay and um yeah das it

** the food came quite fast to us ; 4 orders came in one go BOO YEAH?!
