uA9tzuzID3t5yZ8rhZ1bQw Love this place. I have lived and traveled a lot. China jade is one of the best. Since moving to Pittsburgh we use to go once a week. Always consistent. Always delicious!  Owners are extremely nice and kind.  You will never be disappointed.  Wonton soup is flavorful and tender. We have had about everything on the menu it's all consustanrly good.  Thanks China Jade
