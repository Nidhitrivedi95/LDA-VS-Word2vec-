t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA If you can read Chinese, this will be a good place. They have over 200 choices I think and when we ordered some known Chinese dishes (being unable to read the offerings), the flavor were all under par. I am from the Philippines with Chinese ancestry so I know what good Chinese food tastes like. 
Enjoyed China King on Neil St instead.
