Dl-hhPCjRJM221XSwiuTbg Have been there twice. I have to say the place is a typical hotpot place and food are also good. The service is considerable. Their waiters and waitresses always take initiative to help you out.

The only thing I don't really appreciate is the pricing. Story is the price they put on menu is 26.99/person for adult but it's actually a discount price only if you pay by cash. If you pay by debit / credit, there is additional 2 bucks they gonna charge you. Adding the soup base it will cost you around 31.99/person. So the menu price didn't list clearly what is the actual price is. I think customers should know what the exact price is no matter it is paid by cash or by card.

Before you start ordering, ask the exact price they will charge at the final stage when you want to pay the bill. As customer, we should protect our rights.
