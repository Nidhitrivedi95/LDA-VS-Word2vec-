9rzfGwR--QUGn7BZJdm-Sw I went during the weekdays so we had to order by paper. All of the food arrived generally around the same time. I admit that the food was tasty but they were definitely over steamed. The prices were decent and the service could have been a little better. Don't expect too much from here. It's an average dim sum restaurant.
