eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ I will definitely give a 0 star if there is an option but I have to give a star to submit this thing. We ordered miso and tonkatsu ramen and it took them 30 minutes to serve.
Tonkatsu ramen has a horribly stinky smell, like the smell of a piece of meat that has been in the car trunk for 5 days. Not fresh pork. 
Miso ramen was okay but the soup was too salty, and the chicken was overboiled like a piece if gum.
I don't recommend... Okay, just don't have tonkatsu and miso ramen here.
