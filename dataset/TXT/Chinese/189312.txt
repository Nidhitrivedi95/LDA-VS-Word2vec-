Not only that, they served it cold, luke warm.  It's like they have all of these phos sitting prepared in advance and then serve it when it's ordered.  It definitely was not made to order.  We also ordered spring rolls, sweet sour pork, and beijing beef.  The sweet sour pork was pretty good. That's where it stops.  Definitely do not recommend this place at all.
