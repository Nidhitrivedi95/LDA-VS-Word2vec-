tnvZOd2vNCLPQS1KEZxqog Small "hole-in-the-Wall" type place. Delicious food! We had the soup dumplings, BBQ pork steamed buns, cumin lamb and General Tso's chicken, all came out hot off the stove, perfectly cooked and very tasty! Service was friendly, but seemed a little confused when taking orders which left me wondering if my order was going to be screwed up, but it all came out fine. Half the customers were Chinese, which is a good sign. The meat was American quality with Chinese quality sauce and preparation. They didn't have carts with small dishes. Everything came out from the kitchen. Will go back and try other dishes.
