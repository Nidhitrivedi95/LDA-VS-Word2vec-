SbwUKzeMlSZs-mQt0lOGQw I came for dim sum based on the rave reviews.  Maybe my expectation was set high, or maybe the food had gone downhill, I wouldn't say I was a fan of the dim sum here.  The food tasted good, as in they tasted exactly the way they were supposed to.  These were classic dim sum done right.  The ingredients were of good quality.  

The prices were really high.  A large dim sum costed over $6.  You thought you could order small and medium dim sum instead?  Not really.  Many popular and traditional items were denoted as large dim sum.  The result was a much higher than average cost per person, just to be full.  The price premium is beyond the food quality and service quality premium.
