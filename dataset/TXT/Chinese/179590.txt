X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg So I was at Hakkasan on Saturday for my best friend's bday bash and we got a table because Tiesto was going to be there and we knew it was going to be busy.  From beginning to end, the service was amazing.  We didnt have to wait in line because they sent someone to take us from the main entrance to our table.  Then they sent Ashley who was in charge of making sure we got everything we needed.  We even had a bouncer in case people were trying to crash the area.  Not to mention the people who were replenishing the cups, wiping down the table and refilling the ice.  Hands down the best club experience I've had my entire life and I'm not really an EDM guy.  I've had table service at a couple other places before, but Hakkasan was the absolute best hence the 5 star rating.  I highly recommend this nightclub with table service which is located at the MGM.
