szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A This was the first time since a UYE back in 09 my travels brought me back here. I was surprised I didn't review it the first time. It is a zoo for Dim Sum. Expect to wait for a table unless you get there when they open. With a group of 6 we were able to try many things. You never know which food items will come by your table. As it was we were all stuffed by the time any vegetables came by. I usually get talked in to trying one new thing and this time it was duck tongue. If you get a nice rotation of carts there is something for everybody.
