IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Just ate at the Noodle Shop a few hours ago and everything was great! Being Chinese myself, I know what authentic Chinese food is, and this isn't it.  It's comparable to a PF Changs, maybe.  

I would probably never pay full price to eat here, I had a restaurant.com coupon that I used to get $25 off.  We had the sweet and sour chicken and the mongolian beef.  Both plates were solid and tasty.  Portions are just right and respective sauces were good.  

At the end of the meal, what was supposed to be a $40 meal after taxes and tip, came out to $15.  I felt a little bad since service was great, so I just tipped a bit more.  

I will probably be back next time I'm in Vegas, but i will be coming armed with a coupon.
