cdLBNUBgPurw3PyLXvbiGA I've been here for both lunch and dinner and have had their specials both times. Every time I've gone the food has always been filling, and I've always had leftovers to bring home. It's kind of nice because you're paying for two meals. Although, food the next day is not always the best, I'm the type who does not like to waste food so I bring it home anyways. 

The appetizers, main course, dessert and the tea/coffee at the end especially really fills you up. I was excited to have the lobster bisque, however I thought it required a bit more flavouring. I had to add some more salt and pepper in it. Other then that, everything else tasted great! I realize every time I've ordered the specials, they do not have a lot of vegetables, so more vegetables on their dishes would be nice. 

There's also a VIP card you can get if you go there regularly. I do not come here regularly so I did not get it for myself. I find I always end up paying more every time I get these VIP cards so personally I do not get it. 

On a side note: I remember coming here with my friend once, and she happened to have knew the people who worked at this cafe and got the 10% discount anyways without the VIP card. Maybe I should go with her to this place more often ;)
