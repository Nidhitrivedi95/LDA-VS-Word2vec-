It's all self-service, which is good or bad, depending on your needs. This means you take care of everything, your water, your utensils, etc. If I'm not mistaken, you also pick up your food when it's ready. And of course, you have to clean up after yourself. The interior also is also divey with a big lazy susan in the middle of each big round table. Minus these drawbacks (or charm, depending on your mood), the food is seriously good. I'm not Chinese/Chinese American but I have a decent palate. Prices are a little up there, so that's something to consider. Still, this place beats any fancier Chinese restaurant in town--hell, maybe even in the state.
