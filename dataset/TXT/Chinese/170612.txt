vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Currently this is my favourite Dim Sum in the US. The prices are dirt cheap in comparison to LA/SF/NYC, and the quality is top notch. The servers with the carts are quite pushy, and you'll need to learn to say no and keep looking for what you want, but it's worth it. Also, there can be some serious language barriers at times, but if it looks good it probably is good and eventually you'll learn what everything is. I never miss this place when in Vegas and I suggest you don't either. Even if you don't have a car with you, it's worth the cab ride.
