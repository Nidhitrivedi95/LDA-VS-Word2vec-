V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA Although a noodle fan I don't care for their preparations which are mostly soy flavored.  I lived in Japan for two years and have worked in and out of Asia for years and am maxed out on teriyaki and other soy dishes.

I eat the bread and dumplings while those I am with go with their noodles.  I have been suggested to and encouraged to try the cajun pasta and I promise that I will.

That said, our son loves it.  It is his form of noodle heaven and he would live on noodles if he could.  He likes the varieties and the spicy dishes.  It is more than just a bowl of Asian pasta.

Drinks are self-serve, service is friendly and they will answer any questions you have.  And it is clean and maintained that way, even during the lunch crush.
