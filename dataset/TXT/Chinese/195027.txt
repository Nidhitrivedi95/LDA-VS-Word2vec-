zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I would not recommend this restaurant at all. It is very pricey compare to other ramen restaurants that are way better in terms of flavour. I would suggest to make your money worth it and buy indomie instant ramen that will only cost you $6 for a pack of 5 or other instant noodles than the black truffle ramen that they have for $32 i believe. Though, the service was very good and they do not neglect their customers, but overall we're very disappointed with the price that we paid.
