Ozf92eEJSwwb3LbO50cvag Came here tonight since my wife is traveling to see what the place is like. I really wanted to like this place, very close to my house. I would like to echo that the service and people are fantastic. However, the food is a 4 on a 10 scale. The Generals's chicken was heavily breaded, made of chicken parts and very salty. I am a bit of a health nut so I was hoping for more white chicken than bread. Fried rice was nice and so was the hot and sour soup. Would be nice to have some healthy options on the menu. I would pay an up charge for chicken breast not breaded.
