DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg First time trying this place because it was a highly recommended. I liked how they offered brown rice and their food are not greasy like some other Chinese food place. I ordered chicken pad thai, steak mongolian beef, spicy chicken, and kung pow chicken. My favorite is the steak mongolian beef
