The others included fried tentacles, chow mein, sweet and sour chicken, deep friend pork chop - was just aiight. We even got some fried doughnut things to dip into soup. Those were pretty good!

The service was tolerable - fairly efficient but bordered on rude if I didn't write it off to a culture thing. Would not choose to go here again - I was visiting family and just followed their suggestion and ordering.
