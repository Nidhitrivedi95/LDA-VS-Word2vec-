cw0wVQxImxix2GoChgIYNQ Great price great variety.. Can't beat $7.99 for a lunch buffet.. The mongolian grill is the cherry on top, however a few more added spices and ingredients to the existing lineup would be a plus.. Some of the entrées aren't the greatest tasting but others make up for it.. There is definitely something for everybody and the staff is fast and friendly.. They get 4 stars from me, and I will definitely be back..
