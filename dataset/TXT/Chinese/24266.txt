6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag OMG! Services in this restaurant is terrible, my friends and I went to China MaMa last weekend. Only few tables were taken at that time, so it wasn't a busy day for them. We ordered five courses and some drinks, it seemed normal so far. After two minutes, the thing happened. the server came back and said "sorry, our chef doesn't wanna cook one of five course,"  "what??? Could you say again!!!", she said the same words again. Therefore, I'll never go this restaurant again
