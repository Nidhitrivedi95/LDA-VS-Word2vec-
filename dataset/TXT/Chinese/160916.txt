Everything else I've eaten here over the years is good too but for some reason, which maybe has it's roots in my love of eggs, I just can't get enough of it. Other noteable dishes include the szechuan chicken with its light and tangy, but not too sweet sauce. As an added bonus, there are always fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce waiting for you on the table.

There was a steady stream of people getting take-out and it was pretty early when I was there last. I've done takeout and they tell you twenty minuteson the phone, but the food is always there waiting for me by the time I get there. There is prompt service when you eat in as well.
