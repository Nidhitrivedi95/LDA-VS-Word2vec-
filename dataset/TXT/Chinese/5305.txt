079CV1EE5WLdQqVEVYFeHQ Awesome mom & pop run restaurant!! They are very courteous and the food is delicious!! Decent portions for what you pay! The Mongolian beef was not crazy spicy which I love. Crab puffs have white onions in them, which I'm not a fan of. But good overall. Can't wait to try their lunch special!! Don't forget to check out the local comic book shop next door and head to the barcade nextdoor too!!
