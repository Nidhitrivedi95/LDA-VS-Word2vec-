pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA We're going to assume we just went on a bad day, but my wife and I were really disappointed with this recommendation.

The sushi (sashimi) was nothing to brag about, especially given the higher cost of it. The service was not very good either. We sat at the sushi bar and almost immediately after asking one of the chefs what he recommended, we were quickly (and rudely) reprimanded by a random waitress and instructed to not speak with them. We were told to ask the waitresses if we had any questions.

Our feeling on good sushi is both the quality of the fish and the social aspect with the chefs. If this is your kind of environment as well, this location is not for you.

Not returning.
