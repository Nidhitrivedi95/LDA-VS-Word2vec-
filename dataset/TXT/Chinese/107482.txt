lapNvwl_u-x_g9MlMjW1FQ Just ordered delivery and I had to yelp it out!

Tried this place out based on the one review posted on here, and it was totally worth it. The prices are really good compared to Mandarin and C'est Bon and it tastes very fresh. New favorite chinese delivery for sure!
I ordered pork dumplings, sweet and sour chicken, fried rice and a soup and it is all so tasty, very impressed!

The delivery guy was so nice too!
