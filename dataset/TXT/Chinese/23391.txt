6tY0tn39Mb8FCLYBAXXOUw Keeping in mind this is a new restaurant. The menu is straight forward but the prices are a little on the high side ($10-$16) for your entree (rice of choice and meat/veg). Chose 2 dinners 1 egg roll and soup. Came to round $25 for the 2 of us. 
  The wonton soup was pretty flavorless and that was the theme of the meal. The Kung Pao lacked any "pow" (I realized they didn't ask how hot I wanted it when I started eating) and my wife's egg roll was undercooked. We both agreed that it was a pretty underwhelming meal. 
   I hope this place makes some changes because of how convenient it is for me. Between the bland food and lack of customer service both on the phone and in person it's gonna take some work.
