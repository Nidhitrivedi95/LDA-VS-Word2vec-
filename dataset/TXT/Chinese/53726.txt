Sooo... instead of listening to my fellow Yelpers, I took some blind advice given on Instagram and ended up getting an unsatisfying meal.

We had ordered the Green Onion Pancake [103], The Pork Soup Dumplings/Xiaolongbaos (XLB) [111], the Pickled Vegetable with Pig Intestine Clay Pot [39], and the Sweet & Sour Fish [86].  I had completely forgot to order the Beef Pie, which is apparently juicier/saucier and more flavorful, much to my disappointment.  

Anyways, what I really wanted were the XLB and they were decent!  Everything is handmade and the skins on these babies were tender and delicate.  Sadly, it was so delicate that three out of seven of the soup dumplings had been punctured and spilled its soup before we could even pick them up to eat.  The ones with that still had the soup were pretty good though.  My companion's dish, the pickled veggies with intestines in a clay pot, was flavorful and the intestines were thankfully clean.  Ain't nobody got time for particles-filled intestines!  The onion pancake and the sweet & sour fish were lacking luster.  The onion pancake lacked any flavor or seasoning and the fish dish came out soggy.  It was such a bummer! 

The service can be pretty slow since it's a really popular joint that's much too small.  There was a line out the door!  Halfway through our meal, we were asked to relocated to a booth so we can give our table up to a single lonely diner which I understand but it was kind of a drag to walk across the restaurant balancing your purse, jacket, and plate.  I never did get a water refill either.  

All in all, I'd come back for the XLB and to try their Beef Pies [get your mind outta the gutter!].
