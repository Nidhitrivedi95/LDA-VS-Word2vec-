iemZJSKNBp8vx66CPBG79Q Penglai Fairyland Restaurant serves a mixture of Cantonese, Lu and Korean cuisine..

It just got a little confusing for me to decide what to order..... But since my dinner mate is not really adventurous and cannot takes spicy at all.. We stuck with Cantonese set dinner for 2...yawn..

Banchan with 4 varieties were A ok. I definitely had better..

Our set dinner for 2 ($32) consist of:

Chicken mushroom spring rolls

Choice of chicken corn or hot and sour seafood soup

Diced Chicken with pineapple (canned one which I don't really enjoy)

Shrimp with Snow Pea

Food overall is not too good.. At least the dishes I tried.

Fortune Cookies and Oranges as desserts? I am really confused..

The layout is similar to Ambrassdor with private rooms that great to host gathering.

Lunch Specials from $7.50. I guess I will come back for that instead.
