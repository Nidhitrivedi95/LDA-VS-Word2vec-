9ibMbke1qYbmhJ2Qf3tWfA My hubs and I LOVE this place! 

We drove all the way from Maricopa just to eat here yesterday and the food was, and   always is, Amazing!  The staff is super nice and they give you some watermelon with your fortune cookie at the end.  

We will be going there every other week to get a different dish everytime. I am going to be trying the spiciest dishes near the end of my pregnancy to hopefully get the baby going.. can't wait!! 

Love Dragon Express! :)
