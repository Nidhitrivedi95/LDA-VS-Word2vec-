KXLjOJbl9VYXFxKT4YK99Q I love this place! Big portions, great quality fresh veggies. Everytime I walk in and order they make my order fresh. Been going there about 2 years now and I've Never ever had a bad experience with the food there. It's prob some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. Usually Chinese food is super gross and greasy and veggies are usually over cooked and soaked in oil. Not at this place. The WOR WONTON SOUP is the best soup. The veggies in it are crunchy and fresh. Huge portion w/ chicken, shrimp, wontons, cabbage, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots etc. I'm getting hungry envisioning this. 
ORANGE CHICKEN is not like nasty Panda Express. It's real orange chicken and they put orange rinds in it. So yummy! MONGOLIAN BEEF super tender beef. HOUSE CHOW MEIN beef with shrimp and noodles. My husband and I have had a lot of different things from there and we're never disappointed. And they are always so nice to us when we go. The only negative thing I have to say is that the people posting negative reviews of this place obviously don't know good food. They should stick to Panda Express.
