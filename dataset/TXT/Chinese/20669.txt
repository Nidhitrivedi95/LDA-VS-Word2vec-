618yZxC6stz-Un4xLsp5vw I've had Chinese food delivered from China A Go Go several times and have been happy for the most part.  I have generally purchased through GrubHub and this restaurant delivers extremely fast.  There has never been a mistake in my order.  I have to comment about one delivery, though. :-)  The driver asked me to please order my food earlier because of my house location and because it was their peak busy time.  Problem is...I placed my order at 4:30pm.  Do they expect me to eat my dinner at 3:00pm because it's more convenient for them?  Very odd.

That said, I've really enjoyed their food.  My family has been less enthusiastic saying that they think the flavoring is somewhat bland.  In some dishes, such as the garlic chicken, all you get is heat - very little flavor.  I particularly like the chicken fried rice and broccoli beef and would recommend those dishes without reservation.  Overall, the location is convenient, delivery is fast and the food is pretty good.
