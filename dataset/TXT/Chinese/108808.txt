LjZ_JdhxSzzCdTqisU_Law This place is my go-to for Chinese food.  It's pretty basic as far as decor goes, but they have pretty much a great everything.  My favourite is probably the wonton soup, but they make a killer stirfry which seems to only take seconds.  

Fresh, hot, quick, and even tastier the next day. Can't get any better than that!
