PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg We ordered three entrees last night for delivery. All three entrees were extremely dry and my wife could not finish her Pork Lo Mein. The Sesame Chicken was crisp and the flavor was good, but again, was very dry. The Curry Chicken was the best of the three entrees. The white rice was low quality and also dried out. We will not try this restaurant again.
