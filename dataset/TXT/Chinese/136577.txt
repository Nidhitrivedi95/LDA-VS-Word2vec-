QHZw2L6LV1qmExNJbfhIsQ The good:

This was probably the best looking dim sum restaurant I've been to. The tea was good, lots of room to move around and be be cramped up.

The bad: 

The server lady gave me a bad cut eye for asking for more time on the menu. Hey maybe it's the stress of the job, but aside from that, there wasn't much negative about this place.

The neutral:

The food. Maybe I'm a picky dim sum eater, but I still very much prefer dragon boat fusion over this place. But to one their own :) it's still good!
