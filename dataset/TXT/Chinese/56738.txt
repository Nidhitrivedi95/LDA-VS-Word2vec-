d_jxInosU_3cAYI0qi34UA Food is pretty good, though my favourite is their Fried Rice Noodle with Sliced Beef & X.O. Sauce but it would be even better if they would cut back on the oil.
Yes the atmosphere is quite noisy which makes is hard to converse with others at your table, but you do get used to it after a while.
Service is usually pretty fast, and pricing is decent.
