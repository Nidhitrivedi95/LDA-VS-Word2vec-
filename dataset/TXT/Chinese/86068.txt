HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Had the pork belly bao, pot stuckers, and sesame noodles. The bao was so good, i mean, it's like fat bacon. I really enjoyed the sesame noodles. I didn't care for the pot stickers but my lady says they're probably the best she ever had so if you dig em, try em. The casino is very rinky dink but don't let it distract you from the food here. Gotta go back and try other stuff, like the peking duck bao
