bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Food is wonderful, at a great price - we had an array of items to include General Tso's Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Fried Rice, and Egg Rolls! The show was entertaining, if a little "cheesy". It's very loud in the showroom, so dinner conversation is difficult. We will definitely go back, but we'll sit in the dining room.
