OiR6kP_mAD47vKU1WiPshg Picked up something for carryout, first time, just moved down the rd. I only order vegetarian when picking up Chinese food but I must say the presentation/food is solid! It came in a styrofoam container that had a plastic bag wrapped around it to retain the Heat, and came with a little bag of soy sauce  fortune cookies and tea, I declined sweet and sour or spicy mustard when I was asked. lomein noodles were thinner than the usual but very tasty. Egg rolls were very fresh, will go again for sure!
