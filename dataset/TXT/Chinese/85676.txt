hMTzciZhfmugG2EVAPANcg I have been to the Golden Wok Inn a few times in the past. I haven't been there in a few years. I was in the area and had a craving for chinese and figured I'd order from Golden Wok Inn. I knew I liked it in the past so I was excited to get from there again. The 2 workers I encountered were very friendly and both thanked us for our business. The food did not take long at all to make, about 20 min. I ordered a chicken lo mein, general tsos, and 2 egg rolls. All 3 of the items were delicious. I haven't had luck with other chinese food restaurants other times I ordered from them. Golden Wok Inn is where I will order chinese food from now on!
