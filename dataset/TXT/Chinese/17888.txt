4XGjbI2Ggi-kdgt9eZR83w I've only been to two other Chinese buffets in my life - one in Austin, Texas around 2004 and Journey on the east side a few months ago. Between Journey and World Buffet I personally preferred World Buffet. The Texas joint was a more fancy-pants affair (not actually fancy, but more thought put into the presentation and ambiance). 

WB is in pretty dire need of an update, but the dated 80s-ness of the place is probably what helps to keep costs down. Dishes, silverware, and the serving areas were clean, and the food was hot on a weekday at noon. For around $8 with a coupon you can't ask for much more. 

The two best things I sampled were the breaded bites for sweet & sour chicken (though I'm a weirdo that goes sans sauce and dunks them in spicy mustard) and the sesame chicken (though, as Pat D. noted, there was no sesame or traditional sauce involved, but a nice pepper coating that I really liked). 

I tried two pieces of their veg sushi - it comprised cucumber, avocado, and I think melon? It was about on par with grocery store sushi but I appreciated they were more creative than just a boring cucumber roll. 

On a random note I could not find any white rice, but the fried rice was fresh. I enjoyed the very light strawberry and mocha cake squares on the dessert buffet - usually I'm too full for dessert but the airy texture satisfied my sweet tooth without leaving me full of regret. 

I don't think WB will be a regular stop, but I do think we'll be back. We'll probably give their takeout a whirl - the website has the same price as the buffet, but a sign inside listed it at around $5 a pound. Either way, you'll get a good amount of food for a low price.
