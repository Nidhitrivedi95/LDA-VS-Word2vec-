qO6CWdRFfbOqDJ2UOulpaA The food is pretty good here and so are the portions. However, make sure you check your bag every time you go. They staple and tie the bag but it's worth opening and checking. Especially if you order white rice. Without fail, every single time we've been there they have forgotten that. If you want it delivered it'll probably be about 45 min and if they forget something(95%of the time) then it's another 45 min(even if it's one box). I used to eat there frequently but it's time to start checking other places out. 
The food isn't bad, it's the customer service. My dad called upset and stated that it happens every single time whether we are in store or having it delivered and they had the nerve to question him about the order as if he was lying. And on top of it there were no apologizes or discounts or anything given.
