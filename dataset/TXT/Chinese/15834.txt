3sdUVTMBHPiVN5zqZjb1zw Disgusting is the first word that comes to mind.  I watched a young boy drop a plate of Lo Mein and a orange on the floor.  Six employees walked right pass the mess and one young man at front desk kicked the orange.  

The food trays were mostly empty and this was 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon.  Labels for the food were missing and I was not quite sure what I would eat.  I witnessed employees changing out trays of food with no gloves or hair covering.  Had I been a health inspector, I would have shut it down immediately.  Plus I was charged $9.99.... Seriously???  Stay clear!!!  dirty, very dirty...
