6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ Food was decent but not great. Maybe even mediocre. Started off with takoyaki. Takoyaki is my favorite so I have to admit I am picky with it. I would give it a 2/5. Nothing special and was not crispy enough. The onigiri was alright but a little bit squishy. The grilled pork jowl was kind of disappointing. The pork katsu curry bowl was decent. Again, nothing special. The donburi special was good. The meat was tender with the right amount of sauce. Donburi redeemed itself with very good service. Waiters cared about every table and took care of all customers. They did not come ask how the food was but were very nice and polite when serving food. Do not think I will go again though. Its one of those one time, fad, places.
