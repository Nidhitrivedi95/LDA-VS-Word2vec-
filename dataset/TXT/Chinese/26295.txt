Tried their soup dumplings. The ones they have here are grilled on the bottom so a bit different from othere places. The portions of the dishes are extremely generous. The one dish that stood out was the braised beef noodle in soup. The noodles were a bit different here aswell. They were a bit thiner but still with a good chew. The braised beef was soft and tender.

Tried a few other dishes and they were all excellent.
