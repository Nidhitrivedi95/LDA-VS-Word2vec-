QxnwaNgY6_e88SBfmT6k1w Think Lobster cooked well and served on bed of yummy noodles. 
Did I mention the way the dish is served looks as if the Lobster is swimming in the noodles? In a brothy sauce that's mild in flavor but delicious?
Did I mention I am not a fan of seafood? Did I mention I usually can't stand calamari, but when they deep fried the little squid cupper suckers of our little squid friends, that they were al dente, flavorful, and yummy?
Seriously, I have had Chinese food in SF Chinatown, Oakland Chinatown, Los Angeles, in Dublin, Ireland, and yes, even in Laramie, Wyoming. But I must tell you, that this is the best Chinese food I have ever had. Hong Kong style that is authentic to the hilt.  Dim Sum is available for dinner!
With the cold biting at you outside, it was so nice to sit down, have a cup of tea and pig out on some wonderful food with  wonderful friends. 
Richmond Hill, a suburb of Toronto, is a little shining gem of Canada. I only wish I had more time to hang out and try all the authentic places of Singapore cuisine and more. However, coming here was a great treat on my first trip to Canada.
