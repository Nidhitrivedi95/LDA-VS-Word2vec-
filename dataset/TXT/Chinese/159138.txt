u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ I totally agree with the other Yelpers!  It is the best authentic Chinese food in Vegas.  Prices are decent too.   Our uncle that lives in Vegas brought us here.

We started out with some free house soup.  Was very good.  

Then we had a fried quail.  Pretty tasty.  It needed to be just a tad more crispy, then it would have been perfect.

Next up was some string beans stir fried with minced pork.  Flavor was wonderful, homey and not very salty.

After that we had some stirfried veggies.  That was good too.  There was actually asparagus in there too!  Rarely do you find that in a chinese restaurant.

We didn't order any meat dishes, but we did get some seabass.  They cut it in chunks, lightly battered and fried.  Then it's cooked together with some tofu and veggies in the clay pot.  Very tasty!

They also gave us free house dessert.  It was green bean with tapioca sweet soup.  Yes, sounds nasty but it's pretty good!  

Will definitely go back with friends & family the next time we're back in Vegas.
