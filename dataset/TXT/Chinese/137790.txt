QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw I came here with a group of 7 for lunch on a Sunday. We arrived right when they opened at 11 and they were able to accommodate our large party; otherwise it can get pretty crowded. All of us ordered the lunch hot pot special. You can choose from a non-spicy mushroom broth or a spicy Szechuan broth. Each person has their own hot pot and burner. You select a protein (chicken, lamb, beef or pork) and it comes with a giant plate of veggies and other goodies (fish balls, rice cake, tofu, enoki mushroom, etc). You only get about 6 slices of meat but it's more than enough. I think I was the only one who finished their whole plate. In addition to the meat and veggies, you can get unlimited noodles (there are 3 different kinds) to cook in your broth. There is also a condiment bar where you can make your own custom dipping sauce. All of this came to $9.95/person. It's a really great deal for lunch, plus cooking your own food is kind of fun!
