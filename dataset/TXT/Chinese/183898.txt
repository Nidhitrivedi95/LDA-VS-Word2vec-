XtPizI-UGjySLiQrRuNjYQ Without a doubt one of the absolute all-time best Xi'an style food we have had in Canada.

The restaurant itself:

Beautiful mural on the wall, reminded me so much of western China.

The furniture - chairs are beautifully engraved/carved.

Now:  the food.

EXQUISITE:

The braised lamb was served piping hot - in a thick, luscious, rich and flavorful sauce.  Lots of hot chili peppers.  VERY LA.  Mmmmmmm.  The lamb was cooked to perfection - tender, flavorful - perfect bite size for the chopsticks.  Fell off the bone.  Mmmmmm.  Perfect ratio of vegetables, glass noodles and lamb ... *sigh*

Shredded pork mian-bao.  Bread not heavy, pork cooked to perfection.  Use some of the chili oil on the table and it is just divine.

The dry fried beans with garlic, meat and tons of hot chili peppers was an absolute perfect accompaniment to this gastronomic experience.

This place was a real find.  What an amazing restaurant.  We ordered well and were not disappointed.

Only thing - I wish they had a couple of tea choices.  Waitress was borderline indifferent to us - first time customers - maybe we'll get a warmer welcome next time.  The food is what matters here - and it is exceptional.  The ambience/decor also very tastefully done.

You can hear the roar of the gas stoves which reminded me so much of my experiences in China.

They have some fish dishes as well.  Lamb is the real star of the show here.  Enjoy!!!!
