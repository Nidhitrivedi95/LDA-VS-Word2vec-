IZ33QKVggRtHdMdWoDPi6Q I am according Ginger & Onion four stars because I like to encourage them and their push cart style of dim sum delivery. There are not many places left, which have carts anymore and more and more of them are closing and changing to the less labour intensive waiter-and-menu method. It is too bad. I have been enjoying push carts for years and they are dwindling. Even Ginger & Onion had a sister counterpart up the road years ago. 
I have been here before and the service was the best I have ever seen from them today. The carts kept coming quickly, there was a variety of dim sum being offered, waitress refilled the water and brought tea (which is not free) quickly. The carts came at a regular pace so no matter which side of the room you were or which dumplings or desserts, etc. you wanted you would be satisfied. This is not always the case here in the past.
The siu mai was disappointing and flaccid, but everything else worked Oddly, my favourite items was the fried tofu. They also were carting shrimp dumplings, rice rolls, crispy shrimp, ribs sesame balls and many dessert items.
Being at Pacific Mall there is not a lot of parking and there is a rush at the door so they hand out numbers. My tip is to arrive before 11:30 or after 1:00 for lunch. Speaking of which dumplings are priced per item and are most expensive (like $3.20 each) during meal hours, cheaper ($2.90) during the afternoon and cheapest (I believe $2.60 each) morning. Yes, they are open all day. Great!
