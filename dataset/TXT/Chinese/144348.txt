rv9T1qGHbh9eXqFpKEPy_A How can you rate a place bad because of price?  If you are staying at The Boulders I am guessing that the price of food is not an object.  If you are expecting Panda Express then go find one.  There might be one around the Wal-Mart off Carefree Hwy and Cave Creek.  I bet you Price Haters complain at Morton's, Mastro's, Ocean Club, Tonto, Cartwrights, Harolds, and Black Mtn. Coffee shop.  Probably can not afford to go to these places.  This area Scottsdale, Carefree, and Old Town Cave Creek in not for a person on a beer budget it is pricey...might be too pricey for a beer budget $5.00/bottle for domestic beer.  So Expect High Prices.
Whew, awesome food, start off with Wor Won-ton soup, order lunch salad, salt and pepper shrimp, House Fried Rice & Noodles.
Great Place and service.  Great at any price...same as Tonto, Cartwrights etc.
Ta Ta you price haters go to Panda and find something to bitch about there.
