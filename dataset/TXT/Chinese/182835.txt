XJo_kPFlbuORqL-mE2Ny6w Worst Vietnamese Pho EVER!

I have to start this review by saying that I was NOT expecting an authentic bowl of pho. What I WAS expecting was a noodle soup that would be tasty.

However, I was served a bowl of soup that consisted of:
- at least 10 raw scallions in one inch pieces
- HUGE chunks of raw meat that were NOT cooked in the bowl and only took on a blue shine (pho is usually served with THIN slices of raw meat that are able to cook in the soup bowl)
- large slices of half a raw onion
- noodles that were so overcooked they couldn't be picked up using chopsticks.
- an ok chicken broth

after fishing out the raw-as-hell meat and all the onion I was left with a quarter bowl of overcooked noodles & 4 shrimp in a basic chicken broth.

For $12.99?? Are you kidding me??

I left just as hungry as I entered! Had to stop by chipotle to get a bowl to go so I could eat some fresh good food.

Will NOT be going back to stir crazy again.

My husband got the kung pao noodle bowl. He said it was 'ok', but certainly not worth the price.
