McQsl_USMy6kfUz9J02Tdg I have been stopping in the last week or so for lunch, and have only had the large bowl of war won-ton soup both times,  but it is very good. The service is top notch, the place is immaculately clean, and the prices are what you would expect. The only even slight complaint I have is that they do not have fountain soda, but rather plastic bottles of soda instead. But I really like this place.
