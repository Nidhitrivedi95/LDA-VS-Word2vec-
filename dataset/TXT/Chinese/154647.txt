tEfvf1cznLZUIeTcKKpAIw Great chicken choice! Price and quality that are superb for the unwealthy :P...delicious solid pick....the chicken is only enhanced by the interesting choices of sprinkled on, table side seasonings. Everything to love and nothing to hate about the place except for the calories and lack of late night hours.
