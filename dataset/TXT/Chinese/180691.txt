It is what it is.  What do you expect when you go to an all you can eat buffet that is only 8 bucks for lunch and 13.00 for dinner.  If you want stellar service, food, and ambiance then go to the Wynn or Bellagio, that's what you're paying the 40.00 bucks for! 

I swear this is like a tourist attraction for my fam and I bc we go here every time we are in town visiting my aunt and uncle .  It's not too far from the strip by car because really who wants to walk anywhere in that heat.  It offers a huge selection of Asian cuisine from seafood, to the mongolian style bbq, and sushi (not sure if I would touch the raw fish here but the crabmeat should be fine!).  While some dishes are hit or miss, I did like most of it especially the dumplings, fried chicken wings, Chinese donuts, shrimp, crab rangoon, and garlic tilapia.  I think they have crab legs only for dinner or the weekend?  The service and environment are fine, they take your drink orders and your dirty plates away, what more do you need?   I end up walking away with a  muffin top and double chin, but yes...so worth it.
