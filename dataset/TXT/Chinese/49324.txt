CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw very yummy!!!!!  i could eat here every single day and never tire of it.  little on the spensy side, but very large portions.  i suggest maybe splitting an entree, but definitely fill up on appetizers!

minus one star for no free refills!!!  what the hell is that about?  it's vegas!!!!
