J8ehGrOQvdUr_CS73uxfGw I work in the financial district and I often frequent places in the PATH for lunch.

I do not like most places I eat but it is all that is there. Then I found Wikki Hut!

Wikki hut has a long line up at lunch sometimes, but it is so worth it.

I get the Ecuadorian Rice, which is rice and beans and it tastes amazing. It is like crack, I could just order the rice if possible. Carbicide :(

The Mango Salad is amazing. I get the Asado chicken but I swear it has to be pork.

Everything is very tasty here. I wont say I believe it is absolutely healthy, it borderlines soul food/comfort food. 

They pile on the food high, portions are really big - they dont skimp out.

I love Wikki Hut :)
