u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ this place used to be really good, but for some reason quality of food has gone down hill a lot, like aaaaaaaaaa lot, came in with mom for dinner tonight, dishes real hot but weren't fresh and tasty at all, next thing i notice their health inspection grade a biggo " C " , tbh i mean its okay to have a " C " when your food is good, but when ur food aint good, place aint clean, then there is a EFFING problem, but i gotta say their customer service is consistently good as always tho, gotta give them credit for that. most likely not coming back anytime soon!
