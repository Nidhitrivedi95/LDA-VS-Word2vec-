ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Came here to celebrate my mom took me because I was in the mood for sushi and she said she saw this cool Japanese restaurant driving home one day. We went, the waiter sat us and brought us some kind of grapefruit soda. The lunch menu was I guess different then the dinner menu there was no sushi at all. I was sad but still willing to try the one thing they did have on the lunch menu which was a build your own bowl and a appetizer. The appetizer took almost a good 20 min it was about the size of my palm maybe smaller it was terrible it was a waffle with a small piece of chicken and some kind of sweet and sour chili sauce the chicken was so incredible dry it wasn't edible and the waffle was so soggy! I love chicken and waffles but god damn what the hell were they trying to pull off. The waiter never came back after that, no one did...there was literally one other person in there eating and 4 waiters all tucked in a corner talking about I'm sure how hip they look cause that's all they were good for was being pretty the waiting was garbage. Finally 45 mins later our food came out and I'm not going to bore you with my description of how terrible this food was all I'll say is I swear someone used dirt as seasoning there wasn't a lick of flavor in me or my moms dishes. Wtf man my mom was trying to hunt down one of the 4 waiters 3 times the last time she had to stand up and wave her arms around. And finally one of the cooks came over all she wanted was some sauce to make what we ate a little more edible. Anyway 50 dollars was the total and it was 50 dollars down the toilet and a horrible celebratory lunch. I'm never coming back my moms never coming back and I'm not suggesting this place to anyone. Mad terrible
