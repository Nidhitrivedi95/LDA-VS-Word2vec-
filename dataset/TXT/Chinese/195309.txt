zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I am a huge fan of David Chang. HUGE. Going to Momofuku NY is on my bucket list, but thankfully I was traveling to Toronto and was able to accomplish it here instead. 

Here is what I'll say about this. Is this your everyday affordable greasy comforting ramen? No. Is this your "I'm going to treat myself" ramen? Yes. 

What you're getting at Momofuku isn't just about a bowl of noodle, soup, and pork. Its carefully crafted using higher quality ingredients with some minor twists of the chef's palette. It isn't just a bowl, its an experience. So is it worth it? Yes. It is everyday? No.

I came here twice in a week, here is what I did:

Meal #1: Double Ordered Fried Chicken Day!

- Fried Chicken: 9/10 - The Korean version is superior! Crispy, moist, the skin could be eaten like its a chip! Accompanying condiments and chive pancakes are filling! This is a FEAST!
- Momofuku ramen: 9/10 Again, once in a while treat yourself ramen. Great runny egg, good portion of food though! Plenty of meat to spare. You can get filled by this!
- Clam ramen: 10/10 Wow! Great depth of flavor, love the spice! Nice heat and the soup is intended to be a thick sauce that is absorbed by the ramen. If you wonder why you're broth looks skim, its intentional.
- Okonomiyaki: 8/10 Pretty good, I prefer mind more traditionally prepared and served.
- Oxtail: 7/10 Personally, not my favorite cut of meat. Sauce was great and flavorful
- Pork buns: 10/10 UGHH...lots of fatness and juice, so simple and well executed.
- Soft Serve: 8/10 I couldn't believe how much I loved this. Get the Cereal milk with cornflakes. The coffee flavored one is pretty strong, I preferred cereal milk.
- Service: 4/10 Nonexistent, a bit pretentious at time. When our main server was around, he was nice, but finding him was hard. Then he claimed that none of the servers are assigned tables, its a free for all. Whatever.

Meal #2: Normal ramen day

- Momofuku Ramen: See Above
- Orange popsicle slushy: 6/10 Its not bad, just nothing I'd get again.
- Cereal Milk soft serve: See Above
- Service: 2/10 Our server was really clueless, nonexistent, moody, pretentious, and just plain awful. You're bored of your job, we can tell! He contradicted himself a few times and didn't even notice. Dumb.

So overall, I loved the food! I'm glad I did it and I'd do it again when I'm traveling here. However, the service is as chilly as the winter weather outside. Thank goodness the ramen is hot enough to melt some of that ice cold service away.
