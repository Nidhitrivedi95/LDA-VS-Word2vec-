PAJlmByrU8zAB3WsXxA30Q Good eats.  I have come to this restaurant only for dim sum and it's been great.  The food is good quality for your usual suspects:  haw gar, sui mai, tripe, BBQ bun, rice noodle rolls and more.  Food was fresh and delicious.  The wait staff was good - quick and our table was maintained with tea and finished dishes cleared immediately.  Good quality dim sum and looking forward to trying dinner here one day.
