hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Maybe the food itself is not 5-star quality per ser, but I just love it when Chinese restaurateurs go a step further to make their diner more unique and less the average American-Chinese restaurant. I enjoyed the overall dining experience: the big kitchen window showing the Chinese chefs making fresh soup dumplings and noodles (very common feature of noodle places in China), the vinegar and ginger slices as side (again, very Chinese), the Chinese characters of "noodles" on the back of their uniforms... The soup dumplings are as authentic as they can get in the States. I also had the pickled cucumber cubes and the wonton in chili oil (Hong You Chao Shou). Both were decent but a little too plain for my taste - after all, both are iconic Sichuan dishes. The chili oil lacks complexity in flavor. The authentic Sichuan chili oil is made with not only chili peppers but also all sorts of spices and herbs, which was absent in their version.
