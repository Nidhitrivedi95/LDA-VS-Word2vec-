Oh62VtPS3Jj9e6CNRxJh5w With flight delayed, I got to the hotel around midnight.  Exhausted and grumpy.  Went to eat at the restaurant and was pleasantly greeted with the waitress.  Needed a smiley face.  Ordered the shrimp noodle and a taro smoothy.  Wow, the taro smoothy was amazing and refreshing.  Didn't expect that from a little restaurant.  The shrimps noodle was good too.  Went back the next morning to grab a cup of coffee.  I like the gal behind the counter.  Made me a really good ice cappuccino.    Will definitely go back next time I stay at Riviera.
