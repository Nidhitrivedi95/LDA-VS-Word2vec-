_ltkVUDwaI0MTxv8g21k1A This Manchu Wok has been a place I have eaten at Carrefour Laval for quite some time.  It used to be a place I quite enjoyed.  They served large portions and the quality for cheap food court Chinese food was okay.  Then I noticed the portions seemed to me to be a bit smaller.  Also you get some chunks of just fried breaded mix with sauce.  This is a technique to rip you off as you eat a few chunks of breading and they use less meat.  It's a careful mix by the restaurant and a clever cost cutter,  however I understand this practice. 

Choice here is fried rice or two kinds of noodles.  Then you have a choice of mixed vegetables, beef with veg, the fan favourite General Tao chicken (he must have fought with Montcalm in the Plains of Abraham!), Sweet n Sour pork, Honey garlic chicken and a few others. 

The price has gone up over the years and they serve on real plates with cutlery here now but expect to pay $12-$13 with two items and drink and around $14 with three items and drink taxes in.  Sill reasonable but more expensive to similar food courts.     

The food is fairly fresh as it's a very popular restaurant= high turnover.  I just feel it's jumped the shark for me.  I'll eat it infrequently however I'll let you indulge in some GT Chicken!  Peace on brother.
