8cjXEmuqgCbIRudb2D52qw The food is actually good but the service is very very bad.  I ordered 6 dishes, got the first one in about 30 minutes.  The next four dishes didn't arrive until about 30 minutes later and after about 1.5 hours of sitting in this place, I decided to give up on the last dish.  

The servers didn't refill our drinks and when I asked for my check, she says, they just got started working on your last dish, to which I replied, "I don't want it anymore.  I've waited too long for it.  Give me my check."  I thought she went to get my check but 15 minutes later, still no check.  I hope she wasn't expecting a TIP for the service.
