WAb6ox5RrBtF7m5Cb6p56Q It was definitely time to write an update.  They now serve Chow Fun and it's always fresh, never dry, and packed full of all of the essentials.  Anyone who knows me knows that due to my childhood raised in NYC Chinatown, I base my dining scale on A) if a restaurant has chow fun, and B) how well prepared it is. It checks all the boxes.  The other reason for the bump up of stars is their delivery.  I have literally had delivery reach my office in fifteen minutes.  Granted, that isn't the norm, but I've never had food delivered more than a half hour after I've ordered.  

Wonton soup, house chow fun, and singapore noodles.  My favorites on the menu.

Super cheap all around, especially their lunch specials.  If you like a more Americanized Chinese dish - their House Chicken is actually really good.

Not to jinx it, but I order from them probably once a week.  They have yet to mess up my order, and they always deliver in a timely manner.  Also - delivery is only a $12 minimum, which is on the lower end of minimums for delivery.
