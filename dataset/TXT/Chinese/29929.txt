966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA Update, might have went wild with the 5 star the first time, yet still a solid 4.5, so the score remains.  

I stuck with old trusty (Nan Yang Chow Fun), especially since it has been awhile since I came through.  I took a co worker over and he got a little adventurous with ordering the sliced rib eye noodle soup.  I hadn't had the chance to taste it but it sure looked like a Chinese version of pho.  A side order of short ribs were added along with some veggie spring rolls.  The kalbi was a bit on the salty, otherwise, can't be beat it at $4 and some change.  The rolls were average, but both dishes came hot, which is a plus in y book.

I believe that this is still a great Chinese fusion spot that gets it done right.  Wendy did her rounds as well and was socializing with the patrons.  I highly recommend this place to friends, fam and those visiting.  Hen hao chi!!!
