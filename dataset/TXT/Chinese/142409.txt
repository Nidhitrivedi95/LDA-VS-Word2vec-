RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg Good lunch specials.  I've had both the kitchen stuff (chicken teriyaki) and the sushi and they're both fantastic.  The chicken teriyaki is made from the good stuff, not the cheap gamey parts of the chicken as many other restaurants do.  

The sushi has always been fresh, and I especially love the clam nigiri (I'm pretty sure it was clam?)-- they put a great sauce on it that's slightly oniony but mostly sweet.  It's excellent.  The sushi special comes with five pieces of nigiri and a spicy tuna roll (or california roll) and then the miso soup.  I really like their food.

Now for the bad.  This is not a huge deal for me as I generally get take out during my lunch hour and then eat at school, but their restroom is GROSS-- they really need to do a better job of keeping things clean.  This is not a one-time problem as I have seen it on several occasions and it always looks like it needs to be cleaned.  I can imagine this being really gross to someone who came to eat in with their friends or something, its a bit of an embarrassment.
