sqIEwNn-AG_zZ0LI8dpQ4A This place actually tastes good. Even for me who was born and raised in Korea.
It's very hard to find places that actually tastes Korean here.
Their sweet and sour pork, ggam poongi, and jjajangmen are heavenly.
The downside of this place is the amount of MSG in their food. I'm very sensitive to msg, I get very sleepy and thirsty after having them. 
I know that a lot of Asian places use them but nothing makes me as sleepy as the food here. You shouldn't eat too much of this stuff. 
Also, they have a poor service. I used to work nearby, my co-workers had been loyal customers over five years ordering at least twice a month. We catered several times on birthdays too. The workers don't give a damn, no friendly greetings or anything when they see us.That's why it is a three star place. Not the right place to eat out often, maybe occasionally.
