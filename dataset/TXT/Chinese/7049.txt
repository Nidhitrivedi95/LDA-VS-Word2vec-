Well if that's the case, this place is dynamic as all fuck.

Our office staff eats lunch here often, so it's not unusual for me to throw-in my order once or twice a month. Here's the weird part:

Don't get me wrong - the food is good and tasty, it's just never the same.

If you don't mind getting Forrest Gump'd for lunch, this place is all you because I can pretty much guarantee you never know what you're gonna get here.
