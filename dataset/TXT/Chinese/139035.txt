qThJY-H6Fo8HvfdIvwrjiw We drove the extra 10 minutes to give this place a try instead of our normal chinese take out in Crafton. It definately was worth the drive. The general tso chicken was made to perfection as well as the egg rolls and fried rice. The price was a little bit higher than our local place but it was still under $10 per person. If you are within 15 minutes of this place and like chinese take out, I would definitely recommend Yueng's.
