X3ixtoD0xjiVtxROlU_2wg This place may be new but they just gained a regular customer. Let me start off with the lobby. It is nice and clean, well organized and you aren't sitting around waiting for someone to talk to. Their prices are really great!! I got the 30min foot massage with 60min body massage. The body massage includes hot stone and oil! Most places would charge you extra for it but this place adds it in which is amazing for the price!! Both massages were amazing and the foot massage also included a mini face massage which was a nice touch. The rooms are nice and quiet with calming music. I would recommend this place to everyone that is looking for a great massage. 

I also like that before anything they asked me how strong I wanted the massage and if there where any areas I wanted extra attentiot! A great touch for people who are looking for specific areas to be worked one. 

Obviously I can talk on and on about this place but you just have to come in and check it out for yourself!
