gnqHyA6gY2-m9S-FKt6Xqw Love this place for cheap and pretty tasty chinese-ish food.  Went there the other day, and my boyfriend and i split the fish masala (crispy and spicy) and pork hofun (noodly with mild brown sauce).  2 very different meals, both delicious and very filling.  

Food is very reasonably priced,.  Restaurant does look a bit dingy and generally smells a bit funky, maybe a greasy-smell.  Still recommend the food.
