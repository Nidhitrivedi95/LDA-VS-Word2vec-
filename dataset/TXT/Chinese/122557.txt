OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I went to this place my first day in Vegas cause I was hungry after my flight and was yearning for some Dim Sum...

The place was easy to find with GPS guidance. Chang's is located at the Southwest half of the city and looks like a new part of town since most of the buildings looked fairly new and not much traffic in the area.  The private parking lot is sufficient for all the patrons to park. Although I got there around lunch time and the place was bustling with patrons and workers I was seated very quickly.  The place is not that large and it appeared a lot of the Chinese community was there....and you know that could indicate...?  Traditional Chinese taste...and good... :-))  As soon as I sat down, the carts started swarming around the table...like a swarm of bees to their nest - very quick service with the delivery of the food and drinks.  One of the things I was impressed with at this place was that if you tried to select something off the cart that was not of proper  temperature, they wouldn't serve it but rather bring you a freshly cooked item from the kitchen...That I thought was very nice.  Additionally, I had gotten some fish and after tasting it, found it wasn't really something I liked so I told the manager my experience and he very nicely and without any further question or hesitation replaced it with another dish to my liking. Now that's service with a smile!!

Needless to say, I've found my favorite Chinese Dim Sum restaurant in Vegas! Btw, I came back for a second time that week as I was leaving Vegas?  

The best part is they serve Dim Sum All Day! :-D

And the final thing is this place is just far enough away from the strip to give you a more relaxed feeling from the fast pace.

I'll be back!!! Can't wait till my next visit...not the strip but for the Dim Sum!!

Happy eating!!

Thanks to Jaymie B., the local Yelper compass that helped me get my bearing right on Chang's.  :-))
