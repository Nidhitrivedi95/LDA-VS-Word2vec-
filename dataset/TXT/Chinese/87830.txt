hx-oJMNnweYqE5ybU8aiSg My husband and I wanted to taste a Vegas buffet and ended up here because it was cheaper than the ones on the strip. 

The buffet did not have a great selection and the food was so bland. There was nearly no meat on the crab legs.  You get what you pay for. So if you are looking for cheap buffet good this is a mediocre option.
