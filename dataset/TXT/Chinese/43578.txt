bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug If you are seeking that perfect place to take your first date, or someone you admire. Fredrick's is not that place. The decor is somewhat corny, and outdated but if your looking for a great place to eat and don't mind the sight for sore eyes then you're in for a treat. 
Hands down best Hakka food. 
Try the chilli chicken, or the sweet and sour shrimp. 
They have great lunch specials really cheap all of the dishes come with a side of rice and a drink. 
A good rule of thumb is not to order to many dishes ( 2 people -3 dishes more than enough, with food to take home)
