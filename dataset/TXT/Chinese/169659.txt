vTlIUtYXdPxCk6UB746w8w I've visited this spot twice over the past month and a couple of times when it first opened. They have a pretty grand selection of games, but they have definitely worn down in quality overtime due to usage. Many of the games we picked out, such as DixIt, was missing several game components leaving us to awkwardly substitute pieces to make it work. The drinks themselves are relatively subpar and are all served in plastic/paper containers. If you are eco-concious, this place is definitely not for you. The staff do what has to be done, but don't expect them to go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. My friend was harassed over a tip; I don't believe she will be coming back. Given the availability of cafes like this in Markham, it's decent but it has a long way to go before it can be considered satisfactory.
