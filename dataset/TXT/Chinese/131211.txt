pIB-Js9drl27qrrSjKK_eA Uncomfortable packed-in seating and loud top 40 western music with very mediocre food here.  Maybe I'm spoiled by all the good mainland chinese noodle places in Scarborough and Richmond Hill.  Tried 3 different soup noodles and while the noodles were passable, the soup broths were quite bland.  A few more dishes has excessive amount of oil to them (and my tolerance for oily chinese food is already quite high).  Overall just a very mediocre meal, and only worth coming here if you don't have a vehicle and live in the area.  Tip: go to the other noodle shop just around the corner on Byng, it's much better.
