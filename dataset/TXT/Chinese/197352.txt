zRGCIIez1z4ve5Hppa7eVQ Chinese food reviews are always tough because you have to look from the foodie angle or the casual eater angle

Ok as the casual eater  who is an office worker looking for lunch during the week then this is for you

The usual $8 special offers an egg roll and fried rice with several specials

I chose the General Tao Chicken which is the usual canadian fare and with veggies on the side was very filling amply portioned out

I also added a Hot n Sour soup as thats my test food and it passed

Hmmmmm well as a casual diner the mommy and poppy did a great job with a great meal

is it real chinese food.??..no its canadian style chinese food so be happy to add hot sauce, soy or whatever to spark it up a bit. I have seen way to many people complain about the garlic spare ribs being garlicky...uh yeah its garlic spare ribs

Actually a touch of salt opens the flavours up a bit

many white caucasians will enjoy the fare as its what they can expect when eating out for chinese and the menu is geared towards that group

As a foodie who has no qualms chowing down on pigs ear, rabbit and frog legs alla chinois then you may need to go elsewhere for that kind of stuff!

i have eaten here several times and its always been a better choice than eating in a food court. The owner is nice and she must laugh as i grab the chinese newspaper to read (actually look at the photos) as she brings me a nice meal

if i need to rate the decor then well its cosy and fun and its not the Four Seasons or Nobu but its the right decor for chinese food
