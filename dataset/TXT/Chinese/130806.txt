I've never had a Caipirinha before but I was pleasantly surprised. Sort of like a Brazilian mojito but much stronger here. 

The sea bass skewers were delicious and the corn looked like huge mutant corn and was sweet. 

The pork belly ramen tasted like sweet and sour soup but instead of the sour, it was spicy. The pork belly itself was a little tough. Though, that didn't mean it wasn't good.
