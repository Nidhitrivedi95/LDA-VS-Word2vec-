W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ I had made a reservation for this place about a month ago and was looking forward to eat here and try the food out after hearing such good reviews about it. But until last night I had received a call from them saying that my rsvp would be cancelled because they had "recently" to decide to close on Monday's and Tuesday's. I'm not from Vegas so if I had more then at least 24hrs notice I would've rebooked for another day since they're now only opened Wednesday- Sunday only! This is more of a heads up to customer service don't inform your customers a day before that their reservation is cancelled where as this is you losing business.
