eh9e2wfsXNRa4BgVSXUu7g Now I know where all these retirees goes in the Kennedy and 14th area. They really all hang out at Hai Tang Bakery & Cafe.

I never been to a HK Style Cafe that is so buzzing with energy and full of older people.. They are all just having a good time..

And with a coffee/tea  and any Chinese buns for $1.50 I don't blame them.

The bun though I found them a little doughy and dry.. and bland. However, it is huge in size.. and it can really fill you up!

So until then, I guess I will stick with my croissants!
