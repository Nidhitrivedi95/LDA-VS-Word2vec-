X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Hakkasan has the worst service ever at a night club!! We had a table... The hostess NEVER came to check on us!! I asked FOUR workers to call the hostess so that we can order more drinks and no one ever came. The last person I asked said that the hostess is super busy with other tables so we would have to go to the bar to order our drinks.  What's the point of getting a table??? DO NOT waste your money here!! So disappointed!
