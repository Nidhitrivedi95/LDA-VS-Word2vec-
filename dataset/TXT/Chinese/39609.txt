AwmLDzqJ0aMGZTYYoZnxWg I can't get into their Singapore Noodles, the one time I ordered looked NOTHING like some of these picks. I got a giant knot of fried noodles, dark brown and way to crisp for my taste. Not what I expected. I couldn't even pull them apart.
Other than that, I've gotten the lunch combos and they seem decent. Fair prices.
