XUDOc980cjB0PZvVS-T6Eg I have to honestly say they are one of the best Chinese restaurants around. The food is incredible. The black pepper shrimp and scallops is to die for. The wait staff is  pleasant and always attentive. They truly are one of my favorite restaurants,  if not my favorite. They really have one of the most diverse selections of food. Never have I ever been disappointed from my experience at Jimmy Wans.
