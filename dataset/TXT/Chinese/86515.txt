HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Our locally-based friend and Las Vegas Weekly didn't "steer" us wrong when recommending this Asian American restaurant. 

We enjoyed generously-sized tender beefy hamburgers inside the tiny non-descript Eureka casino. Secret sauce recipe is on the wall! The burgers were so juicy, we needed extra napkins to wipe our fingers and wrists. We also tried the pork belly bao buns, which were a tasty novelty. The pork belly had a good fat to meat ratio and had a nicely crisp exterior. We brought an order of the duck baos for my friend's two kids and they scarfed down the baos so quickly we didn't even get to try a tiny bit! 

A few of the positive things about Fat Choy aside from the damn good food - it wasn't pricey (average price for a great burger), there was no wait, the server was experienced, parking was super easy and we didn't get lost once we were inside the casino. The negative - there weren't a lot of customers, so the server disappeared into the kitchen for long stretches of time. I needed a water refill and extra napkins. I ended up draining both glasses of water on the table, before she came back. Since the food we ate was pretty damn good, we would definitely go back and try some of Asian items on the menu!
