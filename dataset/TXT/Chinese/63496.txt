dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ Just tried Orient Sushi for the first time last sat. evening.
My advice:  if you enjoy sushi and eating sushi, go during the week because its a zoo on the weekends.
The bar has a bunch of seats but its in the redzone......where everyone is walking ,talking etc. , waiters grabbing food, kids running about  etc....those seats were empty during rush hour when we were there. No wonder.
I'd pass if you think you are going to have a quiet dinner with ambiance with your significant other.  It is NOT that place.

Its a sushi factory that pumps out an insane amount of food to hungry people.
Their  sushi is good...... And for 19.95 , i got 3 large rolls including a huge shrimptempura roll, 2 large pce. Yellow tail sashimi, edemame. 
My girl had the teryaki chicken with fried rice.....very good and the portions are large!
Enough for a full second dinner of leftovers.

Great value, good food but a place to simply chow down..... You'll never miss a sports moment because they have flatscreens on the walls.

If you're looking for a quiet evening......try a weekday or head elsewhere.
I may actually try their delivery service.
The staff clearly works hard and was very quick to help us throughout dinner.

I'm glad i live close by....... :)
