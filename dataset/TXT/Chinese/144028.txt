rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg Alright - I am going to update this review because Sun Asian Kitchen is a frequent stop for me.

No it's not the best (Chinese) food I have ever eaten. But their sushi is pretty darn great, plus they have a bar, iced mochas (not joking), Americanized Food items, and they deliver.

I recently just got their Sushi Salad (Tuna, White Tuna, Mango, Avocado, crisp lettuce, shredded carrots, cherry tomatoes and a spicy sweet sauce) and it was heaven. I am updating my review just because of this.

I gotta give them props, since they're in South Phoenix. We're lucky they exist out here.

You keep up the good fight Sun Asian Kitchen, and I'll ordering delivery from you (since it's hot and I am too lazy to drive).

Recommended: 
Happy Hour - It's cheap
Drinks - Fun times
Delivery - Awesome convenience
Sushi - Pretty tasty

Not:
The Chinese Food (unless you do like Americanized Chinese Food)
