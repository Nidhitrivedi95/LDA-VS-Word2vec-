oMF1F795PpnITiNfOR1e2A Lotus Tea House is located in a temple called Fo Guang Shan Temple. Atmosphere is nice. The menu selection is quite small, but I don't mind. It's a nice place to rest and eat while in the temple. It does however close quite early. I definitely recommend to try the fruit tea!! Sweet and delish. Be sure to have a look around the temple as well!! The main shrine is beautiful and there is a mini museum upstairs.

**Every item on the menu is $7 and you are required to buy food tickets before entering the restaurant. Tickets can be bought at one of the front desks near the entrance of the temple.
