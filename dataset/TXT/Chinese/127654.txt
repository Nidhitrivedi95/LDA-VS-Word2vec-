Very clean inside, friendly staff, reasonably priced.  Seems really popular when I went -- it might be because it's relatively new. The decor is alright. The dishes are neat. Washroom could be cleaner, but above average for the neighbourhood. 

The menu is simple and straightforward. Expect noodles, get noodles. 

Pick your noodle base and it comes with ten toppings. The ten toppings come separately from the soup and you put it in yourself. They advise to put the meat and mushrooms in first as it takes a bit longer to cook those through. Hold off on putting in the noodles last! It really fills up the bowl and absorbs the heat.

Keep in mind, soup and rice noodles are free refills! So ask for extra when you're done if you're feeling extra hungry. You can also swap any of the toppings (or even get ten of the same topping!). 

Don't forget about the appetizers. I think they're well-priced with respect to the noodles. Noodles + multiple appetizers for under twenty dollars? Great! I got a popcorn chicken which was pretty good; woulda personally liked it a bit saltier.
