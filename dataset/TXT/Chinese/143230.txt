rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g BEWARE CUSTOMERS when going to this shady Chinese Restaurant during DIM SUM hours. So we went to lunch today. 3 adults and one child-18 months old. When the final bill came I noticed 4 GUEST $2.63 charged onto my bill. I asked what this was for since we didn't order any hot tea. The cashier said that it's a SERVICE FEE we all have to pay for this she said. I said for what? The FEE goes towards SAUCES you use on the table, Cleaning table clothes-we have to pay to have them washed she said and towards cleaning of the kitchen as well as amongst other things. I told her that it was bull crap. That's wrong. I told her I'm from the East Coast and no where do they do this in NY, Boston, Chicago or San Francisco Chinatown. Then she said the sign is here listed that we can add the fee to your bill. That sign was posted at the register after you have already paid. That's ENTRAPMENT!!! I will never go back. By the way my baby who was 18 months old had  to pay that service fee. He didn't even eat or drink anything from that place.
