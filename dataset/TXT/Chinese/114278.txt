MVBCWXTDtU8C1Qh5mMNSKA Bait and Switch.  Super slow.

The menu specified one 10lb lobster.  We got 4 mini lobsters where the body of each lobster is as long as my index finger.  When we told the waitress this dish wasn't ours, she insisted it was and that if it was an error, they would replace it.  When we told the manager, he explained they were all out of the 10lb lobsters.  However, in the tank, you could see that they definitely had lobsters bigger than the ones we got, although maybe not 10lbs.  We felt ripped off bc there's much less meat in these little lobsters and they hadn't asked us first!  They ended up taking $20 off the bill but for a meal that cost $350, it's a lot of anguish.  

The veggies also didn't come as planned.  They came by and said they were all out of the veggie the set meal included.  Funny they put a huge plate of what we ordered on our table 5 minutes before and took it away bc they said it wasn't ours and served it to the table 2 tables away!  That table was lucky we hadn't started eating from it but it's not sanitary to do so.  The replacement veggies was half the size of the previous dish.

Our family had 2 tables.  We waited 20 minutes before the soup came.  Our other table waited 45 minutes before the first plate came.  Our table was already at the last 2 dishes!  

We won't be back!
