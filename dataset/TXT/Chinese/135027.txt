qAbXHsddBhmfQFegGiV7Dg My sister came home one night with an awesome chicken bowl.  I realized it was Tokyo House's House Chicken Bowl.  I am now a loyal fan.  I am a big fan of mushrooms, so this dish hits the spot.  I've invited different family members to this restaurant and they've felt the same I do.  I love this place!
