OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA I'm giving this place 4 stars because their wonton noodles and char-siu are really good. The service is quick and efficient, don't expect friendly service, it is Chinatown after all. It's a great resto for a quick bite of good, solid Chinese/Cantonese food. When I visit my sister and I'm not sure what to have for lunch or dinner, this is definitely our go-to spot for affordable, quick Chinese food.
