tetKWtLT0639lqnD9QJRKw Giving this place a chance to correct some things since they are so new or else I would prob drop it down to 3 stars. I decided to opt for a few entrees to share between my husband & myself. We chose honey shrimp, General tsos & the orange chicken along with chow mein noodles & white rice as a side. All the meat was delicious. The chicken was tender & the shrimp had just the right amount of crunch. All 3 sauces were amazing. My husband enjoyed the rice (although, how can you really screw up rice?) but I did not care for the noodles in the least bit. They were dry & reminded me of cardboard, almost as if they had been sitting there all day but judging by the line I know that was not the case. My major complaint is the entrance. They have an entrance that literally plops you right in the middle if the long line & another door to get into that says pull.... with no handle to pull??? After 3 days of being open I can't believe that was not corrected or even so much as a sign that says to use the other entrance. Over all the price was great (1 "big" plate, 1 "bigger" plate, 1 chicken egg roll & 1 small drink for $19 & some change) & I would go back. Hoping they correct some of the issues with parking & customer flow.
