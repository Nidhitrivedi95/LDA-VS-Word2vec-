8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ Dim sum was delicious, especially the durian pastry thats if you are into that sort of thing. It was filled with real durian and not some filler or cream. I've brought my family here for dinner but thought it wasnt really all that special. Everything was ok and not amazing; although I might come back for the pekking duck because it looked amazing. Definitely going back for dim sum before 11 am
