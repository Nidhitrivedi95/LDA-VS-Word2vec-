ja7zjowr6ymsVglQXZZ6BA I'm going to stay away from this place for a while. The food is decent, but the service is just plain bad. A few months ago I wasted my entire lunch break waiting for them to give me my food that I had ordered 20-30 minutes prior to going there. When I had no more time to wait, I just left without getting any food. I forgave that, and gave them another shot. Then today I ordered sesame tofu and got chicken instead. Not a big deal, but what if it was a vegetarian who ordered it? The staff is just not on point. So I'm going to wait a looooong time before I order from here again. Maybe by then there will be a new staff.
