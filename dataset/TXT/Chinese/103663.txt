Km0sT7E_dc2U1BkyRoy1xA One of my favorite spots in Baxter village. The Asian place to go to when in the area.

Great selection of good food and the service is great too. The plates are very big and I always have to take half of it home. I love their lettuce wraps which I think are an appetizer but are big enough to eat as a whole meal or to split with someone else.
