nDT0T3yW6G89vzdx4p_P4A My wife and I love Chinese food. We are relatively new to the area and we are eager to find a Chinese restaurant that we like. A friend recommended Jin and I am glad he did. 

The restaurant is pretty small (only 7 or 8 booths and two small tables) and is located in a strip mall. We ordered wonton soup, hot and sour soup, chicken Lo Mein, Kung Pao chicken (all of which were excellent) and chicken and cashew (which was just OK). Everything was served hot! 

The service was excellent. The price is reasonable. We will definitely return.
