Arriving for a late lunch at 3:15 pm might not be the best idea as the kitchen was having a late lunch just like me. After I placed my order, it took more than 10 minutes before kitchen staff ready to make my noodle. I don't mind the wait but I personally think if you open through the day, it might be better for business and customer service if staff takes turn to have breaks.

Open Kitchen might not be a good idea if a business not having a really clean and hygienic kitchen. I tried not to watch and stare while they preparing my food as less I know the better it is. 

The food tasted not bad. Noodle was cooked al dente. 

I don't think I will be back unless I am shopping at Briddlewood Mall. But why would anyone shop there?
