5td-5D7aMQ6zSuSSNLAQjQ Very decently well priced take out boxes! I had their BBQ Pork and roasted duck combo with rice and a drink, which came out to $5 after taxes. Their portions were pretty generous and considering the fact that nearby places charge closer to $7-8 for a take out box.

Their meat was marinated quite well and not too salty. Kong Kee is one of the best places I've had Chinese BBQ meats!
