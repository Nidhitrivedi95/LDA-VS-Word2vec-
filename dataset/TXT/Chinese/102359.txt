khxjYMwb_V8UovvwPVhysw We have been eating there since it opened and the food is excellent (especially if you go for the lunch specials).   You could find us there at least once a week, we are extremely low maintenance people, and are extremely generous with gratuity.    On our latest visit, the lead waitress was so rude to us that we will never go back.  She came to our table and asked us what we'd like to drink.  When she returned, she slammed our drinks down turned around to walk away and realized she forgot to give us straws and then literally threw them at our table.  We had no idea why she was so pissed.  I looked over at her and she rolled her eyes at me!!  We ended up leaving $10 at the table for our drinks and leaving.  In all the time we have been going there, she has never been friendly to anyone and looks like she hates the world!!!!  We've spent a lot of money there, and now we will never go back :(   The cream cheese wontons were so good :(
