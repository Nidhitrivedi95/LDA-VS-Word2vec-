hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q I love the bubble teas here! They have five flavors and you get to choose two toppings besides bubble. My favorite combination is milk coffee with bubble and caramel pudding! Although I do hope they can provide different sizes like other bubble tea places do. They only have one size and it's really big! 
.My personal favorite food here is the beef roll, and I will recommend you to try it! The pork soup dumplings are good, not "wow" good but at least tasty enough for me to go back. 
Small dining area so go there early to avoid long wait!
