yBxzqKXHhvNVaFnEOd4f7Q Based on Yelp reviews we stopped here for a late lunch.  Nicer on the inside than the outside.  We ordered egg rolls, dumplings, shrimp with lobster sauce, mongolian beef, and general tso's chicken (I was there with my in-laws so nothing too challenging.)
The egg rolls were hot and crispy, and the dumplings perfect without that overly thick dumpling wrapper.  
The shrimp with lobster sauce and the mongolian beef were perfect with a confident wok he that differentiated them from less good versions.  The chicken was OK, it had a thicker batter that I don't care for but the chicken itself was tender and tasted like high quality meat.
Definitely worth checking out.
