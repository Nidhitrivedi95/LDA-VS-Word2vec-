xjlMlnxWqMd3FGODA_z1NA The rating is more like a 3.5, but that option isn't available yet. Haha. Anyway, I just stopped by here to get my Mongolian beef fix and I must say it was some of the best flavor and portion wise.  I got an order of Mongolian beef and pork fried rice, which totaled $14+. Maybe it's just me, but that seems kinda steep for take-out for 1.  The service was quick tonight, but I've heard that sometimes it can get pretty busy, so call ahead.  Everything was flavorful and tasted good, but my only gripe was the fact that my whole container of bbq pork fried rice were fat pieces and not meat :/  Next time I go I will steer clear of that or politely ask them not to do it again.
