aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ I've been to Spring Rolls twice and both times I loved it, so I'm not sure what's with all the hate fellow yelpers. 

First off, this is a pretty affordable restaurant with great food in the heart of the hustle and bustle of the city. I LOVE thai, but I confess I'm more into western thai (so not too fishy and not too spicy) and Spring Rolls does an amazing job of satisfying my cravings.

The first time I ate here I got the cashew chicken and nom nom nom I ate the entire thing (actually this was at the other Spring Rolls on queen). It was a pretty generous portion too, but that stuff was addictive. I didn't even feel guilty. Nope, it was worth it. 

This time I had mango salad with chicken satay skewers. Normally chicken satay is like meh, whatever, good enough, but this satay was INCREDIBLE. I actually think I am going to be craving it again for days and weeks to come. White meat, nicely seasoned with a flavourful peanut dip nestled upon a bed of greens and crisp yet ripe mangos and red peppers....yes please!

The ambiance is also nice. Just really great contemporary Asian decor that is quite lovely. Service here is prompt, friendly but nothing flashy. I didn't have to ask for any refills or anything which was highly appreciated on this toasty day.  

Totally recommend this place. It's a small chain, but it's scrumptious. Everyone at both my parties were more than satisfied!
