TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ Small little place. Would have never thought to come here if my classmates didn't drag me there on our break between classes. Huge portions for the price you pay. Food tastes okay. Ordered the Kung Pap Shrimp & only got like 7 pieces and the rest was vegetables which was pretty disappointing. Overall okay food. Will probably be back if I'm craving Chinese food while at school.
