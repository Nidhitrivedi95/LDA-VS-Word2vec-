rkTFLIt_Z1bYMIuXfSyAqg There are a couple of authentic wonton noodle places in town but this is my favorite by far.  Personally I prefer the traditional types of wonton filled with a good portion of both pork and shrimp in them and Wonton Hut does this just right.  They also make 'shui gao' and these are simply the best! I have to order them every time I go in if they aren't sold out already.  I usually pair the shui gao with wontons or their beef brisket which are also to be noted of.  In general the food is great, place is clean and staff are friendly.  There is a bit of line up during lunch hours on the weekends but I'm okay with that when I crave for a bowl of good noodles :) .
