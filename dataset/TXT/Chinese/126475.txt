I came in after 7pm after work, and ordered the Mongolian beef. Your choice of spicyness! And like my fellow yelpers, they did not disappoint! Yes, it's a whole in the wall and not the cleanest place, but the food and people more than make up for that! 

If you truly are an Asian food lover then you can not pass this place up!
