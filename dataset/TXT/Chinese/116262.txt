n62dcL1e8BQA1_kUEYrldQ I would say that the food here is basic Chinese that tastes like any other Chinese restaurant.  It wasn't bad but also not memorable or special.  Our waitress was a lovely lady who was kind and helpful.  I didn't care for the girl at the cash register.  The food will hit the spot but don't expect something inventive or extra fresh.  Just run of the mill Chinese.
