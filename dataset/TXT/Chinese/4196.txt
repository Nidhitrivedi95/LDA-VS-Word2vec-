_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg For some reasons, this restaurant made it in Time Out magazine as "Best Chinese restaurant in America", so we tried.

This restaurant is not a typical America-Chinese restaurant like Panda Express, etc. So there is no egg roll, sweet and sour Chicken from there.

Ordered some random dishes to try, they are okay but not really my cup of tea. You might like them tho. To me, they are all okay, nothing too excited about.

They should be a 4 stars, but their parking situation is really bad, so either go there early or just forget about it.
