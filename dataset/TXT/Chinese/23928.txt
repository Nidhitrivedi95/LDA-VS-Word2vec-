6z-T_jIFrRQ4c6-BIvVBvA I love this place!  I bring my cousins here sometimes because she absolutely drools over this place.  The restaurant is nice (and not dirty), the service is fast, they open late, the food is great and the price is right.
Making this a quick review, I love their seafood congee, beef fun noodles, ying yang fried rice (which is called fried rice with cream shrimp and sweet and sour chicken sauce... I think), and fried turnips.  I've never tasted a bad dish from this place.  They even have bubble tea (it's not on their menu but they have the non-flavoured ones).
This place is so good that I drive 15-20 minutes just to go eat there... sometimes longer because I'm lousy at directions and get lost.
