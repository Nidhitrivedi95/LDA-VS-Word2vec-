XjmHPe0H91BlJ3gwJb7OiA I had dinner here with my parents recently and we loved it.

We ordered a 5 lb lobster salt and pepper style ($16.99 per pound = $84.95) and a lobster roe fried rice ($8).  

The lobster was huge.  It was chopped up, battered and deep fried.  The lobster tasted very fresh and the meat was firm.  The batter wasn't too salty and it was slightly spicy.  There was fried sliced garlic and pepper flakes sprinkled on top.  The lobster was so delicious.  The salt and pepper style is dry (which I prefer).  They also have ginger and scallion style, but this is wet/in a gravy.  The other style they have is Hong Kong style which will run you an extra $5.  

The lobster roe rice was also delicious.  It had a strong lobster aroma and wasn't overly salty despite being speckled with roe.  

At the start of meal they brought us some complimentary soup.  It was mostly broth with a few pieces of carrots.  There was a piece of sugar cane in the soup, but I'm pretty sure this was to add flavour and you're not supposed to eat it.  I found the soup unusual, but oddly delicious and addictive.  It tasted like pork bone soup.  There was no actual meat in the soup though.

Servers are very polite and efficient.  They cleared away our lobster shells throughout the meal.  Not all staff speak English though, but they have staff who do, so if you ask a question and they don't understand, they will get someone else to come and help you.

There's free parking, although it's in a strip mall with other restaurants, bakeries and a grocery store, so spots fill up fast.

Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and would come back.
