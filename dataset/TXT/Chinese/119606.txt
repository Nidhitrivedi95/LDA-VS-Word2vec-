Nvd7jbpKcFhpFlWOivEH6A I went for the lunch buffet, after reading the reviews here.  The decor is interesting.  The service was excellent!  The lunch buffet didn't have what I was craving: general tao chicken, pineapple chicken or even a beef dish. The fried rice was dry.  Pretty much everything was pork. I found the food good - but it wasn't hot, it was more like just above room temperature which is disappointing and probably the reason I spent 35 minutes in the bathroom an hour after eating there.  I would recommend ordering off the menu and not the buffet for that reason.
