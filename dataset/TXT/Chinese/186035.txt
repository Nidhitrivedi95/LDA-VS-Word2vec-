y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw Awesome dim sum. The Five Guys is a must and the steamed egg yolk and crunchy rice pork roll thing-a-ma-jig are superb.

Just outside the restaurant is a bar (you can order from inside the restaurant as well) that serves an incredible cocktail: "Ancient Junk." Its comprised of Kikori whiskey, elderflower liquer and sherry, house aged in a barrel. It's like nothing you've ever tasted; do it.

Also, not sure why this place got 3 $ signs because each serving (outside of the Five Guys) was under $10. 

If you're in the neighborhood, do your stomach a favor and give Pearl Ocean a try.
