OXW2erFOPT-Oov6wChxWYA I didn't think you could find soup dumplings in Toronto, but recently found a few spots... All of which were OK, but not great. That is - until I found this place. We ordered 3 orders of the Xiao Long bao, scallion noodles, pan fried dumplings and spare ribs in rice powder. All amazing. Most especially the soup dumplings and scallion noodles. 

This is the real deal. So glad this place exists. I would go as far as saying it's as good as some of the great dumpling places I've been to in Shanghai. 

It's a nice restaurant, service is great, food is spot on. This is a great restaurant to have real Chinese food. If you've been to Shanghai and loved the food, this will fill the void.
