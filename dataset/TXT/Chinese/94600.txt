jenDHueIvOhpB-0ivdiRoQ I am back and once again I was not disappointed. Our party of 5 fortunately had reservations for the Friday dinner time. Everyone except me who was hungriest left with food from the meal. I had the Thai chicken curry at a two level of heat and it was perfect along with a Singha beer. Others ate mixed vegetable and various delicious meals with a bit more heat. Service was excellent, food out shortly after we received our drinks. Jasmine tea was a bit weak with small amount of tea in the pot ... Only complaint I heard during the meal. I have to keep this place on my list of places to stop just off Interstate 17 in Anthem, Arizona, north of Phoenix -- good to know if coming back to Phoenix from the Grand Canyon.
