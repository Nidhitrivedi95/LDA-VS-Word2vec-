XjmHPe0H91BlJ3gwJb7OiA Whenever I have a family get together in the GTA, we usually end up coming here when we want Chinese food. Really good Cantonese-style food for reasonably low prices. For a party of 9 people, we were able to leave super full (with a bit of take-out leftovers!) for ~$160.

Their seafood and meat dishes are done well with decent portions. All the flavours and seasonings are spot on, only downside is most of their dishes are quite oily. My personal favourites are:
-Peking duck with the leftover duck meat in a savoury black bean sauce
-Bok Choy & king oyster mushroom dish
-fried fish with egg drop corn sauce
