L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA I love this place. Most likely my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas! As I come from California and the Chinese food is just completely different there than here in Vegas (well thats my opinion). I first tried Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast hotel and casino for Valentines day and my boy friend and I loved that place but then my co-worker told me about Cafe noodle as Ping Pang Pong is a lot pricier then cafe noodle and she said they have the same owners so their recipes  are the same (I'm not 100% sure how accurate that is but the food was still just as good here) so you get the same for a better price. I like that cafe noodle has a lunch special menu where you get a good portion for a very reasonable price. Everything on the lunch special menu is less than $8. My favorite dishes from here has to be the bbq pork soft noodle (what I consider chow mien) salt and pepper pork chop, beef and broccoli with chinese broccoli, and their chicken in orange sauce. yummmy!!
