It's the only chinese restaurant in the plaza so it can get busy on weekend evenings. We've ordered the fried oysters, fish, stone pot rice, veggies; all were delicious.

We mainly come here because at the end of the dinner, there's a variety of desserts to choose from. Red bean, black sesame, almond bowls. They used to be good, but I find lately the desserts have been watered down. It could depend on the timing you get to the dessert though.
