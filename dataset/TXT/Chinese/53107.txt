cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw I am very picky when it comes to Chinese food.  Growing up in San Francisco most of my life,  I was spoiled with great prices and great food. I moved to southern California and I could not find a good Chinese restaurant for an entire year of living there. I mean not even good,  now I live in Arizona and Yaos is the most amazing Chinese I've had since my childhood.   Great portions, service with a smile,  cleanest restaurant for Chinese food I've been to in years and the food was just excellent. Big portions and great tastes and friendly staff you can't go wrong. I already made a date with the wife to come back jn two days and I'm still eating as I write this.
