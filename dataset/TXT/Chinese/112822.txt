Mkpg9S2j0ZrZc3q-VjfLsA This was a very busy place on Saturday night. However the menu is huge. I really enjoyed the mushroom and gluten dish, a plentiful helping of unusual mushrooms. Excellent if you're really into diverse mushrooms, beyond caprini / buttons.

I really enjoyed the shrimp wonton soup -- TONS of shrimp in there, shrimp like you've never seen seen in a wonton, in fact :)

The server also gave us the wrong dish, the salt and pepper squid instead of the turnip, which we were really keen on trying. The squid should have been crispier frankly, but was definitely above average.

Next time, the congee!
