CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA I ordered a small Japanese pan Noodle.. and the portion is very small! I mean very, maybe just 2 or 3 bite size. And the taste is just ...terrible. I ordered the Japanese Noodle part is because they said it's a little spicy. It is not spicy at all. There's no taste except a little bitter. The only thing that has a little flavor is the mushroom..
Plus for the price, I don't think I will ever come back again.
Sorry.
