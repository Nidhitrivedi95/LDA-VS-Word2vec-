kP2wC0luve3mT5fcdrA3nQ We used to live close to China Village and would frequent it several times a month. Now, we try to make it in anytime we are on that side of town. I made a special trip today and it was worth it. 

If you're ever feeling under the weather, the soup here works miracles. Specifically : wor wonton soup, Hong Kong style. Just add half a bottle of sriracha and you'll be good to go. 

On top of the delicious menu, the service here is fantastic. I would go so far as to say I adore it. I haven't been here in several weeks, yet he not only remembered me, but the exact soup that I ordered. Fantastic. 

I haven't been in with a group; it's just the two of us that dine here. Our drinks, food, and check always arrive in a timely fashion.
