UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw Good food, very poor service.  As usual the food was delicious, but the service just killed the meal. Worse yet, the restaurant was empty and the waitress was aware that things were just not right offering nothing to rectify the situation.  Very uncomfortable meal. If you are looking for consistently good food and service try PF Chang's or just skip Asian Fusion and go elsewhere in the valley.  With so many other choices in Scottsdale, there is no reason for such poor service when you have good food.
