MpT8KheTjs7TSDWIoMUFxg For fast food greasy Chinese food....this is not bad, as long as your expectation is that.

Definitely stick with the Chinese options. They offer Thai and Sushi dishes. Not a fan of those.

I ordered:

Orange Chicken (really good- Lots of chicken!)

General Chicken (really good - lots of chicken!)

Sweet and Sour - (sauce came on the side - wasn't bad, just ok)

Mongolian beef - better than expected

Lo mein - wasn't a fan, pass

Chicken Fried Rice - Good

Chicken Pad Thai - (Huge portion, lots of meat, just lacking spice and real flavor. Again, stick with the Chinese options)

Yellow Curry Chicken - Not good 

Again, if you are looking for fast food, greasy, delivery option Chinese. Not bad, definitely not my favorite.
