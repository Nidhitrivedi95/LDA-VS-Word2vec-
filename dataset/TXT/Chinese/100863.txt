K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw I come here only for their curry laksa, that's it!

The wait can be very long.  6 seatings inside.  If you see one one, grab it.  Clean the table before eating.  

Another alternative:   Take out is also feasible.  Eat the laksa in your car, while it is piping hot.

Desserts are only on weekends.
