X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Sausage Fest, I gave them another chance at this, and again very very bad quality in a nightclub, LiL jon was playing that night so it was packed, but a Sausage Fest as in men all over the place hungry you couldn't even dance, the security was rude fighting people who were just trying to get to the bar and spend money with you.   These guys need to take some serious notes from Marquee, and Tao because even though they are both on the strip it ain't on the same level.
