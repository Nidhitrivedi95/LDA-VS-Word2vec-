QOmojzu24dTI2coPjOtu2Q The food is very good. I have no complaints with their food at all. The issue is their service. Horrible service. It literally took 2 hours to arrive. No apology. When asked why it took so long, they replied "were busy" in a rude tone. I would give this 1 star if the food wasn't really good
