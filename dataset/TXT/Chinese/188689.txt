yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Came here with a group of friends after a night of drinking and clubbing for them. Pretty spacious place and got seated right away. It seems that if you order pho it comes out super fast because our friend ordered it and it came out in no time. I ordered Bun Bo Hue because it's one of my favorite dish as I don't like pho too much. WOW it was SUPER DELICIOUS! I usually don't get the sauce on the side like that and it made the soup really flavorful. It was a good size portion too and it has to be one of the best ones I've eaten. Although it may not be the cheapest but it was worth the money. My bf ordered the Singapore noodles and he really liked it! You can definitely taste and smell the curry spices in the noodles. I would come back to this place again for the Bun Bo Hue!
