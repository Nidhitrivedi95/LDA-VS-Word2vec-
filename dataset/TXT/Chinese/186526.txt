YBIhTjmEH3IEZW4Dr5ReRA I love this place. Their crab rangoons are so good. They are stuffed with filling! The orange chicken is delicious as well as pretty much everything I have had there. You can't go wrong with anything you order. I have had the beef with broccoli, sesame chicken, Singapore noodles, chow Meir, egg rolls, and orange chicken and everything is always super fresh. The prices are reasonable and the staff are always very friendly. We usually do takeout but we have eaten there before and it's clean and enjoyable, unlike some hole in the wall Chinese places. Love this place!
