TYEQ38ONpmYMYv378IByhw Mister congee is your really typical chinese restaurant  but I felt the experience was subpar compared to the more and ever popular and standardized Congee Queen.

This place is really small, and it was absolutely packed. There wasn't any room to even walk around and even the waitresses struggled to shuffle around. We came here with two large groups and were able to try numerous dishes on the night.

We had two types of congee (pork liver and preserved egg and shredded pork) here and I felt both were much more salty than average. In addition the fish maw soup was really salty. Both the dishes were all served piping hot at least.  

The Peking duck was pretty decent here although I'm not sure if we ordered one or they gave us half because there wasn't much to it even though it was a two course duck. The stirfried duck with lettuce was pretty good here. I also really recommend their house special fried rice here with unagi, roe, and crab. The rice was light and fluffy and there's a good amount of toppings here. The salted steamed chicken was also pretty good here and wasn't as salty as I expected.

Other dishes were just average/hit and misses including their sizzling plate sirloin, tendons, greens, and Shanghai noodles. They're certainly not bad.
