CSe9FpalbwGzQcp_h5BVxg Went there about 40 minutes before closing and ordered to eat at the restaurant with the intention of just packing anything we had left over by closing, so we didn't hold them up. Not only did they not rush us, the woman at the counter kept assuring us to not to worry and take our time when we asked for to-go containers 10 minutes before closing. That alone earned a star! 

Everything looked like it was pictured. The restaurant was clean, quiet and cozy. Also, they had hand sanitizer at the counter.  They  deliver, but only to a 4 mile radius. 

We ordered 4 dishes, and it was all ready less than 15 minutes later. All were generous portion sizes for the price. I ordered the chicken lo mein. The noodles were thick, and the flavor was on point. Not too salty or greasy. I tried some of the teriyaki chicken and that was also tasty and swimming in sauce. 

My only regret was that I hadn't ordered any soup.
