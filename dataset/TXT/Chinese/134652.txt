q7aNYIUEkmisLTE3qBPRog I really need to stop eating at Panda Express and thinking it will get better the next time I visit one. It just seems to get worse and worse every time. I mean it's been at least two years since I last went to one hoping it would be better this time around, but  I was sorely disapointed. 

What can I say other then the fried rice was bland, the shrimp dish lacked shrimp but at least the cream cheese wontons were solid. After all was said and done, I really wish I had spent my money somwhere else. What happened to the days of their iconic orange chicken and other goodies? I remember how much I used to love going to these places. Oh well, I tried and they failed.
