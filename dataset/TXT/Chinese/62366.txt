DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA I went here many years ago. Since Joel and I were in the area we stopped in for a late lunch. 

I've read other people's reviews about Sam Woo. It comes down to if you don't mind slow service it's perfectly fine. Their food was excellent. 

Sam Woo only excepts cash so make sure you have some on you. We were seated quickly and green tea was brought out to us. Their menu is gigantic! Omg talk about all the things. It seriously made it hard to pick. I knew I wanted something that had their tasty duck. When you first walk into Sam Woo's you are greeted by ducks that are cooking behind glass. After looking over the menu several times Joel and I both decided on the Duck Wonton soup with noodles. 

It took a while for it to come out. But when it did that was one huge bowl of soup. It was literally filled to the brim. I was shocked the waiter didn't spill any out of either bowls on the way over to our table. On the top of the soup were sliced pieces of crispy duck. Mmmm duck skin. The broth was delicious and omg the wontons. There were probably 6 huge wontons and when I broke them open you could see actual shrimp in the meat mixture. They were so tasty. At the bottom of the bowl were noodles that I'm pretty sure we're made in house. What a tasty bowl of soup. All the ingredients worked so well together. 

Now the wait for the check and a to go container for my soup. It was about 15 minutes until we got our check. Once our waiter came an got our check and money he did bring our change back quickly. 

Not really sure why the service is so slow at Sam Woo. There weren't that many people there, but then again there was only one waiter. The food was so good it really didn't matter. If I'm in the Chinatown area I'll for sure stop in for that crispy duck!
