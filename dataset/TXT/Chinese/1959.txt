We sometimes do strait up rolls, or go with the lettuce wraps and wor wonton soup. If you want something heartier there are plenty of meat, rice and potato salad combos.

You also have the convenience of calling in and pick up. We don't live in the delivery area, so picking up meals after errand running is super convenient.

When my daughter went to high school, I would pick up food here and drop it off. The food is well packed, no leaks. It was a great Friday treat for her.
