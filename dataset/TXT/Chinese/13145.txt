2UaMR7lOJ3IcXizaDpv7KA First off, we LOVE a good curry, and Bangkok 9 delivers!  You can get a great lunch special that comes with a salad with peanut dressing or a salad.

First off, peanut salad dressing......this dressing would make George Washington Carver cry with sweet tears of joy.  I didn't think something that was akin to peanut butter mixed with some spices and what I was guessing was some vinaigrette would be so delicious on a salad.  Well punch me in the gut and tell me I was wrong....cause I'm wrong.

Second, the owners and operators are super friendly.  While we were eating we could hear them talking to customers, who were were assuming are regulars, as the owner/operators were asking where they were yesterday.

Lastly, the coconut ice cream does NOT disappoint.  I whole heartily believe that if mana where to fall from heave in the form of coconut ice cream this would be it.  It was creamy, cool, and oh so coco nutty..........sorry I blacked out remembering this delicious cool treat.  

I've been multiple times and it never  disappoints.
