GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g Cream shrimp dish was a bit oily but still decent. The overall food isn't bad but I definitely would not called it authentic. Maybe a bit of American-wash. Honestly, food here reminds me of PF Chang but pricer, and was it worth the price? Probably not. Coming from a Chinese who eats Chinese food just about all every day.
