0XlbdDkYzC14SZF_bUGeXA Unfortunately my favourite Chinese spot was actually closed so we decided to order from Chef Chan for a change. Unfortunately, it was not good at all. The food was very soggy and almost unbearable. This totally could've been due to delivery maybe it was sitting in the car for too long.. Not sure but I wouldn't order again. Out of the three items we ordered the chicken fried rice was the best.
