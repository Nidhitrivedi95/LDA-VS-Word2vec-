vMpJzMFst_9GP4boeqWIRg The best Chinese food I have ever had in my life. The honey garlic wings had actual honey and garlic shavings, not some fake honey garlic sauce. The general Tao chicken was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The rice noodles with satay sauce had the yumiest grill flavour. Excellent service and good price. Would definitely go back there again.
