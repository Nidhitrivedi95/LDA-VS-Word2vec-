YwTtrKCE_9OaMe9xASCOkA Run away - go anywhere else in the food court - DON'T EAT HERE -  If I could write the review with no stars it would still be too much acknowledgement. 

Ordered a dumpling and a shrimp & pork Har Gow - both undercooked and terrible - actually horrible  and  it's a food court so I felt it was okay that I spit everything into my napkin also had eggplant & noodles. It all tasted as if it was cooked in chemicals - HORRIBLE !!! 

I knew I should have ordered soup at the THAI place - thank goodness your in a food court with lots of options

Will not be going back to Szechuan Express ever - HORRIBLE did I say that already ?? oh well it was worth saying it again so you will listen.
