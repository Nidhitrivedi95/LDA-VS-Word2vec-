kF1Rr2bMPujucUihlitT2g Good sushi but they need to pack to go orders better as the toppings are always stuck to the cover. Also the quoted pickup time is never accurate (show up 15 minutes later than they tell you).  I'll be back though since it's the best in the area with many of the specialty rolls being very good.
