Q_Iia5C2quTUVfE5_8jObw The food was undercooked and terrible.  When we told them that the pork was raw, they ignored us and wouldn't take it back.  They charged for the dish and had the nerve to chase us after we left to demand a tip.  Stay away from this restaurant or be prepared to get food poisoning.
