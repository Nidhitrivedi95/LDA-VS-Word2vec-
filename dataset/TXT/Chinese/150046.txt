SRYM6FaIF6LuXldcC1PY8w Been here a few times. Pretty much the same each time. Wait staff are nice (except one guy who is so shmoozy and a loud talker), food is consistent and generally good. We came here on a whim after a bad experience with the hostess at benihana, and we got in after 15 mins. The food came out kinda slow, but the dessert with the bananas and ice cream was worth the wait.
