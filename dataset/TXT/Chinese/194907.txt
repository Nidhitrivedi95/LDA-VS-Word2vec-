zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Finally made my way here after several trips to T.O.  Gotta agree that all the fuss about this place sets expectations so high, that when you finally try it, you leave slightly underwhelmed. However, it's still a good spot for overpriced ramen and $175 caviar fried chicken.

Location
Heart of downtown core, at the lobby of Shangri-La hotel.  Spacious interior design, sky high ceilings, modern accoutrements. There are 3 levels: first is for the noodle bar and appetizers, 2nd is for the milk/dessert bar, and 3rd is a more formal experience. 

Service
Friendly albeit slightly aloof servers. Prompt kitchen service. 

Food
We only went to the noodle bar and milk bar and had:

++ smoked chicken ramen (love the crunchy chicken)
++ momofuku ramen (a bit of a kick, but quite tasty)
++ pork buns (2 open baos, with a big pork slice -- yum)
+ chicken meatball buns (love the tangy ssam sauce)
+ okonomiyaki (not bad, but also not stellar)
++ assorted cookies from the milk bar (my fave: cornflake choco chip marshmallow)

Ramen items ranged from $13-$16.  Appetizers from $6-$11. And if you're feeling spendy, the $175 caviar and fried chicken. 

Overall, it's good but not great.  I'll still head back to grab cookies at the milk bar (6 for $12), or even try the 3rd floor restaurant to get the full experience.
