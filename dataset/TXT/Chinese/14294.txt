3cAy1gxlprn1ue0q3L_ziw Came in quickly for a late night bite at 9:30. Despite the fact they close at 10 and I though the staff would be irritable, they welcomed me with open arms and immediately sat me. I had never tried a majority of things on the menu (I'm used to the Americanized version of Chinese food), but the waitress was very nice and happily explained what everything was and recommended her favourites.

I tried the Soup Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Salt and Pepper Chicken, and Hot and Sour Soup. Everything came out very fast and nice and hot! The soup came first, and I was surprised at its portion size (it's rather large for a starter), but tasted very good! I wish it came without the chicken, but the broth was so nice and the veggies were cooked well. 

Next came the soup dumplings. I have never had them before, and they were happy to show me the proper way to eat them! The pork inside was delicious, and the broth and dough were at a great ratio. From what I've seen online though, they had much less broth than other dumplings. 

Lastly, the salt and pepper chicken was a great add on. Though it did off-balance the rest off the meal, their crispiness, juiciness and saltiness would be perfect to go with drinks or to indulge in between friends late at night. 

After my meal, they did not rush me (despite closing time) and were very nice. I had such a great, welcoming experience and plan to go back soon!
