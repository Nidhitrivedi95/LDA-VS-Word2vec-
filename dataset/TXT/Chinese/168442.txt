vraKC3CB9KSDCxYX0q3gWA I have been eating at Pei Wei for years and have always loved the food, but my last experience deserved a review because of the service. I called in an order for two honey seared chicken dishes that I was going to pick up about an hour before they closed. We picked up the order, but when we got home we realized that while one order was correct, the other was teriyaki shrimp. At this point, they were closing in about 25 minutes. I called the restaurant where the manager offered to put in a new order for us to pick up despite the fact that they would be closing by the time I got there. The manager let us in, gave us a new dish, would have let us keep the incorrect one if we had wanted to, and even paid me back the money for the one that was incorrectly prepared because we had to drive all the way back. Mistakes happen, my judgment comes from how they are handled. In this case I left a completely satisfied customer.
