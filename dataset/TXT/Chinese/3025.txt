Good spot if you're craving Chinese food kinda late, need a quick fix and don't mind shelling out like 14 bucks for fried rice or noodles.  Seems more like quantity over quality here...but eh does the job.

*Yung chow and seafood/bbq pork fried rices were delicious and came in huge portions.  If I ever ate here again I"d just order the fried rice.

*The Szechwan Beef noodle soup that everyone raves about was blah.  Where people drunk when they had this?  I was sober and the broth was blah.  Noodles were kinda soggy. At least the beef was good.

*Mixed seafood pan toasted noodles.  So I was envisioning the yummy pan fried cantonese noodles from PF Chang's when I ordered this.   I was disappointed when the noodles were the thin vermicelli ones.  It def. was toasted on the outside which is fine, but the sauce was pretty flavorless.  Booooring....

* Wonton soup was tasty.

* Mike C. had the roast pork and roast duck with rice combination.  He didn't like the roast duck and thought the roast pork was decent.  I thought his rice with the sauce it came with was delicious though.
