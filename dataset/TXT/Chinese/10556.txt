1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Talk about cheap with a Capital C. In a town where you have to pay a premium for anything you get, this place is certainly the exception. What's even better than cheap food? Tasty cheap food. With most items on the menu at $5.95 and under, you can't beat it. I'm not sure if it's Mr. Big Wong taking our order, but he certainly looked like the owner. Some of my favorite items we've tried were the chicken curry with roti, fried wontons, salt and pepper chicken wings, and hainan chicken. The chicken curry more Malaysian style rather than Chinese style.

Overall if you are looking for an affordable and tasty place in Vegas to grab a quick bite in between your gambling sessions, this place is it. The only problem you might run into is the parking. While the lot is decent sized, there are so many other restaurants packed in this strip mall that parking could get difficult during peak meal times. I will definitely be back to this Vegas gem.
