9q0qW2sbI147hAaUVfVUqQ Dinner Experience at Richlane was a disappointing 2 Star.

I would suggest just stick with dim sum especially their Early Bird and Later Afternoon Specials which I been for a few times and always been excellent.

For the Good:

- Lobster at $11.80/lb cooked whatever way requested. Lobster can be as small as 2.5 lb and that is perfect for 2 people to share (I can eat the whole thing myself)
- I received a voucher during dim sum for a free Double Boiled Shark Fin Soup with Vegetable and Chicken ($16.80). I am not into shark fin but dinner mate thought it was the best item we ate during our meal
- The dessert pastry which is complimentary were really good

For the Bad:

- I now officially ate the worse Sweet and Sour Pork in my life. So bad I feel like just ordering this dish and make the Head Chef and Head Waiter just to eat and finish this dish so they can experience the same thing. The batter was heavy and hard, the pork was just basically chunks of fat! I ate a few pieces and ended up splitting them out!
<U+91D1><U+76DE><U+7D2B><U+863F><U+5495><U+5695><U+8089> Sweet and Sour Pork w/Pineapple Served in Crispy Noodle Bowl ($13.80) did have this good presentation but avoid at all cost! Don't eat it even it is free!!
- I did tell the wait staff about my SS Pork but they kind of just brushed me off and would just let the kitchen knows.
- Food was mostly salty and loaded with MSG. I was thirsty the whole night
- One of the waiter kept swearing in Chinese behind the partition and the customers can clearly hear every words he said and Richlane supposed to be a higher end restaurant at least according to the price they are charging? 

Richlane does have a lot of potential. I sincerely wish that it has thing sorted out and the food would worth the price they are charging! For now it is a pass for dinner...
