FscCtUIsAL8cBL-S-A4FEQ We have been looking for a good Chinese place out here in Mesa for a long time. It looks like we found it. 

We have ordered twice from here and both times the food was on time and was very good. We have tried their orange chicken which is as good or better than anywhere else I have had it, their chow mein which was better than I have had it anywhere else, their Tofu which was again delicious and finally their Kung Pao chicken. 

You get alot of food for a good price and it comes hot! Try these guys out and hopefully you will be happy you did!
