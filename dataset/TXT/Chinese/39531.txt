AVLj5MSJD1si-Rl6X6qTXQ I've eaten a lot of dim sum and was hopeful as the reviews seemed generally good.  I wouldn't classify myself as a picky eater as I only expect to be full and not get sick after eating. : )

We got there and the waiters seemed stressed out as they were having trouble handling the traffic.  The tables were mostly full, but nobody was waiting to be seated, so not too busy.

We seated ourselves at a very wet table and waved down a waiter for the order sheet.  
I had to grab napkins from other tables and it took our table and several other tables numerous times to flag down staff for condiments once the food arrived. 

On top of that, the three waiters were yelling back and forth the whole time we ate. They seemed to be confused about the order entry system as they actively ignored customers while all three huddled around the entry terminal. 

The dim sum?  Very bland, but what can you expect for 2.50 a dish. Pretty good bargain but you can get better quality for similar prices just around the corner. It may not have helped that a waiter spilled a bottle of Windex on the floor, so the entire upper floor smelled of window cleaner. However, sub par dim sum and a poor environment means we won't be back.
