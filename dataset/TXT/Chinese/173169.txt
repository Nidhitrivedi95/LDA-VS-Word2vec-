The service was fast (6:30pm) and friendly. I had the chicken fried rice, curry chicken, and an egg roll (half size plate). I ate the food, but like I said, I was basically starving and could have made a meal of cardboard. The curry chicken was good (I got a leg and a thigh) and the egg roll was okay. The chicken fried rice was not good at all. It had a light yellow tint and a few pieces of hard chicken in it. No onions, carrots or any other vegetables you normally find in fried rice....it was more like "chicken flavored rice". Anyway, I spent $6.95 and got full, but didn't like myself for it. I won't go back and won't recommend it to anyone.
