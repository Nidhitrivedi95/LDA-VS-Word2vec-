Anyway, the food took a little while to come out, but it was fantastic. Everything was just as good as you hope southern classics should be. Fried chicken was well seasoned, nicely crisp skin, juicy. Mac and cheese was RFG (really fantastically good). Collard greens were perfect. Yams were awesome. I would have preferred regular cornbread to the fried corn egg roll thing, but my kids all ate it just fine.

Drawbacks would be that I wouldn't want to eat in that place-do takeout, and the bar does seem a little depressing to me.
