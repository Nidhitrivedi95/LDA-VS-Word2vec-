pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og Always a great option to fulfill our sushi cravings... Service is always on point and the crowd is usually manageable with no long wait times for a table or the arrival of food. I would love to see some new specialty rolls since they seem to keep the sushi menu the same all the time. We've been here a number of times, ordered take out a number of times and we are always really satisfied.
