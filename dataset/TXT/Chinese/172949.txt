W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ Soupy ramens and pho are generally my go-to meals when I'm feeling sick, or in Vegas, hungover.  So I was ecstatic to find a restaurant centrally located on the Strip that could fuel my crave.

I got the Maitake Ramen, which is made of a mushroom broth, spicy miso, tofu, and egg.  Just a few of my favorite things.

Disappointment at its finest.

Strike 1: FLAVOR - That "mushroom" broth was watery, flavorless, and lacked the richness and depth of a standard bowl of ramen.  With only a hint of miso flavor and no spicy taste, I'm not even sure what the flavor was supposed to be.  The tofu, usually my favorite part of a meal, was lackluster and only added to the blandness of the dish.

Strike 2: QUALITY - The dish upset my stomach for hours after.  Especially strange because it didn't contain any meats or overly-rich substances...

Strike 3: PRICE - Well, while I expect Vegas resort pricing, a meal like this is definitely not worth $17.

3 Strikes?  I'm out.
