zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Definitely have had better ramen in Toronto, and the selection in this city isn't all that great to begin with.

I was very excited to try Momofuku, and was down there the day after it opened to grab a bowl of noodles. I found the broth to be quite bland, and the pickled vegetables tasted less pickled and more like they'd just been dipped in vinegar. The noodles themselves were quite good, but not the best I've ever had and no where near enough to make up for the below average flavour of the soup.

The pork buns were actually quite good and the service was very attentive. I'll go back to try this place again once the fuss dies down, but having seen the lines outside the last few times I've driven past, that will be a while. Hopefully I fare better next time!
