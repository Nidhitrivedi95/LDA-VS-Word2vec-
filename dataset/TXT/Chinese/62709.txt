dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw For my first review of 2009 I really wanted to find a 5 star place but I guess this one will have to do! It's hard finding 5 star places anyway so a 4 star review is just as good I'll say.

For some odd reason, everywhere else besides Orange County seems to be able to get Yunnan/Sichuanese food right. San Diego has awesome Sichuan cuisine and now we've found something in Vegas as well.

We decided to try this place out after reading the reviews and I'll have to say, yelp didn't lead us astray!

We started off with the appetizer buffet station where we got the ma la sliced beef and the tendon. I saw this table with a plate full of chilis so I asked the waitress what it was. She told me it was the 'spicy chicken'-- la zi ji. We got that cuz I wanted something super spicy. Then we got a dish for the young man, dried tofu with Chinese chives. I also like 'mi xien' a Yunnan speciality. Sichuan province and Yunnan province border each other so the food is similar --spicy as hell, mostly, featuring the Sichuan peppercorn.

The la zi ji kicked my ass! I mean I can eat spicy foods -- ie habanero -- but man this spicy chicken was super spicy. Maybe because the entire dish was filled with dried chilis -- about 70% chilis to 30% chicken. I was glad I ordered the other stuff which contained no chilis to balance out our palate.

When your mouth is in flames, take a few bites of the mi xien and drink a few sips of the broth. It really calms your mouth down.

All in all, a really nice meal. The gals there were sweet and came around many times to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I would definitely come back here again!!
