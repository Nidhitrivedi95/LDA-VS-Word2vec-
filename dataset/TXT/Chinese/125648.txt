Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w I decided to try Tin Tin because if you want authentic Chinese go where those of Asian descent go.  I went on a Saturday afternoon taking a break from Christmas shopping. Just like most Chinese buffets I have been to there were the standard Americanized dishes.  But there were also some more authentic dishes (please don't take my word for this as I am a middle aged fat white man who probably doesn't know what authentic Chinese dishes are).  Tin Tin had sushi, not a fan, so I didn't try it, so I can't rate it.  A grill, with chicken satay and other grilled offerings. A noodle soup station which unfortunately I didn't try.  About 25% of the dishes were seafood including shrimp, mussels, and fish.  The also had traditional American fare such as chicken nuggets and french fries.  I can't speak to the authenticity of the dishes, but those I tried were hot and very good, which for a buffet is an important thing to me.  The service was very good, clearing the empty dishes and keeping my glass full.  The price was a little higher than most buffets, but Tin Tin has a lot more to offer than most other Chinese buffets.  If you like Americanized Chinese dishes, then Tin Tin might not be for you.  If you are adventurous and like to try new things, then definitely give Tin Tin a try.
