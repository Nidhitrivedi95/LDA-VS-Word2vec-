td-NOo-k4xhfVmO5X92uAg What an interesting place this is, the decor is straight out of the 70's, the table covers are straight off my grandmothers couch and the food is good....Actually very good from the sample we had tonight.

The only letdown was the order in which the food came out to us...

Sweet and sour chicken, not bad at all.
Chicken chow mein...Didn't order that one, but we got it anyways...Didn't try it, but it looked good.

Sliced Pork & Mushrooms with Noodles, well this place is known for it's noodles and yeah, this dish was the star, the broth really added a good taste to the dish.

Chicken fried rice...A slightly different than normal version, but I liked it so all is good.

All in all a good meal, throw in a couple of drinks and the bill was $23....Yeah $23 whole dollars for a meal that could feed 4 people.
