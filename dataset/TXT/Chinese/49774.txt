CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Finally I found a noodle house in Las Vegas!!!  Sadly, it was a pretty disappointing experience.  The staff were lovely, I really loved the ambiance of the restaurant and the simple decor but, the food was so disappointing. 

I ordered pad thai and it was so dry, no sauce to it at all.  It was just so bland, it really didn't taste like anything at all.  I so badly wanted to love this place, what's not to love about a noodle house??  

Unfortunately, I won't be back here again, nor will I recommend it to anyone else.  If I was rating it solely on the food, it would have got one star.  I only gave it two because of the nice, friendly staff and the actual restaurant.

I'm sorry!!!  I wanted to love your restaurant :(
