Decor, please read my previoua review, food, hum..... Fried fish taste bitter. Steak is over cook. Sushi and sushami, soso, not the best, not the worst. The key to sushi is freshness and this place didnt not live up to its look. Don't attempt the cake, green tea cakes doesn't have green tea taste, cheese cake is not made of cream cheese, and the chocolate cake is made of cake mix from no frills.

There are some good news however, the Japanese steak and the noodle are both made on the spot. Not a lot of buffet does that. Specially the noodle, hand cut on the spot and serve directly. 

In conclusion, don't expect an epic buffet because they charge an epic price. Stay away from the fried fish, as the guy grilling the steak to serve earlier if you like rare and the noodle is a must have. 

Once again Dragon Legend, you are STILL not a legend.
