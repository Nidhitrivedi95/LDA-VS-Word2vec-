jYF7PNnYcn3fWejv0ZE1-w I took my mother for dinner at Pacific Moon the other day.  We were instantly greeted with smiles and the hostess showed us to our table right away.  The menu is great and reasonably priced.  I read through reviews before going and from what was said about the prices I expected it to be more expensive.  The food was amazingly fresh, the service was good and the decor was pleasant.  I will be back.
