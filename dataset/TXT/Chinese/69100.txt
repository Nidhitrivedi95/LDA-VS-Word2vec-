EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ Great service from the new owner and staff. He was very attentive and helpful with us. 

Food was delicious. Owner suggested shrimp  pad Thai. It was amazing. We also had seafood soup with steam rice. 

The place was clean and prices are also great. The portions of each dish are enough for 2 people.
