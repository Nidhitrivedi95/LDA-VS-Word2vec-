oRgoOhwCex1X9j1iQ9ou3w I was here for a private party. This place is super fancy. I always say it's better to be overdressed than underdressed and being overdressed would be a challenge in a place this beautiful. I did not know what I was in for as I'd never been to a celebration like this before. There were 10 people per table and a large lazy susan in the middle.

The server set up small plates around the perimeter of the lazy susan. He came back with a large plate of food and divided the whole dish up between all of the plates. He did this for 10 courses. I thought I may die I was so full. Service was excellent.

The food was absolutely incredible. Pork, chicken, duck, scallops, sea bass, lobster all cooked to perfection. The desserts were not my favourite, but I'm more of a sugary sweet dessert gal. There was red bean pudding, black sesame/coconut jello and almond cookies. Not that I had room for any of them!
