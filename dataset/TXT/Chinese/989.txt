-Gxe5gKrskrgbWyLkz7UGQ The premise of an unlimited buffet is always tempting but there's always the fear that your delving into trays of re-heated slop and left over gruel.

There should be no such concerns when dining at Jimmy Chung's as the buffet food on offer is a satisfactory. Note the fairly bland choice of wording there as the food could never be described as spectacular.

As far as Chinese buffets, this one is A-OK.
