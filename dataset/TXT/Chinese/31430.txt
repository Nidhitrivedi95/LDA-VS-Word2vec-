9qGnuoT91dg8WtVGVMbWAQ Since moving from the east coast to Peoria a couple of years ago, it seemed impossible to find a decent Chinese restaurant...but then we found Good China. Now, it's not THE best Chinese food I've ever eaten, but certainly the best I've had since moving here. Restaurant is dimly lit, casual, has reasonable prices, great lunch menu, is clean and nicely updated. The staff has been great every time I have eaten there. I have ordered take out on a Saturday evening and it was ready in 15 minutes. Portions for take out are just as large as when you dine in. My favorite dishes are chicken lettuce wraps (served warm), spring rolls (crispy and not oily), pork steamed dumplings and mu shu pork, which tastes very authentic and served with thin pancakes. Very yummy! We always share an order of pork fried rice, which is probably one of the best I've eaten, and Mongolian beef, which is nice and saucy and best eaten with white rice. I do find that the food here can tend to be salty, and you will need to make sure you've got something wet to chug a lug, but make sure it's not their tap water! It tastes like chlorine, every time. I don't drink soda, so I order iced tea, and I never taste any trace of tap water. It's our go to Chinese restaurant.
