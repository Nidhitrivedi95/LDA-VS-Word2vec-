3aUBEB206LBNLUY6rCW2sw I had never had acupuncture but I've been dealing with chronic headaches/migraines and back pain for over a year.  After going to the doctor several times and nothing really working other than to temporarily mask the pain (sometimes) I decided to try acupuncture with Ashlee because of the great reviews.  

Ashlee made me feel comfortable from the first minute.  She explains everything, makes sure your questions are answered and most importantly she truly cares and it shows.  I've had two sessions so far, 1 included cupping for my back and I have already noticed a difference.  My headaches are getting better in terms of severity and frequency which is life changing since it was almost a daily issue.  I don't think I could've found a better person to go to for treatment and find myself looking forward to my next appointment.
