ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw I was surprised at the low rating of this Pei Wei. How can a Pei Wei be a fail?  Don't get me wrong, I'm always trying to find a more authentic Chinese food place that is good but that has proven very difficult as most places I try are either bland or use poor quality meat. With Pei Wei, you know you're getting quality and flavor every time. It's pretty delicious and consistent which is nice when you're not in the mood to gamble on how good your lunch is going to be.  To me, this Pei Wei was just as good as the rest.

I do wish it was a dollar or two cheaper... Even just offering a cheaper soda combo deal during lunch hour would make me pretty happy.
