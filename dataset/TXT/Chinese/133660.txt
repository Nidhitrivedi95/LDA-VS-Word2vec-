pyZkGdnTwpRh5tFWfdmQEg I have been searching for great asian noodles near my office for weeks and I think I've finally found my go to! I ordered the Firecracker Noodles which are thick udon noodles in a spicy chili sauce. There was plenty of sauce which is fantastic and the carrots are cut in thin, round slices. It was spicy and delicious and so so gooooooood!
