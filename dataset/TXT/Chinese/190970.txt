Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g It's a shame. This place was very good, a 4 star quality a year ago and it just keeps going downhill. They have a beautiful menu with some quality dishes that WAS good but, quality just deteriorated drastically.  I used to come here a lot but when it got worse I stopped coming here. After about 4 months of absence, I decided to give it another chance. My experience today was a 1 star quality. They hired inexperienced waiter who is old and very slow in his work. He would ignore me when I wanted to ask for more water. He is just overwhelmed with about only three tables to serve. When the dishes come out, he would ask me to make room for him. I might as well go to the kitchen and get my own dishes. 
Now, about the food, prices went up and quality and quantity went down. I always get the pan fried buns when I am here. I know the size of the buns are half the size of what it was a year ago.  Also I ordered fried chicken that is $15.99 for part of a pigeon sized chicken. It is refried and not fresh. No meat on the bird for that price. That really upsets me. How can a decent restaurant serve such quality of food?  
I would say that I will not return unless I hear that they have improved from other yelpers.
