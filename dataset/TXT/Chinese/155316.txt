tK-PQOhZo94fonbQVXaOSg The service isn't great but the food is good. The more you go, the more you will get to know them and they get to know you. :) It's better for take-out. Order over the phone instead of using the online ordering option... Good egg rolls, awesome chicken on a stick, honey chicken and general chicken. You can choose your spice level. Brown rice is available. Their chicken fried rice isn't very good... :/ All in all it's good hole in the wall New York style Chinese food.
