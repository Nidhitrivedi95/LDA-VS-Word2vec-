Rh2smrKvcamnP8VBUgMI0Q I work for a long term care home nearby and we bring the residents here for dimsum every once in a while. Compared to all of the places that I go to uptown in Markham, I must say that this place has a few of the best dimsum dishes!  

My favourite dish is the pan-fried vegetable and shrimp pancake :) So much shrimp filling and so delicious! 

Overall, this place has a good variety of menu items and the food carts come quite frequently.
