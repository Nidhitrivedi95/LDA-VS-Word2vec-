YaGkCO51sV6MLavJ3XUmWw This was my first visit to China Fun. The food wasn't great, but it was edible.  Even worse  for me was the lack of service we got from the time we walked in to the time we left. 
The girl behind the counter was engrossed on her phone.  She never said Hello or Welcome or even smiled. I gave her the first order which she took then she went back on her phone.  I said the second order and she told me to repeat it because she wasn't listening to me as she was on her phone  texting. She barely made eye contact. This should have been my cue to leave but I didn't. When the food was ready, she told us and we got it and left.  Not a Good bye, Thank you, Come again, or anything of the sort.  
I won't be going back!
