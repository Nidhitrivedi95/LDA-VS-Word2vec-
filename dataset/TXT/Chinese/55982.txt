CY3N_T_35gqOXkwQbSeSTA Hong Fat BBQ has apparently been around for decades, and the prices are still kept low.
When you come for lunch, you can still get a meal for $5 which comes with soup.

However, portion sizes have been steadily going down over the past couple years. I went last week and ordered the BBQ chicken and duck, but it was mostly fat and bones. I was pretty much eating white rice and some cabbage.

Looking at pictures I took from a year and two years back, there was definitely more meat for the same dishes back then. I mean, there was still bones, but it wasn't like 90% bone + fat.

Although it's cheap, given other chinese restaurants in the area that also sell BBQ with price ranges that aren't that far off, I can't say it's a place to grab lunch. Maybe the regular boxes of BBQ are still good.
