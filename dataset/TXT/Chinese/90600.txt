IHt79wxZHkD7QSzlDRDivw The BBQ pork is crispy and moist, however meat is leaning towards the bland side. I think BBQ pork in general needs to be well seasoned for it to be really tasty (my preference). The flavours/spice is different from other chinese BBQ places and it's nice and fragrant. The  person assisting me with my order was very friendly and customer oriented. He added some pork trotters on top of my order, on the house.
