GRfq3L3500tXfEFwBK5RRQ Service is always good here, they are friendly and attentive. 
Sometimes the food is decent and fresh and sometimes it is downright nasty and old tasting.
THE REASON WHY THIS IS:
You need to understand something about this place..
They often have asian bus tours stop there for lunch / Dinner and if you are lucky to go there on one of those days the food will be good and fresh for the price you pay..

If there is no bus tour.. you are taking your chances.. and will most likely not get what you are expecting.. 

Weekends seems to be okay, I suppose because the food turns over faster ... 

Maybe it is best to call ahead to see if is a Bus tour day.
