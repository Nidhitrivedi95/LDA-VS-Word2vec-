GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Sometimes I don't know how to rate these restaurants.  On one hand, they use exceptional ingredients and prepare the food in well.  On the other hand, they can never seem to get the flavors right and are often way overpriced.  

Came here to eat cause we didn't want to venture too far from the room, and we were a bit hungover.  It was pretty late in the afternoon so there was no line and we got seated right away.  

Got the swallow the cloud soup, cause we really wanted some soup.  The noodles were well made and prepared, but the broth was just average.  Got the monks chili on the side ($2.88) and that helped a lot, but come on now, $3 for a side of chili???  It's usually free and left in jars at the table in most asian restaurants. The whole plate wasn't "destroy the noodles and slurp every last drop of soup" satisfying. There are some places on the strip that make much better noodles.

Also got the Sui Mai Luck 6 platter.  Decent Sui Mai, but again, you need the chii to boost it up in flavor.

Over all, it was a decent experience.  We sat at the bar and the bartender seemed very knowledgable about the food they offered.  Although I cry about the $3 Monk's Chili, it was really good, and the most impressive thing I ordered.

Probably wouldn't come back, but worth a try once.
