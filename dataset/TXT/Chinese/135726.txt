QdganL5AW9E_fNoRVroLig Graduated from UofI in 2005 and i still get cravings for this place...that may strike you as odd, but I know plenty of other alums who have the same problem. 

I recently got to go back to CU and of course had to make a stop, I think the prices may haev gone up a little bit, though i can't really remember. (Beef Pad Thai for about $8-9). Regardless, it was just as good as i remember.
