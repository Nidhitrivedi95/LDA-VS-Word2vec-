zfiSQ1dl3vTJ-og96eqXGA I have finally found a good Chinese restaurant nearby.  I've ordered from here twice, and both times, we have been pleasantly surprised.  No super greasy, overcooked food that tastes like oil and salt.  The dishes have a ton of flavor and perfectly cooked. 

The first time, my partner and I shared broccoli beef and cashew chicken with an order of pot-stickers.  Even after being in the take-out box, the broccoli was crisp and green.  We both thought the dumplings were hand-made and he loved them. The leftovers lasted us two more meals. 

Last night, my friend and I ordered takeout. We shared the kung pao chicken, an order of crab angels, and egg drop soup.  Great prices, and again, still leftovers! My only complaint is that there wasn't more filling in the crab angels. 
 
Great food for a good value.
