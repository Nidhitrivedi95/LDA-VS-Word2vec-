Q9veWOu7mFj881o3nqB4bQ All you can eat, $19.99, for a maximum of two hours.  Yeah, the value's there and an adequate selection of items of meat and veggies.  What's nice, each person gets their own soup pot powered by an induction station they can control via the knobs right under the table.  A central sauce station allows for mixing your very own custom dipping sauce.  I prefer the old fashioned soy sauce, little vinegar and hot chili oil mix.

Not only do they serve hot pot, they have noodle soups, appetizers and tabletop BBQ options.  Appetizers are average, haven't yet ordered any noodle soups and the tabletop BBQ didn't quite match up to Nak Won Garden.  On the second visit, I noticed the next table over eating barbequed chicken wings and asked about those.  The server explained that it's not on the menu and is special order only for his family member.  He whipped up a small order for us and it was quite a tasty dish.

Service stands out here.  Every server possessed a warm, cheerful smile and dropped by often to ensure satisfaction.  

Recommendation: try their Hot Pot, table BBQ not so much.
