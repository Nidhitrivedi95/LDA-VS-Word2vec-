WbQOuI7mVST8XrJotWq9fA Best BBQ pork in North America? 
Bold statement. Not necessarily true. 

That said, if it's late and you're hungry, and you've got about $5 in your pocket this is certainly the place. BBQ pork on rice with a handful of snow peas is filling and flavourful, especially when splashed with a packet of hot sauce. 

I'm sure it'll be a treat after a night out and too much dough spent on drinks.
