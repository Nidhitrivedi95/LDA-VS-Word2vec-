0dr1FgqQSEMbaTu9SDqiIg I've only eaten here once. I came in at lunch and ordered the Cashew Chicken. It came with fried rice and noodles. The prices was very good. The food was filling, and portion size was excellent, but the food was just ok to me.
Now, I know that they're are a lot of good reviews for this place, but just like every other cuisine you may try, individuals get a taste for how certain things are best tasting to themselves. My fried rice was rather bland from what I've come to expect from fried rice. The Cashew Chicken would've been really bomb, but they put a lot of ginger in the dish, and I just don't care for the overpowering taste of that root. The star of the meal was the noodles. Perfectly cooked and garlicky, they had the perfect balance, and I finished those before I was halfway done with the Chicken or the rice. 
It was nice and clean inside, the wait was short, and the people working there were very friendly. 
I would try another dish for lunch there sometime when I am back on that side of town working, and if so, my review may change a little. 
They are worth a shot, so give them a try!
