SEURrw7032BR15PKZ_aleA It is perfectly understandable that for the price of the dim sum here, I may not get a top notch salted egg custard bun. I do, however, expect to find egg in some way, shape or form. 

That is not the case here at Fancy Chinese Cuisine. Salted egg custard is substituted by some sort of sweet orange syrup. The orange syrup even has orange dots in it sometimes! I'm unsure as to whether these dots are just intentionally there to make it fancier (harhar) or if the food colouring was just poorly mixed in. The deep fried glutinous rice balls also have this filling, so beware. 

Knock-off custard aside, the rest of the dim sum is alright. The rice noodle rolls, fried bean curd and shrimp rolls, beef omasum and clay pot rice are among the better choices. For less than $3.50 a dish (unless it's a "special" one) during peak hours and $2.38 during early bird hours, it does the job.
