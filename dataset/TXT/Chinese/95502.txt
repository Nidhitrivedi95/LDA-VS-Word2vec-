jIc8lKpK0S265D18cgQKEw Pearl of the Orient serves up some pretty good Chinese food. I am not going to say there is anything wrong with it, but nothing is completely mind-blowing or something I would crave. For the appitizer I had a tofu soup, which had a very nice broth. Unfortunately the vegetables were bland, and the tofu which should be the star was simply cut into triangles and thrown into the broth. Really they should rename this soup in a way where you would expect the broth to be the main feature, because it is. 
 I was more impressed with my entree, Mu Shu Shrimp. The shrimp was cooked wonderfully and had a good flavor. However the tiger lily, wood ears, and eggs all formed a one-note hash that the shrimp were hidden in. Luckily the hoisin sauce was delicious and upped the level of the dish. Overall it was a nice Chinese dish, at a very low cost. I was very pleased with the exceptional service. Everyone there greated us with a smile, and were quick to get us whatever we asked for. Another very positive part of Pearl of the Orient, is the house sauces. We tried the sweet and sour sauce, which had deeper, more flavorful sauce then the typical sauce served at Chinese restaurants. I don't understand why so many people are attacking Pearl of the Orient, no it is not authentic Chinese food, but they never claimed to be. If you are craving Chinese food, then go to Pearl of the Orient. You won't be blown away, but you will have some pretty good Chinese food.
