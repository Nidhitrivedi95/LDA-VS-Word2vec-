The menu is large so there's something for everyone and the food is ready in 10 minutes, you can't beat that. Cons? Customer service has never been so great and I don't always get the right change so I just figure it in as part of the tip. We'd probably order more often if they offered delivery but it hasn't stopped us from getting it whenever we're looking for Chinese! When you're craving a quick bite, order for pickup and it'll be ready when you get there.
