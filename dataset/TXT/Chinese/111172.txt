m3tNor-GTl-aAST5AmEqYA Hubby, son (11 yrs old), and I went here today. We have been to a similar establishment about a mile from it a few times, but wanted to give Lin's a try. So very sorry we did. 

These were our issues, not neccesarily in order: The sushi looked as though it was leftover from previous days, rice hard, vegetable pieces inside were brown. Service workers had dirty hands/fingernails. When hubby was at the grill where you get together what you would like them to grill up for you, the worker drenched the utensil (that patrons are to use to pick up raw fish) with raw fish and its water. Food was not great, not even good.

We managed to find a few items that tasted ok, but it was definitely not worth the $43 we paid. And my stomach is upset as I write this, I feel nauseated.
