BH0K6SxPnY3wTRB7tA27hQ Having been to and loving the Mark Pi's in Columbus, IN, we decided to try this one in Avon Lake, OH. So glad we did! The restaurant is gorgeous, the staff was very attentive, and the food was delicious. We had such a lovely experience! We ordered the BBQ ribs, egg rolls, Kung Pao Scallops, and Duck Breast with almonds. Everything was delicious, and fresh. Also ordered their plumtini, which was tasty and refreshing.  Loved the Kung Pao sauce, it was spicy, had a nice heat, so if you don't like spicy, ask them for not so spicy. They have a sushi chef, unfortunately we were so full from our meal that we weren't able to order the Friday night Sushi special. Hopefully, another time!!!
