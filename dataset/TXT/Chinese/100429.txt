Jzz-ZLXsd2ClSn6UyFcbpw I have been wanting to come here forever and got a chance today due to the Dine Around event. My friend and I ordered everything on the event menu: fried pork wontons with egg drop soup, egg rolls stuffed with cabbage and BBQ pork, and orange chicken. The meals came with tea, too. 

Due to the event, we were seated in a side room. It was very drab and badly need of updating. The cement floors were cracked and the bathrooms were scary. The waitress was nice but neglected to ask us what we wanted to drink. When she brought the food, we had to ask for water. Also despite knowing we were sharing, she didn't bring us any extra plates. Annoying. One thing I forgot to add was when we first got there, we stood waiting in the lobby trying to figure out how to be seated. There was a sign with an arrow to the dining room on the right for the event, but it didn't specify to seat yourself. After seeing several employees at the register not ackowledge us, I finally asked what we should do. Then she told us to seat ourselves. 

The food was good. I especially liked the egg rolls and orange chicken. The orange chicken was actually delicious. Although I liked the food. it wouldn't be enough to bring me back. The atmosphere and service, from beginning to end, left much to be desired. Food simply isn't enough to bring me back to a place if service is bad.
