i've had good sushi, bad sushi, salty sushi, old sushi. of all the sushis, this one was the best. i wasn't sure what to expect from sushi in the middle of the desert.. and boy, was i surprised! we ordered everything under the sun, from miso to rainbow rolls to tempura to unagi. the service was great (although everyone's orders came inconsistently) and they gave my friend the best birthday dessert & celebration!!

without a doubt, one of vegas' hottest restaurants.
