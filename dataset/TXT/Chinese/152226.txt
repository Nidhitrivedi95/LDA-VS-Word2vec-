You choose from either the abbreviated American menu, or go through the full "Translated Menu" and write your own guest check and give it to the cashier, pay, then take a number to your table to receive your food.  

I actually love this idea as I, a waiter, have always felt conflicted as how to tip in most Chinese restaurants where you terrible service, but a server does come to your table and bring you your stuff so you feel compelled to leave something. . . . Golden Harbor even has signs saying tips aren't required and instead charge a $.50 per person clean up fee.  I also like how they give a five percent discount if you pay cash and the cashier was completely fluent in English and was far friendlier than any other Cashier/waitress I've experienced at a Chinese restaurant in town.

The food was on par with what I've had at Lao Sze Schuan in Chicago's Chinatown, and far superior to any Chinese place I've found in town where every dish was basically - meat, veg, rice, generic greasy sauce,/no flavor." This is definitely a place for someone who appreciates good Chinese food, but isn't necessarily concerned with the ambiance or service.
