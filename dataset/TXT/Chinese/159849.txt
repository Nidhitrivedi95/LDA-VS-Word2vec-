Absolutely, but you've also got to expect that from the STRIP.  Also,  you can tell the experience of the chefs because the food is more delicate than your typical hole in the wall chinese that they're being compared to.  

That being said,  we arrived on 930pm when they close at 1030pm.  Important to get there earlier as they stop taking people around this time.  We made it just in time.  I saw the hostess turn people away at 10pm.  Anyway,  we had the shanghai soup dumplings,  sautéed pea tips, dan dan mian, chicken broth with hand pulled noodles, chinese pancake with beef, jellyfish salad, hot sour soup and pot stickers.  

Warning, the dan dan noodles are super spicy and salty, so just know this before you order.  None of the food was bad.  It was tasty, but not the best chinese I've ever had. But will satisfy the chinese craving.  The sauteed veggies were well done and not overcooked.  

Hand pulled noodles were chewy and delish.  The soup dumplings were very good, so we had to add another order.  All in all,  if I wanted noodles or chinese and didn't want to leave the hotel,  I would eat here.  The service was fine.  Typically I have fairly low standards for service at asian establishments.  You know you're doing for food,  not the service.  Have that expectation in mind and you won't leave angry at any asian establishment.  Just a tip.
