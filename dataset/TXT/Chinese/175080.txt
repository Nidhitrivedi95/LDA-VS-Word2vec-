wfWcE4K7vQX1Fjao9Q-12Q If I had not tried the drunken noodles dish, this place would've gotten 4 stars from me. I've always got the same thing whenever I come to Thai Basil and loved my signature dish. My better half, on the other hand, gets something different every time (pho, the Thai basil dish, a bento box, chow mein, etc.). He's never completely happy with his meals here, so that's another reason for the three star rating. Out of everything he's ordered, he likes the Thai Basil Chicken dish best! 

THAI BASIL TOFU ($8.59): Love this dish. This is my regular order. You can't go wrong since it's the namesake of the restaurant, right? I like the veggies in the dish and the texture of the tofu. The spiciness level is perfect and the portion is plentiful. I love how the rice comes in a pyramid shape. 4/5 

DRUNKEN NOODLES ($8.99): I ordered this dish on my most recent visit. Very bland and I didn't like the way to tofu was cooked. I won't order this again. 2/5

SERVICE: The staff is quiet but attentive. 3/5

VIBE: I like the feng shui going on in here. The restaurant is cloaked in shades of greens with bamboo accents. 

Worth a Return Visit?
Yes, but only for their lunch specials where I can get a spring roll with my Thai Basil Tofu dish for $7. 95! Go elsewhere for drunken noodles.
