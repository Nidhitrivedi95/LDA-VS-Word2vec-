GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g Best Chinese food I've ever had!! Never have I seen such an expensive Chinese restaurant (that wasn't dim sum) so I figured it had to be good.

The crispy shiitake mushrooms were killer! I couldn't stop eating them. Sweet and flavorful.

The Cambodian Bbq duck was great as well. The skin was so crisp it was essentially a chip. The sauce was perfect. The rice was fluffy. The meat was juicy.

Great spot here.
