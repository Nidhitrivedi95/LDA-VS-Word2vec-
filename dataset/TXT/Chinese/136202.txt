Qe8vFq-3HMld-ymBQLDnpg Seriously, the staff at the restaurant provide some of the best customer service and appreciation I have witnessed at an establishment in a long time. But of course, that's just the icing on the cake. I've tasted the crispy OK beef, the Mongolian beef and the sweet and sour chicken (off menu) as well as the mango spring rolls (addictive!) and everything was delicious (most of it was recommended by host too which is a bonus). The prices are reasonable and you get a large portion of food at great quality which is not always easy to find (so I can appreciate this place even more!!). The decor is traditional and beautifully ornate to match the server's and host's traditional garb. Bathroom - A+. This would be a lovely restaurant to host a larger group for a celebration as there are private dinner areas to reserve and some sort of classy lounge downstairs. Very impressed and would recommend!
