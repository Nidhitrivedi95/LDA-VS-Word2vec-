wC-wLFVCIjXArsrMuUJdYQ This place has the best general tso in Charlotte.
My boyfriend is a huge fan of the shrimp rice noodles (I have to admit it's pretty great)
Don't generally see many people eating in the restaurant but they are always busy with take out orders. I have done both take out and eat in and the food has always been great. The staff is also nice and polite.
