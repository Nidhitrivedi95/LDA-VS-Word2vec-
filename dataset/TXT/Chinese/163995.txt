ut9tXoj7CAsw-zG70eq0IQ I purchased a Groupon for a massage at this location.  I have never been here before.
 Somehow I marked the wrong time down on my calender for my appointment, so I showed up an hour early, of course it was the day of the heavy downpours and flooding in Las Vegas, so I was in no mood to go back out there and try and kill an hour somewhere. The staff was so nice and accommodating, they let me fill out my paper work and then took me in the back and let me relax in one of their massage chairs while I waited. I would go back to their office for the massage chair alone! The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. The time flew by.
My massage therapist was Michelle, and she was excellent. She listened to where I had the most problems and went to work on them. I was told about their massage club, where you pay $60 for the year and it makes all the massages you book for that year just $40 a piece. No waiting for Groupons!
