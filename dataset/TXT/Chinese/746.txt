-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ We ate here on 4/11/17 for dinner (while on Spring break). We wanted to find some place quick to grab a bite that was not buffet or steaks. Server was friendly and prompt. Noodle soups are not authentic but decent for casino restaurant dining. We ordered the Crispy egg rolls (pretty good but they only give you 3!); Five spice beef soup (similar to Vietnamese pho in terms of the broth but it had fat, thick noodles), Shoyu ramen, and Tonkatsu ramen. My daughter didn't like the broth in her shoyu ramen but she liked the chicken they put in it. The portions were not huge but just right. Probably not enough to share a bowl of noodles between 2 people but if you ordered an appetizer, maybe it will be enough? Prices were overpriced (not a surprise!) for a noodle restaurant! Probably wouldn't go back when we stay again at Red Rock.
