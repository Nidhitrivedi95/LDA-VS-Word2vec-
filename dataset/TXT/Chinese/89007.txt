i3jZgPgXPtXbZIjv7obagQ I'm surprised at the poor reviews here... I think Szechuan Express is above average for the type of place that it is. It's definitely on the pricer side, but I find their food delicious - it always seems to be (again, for the type of place that it is...) fresh and served hot, with great variety available. Most importantly, it'll keep you full. I may pay $12 for chicken, veg, noodles and a coke, but I know I'll be full for the rest of the day - or taking half of it home for dinner.

I've always found the staff at this location friendly and helpful.

I generally go after the main lunch rush though - maybe that helps explain my positive experiences.
