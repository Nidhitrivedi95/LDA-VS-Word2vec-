I've always loved this restaurant, and have eaten there frequently with my friends for many years. I couldn't believe it when my friend was told that they would not give her some extra veggies in lieu of rice after she told them she could not eat the rice for medical reasons.  Then, they went ahead and put the rice on her plate after she asked them to leave it off.

We'll be looking for a restaurant that's more accommodating to such a simple and necessary request the next time we want to get Chinese food.
