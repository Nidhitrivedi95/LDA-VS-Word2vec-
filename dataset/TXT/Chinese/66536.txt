EHKzu5r2NEz5Zq2R84J4ow Meh totally spoiled by all the places in the city that this disappointed me. The food wasn't bad, it was the portions vs the prices that really sucked. The decor was boring and probably never ever updated. Weird tiny booths. 

I ordered tofu with broccoli and it was served on basically a side dish. Maybe had 6 or 7 pieces of tofu? That cost me $11. Then I ordered a avacado roll. 6 absolutely tiny rolls came back. They were good but the seaweed paper was kinda dry! That was another $5. 

 I rarely eat everything when I go out but I finished with more room in my stomach after 15 min. They also have lettuce in their veggie sushi roll.. super weird. Lettuce!!?? I will only go back maybe for convenience.
