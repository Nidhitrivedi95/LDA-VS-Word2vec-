9BBWtaSvsootDkKTVBgv_A What a smorgasbord!  The place has it all - Chinese buffet, sushi, made to order hibachi, even roast beef! 

The best part about this establishment is the made to odder hibachi. They have several veggie and meat options to build your own stir fry, four sauces, and they cook it in front of you. The shrimp on mine were cooked perfectly and the chef added the right amount of chili flakes to give the dish a nice spice level. 

The sushi bar had a surprising amount of choice and complexity. They went above the standard tuna, salmon and California rolls to include rainbow rolls, several fried rolls, and my favorite which was spicy tuna topped with tuna. 

The Chinese buffet was pretty good as well. I loved the seafood alfredo dish they had as well as the chicken and broccoli. The food was a little greasy but that is par for the course at this type of buffet. The soups were okay with the hot and sour being much better than the wonton. 
They have an American section that has nuggets and pizza which I didn't sample. I did try the roast beef which was good but not great. 

I also liked that you pay before you eat, and all the prices are clearly listed. Everything was upfront and had a reasonably priced $12 dinner buffet price. I will definitely return to try out more of their selection.
