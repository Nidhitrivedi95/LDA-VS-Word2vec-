trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ Great food with the most amazing server Stella, who enhanced our dinning experience!!! Our full table of food consisted of 3 pounds of mussels cooked 3 different ways,  rib eye steak, full sea bream, mushroom soup, grilled sardines, the cured fish platter and plenty of fries!!! Would definitely recommend this place for dinner and plan to be back soon for 100 oysters for $100 on Thursday!
