NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ this is a cute cafe where you can hang out with friends while sipping on tea. it's much larger than it seems from the outside but when i went on a friday night around 9:30 pm, every seat was taken and there was a line to get a table. it was also fairly difficult to find a parking spot in the lot.

their bubble tea is expensive; i'm pretty sure my regular black tea with pearls cost $6.99 and it was nothing special (on the weak side). however, i think if you order a drink, you can get something off the snack/food menu for $3? my friend ordered tea and got crispy (popcorn) chicken for $3. my friend's hot taro tea was better than my iced bubble tea and it comes in a pretty tea pot with a cup in a little tray. 

they also have a selection of teas that you can buy to take home in a little section near the entrance.
