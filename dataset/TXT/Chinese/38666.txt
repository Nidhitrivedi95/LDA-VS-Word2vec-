AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I gave three stars for service. I don't know if I just made bad choices but I got the orange chicken and the salt and pepper pork and they were both awful. The salt and pepper pork was truly inedible. The place is cute and it was busy and everyone else seemed to be enjoying their food so I plan on trying again...but definitely staying away from the aforementioned items!
