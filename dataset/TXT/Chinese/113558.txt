MpT8KheTjs7TSDWIoMUFxg Just moved to the area a month ago and wanted Chinese and figured I'd try here. The delivery time was amazing ! I ordered at 7:36 and the gentleman was here at 7:50! The food was delicious as well. Loved the potstickers and the house fried rice and the fact they use huge shrimps in the fried rice! Definitely ordering my Chinese from here for now on
