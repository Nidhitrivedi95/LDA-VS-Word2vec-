y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw I grew up eating dim sum and this is the best I've ever had because it's not greasy and the quality is top notch. Be advised that the atmosphere is not the typical dim sum experience. Maybe it was because I was there at 2pm on Thursday, but I ordered with pencil and paper (like when you order sushi). The familiar chaos of metal carts being shoved through crowded aisles of diners was missing, as well as the loud shrieks from the servers advertising what's on their carts. 

The dining room was very quiet and upscale, which was nearly off-putting for dim sum, but the quality of the food made up for it!
