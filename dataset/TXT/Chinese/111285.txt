M990h0-4g-wpJN-qlnqFAg Found a hair fried into our fried pork chop. When I told the waitress about it she laughed it off. Then asked how long the hair was, because depending on the length or it it could be pork hair.... Either way it shouldnt  have hair in it period. They discounted it 10% and after we fought some we got the dish taken off our bill. Awful service and even worse at handling their sh*t.
