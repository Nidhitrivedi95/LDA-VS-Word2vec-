pofDmHoIsdvPcSKzb2iMag I've been searching for dim sum that reminds me of my childhood in Vancouver. This place is not it. 

Pros: cart service; authentic looking place

Cons: The food. Thick cheung fun (rice rolls with shrimp). Grey-looking stewed meat (including chicken feet! How could you get chicken feet wrong?). Hard fried squid. Pasty sui mai. 

Avoid, avoid, avoid.
