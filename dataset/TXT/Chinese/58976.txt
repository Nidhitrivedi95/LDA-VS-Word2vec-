Ordered delivery from them through Eat24, and found the prices very high for Chinese take away, while both the quality and portion sizes were lacking. The food was AOk, except for the Happy Platter which was inedibly oil-logged; the delivery was very quick, and the driver was polite. 

So, while I'll probably order elsewhere for future delivery, we might try a dine in lunch, it looks cute from the pics, and they offer specials. The upcharges made our order more than $103 - with tax & tip - but still, that is quite a lot for a takeout joint of American Chinese. My photos are missing a pic of large Hot & Sour soup, which was good, the rest of the items are posted with prices and upcharges.
