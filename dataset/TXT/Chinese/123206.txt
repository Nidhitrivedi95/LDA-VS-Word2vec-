Oj4PqiXtPTd4kZdI5aG1uw We have been here 3 times for dinner take out. All 3 times the place was really quiet, with at most only one table occupied. The first time was good, staff was nice, food is reasonably priced, tasted ok... not great, but ok. So we went there 2 days later as we really wanted to try their crab claws, they also sell cheap(er) frozen dim sum you could then prepare it easily at home. The staff was not very friendly at all that time. There was no "hi/hello", no "thank you", didn't even acknowledge if she heard you or not when you place your order. I was ready not to go back, no matter how cheap their frozen dim sum was. But hubby wanted to give it another chance, since it was pretty close to home, so a month later we went there again for dinner take out. Same deal, that particular serving staff was all sour face. I asked if it would be cheaper to pay by cash (the first 2 times, we didn't have to pay tax with cash), she said "no, starting today it's the same price" 
me:"(yeah... really...) debit?" 
"ergh... cash is better". we paid cash anyway since they don't take credit card.
when the food was ready, it was exactly like the 2nd time we were there, it was an "excuse me", finger pointed to the food, then walked away. Did I mention that the place was empty? it wasn't like she was busy serving other customer as no other customer was there. The whole time she was just chatting away with the kitchen staff. Anyway, we'll never set a foot in this place again.
