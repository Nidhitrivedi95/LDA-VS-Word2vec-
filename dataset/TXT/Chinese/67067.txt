There was no sesame chicken on the menu but there was no problem for counter people to make it happen- the cooks whipped it up. The fried wontons were fresh and tasty, the Volcano Beef was amazingly good and the sesame chicken was spot on. The leftovers held up pretty good and made for a good lunch the next day
