0R87tcWUqkWXAD5z0vZcuQ Good food, fair service with a higher than usual HK style Cafe restaurant for the Markham area. I have visited this place a regularly in the past. They have things that they are well know for and I really enjoy them. Fried pork chop burger is delicious and their Guiling style noodles are really well made. Their service is not the best although I do find some servers to be friendlier than others. I think their menu is higher than your average HK style places but this is most likely due to the fact that you get wifi and their menu looks nicer. Overall, I would recommend it for the food quality and portion but don't expect great service.
