eS8OuIk6_fMNNslFnj8noA I thought it would be nice to get Asian food and bring it home to me and my girlfriend to have for a nice night. I got the shrimp with lobster sauce and my girlfriend got the chow mein soft noodle with veggies.  The food was average but it hit the spot.  After about an hour of eating I started to feel very bloated. Two hours after that would start a terrible night of diarrhea and throwing up. I have never been this sick from eating out and food poisoning.  I was getting the chills and horrible stomach pains along with repeated trips to the bathroom all night.  I felt so miserable I had to stay home from work so it not only made me sick, it took away a days pay for me.  You may not have the same experience as me but for this only being the second time eating here and to have this happen I will never be eating here again!
