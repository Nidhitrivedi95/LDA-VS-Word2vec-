yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Just terrible for vegas standards. Plenty of better places. You have to be really wasted if you think this place is good. Food was not very fresh especially seafood used in the salads and spring rolls. I had hue style beef stew Pho. I am still traumatized by it. One of the worsen I've had in my life and they had carrots chunks that were raw and you could not even bite into it
