TkrydveE1Laf_LHoKFALNw As a native hunanese, it is alway so hard to find a decent restaurant that can make the authentic hunan cuisine. This is restaurant is the only one in vegas that makes good hunan/spicy chinese food. Of course it can not be compared to the amazing hunan restaurant in NYC or LA, but it is reasonably priced and good enough. For those of you who complained about the lousy service and the atrocious environment, you are missing out on the good food. I don't know if half of you have even been to china but chinese food is not hunan chicken or general tso chicken in some suedo chinese restaurant like PF Changs. No idea where the bad reviews came from, the food was great. Order the la mei zi yao hua, the smoked bacon, the spicy beans. They even offer to delivery to hotels when they are not busy. I really wish atlanta has a restaurant like this.
