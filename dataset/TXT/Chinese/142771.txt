RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw DO NOT bother with this place if u plan to have dinner here as it is ALAWAYS crazy packed (unless u come at odd late hours). My fam & I always order take-out to avoid the chaos & getting majorly frustrated. 

All in all... we have had great service ordering take-out. They really listen to your instruction. ie: separate the sauce from noodles, less oil, etc. The price is quite good as well. Also I have been to the Richmond Hill location & the congee at RH is not as good as the one at the Leslie location. Must be smth in the water....:) I have a lot of fav dishes from this restaurant. Seafood with dry garlic fried rice, fried rice noodle roll with x.o sauce, plain congee (yes the plain is great!), etc. Everything's always yummy!

I went here for lunch last week & was annoyed cuz they made us wait for a table even though there were a few tables/booth avail! Not sure if they are saving it for more VIP high tip paying regulars or what. I have pics to prove this :) Regardless of its idiotic wait staff, I still heart the food
