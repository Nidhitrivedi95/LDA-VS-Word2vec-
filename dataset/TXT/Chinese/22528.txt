6N9NClBpOi-GoWckg137NQ This part-Chinese Jersey girl is here to tell you that Red Dragon is definitely an authentic NY-style Chinese restaurant, down to the brusque way in which they take your order over the phone. LOL.  We tried the Kung Pao Chicken and the Orange Chicken combo platter, which is my go-to when testing out a new Chinese restaurant.  Our food was flavorful and delicious, but my only complaint was that the Kung Pao Chicken was 90% Kung Pao and 10% chicken.  Otherwise it was really good.  This is my new go-to Chinese restaurant in the east valley.
