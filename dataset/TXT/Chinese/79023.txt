GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog For the Foodies and Adventurous Eaters!This is one of my favorite places to eat! Adventurous Gourmet tacos. I go there to have fun. My husband and I get each of the most interesting tacos and split them so we can have ALL the ones we want to try. Their drink menu is also creative and worth sampling as well as the desserts. A place for true foodies! If you are picky you will never understand why this place is so awesome...it's not Baja Fresh Mex or Taco Bell. Still fast service though, eat in and takeout...for those vacationing and partying all night long at Cosmopolitan, get some to bring to your room to eat away your hangover the next day. It was my medicine one very special day...my wedding day. Yeah, we did it Vegas style;-) Date night? Bring the buffet to your table at this place...we just keep the small plates coming while we indulge in the delicious variety.
