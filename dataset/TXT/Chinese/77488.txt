Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA After going to another Thai Restaurant and paying $12 for Pineapple Fried Rice, I was shocked with how cheap the prices were here. Around $7 for a big box of my favorite fried rice, and it tastes amazing? What more could you possibly ask for?

While I'm still a little weary to try other menu items, I did order the Mango Sticky Rice after reading a few good things about it here on yelp -- and it's actually really, really good. I was a little afraid how rice and fruit would mesh together, but it's tasty without being too sweet.

Clean looking restaurant, great tasting food, and I love how inexpensive it is.
