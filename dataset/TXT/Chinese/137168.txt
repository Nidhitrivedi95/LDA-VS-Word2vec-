qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA Went to Heart Sushi yesterday and here are my thoughts. Entered and sat down, and told our host we were from out of town and first timers. He told us it was AYCE and the price. We said we came in for just a couple rolls and could we see the menu to decide, (did I mention first timers...?)
You would have thought I did a dump on the table. He turned and left and came back with the menu. After checking it out we decided to go AYCE and then he said the table was needed at 7 pm, it was almost 6 pm and we'd have to leave then. OMG! 
I told him he was making me anxious and I felt rushed as I'd never been there and had no idea how quickly food would arrive once I had ordered. He finally slowed his roll and put on his customer service hat and assured me that he would not kick me out before I had enjoyed my meal fully. Breathe out! Using an IPAD menu for ordering, I could say that there was a variety of items, though not a variety of raw fish items on the sushi menu. I get why, we were doing ACYE. But good customer service would offer a more varied a la carte option if that was what we were feeling instead of bullying us into choosing ACYE. I'm from LA, I'm used to paying for good sushi and have overpayed for some average sushi too. We still managed to have a good time, it was close to where we were staying and all items ordered came quickly, at the right temperature and tasted competently prepared.
