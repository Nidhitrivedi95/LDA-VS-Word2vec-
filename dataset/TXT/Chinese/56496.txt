czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA This is honestly the best Chinese food I have had from a take out place since living in Las Vegas. Compared to what I grew up with in the Northeast, the Chinese food here just doesn't compare. This place, though, was awesome. I haven't gone in, but I honestly don't think the lack of decorations or the styrofoam plates would have bothered me. The delivery for 8 people was extremely quick, the food was SO good, and the prices are less than the other Chinese restaurants in the area. The three kids couldn't get enough (and one of them didn't like Chinese food all the much before this meal). Everything we ordered was really good. We can't wait to order again!!
