N2M0WyGCyTV5jMOYPH7odA Delicious specialty rolls and great lunch special with all you can eat sushi. Tuna is excellent. The wait staff (we've seen four different people) are all wonderful and I will go back for the great service. A little on the pricey side and I was not a fan of the ginger dressing on the house salad. But we will definitely be back.
