I8TOosBLYKxZMAYNNyGEyg I usually order from this restaurant through an app on my phone called Grub Hub. This restaurant recently was sold and has new owners/management. Since that time, I have noticed an improvement on the quality of the food/dishes and the customer service is vastly improved. We like the Mongolian Beef, Broccoli and Beef, Orange Chicken, Szechuan Beef, honey wings, and the Pu Pu Platter. 
Everything we have ordered has been delicious, hot,  and fresh. Oftentimes our family has leftovers for the next day. The food is just as good the second time around. 
We will definitely be returning customers to this restaurant.
