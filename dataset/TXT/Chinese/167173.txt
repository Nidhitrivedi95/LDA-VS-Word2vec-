vgc-XO64Uw7otc3sxmns1A Just had my second visit. The first was outstanding and tonight was less than stellar. The food tasted fine. The problem was the hibachi chef. There were two working the dining room tonight. One was great and put on the show expected at a hibachi restaurant- the second could have cared less and that is who we got. We were there to celebrate and instead of a hibachi show- I heard about all the personal problems of the chef from the end of his relationship to the loss of his car. I came here to forget about my problems and have a fun time, and we left disappointed.
