Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w Was absolutely terrible food. I really want to love Siam Cafe as a few friends rave about it but the best meal here (4 so far) was mediocre at best. 
I know it was St Pattys day and late (10-11pm) but the quality of the food was pretty much inedible. The flavoring in the pepper short ribs was pure strong pepper and paste but the "meat" was only rubbery, chewy fat/frizzle around a bone. The texture was beyond weird. The duck (red curry) coo chee's sauce was watered down to essentially no taste (running low late night and trying to make it last? Shame on you) and the duck tasted strong & slightly rancid (like over the expiration date poultry becomes). 
I actually had to stop at BK bc I was still hungry, lol
