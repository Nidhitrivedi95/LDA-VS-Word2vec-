s3AG8m6Pzq-vON729pf0gw came here a year ago and it was decent. today I came back and the customer service and food quality has dramatically declined, we were the only ones in the restaurant and our waiter was very distracted and barely paid attention to us, there were flies and the floor had not been swept in quite awhile. the sushi was cheap but taste cheap as well, warm and did not seem too fresh. Probably won't come again.
