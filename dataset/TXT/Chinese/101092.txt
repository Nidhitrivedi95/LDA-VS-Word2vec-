My family and I go here almost everytime we find ourselves circling Markham undecidedly. He wants Chinese, she wants Japanese... then in unison, we all yell "Let's go to Keung Kee!" and then we all give each other high fives.

I'm not sure what the proper classification of regional Chinese food this would be - I'm suspecting northern Canton? Anyway, wherever this blessed food comes from, it is unlike any other Chinese food I've ever had. Bursting with flavours of savoury spices, fresh ingredients, light fluffy rice, and the best part - you won't leave feeling bogged down with grease.

Favourite thing to order - a giant bubbling metal pot for sharing (among 2 people minimum, up to 4 or so) filled to the brim with corn on the cob, pork bones with tender meat clinging on, carrots, and a spicy green vegetable in a incredibly flavourful peppery broth. Delicious and (I'm going to tell myself), nutritious! Order some fried rice on the side and, wow, this meal will trump most things found on Spadina.
