J_NA-_WNLAJQg7eZwn1dWw Amazing chicken.  It's a dish. Get it.  It's amazing.  My ultimate favorite dish, and I seriously am still thinking about it 24 hours later. I'm not sure, maybe there's crack in the dish, but the chicken is perfectly cooked, crispy, and perfectly sweet.  The steamed white rice is a good accompaniment for the sweetness of the dish.  It truly is just chicken--no veggies.  The General Tso's chicken is similar but different in a way I can't quite describe.  It's unfortunate that we live near 51 and there's not one near us.  Service is quick, friendly, and food is hot upon pick up.  I could eat here daily, if it weren't so far away.
