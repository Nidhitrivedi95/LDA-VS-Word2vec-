We got the nourishing bone soup and the hot chili soup as our base for $8.99, and $26.99 for each person in all you can eat hot pot. On week days, it's $24.99. Their selections was wide ranged and they have almost everything you can think of to put in your hot pot. Plus you have other sauces and condiments in the front of the restaurant to add in to your liking to match your taste. The only draw back I had was a very long line ahead of us but they have an iPad to check in at the front and they will call you when they have your table ready.
