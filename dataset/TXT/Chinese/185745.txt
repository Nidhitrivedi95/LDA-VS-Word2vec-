Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw I will be going again.  Try the Moo Shoo pork, it is pretty bomb abd the portions are big!  Just what a fat guy likes!  We took it to go because the last time we were in, it was freakin' hot in there!  I am a big dog, so I don;t want to eat and sweat, it's kind of gross for others!  But seriously good eats for a good price....you here here now!
