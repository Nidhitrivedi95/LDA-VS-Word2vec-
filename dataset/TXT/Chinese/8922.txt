1nM-ES-xVqL0yQGTCwtd-Q I actually really liked this place the food was not bad at all it was not the best either but it was worth it. I got enough food for two people for 11$ and change. So it was a great deal. But the reason I go back is because of the friendly staff. They didn't just leave me to sit in a corner while I waited for my food to go. They actually sat me gave me a glass of water and had a conversation with me. Granted this might have been different if the place was packed. 

But it is a good place for not a lot of money. And decent portions too. And the service was awesome. I will be going back.
