u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ Found KJ kitchen with  fellow Yelp member's review. It was our first time there and overall the food was simply outstanding! We ordered Pork Belly, Oxtail with red wine and pork chop Cantonese style. All the dishes were delicious including the complimentary soup and dessert! The restaurant was very crowded when we walked in around 7.30pm and we waited for a while for the food to arrive. Still, our overall enjoyment of the food was very positive! Will return but probably either earlier before the dinner crowd or after! Great food that did not disappoint!
