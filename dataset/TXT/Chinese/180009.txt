X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg This club had a great DJ for a Sunday the music mix had a little of everything that seemed to please everyone in the club including myself . We contacted a promoter out here so all four of us (2girls & 2guys ) got in for free !! They also had Promo for ladies to get two free greygoose drinks before midnight !! Thank goodness for that because the prices are true to Vegas lol , one sprite & a vodka cranberry cost $25 , 1 figi water was $10 and it was the mini bottle !! So if you have money to drop its a good club to visit after you see KA which I seen most do ! The restroom attendants where friendly and the bouncers didn't seem pushy but the bar tenders in my eyes felt they thought to highly of themselves ! I feel there is to many bouncers it's not like there was Celebrity there and they are all contracted so they are wasting that extra money for no reason and a lot of them didn't seem like they knew what to do , but than again they have like 8 entry's to the club so I doubt that helps .
