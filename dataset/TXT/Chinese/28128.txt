8keN8Z2sylAEXgMCJMQpDg Typical Americanized Chinese fare. Nothing to write home about. I give it a 3 stars because it's decent food for good value. Plus they have Pad Thai which my mom enjoyed. I had higher hopes for this place because of all the raves on Ocotillo Friends and it's close to my house, unfortunately my palette for Chinese food just isn't Americanized.
