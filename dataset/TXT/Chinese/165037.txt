UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw 3/27/2012: It only gets 3 stars because I'm feeling nostalgic for when their food was better quality. Egg drop soup had tofu and too much pepper. Macadamia nut encrusted halibut wasn't impressive either. First few bites smelled fishy so I'm not sure it was fresh. Veggie rice was mostly rice with a piece of a sugar snap pea. A friend of a friend owns this restaurant, and I don't know if I'll be back anytime soon.
