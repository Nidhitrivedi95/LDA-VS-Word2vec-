Qn5QMHOV6f5uHbxvrTPGRA This is one of my new favorite food trucks! The menu is very simple but the food is great. I did the lunch combo where you get noodles and a small portion of dumplings for $12.99- a little steep for lunch but it was SO much food so it was worth it in my opinion. 

The dumplings are light, flavorful and have a great texture to them. I did the pork and chive and they were the best dumplings I've had in a long time.

The noodle dish was good, but way overshadowed by the dumplings (they were a tough act to follow). I had the Zha Jiang Noodles which were the less spicy option with ground sausage. The noodles had a nice, mild flavor and were very filling. The only changes I'd make to this dish would be more meat options like chicken and pork belly and more vegetables to balance it out. 

Overall I really liked this food truck and will definitely return. The dumplings are the star of the show by far and id honestly recommend just getting a big serving of the dumplings for lunch! Next time I want to try the rice bowls and the bao buns.
