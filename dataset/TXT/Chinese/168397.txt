WORST SERVICE EVER

It took over an hour for my food to come just for my order to be WRONG.  The staff is horrible, they do not know what is going on. I specially told them 3 times my order just to have it gotten wrong.  I am pretty sure there is only one chef for the place which it took forever for my food to come.  I do not recommend anyone to try this "new" place.  There are many places with better food and service in this area.  

If there was a no star I would pick that.
