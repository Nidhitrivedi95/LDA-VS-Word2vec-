pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA How this place gets rated a 1 or 2 star is beyond me. The flavours in the food, the atmosphere is amazing! The location is funky also. The staff are fantastic and help guide you through the menu. Is it pricy? Yes. Is it worth paying a little more for quality? Like you need to ask. 
Would I recommend coming here? Hell yeah I would! We have never had a bad meal or experience here.
We have tried, Las Vegas, New York and London sushi samba's. And we still keep coming back when we're in town!
