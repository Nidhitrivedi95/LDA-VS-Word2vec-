IQnUxhO7oieEP7-5ZVJ4uA i live in SW since 6 years and never ever saw that place before!
they have a daily happy hours between 3pm and 6pm 
like usual i ordered more than i can eat but i wanted to try dishes i always order at Archi's Thai bistro.
the restaurant itself is spacious and well decorated.
large selection of dishes.
i ordered the thai chicken wings (excellent), spring rolls (only cabbage and silver noodle in it) great as well.
we ordered pad see ew with beef, thai salad with beef, chicken basil. i wasn't impressed by it. was ok...
I tried, like the happy hours menu :)
but i ati prefer Archi's bistro.
