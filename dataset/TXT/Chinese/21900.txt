6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q The interior presentation and overall experience in general were impressive, but for the steep price we paid, the food and service left much to be desired. 

In terms of food, the dishes were good but lacking any flavor to really set them apart from typical Westernized Chinese cuisine. The Mapo Tofu dish in particular could have used more heat and flavor, a flavor that I expected since the dish originates in my mom's hometown but didn't get. I did like the soft, tender texture of the beef dishes we ordered though, and the Malaysian Chicken Satay was excellent. The dim sum dishes we ordered were not anything extraordinary to me; I've definitely had better soup dumplings elsewhere.

Service was very average and a little bit on the slow side. While the overall experience definitely wasn't negative, it was overpriced, and I don't think I'd return considering its value.
