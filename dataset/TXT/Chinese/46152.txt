BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA If you are hunting for a cheap hole-in-the-wall authentic Asian eatery, this place isn't one of them (well it's cheap, that's about it).

The first thing we noticed is that we were the only Asian people in the joint.  It's just weird feeling being in a dumpling house that has no Asian people!  

We ordered one of the pancake items, pan fried pork and bok choi dumplings, and steamed pork dumplings with chives.

Our food took a damned long time.
Long enough that the table next to us got up to abruptly pay not waiting for their last course.

The dumplings were a disappointment. 
Maybe our expectations were too high... or we're just picky about dumplings!

1) Flavorless.  Bland...just bland.
2) Doughy and thick.  Bleh.  
3) Ugly.  Not assembled with care, edges weren't crimped nicely. 

We were disappointed and most likely will never return.
...and I hate those stupid red paper lamps.
