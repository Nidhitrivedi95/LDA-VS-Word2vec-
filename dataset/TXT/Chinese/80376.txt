gRrOITLavJ3kuxg0U5qisw I had high hopes for this place after reading some reviews on here. I'm beginning to wonder if I went to the same Red Dragon or somehow got trapped in a wormhole time continuum and ate at a alternate universe Red Dragon.  This review will be simple and short. Pretty much like the experience. 

I ordered sesame chicken. I have no clue if they ran out of the traditional sesame sauce and substituted it with my Grandmas sweet tea or Vermont pancake syrup. I literally ate two bites and couldn't handle anymore because of the bottle of soy sauce I had to pour on it to even choke those down. The fried rice and the egg roll both had the dyed almost fake looking pork type product in it that I distain. I even asked if it had it in it and was told NO!!!!!  

As far as the service. What service?  Only thing I got was a rude order taker with 15 employees playing some game on their phones. I'm assuming it was sesame chicken crush. Yeah that was a lame joke just like this restaurant.
