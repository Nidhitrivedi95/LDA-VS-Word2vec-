L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA Authentic Chinese food.  The place was full for lunch and we looked like the only tourists.  Great values for lunch starting at $4.95.  The soups are huge and yummy!  We ate here by accident first time here and sought it out on second trip.  Held out 1 star as the service was lacking.  Had to wait for some dishes and had to ask for things multiple times.  Everyone's very nice, just slow when busy.
