eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g Came here for dimsum on weekday, got a table for four right away. There weren't too many options for dimsum as the options for steamed dimsum were quite limited..but they had a fried noodle/rice section and chefs special. We had their Kidney Bean fried noodle which tasted pretty good. However-The steamed dimsum didn't live up to the interior decoration..it was rather mediocre. I cant say for the quality of dinner as I haven't tried it yet. But i did see other tables ordering lobsters and other seafood for lunch. Service was pretty good. I wouldn't come back for dimsum again as there many more dimsum places that offer better selection.
