UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw I LOVE the Bamboo Club - hands down the best Asian restaurant in Scottsdale. Not only is the food absolutely delicious, but it's affordable. In addition, they have a fantastic wine list - and a very knowledgeable and friendly staff. One of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.
