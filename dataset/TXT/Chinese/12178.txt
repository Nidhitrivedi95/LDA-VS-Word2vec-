2Oz0VGwBgo3Dp5Az5WUoww I have to say that this is my favorite chinese restaurant and probably a very underappreciated one.  This place is definitely a bit of a hole in the wall- outdated on the inside, not so great decor.  The staff, however is very friendly and I have always enjoyed everything I order here.  The restaurant is quiet and relaxing and they have some fun drinks to order from the bar.  I especially appreciate the Scorpian Bowl for Two...which comes out flaming.  The prices are good too and they deliver.
