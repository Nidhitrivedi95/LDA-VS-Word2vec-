XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw I am a fan for their hand-pulled noodles!  Hubby wanted some soup dumplings so we decided yesterday that we will try out DK for lunch today.  We arrived and notice that Christmas décor was up.  Wondered if DK celebrated Christmas all year round or they are just super excited for Christmas and already put up the decorations.  The restaurant's chairs were all covered with red flowered fabric.  Lots of red everywhere.  Hurts the eyes a bit.  Chairs were uncomfortable.

Onto the food:
- Beef Soup Dumplings: We thought this was ok.  We definitely had better. Couldn't really taste the soup in these medium sized dumplings.  We will pass on this next time.
-Teppan Tofu:  We had to ask for some steam rice to eat with this.  The sauce was very flavorful.  The tofu were soft inside and somewhat crispy on the outside.  I thought this was above mediocre.
-Shrimp Fried Noodle:  The hand-pulled noodle is the best hand-pulled cooked noodle I have tasted to date.  The texture and chewiness was perfect.  The shrimps were perfectly cooked as well.  I have had my share of overcooked shrimp and it can kill a dish.  Not at DK!  

We also had to order a pot of hot tea.  We did noticed that another family of 3 that came in after us was given hot tea and steam rice without having to ask for them.  *Shrug

Additionally, we had to wait 45 mins to get our noodle and tofu dish.  The lady owner did apologize for the wait since her husband had to run out to the store to buy veggies for the dish.  But, it's ok.  She was very kind and we didn't mind waiting.

Overall, this is a 3.5 star restaurant to us.  We will be back to try other items.
