They do make their dumplings in house (I believe) as they are a bit different than the standard (Chiu style dumpings for example).  The  squid tentacles yu yu so, were dry - wouldn't order them.  The steamed chicken and rice was good - overall the food was standard to what you would expect at a downtown dim sum restaurant.  Atmosphere and service were quite good.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to go back, and if at the plaza would try somewhere else (Ding Tai is great).
