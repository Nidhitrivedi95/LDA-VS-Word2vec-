Then added forced 12% service charge AFTER taxes. It is not written anywhere in the restaurant or menu. Was told I have to pay it because their staff are underpaid. Left a sour taste in my mouth. Dishonest, will not return. We also had made a reservation for 8 and was given the smallest table where the things we ordered basically didn't fit.
