ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg Apathetic service and tables that smell like rancid dish rags are the least of congee queen's worries (York Mills). The hot and sour soup was just a horror--thickened with so much corn starch it was just terrible--and the bean curd dish i tried was just swimming in a watery teriyaki sauce. My friend had a noodle dish w/crab that was nothing but flavorless noodles and nearly no crab. When we told the server that we didn't want to take any of the food home, he didn't seem surprised. Not a good sign.
