g-Q3rLkyGT-TtiRgE-PvgA My wife and I have been coming here for several years.  Where else can you find happy hour from 11:00a.m. to 8:00p.m with very inexpensive drinks and appetizers during that time.  The food is always delicious and plentiful.  Best egg foo young we have ever tasted.  Also enjoy the dragon special chicken,  mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, pot stickers and the beef and scallops.  My wife likes her food extra spicy and is never disappointed.  I am allergic to shrimp and they always remember to put a special note on the order even if we have not ordered a shrimp dish.

A main reason for returning here time and time again is the staff.  Candie, the owner is warm and friendly and assures we are well taken care of, her daughter is really sweet.  Our favorite servers Phoebe and Anna are a blast to talk with and always stop by to say hello even if we are not in their section.  All the servers are professional and Michael (Mo Mo) extremely quick.

My wife and I are both in the food and hospitality business and can not understand some of the previous reviews.  We have tried other Chinese restaurants and were never impressed until we 
came to the Canton Dragon.  We highly recommend this restaurant.  You will not be disappointed.
