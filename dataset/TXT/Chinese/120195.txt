O_J5e6aoskxhGx8meOm1Og Food is always fresh, using good ingredients. No corn syrup :) Quality and price are very important to me. 
Delivery is good and fast, especially if you get the good driver.  The price to quality ratio whoops every other chinese restaurant.  Guaranteed chinese flutes for your ears listening pleasure.
