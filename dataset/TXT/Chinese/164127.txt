uU8up3hGwW9qnzQD1HZsMQ Last review was 2 years ago. I have done a disservice to you all by not updating. 
They knocked down the neighboring wall and expanded, half takeout half restaurant. 
The food remains TERRIFIC. Orders customized if needed.
Service is friendly and knowledgeable. 
I'm a displaced New Yorker and this is local and the closest to what we left behind. THEY STILL GOT IT!
Prices are real value. ENJOY!
