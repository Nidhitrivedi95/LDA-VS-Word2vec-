kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A I came here expecting to be blown away by the food but it was a mediocre meal at best. 

The soup was good, my husband got a b2 ($8)and the noodles were nice, very filing, but overall the broth was borderline bland, the highlight of the soup was the brisket which was tender and very tasty! 

I ordered the c3 Szechwan Chicken ($8) the plate was drenched in sauce that made it almost inedible for me. The sauce was good, but there was so much of it that after two or three bites I really couldn't eat anymore. 

We also ordered the Mongolian beef pancake ($5) which we were excited about because it was featured in a lot of reviews on yelp. They were awful. Loaded with oil, the beef had an awful taste (almost sour) and the texture was a disappointment. I expected it to be a little crunchy on the outside but it was soggy from all of the oil. 

I was so disappointed that we didn't love the noodle man because the decor is so cute (not a hole in the wall, w/hole in the wall prices!) and it's right down the street from my house. 

My search for a great noodle soup still continues...
