DIxgItsSI9QwX9H8lVptYg Extremely friendly service.  Food was very good.  Three of us ordered one cashew chicken and one walnut maple shrimp.  Just the two meals.  It was more than enough for us.  The shrimp were large and plentiful.  No shortage of cashews on the other dish either.  Ample food and good quality.  For the price this dinner was an extraordinary value.  Without asking they also brought us piping hot fried dough balls dusted with sugar.  Not sure what they are called, but it was a nice touch and they were a free addition to the meal.  Not fancy, but clean and well run while we were there at 6:00pm on a Saturday.  I will be returning.
