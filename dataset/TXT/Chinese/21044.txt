68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw This place deserves a great review. They had me at Organic Free Ranged Chicken 

I've been meaning to come in here myself since their soft opening weeks ago but haven't had the chance to with my littlest one before they close at 3:30pm so had my hubby pick it up for lunch today 10/7/15

Hainan Chicken is Amazeballs like I knew it would be. The chicken itself is super moist with a silky buttery like skin that just melts in your mouth. Literally. The best part is that it's already DEBONED for you too!! No place I've ever been to debones their chicken and that's the worst part too lol 

   Comes with 3 different sauces
    -Tangy spicy chili - perfect touch of heat
    -Ginger Scallion - good ..bit more salt or seasoning would make it perfect (I'm a salty eater lol)
    -Sweet Soy - Nice thick sweeter kind of dip
Eat these all together and you have a perfect bite 

Chicken flavored Rice that comes with the hainan chicken is perfect the way it is with the yummy chicken flavor 

Twice Fried Chicken Wings were good. That ooey gooey sweet stickey sauce is fingerlicking good. Not too overly sweet either

I will definitely be back again personally soon. Need to take pictures of the interior myself and eat some more yummy organic chicken haha
