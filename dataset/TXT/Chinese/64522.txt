E8ugJa02FVCgfnjqV817iw I was going to give Maxim 4 stars, but I have a hard time holding out if I can't think of a good reason.  And in this case I just couldn't.

Don't hold the neighborhood against them... if you're from Phoenix, you know 19th and Osborn isn't the fanciest.  But then again, when was the last time you ate amazing Vietnamese food at the Biltmore?

An obvious choice is the Pho, and I have to admit I went safe with white meat chicken.  There was no skimping here... a huge to-go cup of broth, and an overflowing container of chicken, noodles, sprouts, veggies and herbs.  There's probably a method to eating it, but I just shoved it all in the cup and gorged.  And I couldn't be happier.

For some carbs and goodness I tacked on 2 egg rolls - a delicious mix of pork and shrimp.  They rank at the top of my best-egg-rolls-ever list.

I read a few things below about not-so-good service, and I'm having a hard time believing it was the same restaurant.  The lady who took my order was very receptive and made some great suggestions (including not being too exploratory with my food on my first visit).  Everyone in the place was smiling.

For a total of $8, I ended up with 2 full meals and a happy tummy.  And it doesn't hurt that I work right around the corner.  Glad I found this place!

Oh side note, I did find a Styrofoam cup in the parking lot that someone wrote "Die Bitch" on.  The neighborhood isn't great.  But the food's amazing, so get over it!
