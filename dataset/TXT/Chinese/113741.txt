MQTP7970k0HAODSIHTFt0w Shana is amazing.  I feel comfortable about talking to her about all my issues and she always listens and tailors the acupuncture around how I'm feeling.  I suffer from a lot of GI stress and sleep issues in general and I am a firm believer in acupuncture now that I have tried it.  I would have never thought years ago I would go to acupuncture since I work in western medicine however seeing the changes in my body the moment I see her keeps me a believer in this form of treatment.  I believe I will always have Chinese medicine as a part of my life whether it's to heal or maintain a healthy lifestyle... It's amazing!!!!
