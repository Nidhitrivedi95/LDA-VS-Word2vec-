X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Huge venue, good lightshow. Sound system could be better. Too many people walking around the whole time. Prices for drinks are too high. 9$ for 0.3L water?! If you want good service take a table/bottle service. Anyway, club was packed tonight. Visited for sunnery james & ryan marciano.
