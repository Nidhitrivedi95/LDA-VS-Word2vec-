BJ0pJxKFxzVGDtsknbLFRQ Ruyi Garden used to be a favourite in my household but both the food and service here has become absolutely appalling. 

Each dish I ordered had something wrong with it, many to the point that they were inedible. An example of this being the chicken balls were rock hard, and could not be bit into.
