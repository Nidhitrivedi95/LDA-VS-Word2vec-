S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg Wo Fat(not the bad guy on Hawaii 5-0!) is the only place in Vegas to go to for some Hawaiian Style Chinese food since Noodle Palace(RIP) is no more:(

Cake Noodles are pretty good, so is the Crispy Gau Gee and the Salt and Pepper Shrimp. Go here for the food and not so much the service which can be spotty at times...ALOHA!!!
