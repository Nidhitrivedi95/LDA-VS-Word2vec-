vMpJzMFst_9GP4boeqWIRg Walking into this Congee Queen for the first time; the decor is fancier than the other locations. Maybe the fancyness of this place has the front staff acting pompous... I'm not sure.  

This place would have gotten a 1 star based on the type of service received... but the food was on point. Got the usual (the I don't need a menu, I already know what to order) - minced pork & fish w/ beans, crispy chicken, fried squid w/ spicy salt, cantonese chow mein.. ohhh and the BBQ pork. 
BBQ pork was succulent. Crispy chicken, skin crispy, chicken juicy... veggies on other dishes not overcooked...  Have to say The. Food. Was. Goooood

If the food is always like this at this location - a tip for management/owners... Get rid of the front of house staff - servers, hosts. THEY SUCK. Let patrons sit themselves and order for  themselves, let the cooks get the credit they deserve and guarantee 4 and 5 star ratings will be the norm.
