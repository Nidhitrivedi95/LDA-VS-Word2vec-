hsgRNkXFMCqzO7nPRB3yJQ A small chinese cafe thats hidden in a small plaza along steeles ave e. Its a pretty traditional chinese cafe thats very small and has very limited seats. Breakfast and lunch time can yield 15-20 minute waits. The food is pretty cheap and the portions are pretty good for the price. The food comes pretty quickly and the servers are attentive and respond pretty quickly. Come here quite often for breakfast or tea time, as they have a deal where it comes with a drink for a cheap price.
