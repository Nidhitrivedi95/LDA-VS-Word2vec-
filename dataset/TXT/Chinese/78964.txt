GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog CHEF SADIE MERCEDES RECOMMENDATIONS WERE AWESOME! 

Chips & Salsa.  SO Simple but I love it.  Freshly made chips and chipotle salsa.  just the way i like my chips and salsa 

Tacos: Cochinita, Barbacoa de Res, Carnitas Refried Bean Taco

Tuna Ceviche was amazing... I've never had ceviche like this before.  Pecans was a nice change in your usual ceviche. 

Palmitos:  Hearts of palm with grapefruit and tamarind dressing.  Pretty interesting.  I'd recommend this if you've never tried it.  I feel like it's an extremes though.  You either like it or you don't.  I thought their tamarind was perfect.  Not too overbearing and not too sweet. 

Elote con Calabazitas.  Elotes.. can't go wrong.  order it.
 
Shrimp Mojo:  Nice big pieces of shrimp but I thought it was a TAD salty. But it is served with warm tortillas.
