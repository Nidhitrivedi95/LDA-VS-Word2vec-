The food is typically overcooked (or cooked long in advance and sitting in the warmer -- aka "hot box" -- for a long time), so not that great. 
The Egg Drop Soup is usually pretty hot, and normally has a fair amount of egg in it rather than being 95% liquid and 5% egg.

One of these days I will go back and try their "mongolian grill".  When you get your food direct from the grill, it's steaming hot, so I hope it will be close to what I am used to from the better quality ones I frequented before I moved to Chandler.

The service is hit-and-miss.  You either get a waitress who is very attentive (and therefore gets a far better tip) or you get someone who brings your drinks and MAYBE comes by once to collect dishes but not refill your beverages (and therefore receives a very small tip).
