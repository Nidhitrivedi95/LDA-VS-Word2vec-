I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday not too long ago. There were 7 of us. We had to call in for a reservation. We had to wait for our table for about 5 - 10 minutes but the hostess was very sweet and apologized for the wait. We sat down and immediately someone came over and asked if we wanted a round of ice water while looking at the menu. The menu is easy to read and follow and it was all you can eat! We were here for about 3 hours. Over all, friendly service, it is quick and easy, this location is definitely one of my favourite places to have hot pot from now on.
