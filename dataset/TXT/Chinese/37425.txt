anhk98859Rmo3mL6X41jbg I showed up tonight at 829 pm in the drive thru I was the next person up to order sat for 11 mins until the car in front of me was able to drive forward and I was able to actually order. By this time the line behind me is wrapped around and people are honking. I finally get to the window it's now 853 pm they girl gives me my food and says oh wait I need to get the sweet and sour for your ragoons. So now I am waiting again I finally get to drive off at 856pm. Not sure if I will return to this location
