mHcfv-cdbx1LtR3n3FoooA Stopped in on a Saturday evening just sure that I would have to wait a while for my food to go.  Not so.  I had my order within five minutes and I was not disappointed in the food at all. The shrimp with lobster sauce was scrumptious and the portion was huge.  Definitely worth the price!  I am making Hong Kong Kitchen my favorite for Chinese food!
