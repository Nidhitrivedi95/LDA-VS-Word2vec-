6_KCUxu2kOgP-pRnSNXG8Q The Husband had been raving about the fabulous Chinese food from Food Express, so imagine his dismay when they had closed down! Imagine his delight when he discovered they relocated to the Palace Station.  As a result, prices have gone up!  Sure the decor and ambiance is probably a lot nicer than their former location, but I'm not so sure if the change is good.

I had the Vegetarian Chow Fun, which was pretty pricey from what I recall.  It was standard, not a huge amount and there was limited veggies in it.  I thought it was authentic, but not worth what I paid.

The Husband had the Won Ton Mein and again, it was fine.  But still pretty pricey.  

The bill for both items was a little over $18, not including tip.

Overall, we didn't get to order a whole lot to really experience what Food Express has to offer and I can't say if the new one is as good as the old one.  But then again, the menu prices looked a bit more than what I would like to have paid for Chinese food.
