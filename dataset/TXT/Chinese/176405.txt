After a night of casino hopping we ended up here, its in the Fremont Hotel & casino. Small little place, with only a couple of tables to sit at. I went with the Breakfast plate - rice, portuguese sausage, eggs, and a biscuit all for like $5 and they give a lot of portuguese sausage. The food was ehhh - the eggs were cold, the rice was cold - I'm sure we could've found a better place to eat at. 

The Fremont hotel does have a Dunkin Donuts there - so I was pretty stoked. But I would skip this place.
