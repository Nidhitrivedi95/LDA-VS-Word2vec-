A5lD3y2eREchEdMcvWPXBA My review is only based on the rice rolls (Chang Fen) experience. 

We visited Yin Ji after 9:30PM on Sunday night. The restaurant was half full. We were seated immediately and served with warm water. Service was efficient and friendly. 

Since Yin Ji is famous for rice roll, we ordered 4 different kinds:

Shrimps with Chive, Marinated Beef with chive, Marinated chicken with chive (the Chinese wording actually is Chicken with Chinese mushroom), Sweet corn. The rice roll skin was very thin yet "bouncy". The meat filling was fresh. I like the soya sauce on top which was not very salty although it made every dish taste the same. 

We also ordered the Sweet Cruller; it was fresh and hot and not oily. 

We will definitely go back if we crave for rice roll.
