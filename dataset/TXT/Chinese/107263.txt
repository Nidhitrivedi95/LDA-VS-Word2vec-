l9B72QwKjUhEA-pLumCa5w Overheard some coworkers talking about this place and they said it was really good. Reading the reviews, I was less confident in eating here but decided to do it anyway. Ordered a ton of food. Beef skewers, egg flower soup, orange chicken, pot stickers, low mein, fried rice and egg foo young. I didn't try everything yet, but the beef skewers and egg foo young were both excellent. Everything else I tried was really good. They also had everything ready quickly and for as much food as I ordered, it wasn't that expensive. Definitely will be going here again.
