pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I am honestly so surprised to see so many positive reviews. Yes, it is pretty inside and the staff was wonderful, but the food was just ok. We ordered lemonades, a mushroom appetizer and a 15 piece sashimi chef's choice platter. The sushi was of okay quality, but nothing particularly special. I found the menu somewhat limited and we settled on what we ordered. The presentation was lovely and the ambiance very cool. Our server was very attentive and very sweet. We can throw down sushi, and we were still hungry and wanting more, but really didn't see anything else on the menu that caught our attention. Ee had hoped to find a go to sushi place but will keep looking. We are very spoiled living in the east coast. The drink menu looked interesting. It seemed to be a really cool bar that also served sushi.
