X8mtoSxY8whtmbDlj0D3Aw too easy. DO NOT eat here. 

its like a big buffet full of nothing. the old asian inspired theme was shabby. and the food. nothing near the asian style. break fast was terrible. and the only thing that was slightly edible was pizza. they ran out and never replenished it. i thought this was a buffet. however. the desserts... were total embarrassment of that entire category. my mud pie was not even muddy. it was just a chunk of dirt that has already settled 24 hours AFTER the rain. done.

no. don't do it.
