qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ Got there last week with my girlfriend. We were seated, but happened that the seat was reserved for someone else. They apologized and asked us if we can sit elsewhere. We really did not mind, because our couple work for customers also; Everyone makes mistakes. We were been seated on the other spot, and one of our server insisted to give us complimentary fried dumpling. We really did not mind switching the seat, because it is not a single big deal, but... Well okay..? It is free so I will take it. The server was Stephen I think. While we were ordering, we asked him to see if we can get some jjambbong soup by itself as a complimentary. Stephen told us he won't be able to guarantee us that he is able to give us jjambbong soup, but he will try best, and gave us an alternatives egg soups instead, if it is in that case. Which was great, amazing. Food was great, nothing special, but we enjoyed our time. jjambbong soup came out a bit late, but we were okay. Stephen apologized for being so late, but I really did not mind, because we were not that tricky and jjambbong soup was something that was not guaranteed like what he mentioned earlier. When our check came out and paid with our credit card, I don't know why, but gratuity line has been already filled with $0. I believed that he felt apologized, so he decided not to take gratuity from us since he thought that he did not serve us well. I was embarrassed, because I have never seen as attentive server as him, and he tried his best on what he could to please us. And we decided to just pay gratuity with cash. I believe we have dropped around 20% of the gratuity. 

Again, great place to eat when I am into Korean style Chinese food. It was great experience for us, and we never thought that we've been treated badly, everything was good.
