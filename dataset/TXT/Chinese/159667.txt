U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ We really enjoyed the pho here tonight.   The P1 pho without tripe or beef tendon was hot, delicious and filling.  The flavor of the pho was outstanding.   We also ordered the lemon grass beef vermicelli and it was excellent.  Portion sizes was generous and we had leftovers to take home.   The wait staff was attentive, but not overbearing.    Drinks were refilled promptly.    

The restaurant was almost full when we arrived at 5:00 pm and waiting a few minutes for a booth to be cleared.    Would we go back....Yes, we would!
