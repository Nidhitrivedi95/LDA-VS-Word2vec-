rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g Foods pretty good. The place is way outdated in my honest opinion and they should remodel but don't judge a book by its cover. My advice is to go between 11am and 3pm mon-fri.  For $5.95 you get the lunch special which includes a long list of main entrees that come with your choice of Hot & Sour or Egg Drop soup, rice, and Egg Rolls.  It's a smokin deal.
