9ibMbke1qYbmhJ2Qf3tWfA I LOVED this place!!!! We have been searching and searching for the perfect place to get Asian food bc we like to eat it once a week.  
They have great food and there is a bit of every taste of Asia. I had Pad Thai which was better than I've had at Thai specific places!!!!! We tried the egg drop soup and it was good, hot, fresh, and a big bowl with crunchies too. Lo Mein was yummy as was Kung Pao chicken.
U serve ur own drink which we love especially with spicy dishes.  I always get tea and it was freshly made and purified water as was the soda which were Coke products.
It is super clean and fun decor inside too. Sort of mood lighting and dim which is really nice and relaxing. Seating is comfortable and there is tv but it is turned on mute with CC so it doesn't bother but u can look at it. 

And the workers are very very nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Super big five stars and we will be back!!!!! Yay!!!!!!!!
