zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Excited to try this place due to the hype and reputation of the chef. We made reservations a week in advance for a Saturday 12pm. We were seated quickly and space was tight. We went with the summerlicious special for $18. it included an appie, a ramen or main and a dessert.

I tried the BBQ pork bun, tasted the chicken bun and had a chicken ramen. My gf had the rice with salmon. See pics. I loved the BBQ pork bun. It was tasty, tender, salty sweet inside a fluffy open face steamed bun with coke slaw. Yeah, sounds weird but it works! The chicken bun was pretty good too but the texture was really soft. 

My ramen was not what I expected. The chicken was in small ground up pieces and not sliced as I anticipated. Although odd, it was still tasty. The veggies were tender and the broth had a good kick. The green onions were excessive  so I scraped them off. My gf enjoyed her salmon on rice but it wasn't anything unique in taste or texture. High marks for a pretty presentation.

Finally dessert. Oh wow, impressed!!! Milk n cereal ice cream tastes exactly like cereal and milk. I had the chocolate truffle balls/ out of this world with salty n sweet moments exploding in my mouth!  I also bought a crack pie-it was like a chewy skor bar. Go upstairs to see where they kept the refrigerated creations. 

Overall this was a decent meal. Our bill for 4 people was $96 before tip. Perhaps I was blinded by the name but really, the venue, service and food quality.  Go try it for yourself
