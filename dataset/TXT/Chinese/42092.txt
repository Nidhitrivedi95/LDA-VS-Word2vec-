baY3pCVhwAKyWFXagiOCNw Was walking around the neighborhood and found this little place. Was looking to eat something quickly and the workers mentioned they could be quick. They definitely lived up to it! We were in and out in less than 30 minutes!Decent food for the most part. Ordered the following: 

Duck in beer marinade: 3/5 - great marinade but not too much duck meat. Wish it was a little more portion wise. 
Chicken wings in Coca Cola marinade: 3.5/5 - sweet and savory! Surprised I liked this more than the duck! 

The staff was super nice but difficult to understand. The owner came around and gave us VIP membership for free. Guess when you're VIP you get the discounted price for the foods. Pretty solid deal! 
 
As for ambiance, it needs a little work. The restaurant was very dark and needs light. Decent place with a nice staff.
