WrYz1HW0YuXG1rPa2Vznjg We were in the mood for some Dim Sum and I had heard that this is one of the better places outside of Brossard and Chinatown. You can tell that they must do a pretty steady Chinese wedding-party business with the stage motif in the front! Decor inside is your classic Chinese restaurant!  This place is huge and cavernous but we had an excellent selection of pretty much everything you can expect: fried, steamed, greasy noodles, chicken feet, tripe, har gow siu mai, char siu baau!  Carts kept rolling around the whole time we were there and different selections! No nonsense attitude by the cart ladies and the owner is pretty much par for the course at many establishments and this was no difference!  Trekking down to Brossard is a PITA for me so this may be my Dim Sum fix when not in Toronto as these people seem to know what they are doing!
