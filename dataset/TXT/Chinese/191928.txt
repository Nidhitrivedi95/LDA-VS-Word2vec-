On our last visit we showed up 15 minutes before closing - (you know the clients everyone who works there hates) and they were so nice. They told us to take our time and that only the kitchen closed at that time. So we ordered and the food came our right away - and we got worried! But the food was perfect, fresh and tasty with huge.....I mean huge portions. What a great deal and option to eat. We never felt rushed or under served.
