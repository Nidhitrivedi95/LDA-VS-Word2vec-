Some Chinese places are decorated very 80's or kind of like a doctor's waiting room. This one has the authentic red and gold hues i think one should have. It reminds me of the one in the famous "Seinfeld, four!" episode where they end up not eating. It also reminds me of parts of Big Trouble in Little China. It is situated in a run down strip mall across from the lake and next to a thrift store.The food is good enough i guess. I also dig the name. Not to many restaurants have pagoda in their name.
