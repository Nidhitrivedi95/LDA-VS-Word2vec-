z8oIoCT1cXz7gZP5GeU5OA My favorite dim sum restaurant in the recent months. The times I've visited were all weekday mornings so no wait. The dishes are tasty and the price is good. Just don't order their rice in clay pots because i tried a few but they were all pretty bad (mainly dice with a few pieces of meat on top). I had dim sun for 2 hours here with a girl friend who I haven't seen for a long time. They didn't disturb us or rush us out while we were catching up which I appreciate.
