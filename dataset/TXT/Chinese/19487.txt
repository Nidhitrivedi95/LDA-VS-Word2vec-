5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ My wife and a number of friends were in town for CES this year and decided to go to dinner at Blossom after getting drinks at Minus 5 in Monte Carlo.  I had never been in the Aria, so seeing the beautiful hotel for the first time was great.

There were 10 or so of us dining together at a table, so it was family style dining where each person ordered something and everyone shared.  Here are some of the items that we ordered:

Pot Stickers - Tender and tasty. Standard potstickers.

Egg Rolls - Standard.  Toasty when fresh.

BBQ Pork - Tender and well flavored.

Kung Pao Chicken and Shrimp - Tasty, spicy, excellent quality.

Pan Fried Beef Tenderloin - Really liked this one.  Great texture and flavor.

Beef Broccoli - Standard and tasty.  Two types of broccoli for options.

Hong Kong Style Chow Mein with seafood - This was great and went fast.  Lots of variety and nice textures of crispy noodles.

Some other type of Chow Mein - Also good.  Not pan fried noodles though.  Good sauce.

An interesting note, there is a $44K bottle of wine listed on their wine menu (it's a 1990 vintage I believe).  Hard to justify that, but it was the first time seeing that before.

Summary: Food was very good as far as flavors and quality goes.  The service was impeccable.  Very attentive and efficient with ensuring everyone had drinks, food, etc. whenever needed.  The only qualm I have with this place is the price.  It is an upscale Chinese restaurant, and definitely elegant inside, but $30 for beef and broccoli... One can't honestly say that it's worth that much.  So it wasn't.  The dinner was too expensive to warrant it a "good deal," but it was still a nice dinner and good for a large group.
