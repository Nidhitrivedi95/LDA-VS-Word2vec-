5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Fantastic experience from start to finish. Made a same-day reservation during Halloween weekend as we were staying next door at the Vdara and this restaurant seemed like it had great reviews. We were greeted and escorted to our table right away.

I made note of our special occasion and it was mentioned by the host right when we were seated. We were given a beautiful big booth facing out towards the rest of the restaurant. The waitress came right away to get drink orders and hand over the menu. 

We decided to order a few things so we could share them, however we did not expect the portions to be so huge! We order the bbq duck, beef (forgot the name), and garlic prawn fried rice. The speed that the food came was so impressive! Literally within 10 minutes even though the restaurant was some-what busy. 

Everything tasted so delicious. I don't eat anything spicy which is why we chose out these dishes. The seasonings were all fantastic! The beef was way better than I expected and same with the fried rice. We had to ask for to-go containers as we had more than half the food left over.

After the meal we were too full for dessert so we asked for the bill. However our sweet waitress knew of the special occasion and presented us with some mochi ice cream as well as a cute little gift box! What a fantastic way to end an already great experience! Will definitely be back.
