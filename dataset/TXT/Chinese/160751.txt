uBCRRQJ4ukFaE_UyY6T1uQ stopped in here for happy hour before a show. Found a nice spot at the bar & ordered one of the $5 drinks on the HH menu. It was some kind of rum punch. And it was very good! I had 3 of them & had a nice buzz when I left.
I decided to try some food and ordered the spicy tuna roll & cucumber salad.
It hit the spot just right. I just wanted a light snack and thats what it was.
The bartenders were awesome. Bringing me water/soy etc.
I would come back again for happy hour.
