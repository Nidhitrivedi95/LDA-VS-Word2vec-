4egAyQgylMPJgngmNGCloA Food was fresh and tasty.  Spicy chicken with ginger and scallions was out of this world. Ma Po  Tofu really tasty..  Congee Seafood SuperBowl has hint of ginger which was nice,   and good amount of seafood.  Service prompt and personable.  This is a tiny restaurant, newly opened and deserving to be a success.  Definitely on our list of favorites.  They do take out and delivery, really only four tables, but if you score one it's worth eating in.
