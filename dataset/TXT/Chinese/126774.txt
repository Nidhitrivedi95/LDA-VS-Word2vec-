P5NfFdOUSyhEjbMlfnxPpA Honestly, it was so quiet in the restaurant when me and my sister walked in Saturday afternoon,  they had all day dim sum so I was quite surprised to see the restaurant nearly completely empty minus a few other patrons. It was a bit of a wait since we got dim sum dishes and that needs time to steam and everything. Please this is our second time eating here.

We ordered:
- Chicken feet
- Tripe with scallions & ginger
- Char siu bao
- Curry squid

Everything was good until near the end when we had to pay. Note...guys never come around 3-5ish. Why? Because all of the staff will go on their late lunch/early dinner all at once during that time. This is a problem because they will not notice you if you need to wave them down for anything, so my recommendation is if you want a drink, flag them down before they go on break or tell them right away as they are seating you. Second problem, we finished eating right when they started their break, my sister looks at me hesitantly unsure of what to do in this situation, we flagged down a waiter, we got ignored. Tried again as another waiter comes by, again ignored. So sighing heavily, I told her to take our bill along with her purse up to the counter to pay. LIKE HOW THE HECK DO YOU IGNORE A CUSTOMER FRANTICALLY WAVING THEIR ARMS LIKE A LUNATIC TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION? Anyways we paid and as we were leaving, I asked how was the damage? She said $21 and something cents. I stopped and looked at her weirdly. They had overcharged us. I had looked on the menu for item prices and the large items were labelled $4, medium for $3.50, small for $2 or $2.50, a can of pop was at least $1 to $1.50. We did the calculations even after tax and tip it only totalled to $16 something. We had 2 large items, one medium and one small along with a can of pop. So you guys do the calculation and see you if you agreed with us. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but we knew we were never going back because of shitty service.
