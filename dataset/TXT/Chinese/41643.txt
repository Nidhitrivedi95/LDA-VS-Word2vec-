B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ First time I went hear it was wonderful.  I have been here several times but the last would be the last.  There is one word for this place SPICY!

The food is good but way too spicy.  We asked for it too be mild but they did noting to make it less.  It was not busy so they should have been able to prepare it mild.

The service was good except they seamed offended they were not eating Nan correctly.  The server showed us the correct way.  They did not need to that.  

The seating is funny.  The booth and chairs are real low.  If you a tall person you will find it difficult to sit.

The restaurant is connected to Tadka next door.  You can order from either menu.
