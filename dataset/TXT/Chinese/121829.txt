oAngC9V69vyzBVYwKEJQaw I tried China Tango Bistro tonight for take out. I ordered online and I was happily shocked that within 15 mins it was at my door and it was extremely hot! I ordered chicken chop suey and orange chicken. I thought both were very good. I LOVED the chicken chop suey, and the orange chicken was very good too but I didn't think it was any better than Panda Express but this place delivers and that scores major brownie points, for fast food Chinese. Over all, I will order again. I would say it's good step up from Panda Express. 

China Tango is not to be rated against a nice sit down authentic Chinese restaurant. 

PS: my order came with two containers of white rice free, I normally order brown rice if offered but I didn't see the option to choose, and honestly I didn't know I'd even be getting rice so no biggie. :) 

PSS: This place is FAR FAR FAR better than the Chinese delivery (I won't name names) in the Sprouts/Target center at Green Valley & Horizon Ridge.
