gtcsOodbmk4E0TulYHnlHA Amazing staff, owner is awesome. If you call a tab a "tap" I probably won't trust your review haha. Also if this guy hated the beans why did he ordered more bread? Such weird reviews for this place. Snacks are always great and it fills a hole in the neighborhood for a predrink spot!!!!
