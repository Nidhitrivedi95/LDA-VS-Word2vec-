oyPvqoQhsdkfUeHtdPD7BQ J-Wok kinda reminds me of a confused Pei Wei/China One with a splash of Thai. Being in the area and seeing the high ratings, we got suckered in.

We were thinking of a noodle dish and an item off the fusion menu. As much as we were eyeing the Pad see ew and the Drunken Noodles, the owners strongly recommended the Chow Mein and Mongolian Beef Hash off the fusion side.

Tastewise, the hash was a disappointment using the same type of hash browns found at Mickey D's and the flavors just didn't mesh well together...no....just no...the Chow Mein was good, similar to what you can get at China One, but the excess oil left on the plate was unnecessary.

Overall, a weak A-Ok for me, and another place I probably won't be returning to when you got tastier oodles of noodle options in Chinatown, and be careful... The po-po may get you here for J-Wokking ...;) ALOHA! ! !
