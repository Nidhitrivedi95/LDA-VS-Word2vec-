dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ I had gotten a recommendation for my coworker to go to Orient Sushi. As we showed up the place is nothing special from the outside but very clean on the inside. Sushi was very good and came out amazingly fast though it was not very busy the time that we Whit. Service was a little spotty but it was toward the end of the night so it seemed as though they were closing down. Would recommend Orient Sushi, very good sushi, and a really good price
