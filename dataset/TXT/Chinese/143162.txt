rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g Awesome Dim Sum! Huge selection! We have been searching for somewhere as good as The Golden Buddha since they closed... we found somewhere so much better! 

The BBQ pork noodles are divine, the kids love the chicken feet! Have not had one bad item here. 

Can't wait to go back to try more as there are so many kinds of Dim Sum, there is no way to eat them all on the same visit. 

Well worth the drive to Chandler from North Phoenix.
