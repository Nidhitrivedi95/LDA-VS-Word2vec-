j9YFHVQqxM_qKHIc4nck-A first time at Wong's Asian Cuisine, it is Hakka-Chinese cuisine.  Good prices for lunch specials.  We ordered Shrimp and Lobster sauce + rice w/soup lunch special and Chicken with Black Bean sauce + rice w/pop.  Condiments were simple, was hoping for chinese vinegar, but not available.  Wife had hot and sour soup with her lunch combo (only 1 type of soup offered), it was too spicy for her and for me as well, we ended up not finishing the soup. Shrimp and Lobster sauce was a bit more salty than we normally like.  We just barely finished our respective lunch dishes, was almost too much for us.  At the time of our visit only 1 staff member was managing the dining room, service was kinda average.  There are more dishes we are curious on tasting so likely will return again.  They do accept cash/debit, not certain on Credit cards.
