Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Dim sum is hot, comes around frequently and the people are nice.  I do think they are a little over priced and sometimes I feel like I'm being cheated because they can stamp any price section without me verifying it's the right price for the item I got. 

But the food is good and service is fine.  Oddly enough I always bring my own chopsticks though because theirs are VERY waxy and hard to eat with.
