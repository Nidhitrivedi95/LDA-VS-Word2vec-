LpdW1vh1AVm5QznEL5j03g This establishment lacks customer service, I placed an on-line order ready for pick-up so this way I do not have to wait in line, but I still had to wait just like if I were in line, I stood at the on-line pick-up order area and the cashier did not even bother to ask for my name for my pick-up that I had already placed.  She saw me standing there and proceeded to help two more customer that got there after me in the other line, I finally spoke out to her and told her I am here to just pick-up my on-line order.  If I had not spoken out she would have continued to ignore me standing and waiting.  This establishment needs to train the employees to address customers effectively in a timely fashion.  It should not have been the customer to be asking for help when clearly the employee sees a customer standing and waiting in the pick-up order area.  The employee should have at least acknowledged me standing waiting around for my order. Management should have some sort of training for it's employees on greeting customers and have a better friendly and fast service!  Management knows that it starts to get busy during the lunch hour and should help out their employees since it is too much for them to handle and/or they should hire more people for better service!  Not a good experience, that is to bad since it was my first time there...
