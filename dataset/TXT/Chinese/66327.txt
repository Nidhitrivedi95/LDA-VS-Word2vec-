EhGPj8iJDIdaHnWg9d5BgA I've been enjoying dim sum at Pearl since I was a kid, it's remained an amazing destination both for the views and the food. It's a little pricey but in my opinion worth it. It's one of those places that you can actually enjoy the afternoon. I recommend the hand rolled rice noodles that come around under a glass bowl, they are delicious. Enjoy the food and the view. I've always had great service there and the food is high quality. It's best in the summer or the dead of winter. Looking out at the lake while enjoying dim sum is worth the cost of food.
