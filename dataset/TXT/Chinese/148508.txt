SktLID5_ywSlgVE-h3NB3Q This place should not have three stars! The food was AMAZING and AUTHENTIC! Finally a place that knows what spicy is when you ask for it! You can ask for mild too if you don't like spicy. LARGE amounts of food and it was FRESH and HOT. Mind you I ordered delivery was told 60-90 minutes through Eat 24 from the Yelp app; they were here in 35 minutes. I will order again from here 100% so good!
