BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg I personally think this is as good as it gets as far as local Chinese food delivery goes. I have never eaten in, but whatever I've ordered off their menu has left me a very happy person. 

Their lunch/dinner combos, both Americanized and Sichuan cuisines, are both good value and delicious. 

I'm a big fan of their Sichuan food items. The delivery portion is massive and the generous use of various spices makes the dish very flavorful. I would definitely recommend their mapo tofu and the sauteed beef with cumin. 

I will order from them (possibly drop by sometime in the future) for as long as I live in Pittsburgh.
