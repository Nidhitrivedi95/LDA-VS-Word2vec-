Cl-xl1vTUwHeaGgBxzdTRA This place is great if you want a step-up from Panda Express. But not ready for a full on authentic Chinatown restaurant where you need to really know your  Chinese food. We have been looking for a Chinese restaurant to replace Diamond China over at Sahara and Valley View since it closed. This is why we decided to try Chow Mein House. The noodle house was nice and clean. Our host/ waiter was very friendly and attentive, pointing out helpful tips on what to order. Except for a little mishap with the water being spilled on my daughter, everything went pretty smooth. The bus person was very sorry. The Service was really fast, the food was very tasty, and the prices were very reasonable. Although we have not found the replacement for Diamond China, this place is still a good place to eat Chinese food. We will be coming back and recommending this place to family and friends.
