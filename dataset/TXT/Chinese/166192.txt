vbVJzKDhHlhMnKRpES5QzQ Well if this review was based on service it might be a 1 or two star.  However the food was a 5 star. Probably a 7 star .  My order arrived after my two companions were finished. No apology or explanation. 
I would normally land on a 3 star based on great food and poor service , but as I said  it was exceptional.  
The restaurant had 100 percent (except me) Chinese customers so I knew it would be good. Not fancy by any means. Go there for the food, not the service  or ambience .
