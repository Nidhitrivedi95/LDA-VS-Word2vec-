6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q This restaurant is over priced and extremely shitty quality. I ordered the cashew chicken (vegan) for 17$ and it was so bland. The sauce wasn't good, there were huge chunks of celery which would've been fine had they not been raw or maybe sliced more thin and  the fake chicken was dry (HOW DO YOU EVEN FUCK UP FAKE CHICKEN!?!) I ate like two bites of it and when asked how it was I told my waiter it was extremely disappointing and I didn't want it. My boyfriend still paid for it and I left hungry and upset.

 I was excited because I know the Wynn has vegan options but NO THANKS, never again.
