eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ When I see a sub-4 star overall rating on yelp I have certain expectations and I'll often actually avoid the place. But a friend of mine wanted to check Umami out so I checked my assumptions. And I loved it! We went during restaurant week so it was packed at we ate at the bar. The buzz in the place was great and you could tell it was a place where people were having a great time.

Brandon and I ignored the restaurant week menu (simply because it would have been WAY too much food) and we shared an order of the buns, the dumplings, and we split a bowl of ramen. The pork belly buns were delicious. The pork was soft and flavorful and the hoisin sauce was the perfect pair.The dumplings were less remarkable simply because they bore a strong resemblance to Asian Kitchen take out, but I love Asian Kitchen take out, so I thought they were good. The tonkotsu ramen was delicious. This was the part I was most nervous about because people seemed to have the most negative opinions about that. But it was great. The broth was flavorful, the noodles were nice and thin. The egg was absolutely delicious. Even the pork, which was my least favorite part, was nice and salty and added a lot of flavor. On a tip from another yelper, we decided to split a bowl. It's $1.50 extra and they give you separate bowls, extra meat, and an extra egg. Great deal and the perfect amount of food.
