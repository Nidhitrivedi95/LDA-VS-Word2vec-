Ok top of that we ordered three spring rolls and three small bowls of rice and it all came up to $50. Really decent. And if you're going out with friends it's great because you can share with the table.

I don't know if I see the appeal in taste as much. It wasn't bad but I didn't find it to be very flavourful. I didn't like the fact that the spring rolls we're so oily - they could have let a paper towel soak some of it up before serving. The mock shrimp and the cashew fried veggie plate were what I enjoyed most.
