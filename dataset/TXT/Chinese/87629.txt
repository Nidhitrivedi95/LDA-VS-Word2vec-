The food is always consistent and authentic old school Cantonese style.  

The Dumpling Soup is excellent with large dumplings in a simple base soup. 

The Chinese Crispy Chicken is as authentic as you can get, well prepared and skin has the right snap. 

The Salt and Pepper Fish may be the best dish that they prepare, just a little kick with jalapeños to give it some taste but not hot.

The Chow Fun topped with Chinese Broccoli and Beef is very tasty with the noodles having good consistency and flavor.

Of course their Sweet and Sour Pork is very well prepared and firm.

Service is pretty good, but limited in parking, make sure you don't park next door at Filibertos or your car could be towed away.

Overall good food at decent prices with authentic Chinese.
