SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ Learned of JC Sushi and Chinese off of our Nextdoor app. Didn't believe that a place that took over the location of some restaurant we never went to would be good. We were wrong. Dead wrong.  Good is an understatement. Great is getting close to the quality. 

First off. Don't be dismayed by no one being there. As many times as we have gone for dinner, no one is hardly ever there. Second - if the bar is open, grab it. The bartenders are funny, courteous and helpful. Additionally, the bar backs up to the sushi bar and many times they will send over samples of something they are trying out.  Third, live it up. Sake bomber? Hell yeah, why not. Quail Egg? Of course. Try it all. Ask about the specials and what the staff likes. We have yet to walk out disappointed. Prices are similar to Ra or Ahso and there are great happy hour prices Monday - Thursday. No negatives here other then I wish they had a better bar area for happy hours. I think they should add some TV's and really push happy hour. Live a little and try something different, you will not be disappointed.
