OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw We craved some dim sum while on Labor Day vacay and yelped this place and we really enjoyed the food and the service was great that we came here twice on our 4 day weekend. The service was great the ladies were real nice and our drink glasses were never empty always refilled. They'd seat us at tables with lots of room so we aren't cramped. I love dim sum places where you can order a particular dim sum not available on the cart. We really enjoyed the fried shrimp balls (looks like a hush puppy) it was crunchy, sweet and moist in the center, the bbq pork noodle is our standard go to dim sum which didn't disappoint, pork dumplings, bbq pork siopao, bbq baked bun (dinner roll stuffed w/ bbq pork), and shrimp dumplings were some of our favorites. They also offered mini entree dishes that they walked around offering like salt and pepper shrimp and salt and pepper calamari. The prices were reasonable dim sum from $1.85-$2.50 and entrees around $7.00. 

The 2nd time we came here we came real late almost 2:45 and they didn't give us a hard time because their dim sum ends at 3pm and they took our orders on any dim sum we wanted that they didn't have available on the carts. And even though most of them were at lunch eating at the corner we were still served and attended to very nicely. 

We will be back here when we're in the Vegas area.
