zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I have a feeling that some of these reviews are for the other Momofuku sections (milk bar, Nikai, Daisho, Shoto) and are not about the Noodle Bar specifically. My review pertains just to the noodle bar.

I've been avoiding the noodle bar ever since it opened because of the terrible reviews I've heard from friends. Tonight, I decided to just go and try it myself because I was having a particular craving for the cereal milk soft serve (which they didn't end up having anyway), and unfortunately, my friends were right. Considering the price I paid ($65 for 2 sets of buns and 2 ramen bowls), it could possibly be the worst ramen I've ever had.

I think the main problem with their dishes is that the meats are not marinated or marinated long enough. The pork belly just tastes like a steamed pork belly with no seasoning. There isn't much flavour in the broth either, and so every dish tasted bland. I ordered the Momofuku ramen, and my friend ordered the chicken miso ramen and they were both equally bland. The buns weren't much better either - very underwhelming compared to the buns from Ippudo.

I would just walk down to Sansotei for a much better ramen experience. I give it 2 stars for the nice decor and the efficient service, but the food was abysmal.
