zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Ramen is lacking flavourful broth, and does not contain enough broth. 
Toppings doesn't come together well, I don't need pickled veg in my savoury soup noodles when the soup itself isn't even rich enough to demand for the tanginess of the pickles. 
Might as well call this shit a noodle salad. 
Noodles have a overcooked texture, probably got the ratios wrong, definitely not hand pulled/cut/made to obtain the elasticity of the dough.

Honestly, this is a great place if you eat bland food like grilled chicken and steamed veg everyday

this spot is good for people who never had real asian flavours, you get better, cheaper buns from banh mi boyz, you get better noodle soup at ANY ramen shop around town, and that's saying a lot (Aijisen anyone?). This place is overpriced AF, probably to pay the salaries of these incompetent chefs and those fancy ingredients they get which don't even work together (Shoto/Daisho?).

And do yourselves a favour, don't go to the floors above, I gave Shoto two chances, below average flavours, premium prices, on two separate occasions. Don't waste your time and money, especially don't go during Winter/Summerlicious.
