Hole in the wall northern Chinese dumpling joint with average offerings.  If you are in a craving for Chinese dumplings, this place may satisfy.


FOOD:  2.5/5
Unlike the previous reviews, the menu offerings are significantly paired down. Pooled noodles are no longer offered.  They do not even have the steamed soup dumplings, Shaio Long Bao (<U+5C0F><U+9F8D><U+5305>).
DUMPLINGS, BOILED:  Pork / Sour Cabbage 
The dumpling wraps are clearly hand made.  As a matter of fact, you can see a few ladies behind the glass partition in the kitchen hand wrapping the dumplings.  The flavors are good.  The wraps are a bit past "al dente" to near mushy.
DUMPLINGS, BOILED:  Lamb
Good texture to the filling and slight acidity hinting at the lamb.
DUMPLINGS, PAN FRIED:  Pork
Once again, the lack of gluten development of the wrapping makes the outside less solid and crisp as could be.

AMBIANCE / SERVICE:  2/5
Hole in the wall with an attempt at Chinese decor.  Service is not obstrusive.

LOCATION / PARKING:  2/5
Parking is metered city street in Chinatown

WHEELCHAIR ACCESS:  0.5/5
Large / high step at front door that is uneven, making it difficult for one person assisted entry.
