The sesame chicken was dry and stringy. The chop suey and mongolian chicken looked identical and used the same sauce. The mongolian chicken was just spicier. The gravy for the egg fu yung was the same sauce that was with the chop suey, etc. I guess if you haven't eaten decent chinese food then this stuff might be considered good. But for my taste it was terrible and I would certainly take a pass on this restaurant. Tom's Red Pepper is not too far away from China Kitchen and, while not the best, it is far better than this.
