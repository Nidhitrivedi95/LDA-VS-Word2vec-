D2eZD_MP8Ds32rkoVI_MBQ The only reason that this restaurant is getting one start is because it goes no lower. After a long drive, we decided to order Chinese. They didn't take half of our order over the phone. Asked for a tip and then were irritated with the tip given. Then argued that we didn't order the other half of our meal when we called them back. RUDE!!!!! Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere.
