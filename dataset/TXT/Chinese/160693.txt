uBCRRQJ4ukFaE_UyY6T1uQ We stopped by for the sushi happy hour with a group of friends after visiting the aquarium around the corner. I was intrigued by the $5 sushi and drinks that was advertised. After taking a look at the menu only 2 out of the 5 happy hour rolls were actually $5. I didn't mind spending more to get a more interesting roll. However... when our rolls came out they weren't really rolls at all. Each roll no matter the price only had 4 pieces! You would be better off paying the $20 a roll to actually get some food. The sushi was good, but they limited it to two per ticket. There really wasn't enough food for what we spent. There are much better places for sushi on the strip. I would skip over this place.
