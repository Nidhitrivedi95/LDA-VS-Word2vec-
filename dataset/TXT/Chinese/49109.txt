CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I ordered Beef soup noodle - disappointed: noodle too soft, soup has no flavor, even though with lots of beefy, but too tough and lack of flavor. Then I ordered papaya for try to make myself feel satisfied - for over $8 get a half of mini papaya. Now I know why I don't need to wait for dinner
