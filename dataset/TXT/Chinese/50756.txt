cGQKUOAZm_VHcQOJWbatog If I had to pick my very favorite chain restaurant, it would be PF Chang's.  I'm aware that it's not authentic, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious.

We stopped by after some shopping in the area on a snowy Friday, and were able to get a table pretty quickly.  The hostess and server were both friendly.  My husband enjoyed a glass of sake, and I had a mai tai that turned out to be delicious.  We split an order of lettuce wraps as an appetizer; they don't custom-make your sauce any more which is disappointing, but they did happily provide us with chili paste and hot mustard to doctor it up ourselves.  His Chang's Spicy Chicken (extra spicy) turned out great, and provided the extra requested heat.  My Orange Peel Shrimp were as good as I'd remembered-- perhaps better because they have some fresh orange slices included as well.  We also ordered a Great Wall of  Chocolate.  If you like  chocolate cake at all, you'll love this one.

PF Chang's consistently provides good Chinese in a trendy (but still casual) atmosphere at a decent price, and I'm always a fan.
