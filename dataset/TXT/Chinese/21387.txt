68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw I love getting the beef pancake and the soup filled dumplings. Snow pea leaves are also very good here, as are the dim sum options. I also love the fried spicy tofu, very nice sauce and nice textures. 

Definitely the cleanest restaurant in Chinatown but also fairly pricey so I usually stick to the dim sum/appetizer menu.
