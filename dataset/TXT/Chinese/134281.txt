Q_ZqXNa5I753FOkA28R82Q I Order for take out a bowl and a 2 entre plate . Both were made wrong I ordered orange chicken on both and walnut shrimp and they came with grilled chicken I tried calling the restaurant for 2 days now to try and see if they could resolve the issue but they have failed to pick up the phone . I don't know if they are just ignoring calls so they don't have to talk to customers or the phones don't work . Very disappointed right now !
