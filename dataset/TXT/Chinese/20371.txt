5z-kd3h50BnaE1Ee8GV5bg We were looking for a different chinese place but when we got there it wasn't open yet so we gave this one a try.

This is an older place, kind of a hole but I noticed that the staff was cleaning the entire time we were there. The waitstaff was friendly.  The food was ok, it wasn't exactly good but most of it was edible.  $7.25 for the buffet on the weekend but I think it's cheaper during the week, $6.25 or something like that was on the sign.

2 drinks, 2 buffets came to $19 and some change.  

I wouldn't really recommend this place, they didn't do anything "wrong" but they don't do anything right either.
