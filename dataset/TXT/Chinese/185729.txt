Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw I was hungry for Chinese food, and Great Wall is right up the street from my house, so I tried it...

I had the Mongolian Shrimp and Chicken, and it was  just above average in flavor. I got my order to go, and the food was served lightening fast.

The joint is clean, the staff was helpful, but not the friendliest, and you get a lot of food for the money. It was decent, I'll be back.
