safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg Stopped in here for lunch the other day so I could try them out since we just moved in down the block. Found out they had a lunch buffet for $6.50. What a great way to try out a few things on the menu!
The place is pretty out dated inside and the staff was neither great, nor terrible. They were OK for servers during a buffet I guess. The buffet was a bit disappointing as they seemed to put out very little food at a time. Seems they are trying to be very cautious as to not waste food. I appreciate them not wanting to waste food but it makes it frustrating when there is only a spoon full of most items left in the tray when I go up.
As for the food itself, it was about what I would expect for a 6 buck buffet. Nothing spectacular but just decent chinese food. The chicken items (General Tsos and Sesame Chicken) were probably the standouts to me if I had to pick something. The fried rice was a bit disappointing but I would try it again fresh and not off the buffet line.
All in all, not a waste of a trip, especially for 6 bucks! I will give them a try for take out and update my review.
