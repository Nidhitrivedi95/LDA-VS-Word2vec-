Z4MvEVylnZPW_vddQc2Ihg One of the better choices for Asian AYCE buffets.I really like the option to create your own stir fry which is what makes the place unique. Pick your meat(pork,lamb,beef,chicken or several different kinds of seafood),veggies(plenty of options),noodles(3 varieties) and sauce(large selection of pre-mixed or create your own) and hand your bowl to the cook who has it ready for you in a minute or so after tossing it around on a huge hot plate with no oil,just water.


They also have the standard pre-cooked appetizers-spring rolls,dumplings,some salads, deep fried stuff,etc-nothing special.

Desserts are limited but the chocolate fountain with fruits and marshmallows is cool.
