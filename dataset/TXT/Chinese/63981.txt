e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg I have used Yelp for years but never had a reason to create an account until now.

I finally caved in to my girlfriend and took her here. I should have known better when I walked in and saw the place empty except for maybe 2 tables at 7:30 pm on a Friday night. The decor was nice though, and the staff was enthusiastic. I had no idea it opened by the winner of Masterchef Canada, so when he mentioned that, I got pretty excited.

We ordered 3 items to start: grandpas' fung guo (recommended by the waiter), ceviche, and the curry. The lobster chow mein was also recommended, but I wasn't too hungry nor was I too keen on spending $25 on a tapas dish. 

The fung guo was bland. There is nothing more to say about it. At $8 for 3 pieces, I expected it to taste better than the frozen dim sum I can buy at the grocery store.

The ceviche was disgusting. My girlfriend always orders ceviche if it's on a menu, so I have had my fair share. This was just diced up shrimp and scallops on top of guac. It was too sour for us to even eat half. 

The curry was pretty good. My dining partner thought it was too salty but I thought it was decent compared to the garbage that was my 2 previous dishes. She also ordered a cosmo which she did like though.

Overall, the bill came to $70+ for 3 tapas dishes and a drink. I had to eat again a couple of hours later. $70+ for a snack is ridiculous given the quality of the food. There are so many better similar restaurants out there, and this one seems to be putting random ingredients together and calling itself "Asian Fusion" in attempt to cash in on the hype right now. 

It could be possible I just didn't order the "right" items, but I will never find out.
