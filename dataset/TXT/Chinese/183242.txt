xmeEyBVC5zN-FCX5qZviIQ First let me say I will give this place another chance.  Ordered last night.  The food showed up in timely fashion.  Except the forgot my egg rolls.   
The seafood special was ok but I wasn't crazy about the sauce.  
They eventually came with the egg rolls but they were really greasy looking and I was already full.
