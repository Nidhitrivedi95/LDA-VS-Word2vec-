At3bSltMX8mrBWAHL9s-HA I ordered a lunch combo of sesame chicken and white rice and received sesame chicken with pork rice. I do not eat pork, so I had to eat the ride around the pork. The sauce used for the chicken isn't as sweet as I would have liked. Overall I give it two stars because I'm hungry and they are the closest Chinese takeout in the Northlake area.
