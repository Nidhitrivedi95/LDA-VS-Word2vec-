zQlaDJqp3c_HAuYP5Ukk3w My wife talked talked me into this place as she had gone in for lunch.

Some of the best and authentic tasting Chinese food I have ever had. Given that I've never visited China, this place has a different but great flavor. 

The dining room is fairly large and but kind of out dated. As a side note: we've never eaten there, always take out. 

The employees are very friendly and also demonstrate kind gestures to my son while plays in the lobby. 

The prices are more than reasonable and they even have family dinner packages. However, even the regular menu items are very generous portions.

If you happen to visit this place, you have to try their crab puffs! Oh my! They are delicious.

The times we've ordered take out that pack our food nicely in plastic grocery bags with a card board base to eliminate the possibility of spilling.
