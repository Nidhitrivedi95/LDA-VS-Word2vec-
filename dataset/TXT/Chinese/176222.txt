I'm not sure why people eat here. But I can tell you the reason why I did. Because I was starving. If you're not picky about how your meat taste or how fatty it is,  then this is the place for you. My meal had chicken and beef in it. That was the most disgusting crap I've ever eaten. The beef was chewy. It had been the lowest grade of meet I've ever eaten. I was going to get the beef ribs but that was the reason I didn't get them was because they may be too fatty or too chewy. I guess this is why I always eat vegetables when I eat at Chinese restaurants because their meat sucks.
So please, don't be spontaneous and try this place you'll be pis-ssed and waste your money.
