pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA My friends and I ordered the sashimi assortment which was amazing! What I especially loved was the kids menu, probably the best kids menu I've seen. . My 8 year old daughter had the salmon baby bento which was a very a good portion. The salmon was cooked just right. Mmm. I took a bite of it and couldn't stop. She was not very happy about that. lol.  

I must admit when I was walking in to the place, I was concerned because it didn't seem very kid-friendly. But after sitting down and seeing other families around me and the kids menu, I would definitely take my daughter back. The ambience and food was perfect! I love my town!
