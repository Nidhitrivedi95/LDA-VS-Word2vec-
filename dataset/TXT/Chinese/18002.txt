4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A I am here tonight for the 10pm late night special ($14.99).  They also have Beef menu for $16.99 and Seafood menu for $18.99.

The food selection here is wonderful.  Much bigger than most hot pot places.  It does not have my favourite - quail eggs, but includes unlimited drinks (plum juice, ice tea) and rice pot (spare rib, sticky rice, pork patty on rice).  They also have handmade beef/pork/fish balls.  The soup base is the usual with optional specialty soup base for extra $$.

The service is virtually non-existant.  Not sure if it is because it's after 10pm or maybe because our table is hidden from view.

Great place to try if you're looking for a large selection of hot pot menu items.  Will return with a bigger crowd to try out the rest of the items.
