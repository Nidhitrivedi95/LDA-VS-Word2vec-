OUB81Dpb6m7HjW4ZmeSlmw Stay away!!!! We came here for lunch after having a positive experience at their leslieville location. First of all, the place is a dive. It's tiny and dirty. Secondly, the food was inedible. The two guys behind the counter seemed frazzled and lost. They couldn't answer any questions about the food. They forgot to give us our complete order, but we asked for a refund on the forgotten items because what they had given us was so bad. 

Pork belly boa - flavour was ok but texture was horrible.

Braised beef boa - I took a bite and had to spit it out. Tough meat with a big hunk of fat. It tasted like it hadn't been cooked for long enough, and also had no seasoning. It tasted like boiled meat. Ew. 

Shrimp dumplings- had dried hard edges, and the shrimp inside was very fishy and had little crunchy bits. Tasted like it had been badly freezer burned. This I also had to spit out. 

Pork dumplings-same dried hard edges that seemed freezer burned, and the filling tasted like moth balls and pig crap. Really bad. 

Quinoa salad - this was the only thing that was remotely edible, and it tasted like mucky, sticky quinoa with hoisin dumped all over it. So still bad but we didn't have to spit it out. However we didn't take more than a bite each. 

A truly gross experience. They also had no napkins, no straws, and the entrance was blocked with a garbage can in our arrival. Stay away!!!!!!
