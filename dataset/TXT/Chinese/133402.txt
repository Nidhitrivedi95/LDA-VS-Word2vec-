pw9ErdIO1t7CWLrZwNP1fw We usually order from Red House, but on a whim we decided to try Fusion b/c I loved their variety of tofu. I got vegetarian spring rolls, crab puffs, and orange sauce w/ tofu entree. The spring rolls and crab puffs were actually pretty good. The tofu, however... The orange sauce was different, but not bad. ... And I'm not an experienced vegetarian cook, but I do know to use firm or extra firm tofu in dishes such as these... Not silken... After marinating and cooking, it was just mush in my mouth. I couldn't even finish it because of the soggy texture.
