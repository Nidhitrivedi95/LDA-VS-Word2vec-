0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ Food is amazing. I'm outside the delivery area, but it is worth the drive. They make the egg foo young wonderful (where they put everything on top and not inside) The Moo Shoo Pork is a family favorite, but they do run out at times (it's that good) Hot and sour sizzling rice soup and the sesame chicken are some other favorites. A definite family run business they make common human errors, but always correct it and are always friendly when face to face.
