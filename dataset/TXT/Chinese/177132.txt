WuQZ5iesON7NWTDWgwWlbQ Dim Sum - I enjoyed the dim sum, this is the best thing they cook here.  I would come back for this.  Traditional dishes and new dishes, all done well.  

Private Banquet (rented room for large party) - 10 course meal was average.  Some dishes had a lot of flavor (like the Curried Conch in Conch Shell) and others had little flavor (like the stir fried Lobster).  The plus is that this place is roomy and has extremely high ceilings.  If you want to feel like you're in a faux Hall of Mirrors at Palace Versailles... well, you've found your match (decorated with some serious classic and baroque euro kitsch).  

Ticketed Parties & Banquets - New Year's and Chinese Year's here is a joke.  $88 for an all you can eat buffet with live band.  You get some quality food items with substandard sauces (half a mini lobster, giant scallop with sweet potato sauce, abalone), but the sushi is crap.  The worst thing is not the food. It's the defeaning loud Canto-pop cover band that refused to play classic hits (Sinatra, Elvis, Neil Diamond) for the older crowd to dance to, but instead took up most of the time yelling Anita Mui songs.  

I wish I could say I was exaggerating about how horrible the band was.  People at all tables were covering their ears.  It was so loud that the sound system was cracking, not to mention the feedback that seemed to occur between every song.  Unfortunately, the band is regularly scheduled to play here.  Yes, I was dragged by my parents and other relatives here, but my review of the band and sound system is unbiased.  I have pictures of strangers covering their ears... maybe I should post them.  

I would come here for dim sum.  I might book Premeire for a private dinner room if it required eight tables or more (one where your parents or business clients insist on having Chinese food), but I'm sure there are better food options available elsewhere.  I would not come here for one of their hosted parties.
