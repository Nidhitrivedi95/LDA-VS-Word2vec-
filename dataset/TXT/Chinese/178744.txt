X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ I started liking Malaysian food when I was in Australia, so I've been looking for a Malaysian restaurant in Vegas. 
I decided to try this restaurant for my birthday, and I'm glad I did.

They have a lot of options on their menu, and they even have a separate picture book with the items they have. I thought this was awesome since, majority of the time, I'm unsure of what to order when trying a new place. Pictures help, big time!

I decided to order some items that I already know: Laksa, Roti & Curry (canai), Hainanese Chicken, and Beef Rendang.
We also ordered a couple other noodle dishes.

Everything was delicious. Their laksa & beef rendang tasted a little different than what I'm used to, but it's probably because I've gotten used to the Singaporean style laksa.
Nonetheless, it was still yummy and my family & I finished everything!

Prices & portion sizes are reasonable, restaurant is spacious & clean, and they even have an area with a pool table & foosball table. The manager was super nice & made sure my birthday lunch was special.

I'd definitely come back here again & try their other dishes, especially their different options for laksa.
