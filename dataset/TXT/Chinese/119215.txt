NSGFzlDGs71v43Y7a1XH0A Terrible service. We went twice but will never go again. 

What a pity, as their bbq pork and fried rice is not entirely bad. 

Just stay away from their so called burgers and wraps...you can do a better job at home. Very unprofessionally put together (wax paper wrapped, looks like cheap takeout on a plate), had extremely stingy amount of filling, and lacks visual interest. Bun and tortilla were stale, and you can tell even after they toasted it. 

Service was lacking on our first weekend visit, but the bubble tea was good. So we went back for a weekday lunch, as I was craving bubble tea. No one was available to take our order for the longest time, especially when the lunch takeout customers came in. We should have got up and left, like some other people did who were fed up waiting. 

Lunch special includes tea. But they had no bubble tea yet! So we ordered Hong Kong style tea. But they didn't have that either!!! What's the point of this lunch special then, that costs $1.50 more than their a la carte menu? Their excuse was their tea person was not in yet. They gave us simple seaweed soup instead. $9.99 for chicken fried rice and a small bowl of crappy soup in this kind of setting is not worth it. 

It was dead quiet when everyone left, but us. For the entire time at both our visits, there wasn't even background music to fill the void.
