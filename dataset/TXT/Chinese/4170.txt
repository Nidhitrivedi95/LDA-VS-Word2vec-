_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg Many of my Chinese recommended me this place, but I didn't like it. They use too much MSG, and spices are too strong. It's ok to use spices if food tastes good, but all of our food were horrible. My Chinese friend who went to this place with me also didn't like this restaurant. We won't be coming back this place.
