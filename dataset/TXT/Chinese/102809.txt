kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA Went here with a group. I called and made reservations and the person on the phone was friendly and accommodating even when I had to call back and up the number of people in our party. The ambiance was nice (dark, would be good for a date night) and the food was good - definitely not authentic Chinese but delicious nonetheless.
