t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA Before I get into the food, I have to say that one of the _greatest_ things about eating here (or getting things delivered/to go) is the service.  Talk about bend over backwards!  You want them to do Princess Chicken with sliced carrots and a side of sauce?  You got it!  You want your fried noodles with a side of pea shoots and baby won-tons?  You got it!  Okay, wait... that last one I might be making up, but the first, dude... I get it every time!

Alls I'm saying is-- these people will do everything to make your order, NAY, your EXPERIENCE something awesome.  And that's a restaurant I can get behind!

The food is excellent.  Rice is the perfect consistency (not too dry, but not wet, either).  Their sauces are incredible (try the Princess for a spicy kick, or the Empress for something a little spicy-sweet).  Their veg is even good in my book, diced or sliced thin, not overbearing!  Everything is just hot, and yummy, and delicious and my favorite, not too hard on the wallet.

Golden Harbor is located in the old Pickles location (trust me, a Champaign paragon in its day), so it's pretty much central to Champaign, Urbana, AND Savoy. Tell them where you're coming from when you order and they'll make sure the food is separated out in containers that keep things from getting soggy on the way. 

Whether you choose to eat in (now that they have the ventilation under control) or decide to carry-out, Golden Harbor Authentic is one of the best Chinese places you can choose in C-U.
