mwO4cm8qs32djjve5ni_Vg This is the second Chop Chop in Edinburgh (the original is at Haymarket) and it is a good option if you fancy something different to a usual 'Lemon Chicken / Sweet and Sour' chinese.
There are a wide variety of options but really you have to go for some of the dumplings as that is what they are known for. There is also the option of a banquet for which you get a selection of some of their best dishes and unlimited re-orders. Drinks are reasonably priced for a restaurant with bottles of beer for around £2.50 and you can BYOB although corkage is now £5.
Service has always been fast when we have visited and I like the fact that you can book online on their website. They also have a loyalty card which soon stacks up points for money off repeat visits and you also receive vouchers on your birthday.
