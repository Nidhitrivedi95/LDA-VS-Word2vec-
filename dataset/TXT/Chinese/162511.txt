There isn't much to the menu but what they do, they do extremely well.  Noodle soup is their speciality with some variations to what you can get in it.  Not being red meat or pork eaters we went for the veggie (chicken wasn't an option nor was shrimp).  Noodles were excellent.  It is very cool being able to watch how they are made.  The broth was very well seasoned and the veggies were perfectly cooked.  We ordered a large and a small since we were not completely sure how filling it will be.  Well we finished it all but could have gone with one large bowl for the three of us.  Definitely a great choice for our early afternoon option.
