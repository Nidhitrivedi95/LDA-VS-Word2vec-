966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA Food was below average and the service was okay. Ordered popcorn chicken, wonton egg noodle soup and soup dumplings.

Popcorn chicken was terrible, very dry and burnt. $4.50 was not too bad but I was not expecting a whole bowl of "leftover" chicken edges. I am a Taiwanese and I know what popcorn chicken should taste like!

Soup dumplings were sticked altogether, some were broken by the time it was arrived to our table. Thick skin and barely any juice. Meat were also very mushy. Not good at all.

Wonton egg noodle soup was average. The broth was good but the wonton wasn't great. Egg noodle was too thin and some parts were raw.

The service was very unorganized. Four waiters came by our table to ask if we needed anything after we told one of the waitress we needed a box app 10 minutes before.
