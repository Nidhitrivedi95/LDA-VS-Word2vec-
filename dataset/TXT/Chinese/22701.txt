6OhahrmtLGmkUdPfaMck0A Bad service, bad food. Every single thing we ordered, apart from the XLB, was below average. We had notified server that the chicken was too way too fatty and dry on the inside - she said that was normal and it's supposed to be like that... Very interesting response lol. Not sure why this place is popular.. there are way better restaurants who serve better XLB with better menu items.
