nV8mDMin6c964MgjK6JZgg First family dinner of our vacation. Nine adults and three toddlers. We ordered a set dinner and added a dish. Because they didn't have the whole fish in stock, we opted to substitute in a couple of other fish dishes. 

Service was fantastic and the food was very good. They were right when they said we wouldn't be able to finish it all. Had our other brother joined us, we would have been fine. But alas, there was an abundant amount of leftovers. The last dish was Noodles and Dumplings in Soup. We had no room for it on the table and everyone was stuffed so we asked them to box it up for us. They were kind enough to place the noodles and dumplings in separate containers. Guess who had it for breakfast over the next two mornings? 

I'm not going to rate each dish individually here. There were so many and all of them were very good. The name of this restaurant, Congee Town, sells it short. They have much more than Congee here. We recommend coming here with a large group so you can order lots of food and enjoy many different flavors!
