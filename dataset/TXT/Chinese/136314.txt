qgEKyJfuL5LBA6D3V9nR9g yeah, ok.  very small portions.  tons of waiting staff on hand.  open kitchen is nice.  they even gave my daughter some dough to play with when we went up to their window.  we had some dumplings and the skin was very thin with lots of proportionate filling.  we also had some noodles in soup with some beef.  the noodles were pretty good.  hand made, you can tell.  i just thought that you did not get a lot of food on your plate for the price you pay.  the food is pretty darn good.  nothing frozen, freshly made.
