OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA I'd like to give King's Noodle 3.75 stars, but can't quite justify rounding it up to 4 stars. Store front may fool you because lots of various barbequed and roasted items hang in the window to entice passerby and to being nostalgia for my younger days of going to Chinatown in LA with my grandmother. But once you walk in, the decor is rather modern and the dining area is pretty clean and orderly (can't say the same for the bathrooms). Since this was a mid-afternoon/pre-dinner snack, the hubby and I split a bowl of wonton egg noodle soup with roasted duck and barbequed pork, YUM. The broth is delicious, full, and had just the right amount of fat content that kept it from going over the side of "greasy." For a special treat, we also ordered the shrimp rice rolls with special soyo sauce. Yummmmmmm, I was craving this for days while I was visiting Toronto, but unfortunately did not get to relive this bit of glory. Some of the meats can be pretty fatty; I know some people enjoy that. Eat with lots of water: the MSG digests more easily with liquids.
