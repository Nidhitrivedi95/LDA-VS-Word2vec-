pvjPOBfYF2QbkqNY3xHC-A We tried this place tonight for the first time. We weren't expecting fine dining. I will say we both thought the won ton soup was too salty. The crab puffs were good but the egg rolls a bit small and not that tasty. My sweet and sour chicken was ok but the chicken was overwhelmed by the bread coating. My husband's sesame chicken was better. The portions were generous so having leftovers increases the $ value of the food. I easily have enough for lunch tmw. Service was prompt and pleasant and all in all an adequate meal. Inexpensive too. I can see us going back again.
