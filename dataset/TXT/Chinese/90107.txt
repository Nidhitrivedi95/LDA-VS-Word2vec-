idQuN4Kxl0UO-6LQtrq2eQ I was leery of another Asian buffet as Hibachi Grill is right up the road and I don't like it at all. I was very pleasantly surprised by Tropicana buffet it is new so it's very clean. They have everything from a salad bar with traditional Chinese buffet items, fresh made sushi, a soup station, making your favorite Vietnamese soup and a Hibachi station, which is what I ate, I got to pick all my favorites and have it grilled right in front on me. I would definitely say as with any buffet go at lunch or dinner busier times so the food will always be fresh and I'm pretty sure you can find whatever you want to feast on. Also don't let the outside fool you, it is very nice inside!
