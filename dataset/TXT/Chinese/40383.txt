B19KKE75ZxqoR3EDuvA1qw Me and my kids were looking for a new place to eat we were hungry and on the area... We decided to stop n try china star we honestly thought it was going to be bad we didn't have high expectations... We stopped by around 2pm we had the lunch special for $5.99 and for kids is like $3.75 or so... To be honest this place looked kinda old but the food is Fabulous!! Oh god we ate so much!!! We couldn't stop eating and our bill was only like $15 I was shocked!!! I left $5 tip and my bill was still like 20$ for good food! I'll come back again! Great place if you have a large family!!
