uxSL4FHWiO-fr2iae_d3Bw Great food and great service! Justine always takes great care of us, and food always comes out within 30 minutes. Only once did the food take almost an hour but that was when the restaurant was literally filled to capacity (understandable). We will always come back and we will always ask for Justine!
