cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ I rarely frequent buffets because I find I get full too quickly...but this one is definitely one of the better ones. I had two plates of food and a few desserts. The prime rib, sausages (same as they have at Korean Grill House) and Peking duck were my faves. I broke my diet just to eat the duck with the wrap. I only had 3 of those and regret wasting precious stomach space on anything else. The skin of the duck was so crispy & delicious. The prime rib was medium-rare, just the way I like it. I threw in a couple of other random items on my plates, but nothing worth mentioning. There was no more creme brulee when it came time for dessert. I ate the sugar free cheesecake, flan, tiramisu, mango and vanilla ice cream. Nothing spectacular, but it satisfied my sweet tooth. The servers were attentive when it came to collecting plates and refilling our waters. They were also really friendly, which I always appreciate. I gave this place 3 stars because the food was good but only with a few standout items - also, because the bathrooms were disgusting. There was only one decent stall to use out of 5 or 6. Not sure how often they are cleaned, but they should make a better habit of checking on them. Dinner on the weeknights is 26.99 for adults. It seems like a fair price, but in my case, I probably won't eat at this type of buffet again, simply because I never eat my money's worth.
