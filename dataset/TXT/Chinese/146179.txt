S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A I was in town from L.A. visiting family and friends for the holidays and thought I'd try this place out. What a disappointment, the noodles were rubbery and the potstickers sucked. The only thing good was the broth. I'm pretty sure there are some good items to eat but my order was a disappointment. The service wasn't very good too.
