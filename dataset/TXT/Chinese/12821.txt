2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg OMG EXACTLY what i've been craving!! we heard raves about the chinatown here in toronto (if you've been to chinatowns in SF, NYC, or LA you'll be underwhelmed) and so decided to park, walk around, and eat at the busiest dinner spot in the area. raised by my cantonese dad, i have specific criteria that i look for when i crave wonton noodle soup, specifically bbq ducks and fresh noodles in the window! while asian legend (a block down also on dundas) has lots of  "awards" on their window and quite a few people (some chinese even) dining there, prices were a little more expensive and the atmosphere wasn't like the family style spots i was raised on. 

house of gourmet, on the other hand, was perfect. lots of cantonese people chatting loudly, a butcher chopping away at fresh duck and pork, fast service and surprisingly servers that can speak english! i got my shrimp wonton noodle soup for $3.99 and they aren't joking about the shrimp - the wontons were huge and basically stuffed solely with about 4 large shrimp and just a hint of extra stuffing. the noodles were chewy but a little more broken than i'm used to and the soup was sweet. forrest y ordered the sizzling beef and chicken satay for $9.99 and the portions were certainly generous! he had a large platter of tender beef, tasty chicken, bell peppers, pineapple, and onions immersed in delicious satay sauce. i think they charge rice extra per bowl but we didn't want to waste precious stomach space and left stuffed!

lots of locals but also some non-chinese tourists in the mix - i'd definitely come back here!
