X4CRPHvv-33kjxVJISZpUg I don't understand why my classmates love coming to this place.  It's cheap Chinese food that is not good.  Their beef is kinda funny in texture/taste.  Their General Tso's chicken is soggy and super fat and has an iron taste to it.  Place is kinda stuffy.

If it weren't for my classmates, I would not visit this place.
