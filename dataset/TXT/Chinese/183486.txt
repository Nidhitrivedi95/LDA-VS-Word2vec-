XPtDU14nu36LWt7_UagI9Q Came here based on previous reviewers.  The dim sum is mostly $2/dish but the proportions are small.  There was hardly any shrimp paste in the stuffed tofu and eggplant dishes,  ha gow were nicely made but, again, a little skimpy in the filling. The decor and cleanliness,as everyone had pointed out, is bad and a bit of a turn off.  Overall, I would say if you want cheap,decent, and fast dim sum, this is ok, but you are trying to impress a date or new friends, I would try somewhere else.
