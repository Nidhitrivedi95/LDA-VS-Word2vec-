jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg When I visit Vegas, I usually eat at China town instead of fancy restaurants on the strip. Saw this place a few month ago, and I decided to give it a try since it was so cold. 
There was only one lady serving tables. She was friendly but really really loud. I didn't like to hear her shouting while I was eating. 
I ordered the beef tendon and daikon pot. The soup just tasted like standard beef noodle soup, nothing special. There were not much ingredients in the pot, only tendons, daikon, cabbage, tofu and mushroom. For the price $12.99 , I expected more kinds of ingredients like fish cakes. 
I also tried some of my friends hot pots, fish head pot and chicken herb pot. For chicken pot I was expecting clear chicken broth, but it was not. I guess all of their soups are on the stronger heavier side, which I don't mind if im in the mood. But its just not special at all! 
Also, they only let you add soup once. They will charge you from the second time. And the lady only added about a tea cup amount of soup when I asked. Wouldn't recommend to people who like to eat a lot of soup. 

Wont be coming back.
