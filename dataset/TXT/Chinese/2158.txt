-YWr1wm_NaAlgEf9TZzsMQ It supposed to be cheap and quick. My fish heads were tender and well seasoned. Service was courteous and prompt. Quit your hating' on the place. People are really too hard on this place in these reviews. It's not Ping Pang Pong or somewhere. But the food is good and the soups were very good. I'll go back for sure.
