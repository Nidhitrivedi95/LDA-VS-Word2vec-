BQIscJNv1rNEZpV9S7Z_tQ Woke up this morning craving some Chinese & Boba Thai tea, So I decided to do some research on good Asian restaurants that were in the area, When I came across "Noodle ChaCha" Which had JUST opened, So I thought why not? It Never hurts to try new things . Not only did this place have excellent service, with welcoming smiles & On point manners, But most importantly the food was delicious! I had ordered pineapple fried rice, pad Thai with gyoza as the appetizer, & Of course Thai tea with extra Boba! & I'm in love, Definitely added to my list of favorite food places to go . (:
