zfiSQ1dl3vTJ-og96eqXGA We ordered Wonton Soup, Crab Angels, Chicken Fried rice, Fried dumplings, and Chicken Lo Mein. When the food got to us it was super hot which was nice but we were missing the Chicken Lo Mein. That being said the food didn't blow us away it was good just not AMAZING. Food was also rather expensive, especially to be missing a whole dish. Probably going somewhere else next time
