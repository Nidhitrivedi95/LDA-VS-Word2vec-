rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg First time here for lunch with a friend.  I got the pad Thai on the lunch special.   VERY TASTY!!!  Good portions, fast and good service.   My friend got the chicken and snow peas on the lunch menu as well.  It needed some kick and the chili sauce did the trick.
I will definitely be back!
