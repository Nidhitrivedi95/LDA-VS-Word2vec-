bFBV-rYwr6qKT7u0ovZhQg This is one of those great places where you can get something quick and healthy at the same time.  My biggest beef is with the lack of veggies!  When you order an Asian noddle dish, of course the main part is noodles but can you please make it with more than two mushrooms, two pieces of broccoli and 3 little slivers of carrot????

I like my veggies and I think it is extremely dissatisfying to order a meal and have it look like we had a major loss in our vegetable crops and they are being rationed out to last the winter.  When you pay $30 bucks for two people to eat a bowl of noddles you should get more than noodles (they cost way less we get it), however I just forked out $15/person and expect to see some veggies darn it!!!
