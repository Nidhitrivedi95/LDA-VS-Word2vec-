ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ First time in Phoenix. Enjoyed a relaxing night on Koi's patio- both great ambiance and awesome food. 

Vegetarian friendly menu- one of the best things we had was the crudite with tzatziki sauce. Fresh, crisp vegetables was a nice start to our meal. 

Definitely try the pork buns!!

Cocktails are on point.
