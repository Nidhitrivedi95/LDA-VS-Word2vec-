x8O-Mll5ksDpeIgtA0XY-w This place was "OK." It was pretty busy when we went so the food was turning over quickly, which by reading the other reviews was a good thing. I was really afraid I was going to get sick  off this place. Thankfully I didn't get sick, but I definitely wasn't raving it was the best food either. 

I got a couple plates- chow mein, fried rice, chicken on a stick (i really dont know what it was called), a few other things... and everything was average. The sushi was better than grocery sushi, but still a largely noticeable difference to an actual sushi restaurant. Plus one of the rolls was warm when I bit into it, instant fear and regret set over me. I'd like to thank my stomach of steel for saving me from that one. I got a plate of crab legs, saying to my friend "you can't screw up crab legs." But I was wrong. Don't get me wrong, the taste was fine... but just about every other piece I cracked open didn't have any meat in it! Crab legs are not easy to open so I was definitely not happy about that. The best tasting thing I had was the baked bananas, those were delicious.

The dessert was average... below actually. I got this little cake with pink frosting on top. No real flavor to it. What I think was ambrosia... but it was nothing but marshmallows (isn't it supposed to have fruit?), and a soft serve. The texture was... off, but the taste was ok. 

We didn't have any problems with the service. The lady was nice and after getting our drinks pretty much left us alone. Considering it cost about $15 to eat here at dinner time, I won't be back. For $15 I could've got a MUCH better meal elsewhere and not had to fear for my life.
