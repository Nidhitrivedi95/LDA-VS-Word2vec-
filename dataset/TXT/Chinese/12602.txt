2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg Great food, great service.  I highly recommend this place - really takes me back to my childhood.  And the prices!  You can't beat the prices:

$11 gets you:
- toast with eggs & sausage
- toast with eggs & bacon
- roast pork with macaroni
- iced Horlick (malt drink)

$12 gets you:
- beef brisket & egg noodles soup
- beef brisket, shrimp wonton & egg noodles soup
- iced Ovaltine

The portions are big - I could have shared and still be full (but if you know me, I don't share). ;p

If I lived in the area, I would go there every day.
