OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Food was just "OKAY" in my book. I must admit, it was cheap though, $21 for 8 dim sum dishes. Service was great! We went on a Wednesday during lunch at 11:30am. Got a seat in 2 mins. We had the same cart go around us 3 times! So we ordered and received our food very quickly. Nothing to rave about the dim sum though. It was partially cold when we got to the table.

We ordered:

Chicken Feet
Har Gow
Siu Mai
Fried Taro
Beef Rice Noodle Roll
Ham Sui Gor
Fried Shrimp Wonton
Shrimp and Chive Dumpling

Tip: If you order hot tea it's $0.50/pp but if you order chrysanthenum it's $1.00/pp.
