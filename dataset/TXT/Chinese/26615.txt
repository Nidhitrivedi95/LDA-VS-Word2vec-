7U73RqIg6JA0WThxWUV3uA New favorite Chinese delivery!!!! We had beef xinjlang spice noodles, and the combo fried rice, both of which were great, and very fresh! My favorites were definitely the pork and shrimp shumai, and the handmade dumplings! I got sashimi too, which is always questionable when it comes to delivery, but it was all very good too. We plan to go to the restaurant to dine. As far as delivery goes, we'll be working our way through the whole menu!
