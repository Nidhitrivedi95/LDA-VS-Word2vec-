ygJshif4VuxL1ijnRJnuYA Got there at exactly 4 p.m., opening time, on Saturday, Jan. 24, 2015.  First ones in the place!  Ordered ribs, fried rice, tofu and veggies, chicken and pineapple, chicken in black bean sauce.  Ribs came first, after about a 10-minute wait.  They were tasty.  Then came the tofu dish after another 10-minute wait.  Tasted okay, but not great. A bit over-salted.  By this time there were three other tables occupied in the restaurant so no reason for the time delay in getting the majority of dishes to our table.  After another 10-minute wait came the fried rice.  Again okay, but nothing special.  Another 5-minute wait for the pineapple chicken.  This dish was luke-warm at best, but tasty.  Then after another 10-minute wait came the chicken in black bean sauce.  This was very tasty, but a tad over-salted.  In conclusion, the service was terrible, the food was just okay, and the over-salting of some of the dishes was disappointing.   Would not come back here, and would certainly not recommend this place to anyone.
