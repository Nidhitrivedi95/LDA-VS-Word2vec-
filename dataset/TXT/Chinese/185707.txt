Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw Service has always been excellent. 
Really fast. 
Great Portions. 
One of my absolute favorite Chinese places. 
Amazing Egg Rolls. They are actual Egg Rolls not Spring Rolls. (They have those too) 
Love their Pork Fried Rice! 
Their soups are really good not oily. I'm mildly obsessed with the egg drop and hot and sour. 
One of the great things about take out is that they package everything correctly. No spills 
I only wish they delivered!
