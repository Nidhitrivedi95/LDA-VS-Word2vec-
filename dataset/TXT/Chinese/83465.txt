hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA Solid buffet. All your usual Chinese favs. I particularly liked the Sushi (they have alot of different kinds) and their baked seafood dish. This was lunch so no crab, etc. Their honey chicken was also really good, not covered in batter and sort of light. The service is also really good, they clean plates and re-fill drinks right like ninjas (so stealth you wonder was it aliens who did it).
