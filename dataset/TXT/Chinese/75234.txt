FvwB6cSrkfIlfZFlhKwd6w Great ambiance, never too many people, and the food is usually great. Be waru, sometimes battered chicken (general tao, lemon chicken, etc...) Will be over battered and overcooked. Soups, rolls, and noodles always great. 

The staff is very nice, service is fast, takeout is free. There are some tables and chairs stacked near the entrance, bit of an eyesore but the place is lit so dark you won't even notice.

I was nervous my first time because the sign looks a bit dated, as does the decor. However the food is great and reasonably priced.
