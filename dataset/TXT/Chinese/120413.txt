O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw This restaurant is good for quick meal.

Each DIM SUM is very cheap, so you can try variety of menu if you are more than 2 people.

always quick serve and very hot.
however, nothing special, not bad but also I was not able to find out my own best DIM SUM menu. (Of course I have not eaten all menu yet.)

Table are not crowded together like other Chinese restaurant.
It is interesting to note that, table covers are just white plastic sheets which are layered many over. but actually its very practical way because I hate greasy and stinky restaurant table.
