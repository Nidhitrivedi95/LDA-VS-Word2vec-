-RmFfWUyUU1RPIGtih7J-w I Yelped some Chinese food in Henderson near my job and Grand China popped up with some good reviews.  The lunch specials were mentioned a lot, so I ventured over to give it a whirl.  For a Monday at 11:30am, the place was empty except for myself and two gentlemen whom I recognized as employees of the city, too.  I quickly decided on the Cashew Shrimp lunch special for $6.95, which included a drink, soup, and the entree.  The egg drop soup that I chose was served quickly and piping hot.  Minutes later, my entree arrived and this is when the Yelper in me kicked in because I started counting how many shrimp I got: four.  They weren't tiny, but they weren't huge, either.  There were lots of vegetables to go with the shrimp and also a side of plain fried rice; I should have asked for white rice if I was thinking about it.  All in all, it was a decent meal for the price, plus the place is clean and service is fast.
