ZN8EHmoe4Xjy4q4Y8ROEfw Stopped here on the way back from the zoo during rush hour. They've decorated the place in whites and bamboo green. Enjoyed the pho. Wife had a salad, and daughter loved her teriyaki chicken. The boba were tasty. The decor and calming music hit the spot. The gentleman who waited on us was extremely friendly, and the food came out very quickly.
