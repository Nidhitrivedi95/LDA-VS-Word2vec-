ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ I don't really enjoy buffets but can say dragon legend legend is great and is definitely worth a visit. I came here for lunch numerous times, and have always walked away happy (and full!). 

As others have noted, the Peking duck, sashimi, and hand pulled noodles were all fantastic. There was rarely an issue with things running out. I was actually surprised how good those noodles were, they were chewy and delicious. Try for the fish broth, which is much better than the spicy beef broth, and add everything - dumplings, BBQ pork, and some beef slices with coriander and green onion! I'm not afraid to admit the sushi was actually pretty good and was really impressed because general Buffet places serve typically poor sushi.

There is great selection of items and there is something for everyone. The dim sum was passable and the grill items were grilled well. The quality stands out here, I didn't eat anything that tasted bad. Great variety of fruits and ice cream cap off a fantastic meal. 

We did come here with a large group and the service was great. Plates were taken away and our tea was refilled often. 

I just have to comment about those high chairs, they are so bizarre, do not hang your coats on them!
