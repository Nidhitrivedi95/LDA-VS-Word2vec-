I-mDBT0rs1ReKpyO4t0ciA Came here for dinner with my family as table of 12. When we got here, they hadn't set up the table although my grandparents and aunt had already sat down. They forced 12 of us to squish into an 8-10 person table. We asked for the menu to order some vegetarian dishes for my grandparents and they just gave us the set menu. All the staff gave us so much attitude when we wanted to order. Took 4 of them to put in our add on. A lot of our dishes were dirty with crusted food on bowls, plates and tea cups. They didn't even bother looking at them when they were distributing on the spot. When they found a bowl that was dirty, immediately rinsed it with the teapot on the table and poured the dirty water out in our bowls on the table

The food that came was almost all lukewarm and cooled down within 5 minutes. They weren't attentive to what we had or didn't at the table. We needed vinegar and pepper for soup but they didn't give us either. We asked for it and finished our soup in that time. They even gave us 2 forks for a plate of fried rice. The people bringing out the dishes also don't know what they're bringing out and tried to force a dish on us and pretended it was something else. We proceeded to wait over an hour and a half for one dish from our set meal to come out and asked for it over 6 times. Ended up cancelling one of the add ons. The service is worse than most Chinese restaurants. 

Do not recommend this chaotic place with cold food, dirty dishes, worse than usual service.
