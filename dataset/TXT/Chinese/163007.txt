UpbTdzW9OoVrnbpHyxnMWg This is the best Chinese buffet I have ever been to.  I'm from DC and came up a couple years ago.  We checked out this restaurant while in town.  OMG!  the sushi I would give 4 stars but their desserts were so good and so tiny and cute.  I loved their fried shrimp on a stick.  Awesome!
