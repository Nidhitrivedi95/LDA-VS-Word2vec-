Cine is a nice new minimalistic modern looking ayce hotpot restaurant with spacious semi communal tables that forces you to share it with other costumers if you come in with small group. It can make you feel uncomfortable about sharing table with others. I wish they have some sort of thin heavy table divider to actually divide the table to prevent mixing ingredients with other  group's order.

They have good selection of broths available. My personal favorite broths are black chicken broth and sichuan style spicy broth. They are not as authentic as I wish to be but it's perfect for ppl who are new to hotpot. 

Unfortunately they do not offer Yin Yang style hotpot. So you will have to order two separate broths if you want two different kinds. On the other hand, their individual pot is pretty deep so it allows you to enjoy your hotpot without constantly bothering servers for more broth.

They have all the standard ingredients available on the menu and they are pretty fresh. Their New Zealand lamb was definitely the best quality one that I had from hotpot places.

Big plus for make your own dipping sauce station and relatively fast service.

I will definitely go back when I'm in dt and crave hotpot.
