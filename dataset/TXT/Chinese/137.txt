-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg I read some of the other reviews, and I gather the major complaint is that this restaurant does not have good pho or not as good as some other restaurants.  Well, I did not order the pho, but ordered the vegetarian spring roll over rice vermicelli instead, and it was pretty awesome.  The dish is a cold dish, which was to my surprise.  There was radishes, carrots, cucumbers, and crushed peanuts.  The sauce was the key to the dish.  I dumped the entire mini-bowl of sauce and mixed it up.  Oh yummmmmmmm it was.  It's a perfect dish to eat in the summer time when it's super hot outside.  The dish was refreshing, light, and tasty!  Too bad I'm leaving Cleveland tomorrow or else I may drop by to have it again :)

Service was descent.  They sat us down quickly, and in a blink of an eye our dish was placed in front of us.  The servers were pretty friendly, and I didn't have any problems with them.  We got in early around 11:30am; however, by noon, it was packed full and a line was forming.  Go early!
