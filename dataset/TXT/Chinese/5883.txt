0DarxWxf-Cv0WT_EEWsM9w Even though peking is convenient for me, i would still probably go out of my way to get some of their take-out. I know when you walk in to peking you will be drawn towards the General tso chicken...however, I STRONGLY ADVISE that you fight that urge to order, even though there is nothing wrong with the generals chicken (it is actually quite good, i get it extra spicy) you must order their PORK FRIED RICE. easily some of the best pork fried rice I've ever had. Its not greasy, just full flavor, its made perfectly. i cant stress the quality of their rice enough!

Furthermore i usually get shrimp lo mein, friend dumplings and wonton soup....oh yea the wontons are incredible. at just $2.70 for a quart, you can be your bottom dollar that I add one of those bad boys on to every order that i make.

I don't drink the stuff but after $15 you get a free 2 liter. even if you are under $15 and ask. they sometimes just give it to you. Awesome place always friendly. Chow down west end.
