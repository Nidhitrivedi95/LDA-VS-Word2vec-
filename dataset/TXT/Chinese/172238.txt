W_nU2qtu1AEDDCgkCo0gJg We go here about twice a month and enjoy the casual atmosphere with good food.  Portion sizes are good and they have a lot of combos that comes with drinks.  One of my favour is the Malaysian curry - you can order it as a entree for a little more $ and the portion is a lot bigger than if you were to order it with the rice.  The naan bread is FANTASTIC, we order extra ones just to eat, butterly though but good!
