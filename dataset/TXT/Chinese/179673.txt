X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg this place has a great list of DJs and famous people coming through it but this place is trash. Strict dress code? guys in t-shirts and sneakers(I seen a girl with a fanny pack for fucks sake). We went on a night they had 3 floors blocked off, so we listened to house/trance music the whole time(not my first choice) it would have been okay if they actually had a place to dance. The whole club is just vip area and the dance floor the size of my bathroom, by 11:15 you could barely fist pump without hitting 2 people. The drink I got was a rail mixed drink, with the ice it was maybe 4 ounces and it cost 23$. This place is just a money trap. So many clubs in Vegas, I would never do it again.
