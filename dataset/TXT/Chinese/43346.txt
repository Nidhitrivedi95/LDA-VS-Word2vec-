bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog Came here with a few friends on a weeknight. I'd give the food (4.5 stars) but the service was (2.5 stars). 

chengdu zajiang noodles with soup (4.5 stars)- this dish was not spicy with ground pork and thin noodles. We were informed that if we wanted more noodles we could get them free of charge. Dish was pretty flavorful and included some veggies as well. 

hot and sour chaoshou (3.5 stars)- same spicy soup as the hot and sour noodle soup dish. This was good with some spiciness to the dish, but if you order the hot and sour soup I wouldn't order this dish due to the same flavors. 

Chili oil chaoshou (4.5 stars)- we liked this dish better chili sauce at the bottom you mix the dumplings in. 

Service (2.5 stars)- we asked for a re-fill on the mung bean tea and were told to "hold on." The server never came back and re-filled the tea. Also took a long time to order dessert. We had to flag down the server and shout across the room to get their attention. 

I would come here again for the food but the service wasn't that great.
