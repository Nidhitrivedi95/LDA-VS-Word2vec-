kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A My husband and I went for lunch, the staff was super nice. He ordered the spicy noodle soup (realllly spicy) and I got the hot chicken chow mein. .. both were amazing!!!!! ...w3 also got chicken dumplings which were pretty good. We will for sure go back, I'm pumped to try the other menu items.
