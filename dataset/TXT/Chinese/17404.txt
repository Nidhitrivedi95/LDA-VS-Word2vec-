4sn2a0QzxTmAO3-mxi1s7g All I can do is compare this place to Seinfeld's Soup Nazi. We just moved in to the area and wanted to get some good Chinese food for the family. I looked on line and found the menu for Asian Grill. They had the typical specials by number. So I ordered by number. when I got the food home I unpacked it and my two Mongolian beefs were Mongolian chicken. I called to complain about the mixed up and was told by the young lady that she repeated the order and I accepted it. I reiterated that I ordered by number so the mistake could not have been mine. I went in a short time later and talked to the owner and explained the situation. Not sure if he understood everything I was saying but the other gals standing there sure did. I told him I didn't want any free food, I just wanted him to understand that she should not have argued with a customer. I ate here two times since then without incident. Good food Good service. Tonight my wife decided she wanted Chinese so I called to ask if they had Peanut Chicken. I was having a hard time hearing the gal on the other line so I said I would call back. I tried to call several time but every time I dialed they picked up and hung up. I thought they were having phone trouble. My wife dialed from her phone and they explained that we were no longer welcome there. My wife chuckled and asked why? The young girl stated that it was because of "what happened at my last visit". As I mentioned we had been there two times since the bad experience. I explained this to the gal and she said that they no longer could service us....NO SOUP FOR YOU!!!...lol What kind of nut ball operates a business like this? THUMBS DOWN for Asian Grill....Plenty of other great Chinese restaurants out there folks...I'll make sure I let everyone I know about how you treat people.
