Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA I'm normally a fan of PF Changs but this experience was not good at all!  I wanted to take my mother since she had never been.  I always bring home food for her to try.  This was not what I hoped her first PF Changs experience would be! 

The beef with broccoli was over cooked, and when we asked about it we were told that's how it's ALWAYS made.  The Mongolian Beef was over cooked as well.  I had a cup of wonton soup...lets face it you can't really mess that up!

Overall the service was less than stellar,the waitress was a bit rude. When the manager came over to speak with us we were asked had we ever been to PF Changs? I asked why he wanted to know he said because we were asking about the food and explained to me how PF Changs is not a "typical" Chinese restaurant.  I explained to him I was a regular at my local location and have NEVER had beef cooked to the point it was basically beef jerky, nor had I ever been treated like that in a restaurant.  

I will continue to frequent the PF Changs in the PH hotel/casino, but will NOT go back to this location!
