uz77ng57t-sFnEjKbTAPrQ I've been here like 3 times, and of everything i've tried, one dish has stood out to me. The 5 spice salt & pepper calamari appetizer! Surprisingly light, i felt NO guilt eating these fried gifts of the food God. I want to try others, but just can't pass up these things!

I've also had the Chili Lime Beef Salad which was perhaps too strong in flavor after having the Calamari. The Crispy Fried Whole Stripe Bass is a little intimidating when it gets to your table. It's literally a whole bass, who is fried stiff, posed as if he was swimming on a hoisin ratatouille pond on your dish.  Even though everyone had a good laugh at my new pal, I was pleased with the order. While the fish looks huge, it didn't feel like it... he was friendly to my belly.
