I love trying new items and this time we tried the fried chicken's feet and the seaweed salad. Both were something new and different for our entire table. Favorite item this time was the duck. It was tender and flavorful, almost like a dessert. Everything was good, and the service is stellar. Prices can't be beat. We ate and ate and ate and our bill was about $15 per person. Yum.
