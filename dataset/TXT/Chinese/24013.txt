6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ they have variety of appetizers, Pho, and huge selection of boba tea. I had the lamb, cabbage, carrot dumpling. figured since their name had dumpling in it that's what they'd specialize in. it was around $10. Very average. Nothing special. Not worth the price. also had the Thai tea and that wasn't too bad. however, there really isn't anything that stands out about this place and I won't be coming here again or be recommending it to anybody.
