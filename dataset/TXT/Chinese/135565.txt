QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg Like I said don't care about the service we had here the biryiani is too good. But since our bad experiences we have been back many times and everything has been great. Our food has come super fast they always are super friendly when we come in and always remember what we are going to order. Must have just caught them on off days. Definitely go get the biryani I swear someone's grandma is back there making it!
