nTc-Qj_-ABZrpM9YSpJ6jA Not a fan. The chicken just was not that good to me.  Not a reason to go try for yourself.  The rice looks moist in the picture and was very dry when we received our meal.  The rice is garlic fried rice, but did not taste any garlic.  I'm not chow mein fan so I'm not even going to comment, but they did not have many choices of side to choose from. 

The young lady at counter was a little rude.  They had two different type of noodles as sides to choose from pancit bihon and pancit canton.  I was trying ask the lady what is the difference between the two and she seemed to be a little inpatient of telling the difference.  That really upset because I want to know what I'm eating and at that she never answered the question.  She just said it's  noodles.
