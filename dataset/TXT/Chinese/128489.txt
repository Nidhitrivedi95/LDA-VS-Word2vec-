PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ At first glance, you see the fast food takeout style buffet but the food was very good. They ended up having dim sum carts going around but some items you order at the buffet serving area. Once you order, they will cook your food and bring it to your table.

Some of the flavorful dishes we got was a Malaysian Chinese dishes and it was amazing. 
I loved the pancake with curry dipping sauce. It's a must!!
Defiantly going to come back again!!
