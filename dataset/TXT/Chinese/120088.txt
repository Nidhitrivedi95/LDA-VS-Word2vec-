O_9K3WhlGlXW3KFPfTo0yA I am surprised by all the less than stellar reviews.  Maybe I ordered the right dishes, as I really enjoyed the food.  

I liked the cooking here.  The Sesame Chicken was the best dish of the evening.  The flavours were layered and bold.  I figured that the chicken was marinated with five spices and pepper salt for overnight or longer.  The chicken was deep fried without batter, then was coated with sesame seeds all around.  The sesame flavour was so bold.  The flavours of 5 spices sipped all the way to the bones.  The other two entrées that we ordered were simple dishes. They both tasted flavourful.  The ingredients were fresh and of good quality.  I could see myself returning for them.

Steam Kitchen is not your Hong Kong tea cafe, nor is it a congee/noodle restaurant.  Steam Kitchen is a step up in terms of cooking skills and quality of ingredients.  Is it a high end restaurant?  No.  It is a self-respecting mid-level restaurant.  And it is priced accordingly.  Personal opinion is that the price premium is justified.
