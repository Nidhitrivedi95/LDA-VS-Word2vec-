qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA I've been here a few times.  And every time I finish ayce sushi I regret it.  Doesn't take away from this place.

Service:  amazing.  This place is so efficient with their ordering system.  Unlike other ayce sushi places they don't forget orders or if they do it's pretty rare.  And since its iPad ordering u can say we didn't get this and we ordered it and show them so there is no confusion.

Food:  average.  I feel like they got a lot more options recently with new items.  It's great for an ayce sushi place like 5 stars.  

Price:  the price is a little steep on weekends.  Perhaps go there for lunch or weekday dinner.
