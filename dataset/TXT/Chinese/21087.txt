The rice was made of a chicken broth which made it quite tasty, but the chicken wasn't anything special. For $10 a plate, I'm expecting more than 6 pieces of chicken. Although the chicken was moist, my hubby and I each ordered the # 1. So for $20 we could've ordered an ENTIRE chicken at a chinese restaurant.

The description on the menu said "pickles and mustard greens" -- to think that we were getting a side of veggies was naive. They literally served a teaspoon amount of mustard greens and 3 slices of pickles. What a joke. 

I'm not one to complain about prices... but I added 1 egg, an order of chinese sausages, and 1 order of chicken skins - all of which was $2/item. My $10 dish became a $16 dish. 

The sausage was mediocre. The ones I get at the market is better than the ones served here. The sausage was cut extremely thin and was over cooked -- extra crispy. And the skins were bland and tasteless. Would not go back. 

The chicken wings were okay... We ordered half and half. One of which was a bit on the sweeter side and the other was a bit too spicy for me. 

The Bao was the best thing on the menu - but the sauce was drenched on the chicken making the bao too salty for me. 

The green milk tea was pretty good... but not amazing. 

All and all, I do not recommend this place.
