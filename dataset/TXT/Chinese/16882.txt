My sons and I came here after reading other reviews and weren't disappointed. 
We ordered the signature pancakes -- lightly fried scallion pancakes. I way surprised they didn't come with sauce. The waitress said it wasn't necessary and she was right. 
Kids ordered the 98 Signature Noodle bowls -- one had chicken and one shrimp. Delicious and filling. As one said, he wanted to keep eating after he was full. 
I had the talapia, which was fresh and spicy. The tofu underneath was soaked in chilli sauce and, despite my mouth being on fire, I kept going for more. The waiter took it upon himself to cut my fish when I wasn't apparently eating it right. Still not sure what I did wrong, but that's ok. :)
Other things in our order: shrimp dumplings (too eggy), spring rolls (average) and tsingtao (nailed it).  They play Hits One music, which the kids liked. 
The only downside: the massive portions left us all in food comas. :)
