ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ Chatime totally hits the spot...best bbt in Toronto (I'd say). I only wished that this place existed when I went to school in downtown.
You cannot go wrong with the Roasted milk tea with grass jelly- it is known to be one of their signature items. The Brown rice milk tea is also very good as the flavour is very unique. 
One other drink that I like is the taro milk tea since it is NOT powder, but real taro. My friend introduced me to it  in the winter (hot taro milk tea) and I have totally fell in love with it!  The cold one is also a win!
I recently tried on the weekend was their mango juice, it super refreshing and I do recommend it for the summer time. The only thing I wanted to mention was that over the weekend, they ran out of tapioca and so you had to wait for it if you really wanted it. I guess in my mind, a bubble tea place should never run out of bubbles...but i still really like Chatime and this particular location!!
