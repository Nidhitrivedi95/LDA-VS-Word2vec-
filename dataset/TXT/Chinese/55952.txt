cxVp-a28Cp7lavjaPMvK5w Decor was very well done and cool. Service was also really great, with our friendly server offering food and drink pairing suggestions while never once complaining one bit about splitting the check amongst 7 people.

Food was maybe a 3/5. I wasn't impressed by any of the dishes' presentation, portion sizes, or flavors.  I ordered the Godzilla roll which was fairly large but not big enough to warrant the $17 price tag. Drinks seemed to be on the more expensive side as well, but that could be because we had a large group and split the alcohol tab. 

Past 11 pm, a smaller portion of the restaurant turns into a bar/dance floor. Not sure if the kitchen closes at that time but the full bar should keep you well stocked for the night.
