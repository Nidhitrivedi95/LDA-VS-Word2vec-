SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ I wasn't a big sushi fan until coming here. Now, i crave it once a week!  Along with the Kirin and saki. Kids love it too (the food). Very reasonably priced. 
It is simple and clean and the staff is very friendly. Don't let the look of the outside fool you. It is the old Native New Yorker. If you dine in it is 40% sushi. Just remember, they are closed on Tuesdays.
