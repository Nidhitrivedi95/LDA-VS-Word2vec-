ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ COLD APPS
-- Mandarin-selection / Mandarin-quality

SUSHI / SASHIMI
-- Plentiful, nice variety, decently made Nigiris & Makis
-- Sushi (Unagi, Hamachi...), Sashimi (Salmon, Tuna)
-- Salmon & Tuna are served 3-pieces per turn by staff
-- They make too much in advance, pay attention to sushi chef

NOODLES
-- Knife-shaved Finger-length al-dente chewiness
-- Choice of Fish, Chicken, Red Braised soup stock
-- BBQ Duck(*) or Char Sui as topping (NOT mandatory)
-- May skip Scallions / Cilantro when asked

TEPPANYAKI / GRILL
-- Japanese Grilled Chicken taste like Viet Lemongrass
-- Grilled Shrimp is extremely plump and tasty (VALUE)
-- Korean Kalbi Short-Ribs be choosey and leave the rest
-- Squash Cake/Dumpling is a must-skip doughy filler
-- Roast Beef - Only dried-ass bits-n-pieces by 7:30 pm FAIL

WOK / STIR FRIED
-- Spicy Frog Legs, pretty meaty slightly over-breaded
-- Most other items are simply Mandarin-selection

DEEP-FRIED / ROAST
-- Peking Duck - BBQ Duck actually, half goes to NOODLES
-- DF Chicken Wings, large juicy but non-crispy flavorless

SOUPS / CHINESE-DESSERTS / ICE-CREAM
-- Soups are nothing of interest (Mandarin's selection)
-- Tofu Pudding is still an excellent offering IMO
-- Purple Rice Tapioca Soup is loosely entertaining
-- Ice-cream has no firm density, possibly Frozen-dessert

WESTERN-DESSERTS / FRUITS
-- Crème Brulee and Custards (To try next time)
-- Fruit station seemed fresh (To try next time)
-- Cakes/Pastries (next time) (Mandarin's selection) 
-- Obviously I was eating MAINS until the last second

LINE-UPS @
-- Peking Duck, until they run out and waiting
-- Noodles, fresh-made takes time be patient
-- Salmon & Tuna, staff asks Salmon? Tuna?

SETTING / WASHROOMS / TV
-- Eye-catching cool-factor comfy clean 
-- Pay attention everywhere! for Chinese-style Art-pieces
-- Massive projector re-runs Chinese food from China

SUMMARY (3.5'd)
-- There seems to be some popular food-choices
-- Then there are some unpopular left-there-ALL-night food
-- Prices $3.00-5.00 higher than average Chinese Buffets
-- Soup bowls are huge, still using disposable chopsticks
-- Empties are taken-away appropriately, napkins as requested
-- This location is mostly ASIAN customers
