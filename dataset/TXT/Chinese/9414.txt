1rbb8ntTOpSolQv60CGcsQ I WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER EVER EVER eat from this place again! Very disappointed with not only my food, but with the customer service. The lady was very rude and even dropped a "whatever" to me over the phone when I called and said I was missing an item from my order. Eventually, a new delivery guy can and gave me that item.  I was so over this place I just gave it to a homeless man.

My food had a weird smell and taste.. So, with that and with the customer service, I will definitely not be ordering from here. Hopefully the change a few things around. 
As to the owner: Good luck with your business.
