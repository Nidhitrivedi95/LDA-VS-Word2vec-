The location reminded me much of the nyc location only that it was much larger. This is a very expensive restaurant but worth the splurge if you're in the mood for Asian flavors and are planning on visiting the nightclub here as well.  

The roasted duck entree was definitely the super star of the night. Thanks! The blood and sand drink here was awesome!
