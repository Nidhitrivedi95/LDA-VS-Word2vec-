WcHMfQZzs3G5UVY_zBB2FA We are from Chicago traveling through Medina and did an internet search for Chinese resturants in the  area and Hop Hing was highly recommended. Prices are excellent, portions for lunch specials are generous, the resturant with a few tables simple  and clean with open view to the kitchen .The staff is very friendly with allergy substitutions.We had the chicken and broccoli with egg roll and beef with Chinese vegetables with egg drop soup ,both were delicious, 
Actually the egg drop soup was one of the best we ever had.
Worth going out of the way for.
