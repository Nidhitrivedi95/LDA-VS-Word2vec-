xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A We stopped by LuLu's since it was close to the CMU campus and we were hungry. There is ample seating which was nice so we sat immediately. 

I was very excited to see the selection on their menu and decided to order one of my favorites - singapore noodles. While the noodles were at least (light) yellow, the flavoring of the spices was barely there, which was unfortunate. *insert sad face* In addition to that we shared a mango bubble tea but it tasted like the maker elbowed in a can of heavy syrup. 

On the flip side my boyfriend enjoyed his wonton soup and my chow foon the second time around was just okay but better than the singapore noodles. 

The food is cheap but I wouldn't take the initiative of coming here. It makes sense that they are near universities and cater to college students though. Their food is mediocre at best but service has been okay.
