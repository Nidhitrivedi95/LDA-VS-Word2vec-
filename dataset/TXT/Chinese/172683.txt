W5Qhm1Jfu6-4lCWHmUzVWQ So disappointing for a $9 worth of food. There was only 4 beef strip on the box. A lot of bell peppers and poor customer service. A kind of business like this and inside a casino and by the strip? It gives poor reviews and an unwelcoming responses. It's actually supposed to be a no star
