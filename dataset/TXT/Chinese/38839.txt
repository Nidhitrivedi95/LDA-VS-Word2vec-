AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA It's official. I'm obsessed.

After recently going vegetarian (and mostly vegan! :D ) we heard about Veggie House from SEVERAL people.. through social media, friends, and even servers at other restaurants. We knew we had to check it out!

We ordered spring rolls for an appetizer - AMAZING!
Kung Pao chicken w/ brown rice + Orange chicken w/ brown rice -YUP. BOTH GREAT!!

We received the Kung Pao chicken first .. got a picture of it &destroyed it. We then got the orange chicken and didn't even give ourselves a second to capture a photo of it .. oops!!

We didn't get our daily soup w/ our lunch specials but it was fine because we were so stuffed anyways!! Better off not wasting it but I'm sure it was delicious as well.

I will 100% recommend this restaurant not only to Vegans but anyone loving some good Chinese food!! 

Place was very clean! A little hard to find if you've never been before - it's on the 2nd level tucked away so look carefully!! 

ALSO - When can we expect another location!??!
