BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I had heard about Mother's when it was still in the old location, but didn't make it into Toronto to try the dumplings until after they moved. I found it friendly and comfortable, and the food was unbelievably good. My husband and I shared the pork and dill dumplings, pork and radish cornmeal dumplings, and a scallion pancake. Every bite was exquisite; it was plenty of food for both of us; and it cost us $22 including a generous tip. Free jasmine tea.  I'm afraid we may never eat anywhere else in Toronto from now on.
