BNeS_hZfmdQWsqewj-LuDA Omg at long last traditional Asian cuisine in North Hills. Tonight we feasted on turnip cakes, scallion pancakes (both freshly made) turnip greens and intestines, salt and pepper squid. I'll be back again in search of the land and sea combination in the winter melon and clam soup. If you know traditional Asian food you'll want to dine here!!!
