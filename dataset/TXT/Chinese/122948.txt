OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I'm a sucker for Dim Sum so I pretty much always want to leave 5 star reviews for Dim Sum. What's more lovely than a ball of sausage rolled up in a light pastry and steamed with all of its glorious juices? 

Chang's was not the exception and it has all the best Dim Sum and the fish tank to boot. We had Shrimp and Pork Pan Fried Dumpling with Scallions, Steamed BBQ Pork Bun (the hubs fav, he said these had large chunks of pork which he likes), Oyster Sauce with Broccoli, Walnut Prawns, Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai and Bean Curd Wrap (my fav and it was fabulous). 

This place could easily be 5 star if they made sure their Dim Sum didn't do 9 laps around the dining room before it arrived at your table. Unfortunately, the Walnut Shrimp was cold and other dishes would have been cold if we had not watched the little Nascars racing around the room. If you are up to playing the game however, you can easilly tell which dishes are coming out fresh and then snag them. 

I've been to Dim Sum elsewhere where this cold food issue wasn't an issue. We felt like they kept offering us more when we had clearly refused approximately 8 times. Oh, well...it was still good. And I would totally come back.
