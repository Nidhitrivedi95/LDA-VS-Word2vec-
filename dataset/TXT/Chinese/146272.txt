S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A Filling, hearty food for a very low price!  I ordered the seafood soup with soup noodles.  My dining companion ordered the curry shrimp and corn plate (odd... I know).  He seemed to enjoy his dish, but when I tried it, the noodles seemed a bit hard like they were not cooked long enough.  That's why I enjoyed my soup better, because at first the noodles were a bit hard, but as they sat in the broth longer they softened up.  If I come back, I would get another soup.

We also tried the steamed dumplings.  The dumpling skin is VERY thick, not necessarily in a bad way.  Overall, the dumplings are tasty and filling, but not my favorite I've ever had.
