0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw While I live on the other side of town, I have several friends who live within their delivery range, and have ordered from here three or 4 times now.  I am not generally a fan of Chinese food, but I can tell you that this is some of the best Chinese food I've ever had.

So far, I've had the Chicken Satay Skewers, the Pork Egg Rolls, the Broccoli Beef, the Tangerine Beef, the Cashew Chicken, the Orange Chicken, and the Pork Fried Rice,  Everything has been great, though the Tangerine Beef is really chewy.

Their website is listed wrong on here.  It should be www.longjinchinesecuisine.com
