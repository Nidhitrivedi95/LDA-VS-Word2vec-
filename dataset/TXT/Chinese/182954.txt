xL-Ckvr8k8vEBJxC1wsCqQ Came here a few nights ago for lobster, and was definitely not disappointed!
We ordered:

-2 orders of lobster (4 lobsters in total)
(Ginger and onion + one in black bean sauce)
-Rice noodle in black bean sauce
-Yeung Chow fried rice
-Plate of baby bok choy

All of the food arrived in appropriate time, and all tasted really good. I totally recommend ordering more lobster as it may not be enough with 1 order unless you're two people.
Service was prompt and the tea was always hot. Atmosphere was just right-not too loud and not too quiet. They have a big menu and have lots of different Chinese dishes to try. But the stand out for them is their lobster for sure! Will be back!
