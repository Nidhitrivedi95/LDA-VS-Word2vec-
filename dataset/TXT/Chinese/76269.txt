G6_M3Dg-gjwVIbRGLIRBkw This is hands down the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I like that they're quick, cheap, and give you huge portions like any Chinese restaurant.

But the food was disgusting, and that isn't a word I use lightly when describing a restaurant. Their kitchen is in plain view of the entrance, and everything looks like it could use a tanker full of Lysol, everything looks grimy and unclean. 

The chicken tastes like it was cooked in three week old grease. But the worst offense was the fried rice. Not sure how that's even possible, fried rice should be the least offensive, as it just complements whatever else you're eating. But it smelled, for lack of a better word, pungent. And it tasted pungent. Never a quality I look for in rice.

 I'm not a picky eater, but the chicken and broccoli from Chopstick was one of the few times I was unable to finish my meal. Considering how many Chinese restaurants are within a couple miles from there, your choices are abundant. I'd recommend any of them but Chopstick.
