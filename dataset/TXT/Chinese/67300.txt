emDKRy7zU0pqISwM71wbKQ I advise you, DO NOT GO HERE. I found a cockroach in my lo mein, threw up, went back to the store and they told me that I lied & PUT IT IN MY FOOD. I demanded something happen to compensate me, but all they said is because I took the food home, there was no way to tell how the cockroach got in the food. They don't even deserve 1 star! How dare they tell me I put a cockroach in my food. Sickening customer service.
