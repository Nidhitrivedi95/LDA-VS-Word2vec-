There's so many components to this dish and it's really a show when you order it. They slice and plate the duck in front of you. There's the crispy lean skin from the breast. It's important to have this thinly sliced so that it can be easily wrapped with the green onions and bao (the white bread). The remaining portions of the duck is then plated again meant to be enjoyed on its own.  When you put it all together, it's easy to see why this is the beloved dish of choice for most Chinese Vietnamese weddings. 

This is as good as it gets in Las Vegas.
