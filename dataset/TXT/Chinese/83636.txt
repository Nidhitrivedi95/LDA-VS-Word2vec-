HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ I'm not a Fan of most Chinese food except when it is excellent!  Here the Food was better than many Chinese places!  My Dish today was Bean Bean Sauce with Chicken.  The Service was Fantastic and they handled my complaint very Professionally!  I was impressed!  The Interior is very nice looking.  I guess a Modern Asian decor.  My food was good, though no better than three yelp stars and I'm probably not going to review any places that I can not give three stars or better.  

At 1:00 pm lunch on Monday I got the last Parking Space and the last Table!  This place is very popular.  I would probably eat here again except for better choices.
