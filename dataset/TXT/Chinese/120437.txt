O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw Authentic food. Poor service. You have to know what you're doing when you go in. If you don't, you won't get help. It's almost like a cattle run. Funnel people in, feed them, funnel them out. The place is huge & was packed at lunch on a Thursday. The food is very good, tho. Just go prepared, ask for water, utensils & anything else you might need as soon as possible because trying to get the server's attention is impossible.
