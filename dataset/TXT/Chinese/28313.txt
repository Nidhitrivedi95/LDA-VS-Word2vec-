8lPxiYChdJdTV24NJvOB3Q Went to other location in North York but this location has the lamb noodles that the one in Yonge street doesn't have, which is now my new personal favourite.

The best part of this restaurant is their tofu dessert pudding that I don't know why is not on the menu. Best tofu fa dessert I've tried in Toronto, most similar authentic flavour and texture as the ones in China.
