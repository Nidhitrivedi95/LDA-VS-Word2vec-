SEURrw7032BR15PKZ_aleA Here's the thing. If you do not make a reservation, be prepared to wait an hour (like I did, on a Sunday morning), being surrounded by a crowd of hungry, angry, & usually fobby older asian parents/grandparents.  
The hostess has the worst system of seating people - first she will give you a number and call you when a table opens up that seats your specific amount of people.  For example, even if I came in before table #65, they might get a seat first because a table of 8 has opened up and I only have 4 people in my party.  Therefore, don't get upset if you think they're randomly calling numbers.

The dim sum here is yummy.  They have these little time discounts, so for example: eating before 11:30AM is cheaper than eating from 11:30AM-1PM, and it becomes cheaper again from 1-4PM (check the pictures).  There are small, medium, large, and special; all different prices.  This is completely worth it for a lot of the dishes, especially the steamed pot rice - it is literally $3 for a pot of rice with beef ribs and a chicken claw. Yuuuuuuum.
Everything else is very average with 0 complaints.  They serve you within the first 10 minutes of you ordering .. but there is a very slow trickle of your food at the end. I waited and extra 10 minutes for the curry squid.  You have to double check what you order because they do tend to forget items sometimes.

Overall, make your reservations and come enjoy a nice Chinese dim sum meal with your fam :)
