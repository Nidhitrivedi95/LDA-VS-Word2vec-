taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg Found this little hole in the wall because it was close to our hotel... What can I say. Easily the best dumplings we've had in North America (and we've had A LOT of dumplings in North America).

Walking into this place, shaking off the snow and ice, and partaking in homey dumpling goodness is one of our fondest memories of Montreal...
