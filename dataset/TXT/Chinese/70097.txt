f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ When is use to be Cathay house/jade the service was very good. Now that it has been remodeled and reopen again I feel as if the service isn't great. The carts don't come as often as they use to. Especially since they put us in the back room. It's the first time I've felt dissatisfied eating dim sum.
