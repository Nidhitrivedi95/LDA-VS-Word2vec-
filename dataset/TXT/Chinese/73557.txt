fjMCpoHsXKLerXiLW9ChKg I LOVE THIS PLACE.

Enormous portions, very reasonably priced.
Super-fast service.

Egg rolls are perfect (fresh on the inside, golden crispy on the outside)
Egg drop soup is perfect (very eggy, not a ton of extra ingredients)
Great flavors in their entrees (thick savory sauces, juicy chicken)

So happy that we've finally found our favorite Chandler Chinese place.
