hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q We came here as we saw that they had good reviews for soup dumplings. We did take out instead of dine in which might have influenced what we ordered. We ordered the drunken chicken, two rice entrees, something else that I don't remember and dumplings. The drunken chicken was delicious! It was tender and had great flavors. As for my rice dish, I wasn't too big of a fan. Initially I wanted to order the soup noodle version but decided against it since I was doing take out. The rice was dry and there was more rice than meat. My least favorite dish were the dumplings. I'm used to dumplings shaped like dumplings but these looked like they were melted. 

Overall, this place is not bad but I would want to try the soup dumplings and their noodles for next time.
