zXjA4Jms2jCAP09EO7Ghfg I note at the time of this review this is a NEWLY OPENED restaurant and they might still be tweaking things.

This is a small casual family friendly restaurant where you order at the counter, seat yourself and pick up your order when it's ready.

The Specialty of the house are the Noodle Bowls where you have FIVE choices, then you decide on your vegetables, meat, and FIVE sauces to pick from. They also offer other items like a few appetizers, salads, rice bowls, bento boxes and FIVE signature dishes.

Get ready to eat with either chop sticks or a small plastic SPORK.

I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken with Hong Kong Noodles. The chicken in my dish was very good. It was moist and tender. I also liked that it was a combination of white and dark meat. The very thin but tasty Hong Kong Noodles where prepared well and the vegetables were fresh and crisp. I am not entirely sure that they gave me my bowl with the Pad Thai sauce because it didn't taste like Pad Thai at all and tasted more like spicy very SWEET and sour. It also lacked the peanuts it had in the description. The choices of sauces are Pad Thai with peanuts, Mongolian, Indian Curry and House. If mine was Pad Thai I recommend any other flavor instead. Unless you like spicy that's sweet like pancake syrup.

My husband had the Steak Noodle Bowl with Chewy Shanghai Noodles and House Sauce that you can order Spicy. The house sauce was described as a kung pao kind of sauce. His meal WAS MUCH BETTER than mine because the sauce was much better. 

Wok Fire is located in the Shopping center that's surrounded by all the car dealers on Bell Road in Peoria.

It's a family friendly kind of place and offers a few Children's Meals. Prices are also low.

 Got some potential going on here.
