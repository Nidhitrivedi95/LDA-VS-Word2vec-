cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw We have been searching for a Chinese restaurant of the caliber of Jade Empress since that palace to oriental cuisine closed more than 20 years ago and today we may have finally it.
Yao Fine Chinese Cuisine was a wonderful experience, the staff was friendly, the food was outstanding and most importantly the prices were amazing!
We started with egg rolls which were large, crispy and delicious without being greasy. The hot and sour soup was delicious without the sharp tang of vinegar that is true of so many other Chinese places.
Yao serves a dish called General Chicken (Similar to General Tso Chicken) that is tender chicken served in a slightly sweet yet spicy sauce with crisp broccoli. It was a treat to be sure, but the dish that really was a hit was the Black Pepper Beef. Strips of tender beef cooked with chopped bell peppers, onion, jalapeno peppers, a delicious sauce all sprinkled with loads of fresh black pepper. Oh my!
We enjoyed our meal immensely but it became twice as wonderful when the check came, Wow! Least expensive we've had out in quite some time. You really need to check them out.
