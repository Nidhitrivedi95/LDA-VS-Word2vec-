Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw First try, based on yelp reviews.  It was delicious. Exceeded my expectations. I absolutely love hot and sour soup and had place in queen creek I used to go to several years ago when we were first married that had amazing hot and sour soup. We went again recently and it was not as good as it used to be. Glad to find a place that I can enjoy. The pork lo me in was also very good and really good portions!  The orange chicken was average but the fried rice with it was just the right level of moist and flavorful. All around it was a wonderful place to eat and worth the cost. All sad part was my fortune cookie was empty!  Ha ha, definitely not the restaurants fault though.
