TtBNeqXSRh37VD-pW_VbAw Friend brought me to this place for the ox tail vermicelli noodle soup.

It's a very small shop run by husband and wife. Maybe sits about 15 people at most. 

Was $10 for a small bowl and $12 for a large bowl.
I honestly should've ordered the small. It's been a really long time since I had to tap out and not finish my entire meal.

There was lots of flavours. Some pickled veggies, the soup base, some spices, and the succulent ox tail. The ox tail was very soft and fall off the bone. They were not stingy on noodles at all and was the main reason I couldn't finish my meal. I was STUFFED. The vermicelli is not the thin almost clear noodles that you would expect but it was a thicker round noodle. The noodles were very soft as well, which if u don't know by now, I love anything saucy, soft, or mushy. 

anyway, i'm about to take a nap now. it's one of those meals, you know?
