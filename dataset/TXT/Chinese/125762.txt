OyBStpjF5e_iRCMXflFasQ Food is pretty good and seems authentic enough given they draw a lot of Chinese people to eat here. I enjoyed their food but it was pretty expensive compared to the other choices on Green St. However, our waiter couldn't speak English at all and only served us water. In addition, there was a mandatory gratuity charge even though they never served us and I was only with a group of 3 total. I'd recommend places like Lai Lai Wok over this place.
