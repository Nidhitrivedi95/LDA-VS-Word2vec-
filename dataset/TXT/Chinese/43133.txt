beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw This place is delicious.  I get the house special soup and just get the small dishes that goes around the tables.  It is a new kind of shabu shabu.  I would not hesitate to come here on a weekly basis.  The service was excellent as well.  Only thing is that it can get very cold in here only because we are eating hot food.
