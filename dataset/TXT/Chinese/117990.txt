NJyTPOukXuLK8vabKw7nvA If you like spicy food, this place is for you.  I tried the kung pao chicken, mapo tofu, hot boiling fish and their house fried rice. All of them are good, tasty and spicy.  

My only concern is they do not take credit or debit card... Cash only.  The servers cannot speak proper English and not all dishes have proper description or pictures.  The place is not exactly the cleanest and tables are covered with plastic just cause chili oil could create a mess.

Overall, I had a pleasant meal and the food is good.  I'd definitely come back or recommend this place.  I would give this place a 4 to 5 star if they could change their menu to something more presentable like adding pictures, spiciness level and more English description.
