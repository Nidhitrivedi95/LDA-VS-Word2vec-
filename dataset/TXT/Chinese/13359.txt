They also have several drink options such as plum juice, soy drink, and fountain drinks. I'm not much of a hot pot fan so I can't really tell the difference between good and bad hot pot. Despite that, i thought the flavours in the food weren't bad at all. Broth was flavourful and sauces were plenty.

It can get very hot in the restaurant and I would recommend leaving your jacket behind since the hot pot smell really sticks to your clothes afterwards.
