Got here around 1145ish. Went up to the EDM area and was not impressed. I've heard good things about this place and was super excited. And then dun dun dun...I was disappointed. 

The lower level has the hip hop area and its own bar. It's small. Small walkways to the bar. It could be bigger. 

The drink prices are way inflated compared to other clubs according to some of my friends. I understand it's Vegas and all, but I've been to other clubs at least they don't gouge you lol. Well as the sayings go, you have to pay to play and cash is king, so make sure you're ballin when you come to Vegas haha. They've got to pay tiesto somehow. 

Pro: Tiesto has his residency here. 

I may give it another chance.
