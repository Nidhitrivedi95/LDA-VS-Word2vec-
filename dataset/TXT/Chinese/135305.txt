QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ A family trip brought us to Canada. After a tried day we ordered food from this restaurant. We ordered:
1- pork dumplings 
     100% handmade.  The meat inside is not dry at all. The veggie inside is freshly green and tasted really good. 
2-North Eastern Salad 
     Good size and folly worth that price. The cucumber is really fresh and u can tell by your eyes. They are carefully separated the sauce (well packed) for u. 
3- Cucumber & Pig Ears
     Pig ears is well marinated and well cooked. With that light spicy sauce. wow!
4- Beef Stuffed Pan Cakes (4 pieces) 
     So fresh and yummy. The sauce comes out after few bites. 
For the bonus they packed a coke for us. 
The deliver man is really nice and polite and food has been delivered with a short time.  We're really satisfied with this place. That makes me give 5 stars for this place. 
Many thanks.
