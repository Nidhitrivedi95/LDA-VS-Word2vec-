1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA We were greeted with smiles all around and promptly seated with menus and water. Ordered the shrimp wonton noodle soup, salt & pepper chicken wings, and ong choy sautéed in garlic. 
Hubs and I loved the chicken wings: Salty enough to make you want to eat it with rice and spicy enough where you can pop a few of the sliced chilis in your mouth to get the heat you want without needing water to cool your mouth down. 
Our 2yr old loved the shrimp wonton noodle soup and devoured the wontons and soup. Nibbled on the noodles but we ended up finishing it for him. Was tasty and simple. 
While I love ong choy, wouldn't order it here again. It was a little too oily and they weren't as fresh as we would be liked. The other two entrees and friendliness of the staff made up for it though. 
Great service and yummy food at a great price. Will definitely be back.
