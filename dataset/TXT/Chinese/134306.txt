Food is well done
Friendly service

Cons:
Menu is very limited

I used to frequent this place when it was called Elite cafe.  I really liked it then so I wondered how Pine House would compare.  

Walking in, they pretty much kept the same decor as the previous business with a few minor tweaks.  There are still plenty of seats for the size of this place which is nice.  There are tables that will easily fit groups of 8 so big groups can certainly find a table without too much trouble.

When you sit down, they hand you the menu.  My first thought was is that it??  It was basically a small half sheet of paper with items on both sides.  It was a nicely done menu, but so very tiny.  I think there were no more than 30 items.  Comparing that to the extensive menu the previous business had, it was kinda disappointing.  

I ordered a fired rice noodle and my wife ordered a baked rice dish.  The dishes are prepared very well here.  There's a good amount of food portion wise.  My fried rice noodle included a very good portion of beef and my wife's dish had a good portion of fish and cheese.  Taste wise, it was pretty good as well. 

The staff here were all very nice. I really enjoyed the service of the last business here and it looks like Pine House Cafe has at least kept up with that tradition.  

All in all, Pine House Cafe is a pretty good HK style cafe.  It could do with a bit more variety in the menu if you ask me though.
