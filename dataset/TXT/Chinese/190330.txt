YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g Had a great time here on a Saturday night (it was a busy night but didn't seem crowded).  Overall, I think the dishes seem very "traditional" (from what I know), which could pose a challenge for the restaurant in that cheaper, delicious "traditional" dim sum can be found approximately 2 blocks north of this restaurant in Chinatown. 
Having said that, the service here was amazing - servers were very friendly and attentive, which is not what you would get at a Chinatown dim sum restaurant.

- Chicken cheun feng - delicious. there is a crispy layer inside which was a surprise.
- Duck pancake - also very good, and not as greasy as other ones I've had (big plus)
- Shrimp har gow (dumplings) - also delicious, but portions are small for what you pay for


I ordered a few other dishes equating to about $40 a person, before gratuities. I recommend this place if you want the "Susur Lee" experience, and a high-quality meal. If you want equally as delicious dim sum without breaking the bank, go to Chinatown.
