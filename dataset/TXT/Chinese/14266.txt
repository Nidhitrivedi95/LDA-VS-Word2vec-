3cAy1gxlprn1ue0q3L_ziw Nice atmosphere, spacious and clean washrooms. Good tea.
Service is polite but very slow at times. The food is quite below average.

Appetizers:
Almond fish - thin pieces of fish battered with almond flakes, pretty good, it was the best dish out of all of them.

Fiery Wontons - very small wontons with little filling, the sauce wasn't spicy at all. By small, I mean very small, about 1/3 the size of wontons you could get at any restaurant in Chinatown.

Main Dishes:
Kung Pao Chicken - sauce was too salty. Very little chicken pieces! Mostly veggies and onions. For $13 it wouldn't have hurt to put in a bit more meat in the dish.

Chow Mein - meh. Greasy. Nothing stands out about it. Also a small portion for the price you pay for.

Overall, average tastes, small portions, and high prices but this is in the Yorkville area so that's probably why. Probably wouldn't come here again. Spent over $40 and my boyfriend and I were still quite hungry afterwards!
