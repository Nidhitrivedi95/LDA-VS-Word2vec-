_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg They mean well at this restaurant.  The service is arguably the worst I have ever experienced in a restaurant.  The food makes up for it signficantly.  Sesame tofu is my entre of choice, and it comes with an egg roll, two batter-dipped shrimp, and sweet + sour sauce.  I believe all (or most) entres come with the same, as my boyfriend also receives those sides when he orders something different.  The food is excellent!  I would recommend buying and bringing it home, since the service is so terrible.  On my first visit, the teenage girl working there would not pick her head up from the counter and scribbled our order down without ever looking up or smiling.  The food was then thrown in front of us.  But don't worry; something about the food is good enough to keep us coming back.
