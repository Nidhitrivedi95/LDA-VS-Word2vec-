Restaurant was 20% full and staff was attentive and food started coming out 15 mins after ordering.  First dish that came out was the yangchow fried rice $9.99.  First time seeing spam being used in fried rice.  Portion size was small and greasier  than I would like but the flavours were good.  

Next came the lamb $5.99 and beef $5.99 skewers.  Lamb was tender and didn't have a strong gamy taste which I liked and the beef was a bit chewy and flavor of the meat was overpowered by the seasonings.  Price was good considering it was about $1.50 a skewer and amount of meat was good on each skewer.  

Next came the 15 dumplings (egg, chives, noodle, shrimp) $7.99.  Each dumpling had one small shrimp in there and fell apart after one bite.  I would avoid getting this dumpling as it tasted mostly like chives.

Last dish was the house special hot pot $14.99.  It was more like a stew with green beans, egg plant, pork, noodles and corn.  Came in a pan with a mini stove underneath it.  I wouldn't recommend because it seems like something that can easily be made at home and flavours wasn't anything special.
