3HrT5IcO3sd4pSBCFP4OYw I have been eating here since 1989, it used to be china gate and I love it. If you want greasy nasty Chinese food don't order from here because its not like that. I order the Moo goo gai pan and it rocks. It has garlic sauce and white meat, it's perfect. The staff are very sweet. The man who delivers to my house is just the nicest, he picked up all of my newspapers in the driveway. Back to the food , it's fresh and tastes great. The only thing is I wish the family dinner came with 4 crab puffs and egg rolls not 2 because there are 4of us and I wish the egg drop would go back to the original recipe with the corn and I would love it if the chicken and vegetables went back to having the  little corn and happy black mushrooms in it. Either way I woul never go anywhere else!
