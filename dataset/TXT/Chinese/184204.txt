xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A Went there Sunday 10/4/15, and although the soup is not the same as it was in 2000, and no longer have Thai ice tea...everything was still much better than any Asian I can get near home, and they added enough bubble milk and bubble smoothies to bring my stars up from 2 to 4. We will definitely return soon! 

Good going Lu Lu's!!!
