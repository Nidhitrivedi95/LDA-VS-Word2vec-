_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Birthday brunch with my babes. My new favorite Asian place on the strip. Good Hong Kong style food. They have some dim sum entries and other great entires. Open late and the prices are reasonable for what you'd expect at the Venetian. 

I personally love this place and they do a good job. I've grown up eating Hong Kong style food so I have a taste for it and know how it should be. This place is on point.
