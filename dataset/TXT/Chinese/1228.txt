-juOL0eJC6kvf5RLEjoPvA Probably one of the best Chinese restaurants with traditional Chinese foods in montreal area. If you have a celebration and want to have family style Chinese and you want a decent meal then this is a good choice besides the Kam Fung in Chinatown and Ruby Rouge. If you are serious then the Papa Resto in Brossard and Heung Ma Ma is a better choice.

We got the family style with six dishes. The chicken was alright but the beef and the eggplant hot pot was quite salty. The lobster was good. The steamed fish was a bit fishy taste so not sure how fresh it is. The vegetables were the best. The rice was taken from two bowls apparently and part of it was really soft like congee. When we asked for it to be changed, the waitress came out with another bowl sitting on too of ours!;(

The dessert was the red bean soup which was fine. They allowed us to bring our cake in and that was nice.

Overall a fun experience with the servers singing with us!
