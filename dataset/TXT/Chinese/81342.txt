GxzEsd-81hVP6C2h6wMvBw For simple, fast, and hand-pulled beef noodle soup, I always go to Big Beef Bowl. It's a tiny noodle eatery with a big heart for service and flavor. I like how you can choose the noodle type (ie. Round vs wide, thick vs thin) and bowl size. I usually order the beef brisket with regular round noodles in a small size. If you're extra hungry, then perhaps have a go of their large bowl! It's pretty big so be prepared! 

Meanwhile, there are also side bbq appetizers to order like mushrooms and chicken heart (I'll pass on that but I know others folks that love that!). 

Lastly, the coolest thing I like about this place is their Bruce Lee art of him pulling noodles. It's a fun and unique attraction, and somehow inspires me to do something fun afterwards.
