Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg Came by for dinner the other night and it was a decent experience. Parking was available behind the restaurant and the restaurant was packed upon arrival at 5:30 pm. The wait for a table was ~30 minutes. There are a few seats, in addition to standing room by the door.

Started off with the jelly fish which was decent. Portion was generous and the flavoring was on point.

Moved on to the Snow Pea Leaves in garlic sauce that was ok. Vegetables were decent and flavoring was okay. Portion was generous.

The Cantonese Chow Mien was huge with a generous crispy fried noodle portion along with tons of chicken, pork, bbq pork, and prawns. 

Highlight of the meal was the Diced Sirloin with Chili Black Pepper in Golden Bowl. Plenty of tender pieces of sirloin cubes in a fried wonton shell that was quite tasty. 

Staff was rather frazzled due to the large crowds.

~$18/head after tax and gratuity for tons of food!
