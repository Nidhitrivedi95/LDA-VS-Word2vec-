yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA The food is always good here. Two things I usually get are pho and fried chicken wings (either with salt and peppers or with fish sauce). Trust me, I don't like fish sauce at all, if I can smell it, I automatically ditch that dish, but with the fried chicken wings with fish sauce, you can't really smell the fish sauce. It just adds a ton of flavor to it. Or if you are still skeptical about it, try it with salt and peppers. It's very different from the American fried chicken wings. 

Pho is pretty good, I guess if you open a vn restaurant but you screw up on the pho part, you're pretty much done.

Service is slow. You can probably know just by looking at the wait list and the line. There is ALWAYS a line. If not always, 98.9% of the time. That's why I usually go to pho so 1 for pho instead. But I miss the fried chicken wings soooo much!!!!
