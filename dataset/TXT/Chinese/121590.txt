OaHJvi10dJbMIaQXg5e2Ag Get your Banh Mi and Pho HERE! Both are great and have authentic taste. The variety for each is also amazing. Guess what, the fish sauce is also super tasty (the best I have had) and homemade. Service was great and the server knew we came for the real Vietnamese food and made sure we were happy with everything. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. The restaurant is fairly big and it looks like they do weddings and larger events. They also had a bar. I would recommend you go elsewhere for your run of the mill Chinese American food, as this is not what this place is about. If you want some of the best Pho and Banh Mi in CLE, come here.
