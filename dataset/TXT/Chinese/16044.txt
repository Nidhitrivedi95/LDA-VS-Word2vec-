HOUSE SOUP: Gratis with meal, on the plain side, mostly broth with hints of ginger. Much appreciated to warm us up on our 40-degree evening.
SCALLION PANCAKES: Four-piece order, delicate and light with a nicely crisp exterior. These complemented our heartier entrees nicely.
LAMB AND LEEK: So good! Plenty of leeks and green onion, generous and tender portion of lamb, definitely something I would get again! 
"EGGPLANT WITH GROUND PORK": I assume there was a miscommunication because my dish had eggplant but no pork, but it was still good. Soft chunks of eggplant, a rich dark sauce, bits of ginger and red pepper everywhere. 
HOUSE DESSERT: Black sticky rice, date, and red bean soup, allegedly good for circulation, balanced flavor but not to my BF's liking. 

Service was shockingly good- I'm used to receiving the bare minimum at most places on Spring Mountain, but here we were checked up on regularly by several staff members. Pricing was reasonable, the above was just over $30 with tip. I will be coming back to try the seafood items or clay pot dishes.
