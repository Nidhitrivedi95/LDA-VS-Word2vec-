lcSsIw_oC-OT2veksCtRwg Ordered orange chicken and kung pao chicken for pick up. The service was quick, which was fabulous, but the food was extremely bland. Kung pao had a little kick to it, but was mostly bell peppers as opposed to chicken. Orange chicken was like a subpar Panda Express had made it. Not what I expect from an authentic restaurant.
