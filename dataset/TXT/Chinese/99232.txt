Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ One of the best dim sum restaurants I've ever been to. The food was delicious. The dim sum that arrived on carts were still warm and & prepared fresh. I would recommend the calamari, it wasn't too crunchy which I liked.  

The servers were more polite than usual for a chinese dim sum restaurant and every time we asked for a certain item not on that person's cart they would try to grab the attention of the person pushing the cart with the food we wanted. 

The only negative was that their bathrooms weren't so great. Not too clean, toilet paper on the floor and such.
