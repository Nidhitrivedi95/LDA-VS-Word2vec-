Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA I love love love this place. If they were closer to my house I would probably frequent this place more then once a week.

It's hard to find a good Thai place that cooks their food like my moms style but here they do and I struck gold because my mom now lives in Tennessee so this was the best substitute. 

Every time I come here I want to order everything on the menu but always get the Crispy Pork belly fat with Chinese broccoli about $8.95 plus a single side of rice. Their 3 companion dish hits close to home with the BBQ pork, papaya salad and sticky rice is perfect and reminds me of what my mom would make all the time. A lot of their other dishes are absolutely delicious and the dessert sound and looks amazing I yet have to try that. 

Food is amazing, price is awesome and restaurant is clean and quaint. The staff is also very nice. I would return to the place everyday of I could. If you haven't been here you must do just that because you will be hook at first bite.
