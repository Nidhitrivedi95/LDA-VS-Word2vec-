c2l80imPWR8V6gIEM02XPg Red Shrimp Company Chinese Take-Out with its white walls and red neon lights is your typical no frills, low price, and hopefully high volume Chinese take-out business run by a Chinese family.  The daughter (I assume) works the cash register and takes the order, the mom expedites the orders, and the dad with the other Chinese cooks prepares the items on the menu.

It is located at the NE corner of W. Flamingo and S. Jones.  The restaurant has a few simple tables and chairs for customers dining in or waiting for their to-go orders. They also do lunch deliveries within the vicinity with a minimum order of $15.  It is opened daily pretty much from around 11amto 10:30pm.

Since moving recently and being just a block away from Red Shrimp, I finally decided to go check them out.  After staring at the menu with all of those choices, I finally settled on the dinner entree portion of Shrimp with Lobster Sauce (which is prepared using 18 ct shrimps, meaning there are about 18 shrimps in a pound).  I paid my bill and picked an empty table near the window while I waited for my dinner.  Before I knew it, it was already ready for pickup, and I think it took less than 4 minutes.
It comes with a lot of rice and the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce was piping hot when I poured it out onto my microwavable plate.  And guess what?  It has 17 shrimps!  That is practically a pound of prawns for just a little over $10.  It tasted good, not too salty and the shrimps was cooked well, not overcooked and rubbery.

Will definitely drop by for their lunch specials.

4 stars for the fast service and inexpensive price tag.
