Q7PWryGwFr52WMmfzqCBhA Came here for Chinese New Year dinner.  Fortunately I didn't experience quite as disastrous experience as the other reviewers (but can definitely agree on majority of their points), the service was excellent, the food came out fast and the duck was actually pretty good.  But ... there are better chinese restaurants out there!
