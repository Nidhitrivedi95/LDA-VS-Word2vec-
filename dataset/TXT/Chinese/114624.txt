mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w Needing my Dim Sum fix I thought I'd reluctantly try East Ocean. Pleasantly surprised was I  !!! I loved the selections and the flavors were authentic. I also decided to try the dinners after that. Again pleasantly surprised. I would say it is the best Chinese food in the Las Vegas/Henderson area. Contrary to what another poster said our servers are more than helpful. I have decided to have my Dim Sum there at least twice a week and have dinner there at least once a week!
