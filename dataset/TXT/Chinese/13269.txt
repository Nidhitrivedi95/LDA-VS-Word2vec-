2UFl9gLOQrSGY2sPu6U-kA Craving spicy asian food Yelp recommended this restaurant. It was my first time eating hot pot. 

The server was helpful explaining how it works. There is an electric 
stove top burner built into the table to heat up your broth. You select a single serving or large pot to share with others. In either size you can have one or 
1/2 and 1/2 soup bases of the hot chillies or chicken flavor w/ginger, garlic and lemon grass. I chose 1/2 of each broth which was good but next time will opt for just the spicy. 

After choosing your broth(s) you can then go to the buffet to select your vegetables, pasta, seafood and meats to cook in your hot pot. The server also brings over a plate of raw, thin sliced beef and lamb for you to cook in your pot.There is a separate table of ingreidents for you to concoct different sauces to accompany your food. 

You can eat as much as you like, desserts and drinks are included in the price ($$).  

The concept is similar to mongolian barbeque. It is a great place for a romantic date where you can relax, take your time cooking and sharing a hot pot with someone special  :)
