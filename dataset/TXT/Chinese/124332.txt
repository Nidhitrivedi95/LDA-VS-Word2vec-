oRgoOhwCex1X9j1iQ9ou3w Decor similar to Premiere Ballroom and  Casa Imperial.  Had the pet peeve syndrome of having two lines, which means some people don't need to wait.  Had to wait a long time to get l my menu and tea,  but  once the food order was in, food came quickly.  The  almond coated crispy beef strips was good. Menu selection was good.  Utensils not clean enough.  Bit pricey like it's sister companies.
