rLyGCFULUSbLCt8J3U0_kA When we first walked in it was like going back in time. Decor was really really old, signage was out of date and the staff was really rough around the edges. The seats were comfy though. Food was OK but I was expecting a bit more from the portions. The main reason for coming... The duck! It was pretty good but I was expecting a bit more. Decent pricing. Only down fall was the server took down a wrong order and they made the food. He tried arguing with us that we did order it when actually we didn't. Made me feel uneasy afterwards. Probably would come back if I have a craving for duck.
