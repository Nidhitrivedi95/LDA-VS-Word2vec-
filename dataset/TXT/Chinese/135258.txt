qaJ-HewyVAQCQ8C_KveZ4g The food is decent (typical chinese takeout food), but the service and staff are horrible! I ordered delivery from here once when I was on campus studying. It took them about an hour to get it to me at UNCC (half a mile away). After dropping off the food, I realized they never gave me a fork or anything to eat with. I called them and asked if the driver could swing back by with a fork, and the lady informed me that they only give forks when they deliver to businesses and hotels (because plastic forks are SOO expensive!). I asked if they could bring one out anyways (again, I'm half a mile away,) and she asked if I could go to another restaurant nearby to get one. I was studying for a final exam ON CAMPUS and couldn't leave, which is why I ordered DELIVERY, and she asks if I could leave to get a fork somewhere else... No, but I can go somewhere else and get food from now on.
