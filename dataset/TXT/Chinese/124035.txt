ooZQt0jRqrJ_ejhjP8C4Mg I'm (almost) speechless. This Panda is so egregiously disgusting. A steaming dump taken by one of their employees and slopped into my take-out box would have been more acceptable than this shit. Rock-hard peas and other unidentifiable bits in my fried rice. Who knows the last time that shit had been cleaned? Ligaments and other unchewables.... Entirely unconcerned high school staff. Do yourself a favor and drive down to 39th and Thomas for an entirely different experience. I count myself lucky I didn't get ill.
