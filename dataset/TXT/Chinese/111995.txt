MDeqp3L79cq3h11_nW5umw Shopped at this location for the first (and last time) as we were far away from our usual T&T shopping location.  Not much of a variety --- small selection of vegetables, fish was meh, meat was meh and the food court was out of everything that we normally get at T&T.  In short, we did our shopping but still have to go shopping.  No line ups at the cash registers like our regular T&T (because fewer people seem to be shopping here) - I will not be running back.  Do not make the large vegetable steamed bau (su cai bau) and other regular items which are available at every other T&T, just pork available.  They seemed to have a good selection of Philippine imported products.  Comparing this location to the other T&Ts at Warden or the Steeles (near Markham) store, this location did not hit the high note for me.
