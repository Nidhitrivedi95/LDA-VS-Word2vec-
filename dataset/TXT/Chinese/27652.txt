8e1dheUto2NpSii6l_b3cg So the smart folks at Royal Dragon decided to paper my apartment complex with menus....thank you Royal Dragon!  I live across from the Mills Mall and finding takeout that delivers to us is hard to say the least.  There's a ton of fast food, but zero pizza, chinese or other restaurants that deliver.  Jimmy Johns doesn't count.    

I ordered the beef with garlic sauce, steamed dumplings and Chinese donuts.  Everything arrived very warm and it tasty.  I'm a fan and have found my go too take out.  I think it remarkable that the items were still hot considering the distance.  I look forward to trying the rest of the menu.

If I had to say one negative, it took forever to get my food.  But considering it's a trek I was impressed the food was hot.
