j3SHAiF8OIlY3kUPnAAlKw I'm at a crossroad with this place. I really like House of Leng, but they also seem to lack consistency. 

At dinner time, sometimes the food is good, sometimes its so so. 

Lunch  though is the opposite. Lunch is always good from my experience. The chicken and string beans, great asparagus, always excellent. Today is no exception. 

But why is dinner so inconsistent?
