bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Fantastic service, food and prices.

The entertainment is amazing, but make sure you reserve a table in the stage/singing room.

The service is awesome -- they work in teams of 3-4; you will have a refill on your drink before you know you even needed it.

The food is great and extremely reasonably priced.

This is a great spot -- highly recommended for all ages.
