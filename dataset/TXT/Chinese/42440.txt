bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg Unimpressed.  Used yelp to find a place that sounded great.  G&G did not hit the mark.  Pork belly was ruined by the ridiculous mayo based dressing which overwhelmed the fat of the pork belly.  

General Tzo cauliflower was special and something to try if there.   Great texture.   Terrific for vegetarians missing texture of meat.  

Skirt steak chow fun was boring and tasted like midwestern attempt on Asian food.  I can get much better in Asia town in Cleveland.  

Their Manhattan was excellent.  I'll give an extra star for it.
