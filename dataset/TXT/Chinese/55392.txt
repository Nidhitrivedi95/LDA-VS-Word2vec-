cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg Dined here last night for the first time because of the high reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed.  Mongolian beef was quality,  juicy,  thick sliced beef cooked perfectly in a savory sauce.  Generals Chicken was likewise, thick,  juicy pieces of chicken breast cooked perfectly in a wonderfully spicy sauce.  Both dishes prepared with quality veggies.  The House Chow Fun was also superb. It was very busy at 7:30 on a Tuesday night,  another good sign of the quality.  Service was very good although just a bit rushed,  probably due to the crowd.  High quality food at prices comparable to lower quality take out.  We will be back.
