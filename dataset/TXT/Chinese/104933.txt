KRoJhHyPWORMJn1UO5kAkA Generous portions, tasty but felt execution on some of the dishes could've been better.  

For example, my chicken steak with black pepper sauce was smothered in the gravy.  It's almost as it's using the sauce to hide "imperfections" (?).  It was tasty, so next time I will ask for the sauce on the side.  

Also, the spaghetti meat sauce was really wet & saucy, probably because they didn't drain the pasta.  Tasted only ok.  Latter, we can find better options elsewhere; though as mentioned, portions are generous.

Vegetarian chow mein was our fav dish, nice mix of veg on crispy noodles.

Will visit again to try other dishes.
