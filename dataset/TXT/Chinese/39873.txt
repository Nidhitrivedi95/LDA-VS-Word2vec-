ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ Markham is basically Asian food paradise. To rank as one of the best HK cafes here is not an easy task, but New City takes the reigns on this one. Seriously this place is one of the best and well maintained cafe in Markham. You also know that they truly care about their customers and has an owner that manages well. The staff has been unchanged since I've lived here. Food here is good regardless of what you order so just go on and make this place your local diner. Because I did and I have not regretted it. Despite the change of scenery in the New Kennedy Plaza, this place remains unchanged and for a good reason!
