You could really taste the five spices and herbs that went into making it. The soup was not too salty so thst you could definitely sip it without needing a big gulp of water afterwards.

As for the lamb skewers/kebabs, it was a bit dry and it wasn't anything special. 

Stick to the noodles and you will come back wanting more!
