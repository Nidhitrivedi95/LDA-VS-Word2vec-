afdthOntL8hfhomIFX-NWg It was a bad experience by all means. First of all it took them so long time to deliver . The order was missing sushimi pieces and the sushi rolls were very small. The food looked like it was left over the day before. I was hungry so I ate it actually it took me one minute to eat sushi order of 20 dollars , if you wanna have an idea about the quantity ! As far as the quality you gotta wait I will update the review if I get any diarrhea !
