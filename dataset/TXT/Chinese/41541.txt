Every time I go to toronto, it is a must that I have to stop here for a drink. I actually came here for dinner and I was so surprised that the food wasn't bad! Everything was cook perfectly and very tasty. I ordered a taro bubble tea and their tapioca is very chewy and sweet! I can't wait till I go back here again!
