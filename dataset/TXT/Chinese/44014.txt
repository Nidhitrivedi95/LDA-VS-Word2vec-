BIMICEFM917JQwi5l4q6Gw Ychhh. Ordered beef and broccoli, egg rolls, wonton soup, moo shu pork and spare ribs to take out. How can I say this? Everything was weird. The broccoli was so overcooked, it was inedible. The beef was slimy and tasteless. The egg rolls are minuscule. I've rolled blunts bigger than these.  The wontons were just small slabs of under cooked dough with no meat inside. Who puts cucumbers in wonton soup? The spare ribs were big and meaty but what was that wet brown sauce they were swimming in? The moo shu was OK, thats why I added an extra star, but the Hoisin sauce was watered down. The fake duck sauce was awful.
I'm tough on chinese restaurants. I compare them to the better Chinatown places in Vegas, NY, Philly and San Fransisco. None in the west valley that I know of, ever come close. But this one is a distant last place.
