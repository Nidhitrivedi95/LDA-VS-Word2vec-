Fhjzzo7ranqqgEdbiPD50Q When you order two chicken dishes and one us like a sponge and the other is moist, it's easy to tell that they might not be using the freshest stuff for all orders. Soup was great and one of the chicken dishes was outstanding. Egg rolls were on point as well. Hit or miss seems to be the the main reviews and I would have to agree. But staff was friendly and that's worth giving a few chances for.
