q_KQbgnaYDlPx8EHTydcBQ A Hong Kong style Cafe ("cha chan tang") with a few more dishes inspired by other Asian cuisines. As recommended by other Yelpers, I tried their laksa (I chose the one with beef), a corned beef and egg sandwich, and their French toast cubes.

Laksa with beef - 3.5/5
Obviously you can't expect an authentic laksa dish, but it is a fairly tasty curry noodle soup. It was a bit strange how they mixed vermicelli and another kind of thick noodle. The curry soup was flavourful and I found it to have a bit of a spicy kick but still fairly mild. It also came with a few fried tofu puffs. Overall, a satisfying dish if you're craving a more flavourful soup noodle.

Corned beef and egg sandwich - 4/5
This is a pretty standard menu item at a cha Chan tang and they did a good job, but there's nothing outstanding about it. There was a good amount of egg and corned beef.

French toast cubes - 3/5
I was less impressed by this dish than other Yelpers. While it's a nice shareable dish, I thought there could have been a bit more condensed milk. I also like peanut butter in my Chinese style French, which these don't have. 

I also had their cold milk tea, which again was pretty standard, although I thought there was a bit too much ice. 4/5
