qTYcqVFApm5bKlXZtmApVg I always come here and eat with my boyfriend's dad and his family and have been to this restaurant a couple of times with friends. The service is pretty good and the food is also really good. Definitely order the deep fried lobster, deep fried squid, SNAILS in black bean sauce. The soup that they serve is amazing and feels good for the soul (usually bigger tables). 

they only take cash here so make sure you remember to fill up your wallets!

Overall, good price, good service and good food.
