xftWto4IdilizsGdE07AQw Came here based on the good reviews, but it turned out to be a disappointing dinner. One star for friendly service. The food was horrible. It was your typical Chinese-fusion American fried wannabe Chinese food. Comparable to the kind you find at mall food courts.

The dinner special comes with a fried dumpling, a fried cream cheese stick, and a fried cream cheese Rangoon. The sesame chicken was basically a chicken cutlet (also fried) cut up into strips and drizzled with sesame chicken sauce. 

The wor wonton soup had a few dumplings with very little to no meat inside. Flavorless too. Sadly, not returning even if the service was good.
