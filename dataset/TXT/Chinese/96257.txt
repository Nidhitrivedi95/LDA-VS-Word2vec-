JkzqS4JDOpoHrj534rzvAA Have been meaning to come here for a long time. Worked out that today was the day. Came for late lunch, not crowded, some were having breakfast, some Chinese, some the daily salad special, and for me, Mexican. Service was very friendly, helpful and attentive. The fruit water was suggested, the watermelon version was delicious. Enchiladas were different than the typical, with just chicken inside, a green tomatillo sauce, and lots of lettuce dusted with cheese. Good beans and rice on the side. I'll be back, for Chinese and breakfast!
