DXP3MbE8srQITLlAuS45aQ The food in this restaurant is ok, but the service attitude is suck. Especially one waitress in this restaurant, she is so strict and never smile. She looks like my professor Mr. Kolenich because both of them seem to have a bad mood all the time.
If you love Chinese food, I recommend this restaurant to you, but you should better take out. Also, customers cannot choose the amount of tip because they will charge the tip automatically if you pay by card. Anyway, i don't like this restaurant, and i won't go to this restaurant anymore.
