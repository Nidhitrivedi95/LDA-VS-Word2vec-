UPF6nUKB_kbMM44xiEc66g Owners of Drift and Stingray, I give you props once again for opening up another fabulous place in Old Town.

I went a few weeks ago on a date night with my roomie and was beyond excited...I love going to new places for the food, drinks & chance to Yelp. Hah :)

It took a little longer than necessary for our server to greet us considering the place wasn't very busy but once she did, she was attentive and nice. 

The cocktails have hilarious names like the Woo Tang and the Woo Jito and aren't lacking in flavor or booze. I had the WooJito and it was yummy! 

We started off with the lettuce wraps which my roommate had heard were amazing and they didn't disappoint. The lettuce was fresh, the sauce was spicy and the chicken was fantastic. I stayed boring with the Cashew Chicken but it was so flavorful and the chicken was so tender that I didn't regret it. 

Can't wait to head back soon!
