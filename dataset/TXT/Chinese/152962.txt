t65yfB9v9fqlhAkLnnUXdg This place strikes me as suspiciously similar to the place that shut down further up Parliament just north of Prospect (Pho Indochina). I'm saying this because the pho here sucks in the same ways the pho sucked at the other place (probably contributing to the reason it shut down) -- as the other reviewer mentioned, super mushy, overcooked noodles, and really tasteless/watery broth. I also think it might be the same owners because the bowls used look similar to the bowls used at the other place, but I could be wrong. 

When we went there (for the first and last time), the waiter ignored us for the first 10 minutes. When some other guests came in after us, he chatted with them,  took their orders, AND served them before even acknowledging us. Normally I don't care that much about service if the food is good (why I keep going to Sukhothai despite their awful customer service), but if you're gonna serve bad food, you could at least try to make it up in service. Not so here.  

Anyway, really disappointing that no one seems to be able to cook a good bowl of pho on Parliament. Much better to walk, bike, or streetcar over to Mi Mi's on Gerrard, a block east of Broadview, or Que Ling off of Gerrard, first street on the south side (can't go wrong with a $4.40 bowl of pho). 

If you're really craving something pho-like, Sukhothai south of Dundas on Parliament has this Thai variation of it with hearty blocks of beef brisket that might do.
