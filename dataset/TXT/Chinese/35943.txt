AjcOXSV1ECKja4JqY3UIXg I haven't visited a Mandarin buffet for quite some time and I was so pleasantly surprised!!! Now, it was a special menu for the Chinese New Year, so I'm not sure how good they really are on a normal weekend lunch, but today, when I went, the selection was great.  The salads tasted amazing.  I particularly loved the broccoli cranberry salad.  It was a delight!  Each salad  had it's own distinct flavour, which I love,  I loved the grilled fish and chicken, they had salmon sashimi and tilapia sashimi (I didn't try the tilapia sashimi), barbecue salmon and a very nicely spiced and hot curry asian chicken.  The chicken wings tasted all right.  Overall, I really liked the place.  When you leave, they offer you a pink mint and a red envelope with a mandarin coin with a whole in the middle.  BIG PLUS: They have a frozen yogurt machine serving vanilla and strawberry AND a cotton candy machine!!!
