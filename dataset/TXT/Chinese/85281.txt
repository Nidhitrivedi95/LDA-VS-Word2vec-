HJ928N6c5Hh2KD3lYCuabA I wish I could give NO STARS!!! 

This was awful!!! My first experience at spring rolls and I am never going back. The food is horribly overpriced for very low quality. We ordered the green curry chicken(no flavor!!!!!) and the pineapple fried rice (where was the pineapple......it was also smothered in dried fish...is that where the flavor was supposed to come from?)

The chicken in both these dishes wasnt cut up properly, the broccoli pieces were the size of my fist...i could go go on...

This is a terrible excuse for a thai fusion...i really hope there is something better in Toronto ;(
