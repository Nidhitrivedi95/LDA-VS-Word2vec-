gDQlaDRAjsCx2p_p6oJLjw Oh, man, did I ever order from the wrong China Star! I should have read Meghan C's review first, for the correct location, but the food is also uninspired and mediocre at best. 

I call in a delivery order, and she tells me that it's an hour for delivery. Could I pick up? Yeah, sure, whatever. I place my order, and then she calls back to say they have no duck, and that I need to pick another entree. OK... After I drive to the wrong (an bustling) China Star in Squirrel Hill, I make my way to the correct (and completely empty) China Star in Greenfield. Boy, this food sure is disgusting. 

Hot and sour soup: inedible; vegetable spring rolls: stone cold, pale, and inedible; Double delight: chicken was stone cold, and the white sauce was a gloppy mess. The menu is already in the recycling, and maybe I'll try the other China Star next time.
