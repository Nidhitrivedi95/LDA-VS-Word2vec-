NE596RKQomLvdrWiM9DYWg Went here for lunch (well...afternoon snack) upon request from my parents.

We ordered two noodles: A vermicelli beef brisket noodle soup, and a satay beef home style friend noodle. The home style noodle actually tastes pretty good, similar to udon but a rougher texture. The vermicelli was...meh. It didn't seem to absorb very well with the soup, so when you chew it it tasted rather bland. I actually had to drink the soup base in order to get a bit of taste.

Drinks were surprisingly good, I actually liked the iced lemon tea here, and my dad was also satisfied with the iced milk tea.

Service was okay, but it wasn't busy when we went there so perhaps we got a bit more attention than some other reviews.
