pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og I'm seriously in love with Otaku. I crave this place, frequently. As evidence of my love for this place, in their first 3 months of opening I went there about 10 times, and I live 30 miles away. Perhaps "obsessed" is a better term here.

In addition to the above, I actually followed the sushi chef, Jay Chung, from his previous sushi joint. Turns out, this place was basically built for him, and for good reason! Better sushi is hard to come by, especially in the Phoenix metro!

My favorite option here is sitting at the sushi bar and ordering "omakase," or "chef's choice." Essentially, you just sit down and let the chefs get creative. They'll feed you anything and everything. I have yet to be disappointed with this option, and I am constantly wowed with what they create. The rolls are delicious and many are quite unique, with a great balance of rice, fish and filling. My poison, however, is sashimi. I would kill for a nice slice of tasty, fresh, raw fish. And Otaku does not fail here. In fact, they get some of the freshest sashimi I have ever had; it's truly impressive.

So if you go here, don't just have a california roll or something equally dull. Be brave, try something new, ask for recommendations, or just let the chefs feed you -- you will not be disappointed!
