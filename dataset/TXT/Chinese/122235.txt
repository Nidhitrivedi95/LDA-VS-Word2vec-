OfqTPtPSQfCVxaSlY4qAxg I used to come to this place a lot with my family when I was a kid. After many years of not eating here, I took my friend Carmon here for lunch hoping for some fantastic duck noodle soup. The duck was great, but the soup itself did not have much flavor, and they gave a skimpy portion of noodles. Our waiter was weird too, he took a long time to get us our hot tea and he brought each of us our food at different times. If you ever come here, get a whole duck or roasted pork to go. Those are the only good food items here.
