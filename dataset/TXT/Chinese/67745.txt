eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g My in laws were excited to treat my husband and me to Yu knowing how much we loved fisherman's lobster and crab specials. Foods were tasty, presentations were on point, service was better than standard Chinese restaurants ... Everything was going well until I bit into a plastic piece from the garlic stir fry veggie dish. It was actually sharp and cut into my cheek. Imagine the emergency room visit or the hospital stay I would have to go through if I swallowed that... Or choking hazard for younger kids.. I would like to live a long life and stay healthy. Your foods might be tasty but no thank Yu.
