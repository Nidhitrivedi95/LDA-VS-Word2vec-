js0ZzxVEDAkTdczCMT1emw I'm surprised that this place has such horrible reviews to start.

Pros: 
- This place is open until the wee hours at night. This is so convenient because it's when all the night owls come out and hunt for their favourite bubble tea shops 
- They have games! I can't remember how many nights I would make the trip to Markham (and I don't even live in the city) to play Monopoly Deal with my friends
- They have Polaroids! If you request it, they will take your picture with a Polaroid and stick it up on their wall (I have two up already ;D)
- There's always plenty of people here when I come which means that it must be a hot spot... but this can in turn become a con (because I prefer the couches which may be taken if this place becomes too popular)

Cons:
- The shop isn't very big. It can probably fix a maximum capacity of 25-30 people. 
- Typical bubble tea prices. If you aren't used to paying $5+ for a drink and don't like the idea of it, maybe bubble tea isn't your scene. 

Nonetheless, thank you for letting me catch up with friends on multiple occasions through talks, time wasting games and tapioca. Lambie Bubble Tea is the Asian version of Snakes & Lattes... only it's better!
