iIFcMHXGNDz8jbx_4H-xVQ Excellent Hakka food! I was a little wary of coming here because of the other reviews but don't be. I ordered the shrimp pakora, crispy beef and singapore noodles and they were all ridiculously delicious. Food came out quickly and I had no issues with staff at all. Definitely worth coming here if you are in the area!!!!
