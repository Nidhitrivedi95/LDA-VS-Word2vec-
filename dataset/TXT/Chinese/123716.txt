oMF1F795PpnITiNfOR1e2A Very interesting place to have a meal inside a temple it's not what you would except, I was pleasantly suprised at how nice the atmosphere was.
They could have had some more parking spaces that's the only issue I had otherwise it was a great meal I would recommend checking it out
