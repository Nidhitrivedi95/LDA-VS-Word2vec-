My family ordered about 6 different plates of rice noodle rolls to drive between the 4 of us, and as someone who immigrated from the Southern part of China, we could definitely say this reminded us of home. However, the price of $5+ per dish wasn't worth it, given how cheap the ingredients cost to make rice rolls. 

We also ordered some appetizers such as chicken rice dumplings and curry fish balls. The curry fish balls were a little bit spicy but the flavour was good. The chicken rice dumplings were absolutely terrible that it tasted stale and we didn't want to touch it again after taking our first bite!!!

Even though it was nice to taste rice noodle rolls as authentic as those back home, it wasn't worth the value for me to want to come back again.
