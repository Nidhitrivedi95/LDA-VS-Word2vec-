jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg This place was REALLY good.  My husband and I ordered the Family Meal B for 2, which came with so much food it could have fed 5!  And it was only $16 per person.   The food was really good too.  It came with hot and sour soup, egg rolls, dumplings, and another appetizer, pork fried rice, chicken chowmein, lemon chicken, and sizzling beef.  Seriously enough food to feed ALOT more than just 2.

Also, I forgot my credit card on the table and before I even made it out the door the waiter had handed it to me, making sure I didn't forget it. Also, the two hosts of the restaurant came to our table both while we ate, and after to make sure we had enjoyed our food. 

 Our 2 year old son also really enjoyed the huge fish tanks that had live fish and lobsters (which I'm sure were also on the menu).
