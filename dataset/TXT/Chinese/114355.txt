There are a few dishes that are always standouts, which are namely the the Crispy Ginger Beef, Hot Spicy Peanut Beef and the Hot Spicy Ginger Chicken (The Spicy Peanut sauce is also available with chicken or shrimp. I know this because they have twice given me chicken when the beef was ordered). I'd give all of these five stars. All of their meals, good or not, have also been very generous in terms of portion size. 

Other dishes however are disappointing in several departments. The General Tso, while decent in flavour, has always been slightly over cooked the 5 or so times I've ordered it (Get the previously mentioned Hot Spicy Ginger Chicken instead. It's very similar in flavour, but the breading and texture is far superior).  The Orange chicken sauce was bland and had sogged into the meat, making the coating mushy instead of crispy. The sweet and sour pork sauce was similar to the orange chicken sauce in nature, and the pork used had bones, meaning they had to be annoyingly spit out during the meal. Lemon chicken was also rather unimpressive, yet edible. 

Wait times can also be an issue. I once ordered a meal, explaining I'll be back in 20 mins. to pick it up. Upon returning, I had to wait another 45 mins to receive my order. In the mean time, a friend of mine coincidentally ordered from them as well 15 minutes later than me, showed up to pick-up his order while I was there, and received his 20 minutes before I got mine (which was a single dish). There have been other times where I've waited for extended periods as well (45 mins - 1hr), while the odd time it comes out in a relatively quick 15-20 minutes.  I'd say 25-30 minutes is the average in my experience (I've yet to have them deliver). 

Despite their shortcomings though, they're still a better bet and value than the other Chinese joints in the neighbourhood  (Jade's, Hai Feng, etc).
