RU3PsG2y_eGBFi_8jDqyQA The first time I came here was for lunch... service was great and sushi was good (spicy Mexican and Las Vegas rolls). Came in a second time for dinner and I was not pleased at all. The woman taking our order looked like she didn't even want to be there and had a bad attitude. Next, the food. I ordered chicken/shrimp Pad Thai, the flavor was just not there. The chicken was yellow and did not look or smell appetizing. My husband ordered "the spiciest" item on the menu, spicy chicken, which was not spicy at all and also lacked flavor. 
Then, sushi. We ordered the crispy rice?(don't remember the name) roll and it was the worst roll I've ever had. It had no flavor at all. The man who brought it over didn't bother to give us ginger nor wasabi. 
We will not be coming back to this place.
