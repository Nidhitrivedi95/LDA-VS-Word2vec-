They have a great selection when it comes to food - fresh sashimi, Chinese soups, assortment of popular Chinese dishes, noodles, desserts, you name it! I've been multiple times and would always go again. Only things to watch out for is that it is super busy on the weekends (maybe go earlier at 6pm) and the front reception and parking lot area can be like a zoo. Otherwise, you should definitely give it a try!
