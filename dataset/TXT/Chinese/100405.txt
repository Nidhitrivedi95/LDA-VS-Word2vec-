Jzz-ZLXsd2ClSn6UyFcbpw The food is good... But not worth the crappy customer service. When I can in, they had only a few other people seated. It took 20 minutes just to get someone to take our order, they never apologized or thanked us for our patience. The servers don't appreciate your business. After waiting to get our orders in, it too an additional 35 minutes to bring out our hot tea and food.... Very frustrating experience. Save your time and sanity and eat elsewhere!
