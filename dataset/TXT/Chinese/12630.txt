2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg Not from Toronto so I can't compare it to other Chinese restaurants in the city, but it was cheap and yummy food. It reminded me of being in a New York Chinatown restaurant. Service was typical Chinatown restaurant style--not very warm and friendly, but they got our food out efficiently.
