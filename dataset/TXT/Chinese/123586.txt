OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA I am not sure how this place received so many great ratings and a 1-$. We spent $123 on breakfast! Admittedly, we ordered a little more than the avg people, but the prices were outrageous. $18.95 for 1/2 roast duck. I'm from NYC and I'm used to seeing high prices but this place makes NYC Chinese restaurants look like a bargain. Someone in our group ordered a san Bo fan (three roasted items on rice) and it was $14.95. Same dish in NYC would be $5-$6. So these are just some comparisons for you. 

The worst part about this place isn't even the ridiculous prices. It's the fact that the food isn't good. We ordered a variety of noodle soups and congee and dimsum dishes. The noodle soup base was tasteless as were the dimsum dishes. It was incredibly disappointing. They forgot two of our dimsum dishes and it was towards the end of our meal so I requested they cancel it since they forgot it. 2 minutes later, she came out with those dishes refusing to let us cancel. We were already done with our meal by then. 
They also automatically tack on 10% gratuity which isn't so bad but with their horrible service, I would have left $2 instead of the $12. 

I am never ever going back to this place and everyone in my group agreed. Overpriced. Under tasted tourist trap. Save your money for all of the other places to eat around here.
