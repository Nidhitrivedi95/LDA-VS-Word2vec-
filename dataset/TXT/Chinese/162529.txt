I love handpulled flat noodles and this is the only place that does them well. Don't get the thick flat noodles though. They end up being ridiculously large and impossible to eat. The broth is always hot and flavourful, full of herbs and seasonings (but the light kind of beef broth, not the heavy dark kind) and the beef is yummy and well-marinated. The small is a slightly large portion of food for the average person. The medium is a very large portion of food that will be more than enough for almost everyone. The large is a bowl as larger as most salad mixing bowls and essentially comes with a little shovel instead of a spoon. If you're not a person who finishes the soup its more manageable, but still. Always add the tea egg, no question. The appetizer/side dishes are good but not worth it cost wise, plus you won't need the additional food. 

I always end up spending around $10 here. Don't bother coming if you're vegetarian. The vegetables they use are frozen and of poor quality and the broth is not comparable to the regular.
