fJCsDc353UC6eUn-kCBrGw Stopped here for lunch on a whim and we were glad we did. We started off with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Steamed Pork Dumplings. The chicken lettuce wraps were awesome. The iceberg lettuce they served with it was cold and crispy and held the steaming chicken mixture perfectly. They were like little tiny lettuce cups that were specifically made for this very reason. And then once you poured a little bit of the sauce in it was like heaven in my mouth! I was really looking forward to the steamed dumplings as it seems as if you can't get them hardly any more. Almost every place wants to fry them nowadays instead of simply serving them steamed. However these turned out to be cold. Not cold enough to send back but just lukewarm and enough so that the flavor just didn't pop. Somewhat disappointing. When our entrées arrived we tore ourselves away from the lettuce wraps to dig into those. I ordered the Salt-and-Pepper Prawns with a side of Lo Mein. I really enjoyed the flavor of the salt-and-pepper on the prawns and liked the fact that the breading was not too thick. I did not care much for the sauce they served with it. I'm not sure what it was but it had a vinegary taste to it. Hubby didn't care much for it either. He had the Mongolian Beef with brown rice. Unfortunately the first batch they sent out was way overcooked to the point of burnt and crispy and we had to send it back. They quickly brought us another one and it was much better. The beef was very tender and many of the green onions were still crisp which I really liked. Although we were both full and couldn't finish our meals we decided to order chocolate martinis for dessert. They were scrumptious and pretty potent! So all in all a good meal and we will definitely be back as we finally accrued enough points on our rewards card for a free entrée next time! Woohoo!
