jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg For those of you who are going to order Kung-Pao whatever and Cashew whatever, Fried Rice, Egg Foo Young, or Egg Rolls,  then complain how it wasn't good, better not eat here.  This is a Chinese Restaurant.

I wouldn't go to a fine Mexican Restaurant and Order Nachos Bell Grande or Meximelts for dinner.

With that said,  finding a good Chinese Restaurant in a desert would be challanging.  I am writing this as a customer with lots of Chinese restaurants tested. 

The ambience was conservative and they are open from 11am - 3am
The price was a bit higher, but not outrageous, but this is Las Vegas.
Good wine list, but not really apropo for some of the food here.

The seafood dishes we ordered were extremely fresh
We had a Stir-fried scallop and veggie dish that tasted very fresh and was cooked perfectly.
The sweet and pungent shrimp dish was very good. The sauce was made from fresh tomatoes and not ketchup like other restaurants.
The Filet Mignon dish was very good
The waiter had recommended the sauteed young pea leaves which btw was excellent.
We had a Fried Tofu dish that was standard, nothing special.
They used good quality rice for the steamed rice.

We skipped the pricier seafood dishes that spiraled near the $100 mark or more, but all in all we got out for $75.00 (not including tips) for 3 people.
We were too full for dessert so no reviews here

I would have to say I definitely would make a return trip here when I am back in Las Vegas again.
