An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg Deer Garden Signatures, not the most obvious name for a soup noodle place.  However, they do noodles very well and the way you want it.

Pros: 
Pick and choose your noodle the way you want.
Lot's of choice and variety

Cons:
Not Ramen type broth but still very good
Can get very busy at times

Bascially, you get a sheet to customize your noodles with.  You pick a broth, toppings (you get 2 toppings to start, $1.50 for any additional toppings), type of noodles, and a drink.  There are many choices to choose from.  You think Harvey's gave you choice, this place takes choice and puts it on steroids.  Each noodle comes automatically with cabbage, mushrooms and bean sprouts and you can choose whether you want those or not as well.  You have full control over what goes into your noodle.  Love the concept.  Each noodle ordered also gets to purchase 2 sides for a discounted price.

The noodle itself is a very good soup noodle.  The broth could be better but's it more than satisfactory.  Portion size is more than enough for the $8.75 base price.  I was very full by the end of the noodle I didn't even have room for my drink while I was there.  I wasn't the most hungry at the time though.  I would of liked to see an add extra noodle option but that's just me being a glutton.  The drink comes conveniently in a to go cup, which is nice.

The service is also pretty good.  The place can get pretty busy at time so it might get a bit slow.  For the most part the ladies working were all very nice and speedy as they could be.  Experience was very good one.

I would definitely go back to this place to try other combinations.  I was delightedly satisfied and you will be too if you like Chinese soup noodles too.
