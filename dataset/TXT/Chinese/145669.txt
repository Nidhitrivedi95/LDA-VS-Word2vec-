S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ Had the banh mi, fresh spring rolls, and strawberry green tea boba and I was very, very satisfied.  The banh mi was nice and toasty, the peanut sauce for the spring rolls was a bit lumpy just the way I like it!   Price was nice and people were cool,  a little empty the few times I went there though - might be due to the fact its tucked way in the back of a random complex on Spring Mountain road.
