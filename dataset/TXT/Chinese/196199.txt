zLC9OtK3SKAW_g6SXijr4w The best Chinese buffet this side of Hims. Forget the decor, forget the size of the joint - the food more than makes up for any conceivable inconvience you may think up. The price is right, sure they gouge you on the drink price - they all do - but get water if that gets you butt hurt. Like I said, the food is killer here. I'm coming back, hopefully it's not crowded when I get here.
