kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A i am a lover of all things noodle.
i especially love knife cut, hand pulled, fresh noodles.
noodle man satisfies that craving for me just well enough.

i would say it's "good enough for vegas", a statement i dislike very much no matter how true it might be for so many places in town, especially chinese food joints.
although i would love to give it 4 or 5 stars, it just doesn't reach that mark for me.
i've been here quite a few times now and each time something has gone wrong; losing the receipt and making me sign a new one, giving us food from another table, giving us the wrong dish altogether, giving us the right dish with the wrong noodles, etc.
i think the worst was the last time i was there.
i ordered the shanxi knife sliced noodle soup whose description reads "beef brisket, sweet potato vermicelli, black fungus, pickled cabbage, green onion, and cilantro", with a picture to match.
when the dish came to me, it was basically beef noodle soup with some chunks of beef and some pickled cabbage.
i mentioned to the server that it was the wrong dish and she replied, "no, it's the right one. the picture on the menu is not the same", to which i replied, "well, maybe the menu should reflect the correct dish then, don't you think", and she shrugged her shoulders.

my favorite dish here is probably the spicy wontons.

like i said, it satisfies my craving for knife sliced noodles just enough that i will return every so often.
