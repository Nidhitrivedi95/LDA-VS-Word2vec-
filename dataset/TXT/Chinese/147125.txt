safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg I had a severe hankering for Chinese food, and I didn't want to drive across town to Long Life Vegetarian to fulfill my need. Well, the wife and I had stopped at Smith's for some shopping when I noticed out of the corner of my eye, a sign...that said Golden Dragon Chinese. I didn't event blink and the next thing I knew I was standing outside looking at the menu. It seemed standard for your strip mall Chinese, and they had some veggie options. 

When we walked in, we were greeted by the waitress. The place was a bit empty, but it was after the typical dinner time (7:45pm) so we thought nothing of it. The dining area is actually bigger than you would think looking from the outside. It is well lit, and it is immaculately clean. A big plus. 

The menu was pretty standard. We went with veggie & tofu chow mein (the wife's sweet and spicy, mine standard). We also ordered the cream cheese won-tons. However, we didn't ask, and found out that the cream cheese won-tons do contain fish. Bummer...I was craving those real bad. 

The service was quick, we had our entrees in about 10 minutes or less. The servings were massive, enough for 2 meals. The veggies were very fresh, and cooked well to leave them still a bit crunchy. The tofu was cooked well, but it wasn't firm. The sweet and spicy dish was actually sweet and spicy. Not too spicy, but enough to give it some interest. 
For 2 entrees and 1 app it came to under $20 which was also nice. 

I would give the place 4 stars, but need to check it out again, and ask more questions about the veggie friendly fare.
