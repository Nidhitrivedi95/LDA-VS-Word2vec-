AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA This place is ok. Maybe it's great for vegetarians but I went with a friend who is vegetarian and I am not. I didn't like the fake meat and even thought I was told it would taste like real meat, I don't think it did. I think a vegetarian or vegan would love this place but I prefer real meat for sure.
