PMsqD6wHCfxdrZkGXIepvA This restaurant is truly epic. I come to Toronto a couple times a year to visit family, and we go to Mandarin often. We always love how every single staff member that greets you says "Welcome to Mandarin!" very, very quickly. 

This is one of the biggest Chinese buffets I have ever seen, and the food is delicious and well prepared. A couple of times I have made my way up there for their Dumpling Festival, which usually coincides with Chinese New Year, and boy is that delectable! The display of the food is also gorgeous, and it has the best sushi at a Chinese buffet I've ever had.

The one docked star is because it is missing my all time favorite buffet food: Lo Mein. They have these thinner, harder, less saucy (and probably better for you) noodles, of which I forget their name. Get some lo mein and you'll be perfect in my book.
