EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw Me and my husband decided to check Dim Sum Cafe out since it is right by our house and its great! The restaurant is open with a lot of seating and the staff is very friendly. When we went we did not see a dim sum cart probably because it was later in the night and not many customers were in and actually im not too sure if they even have one haha. Over all the Dim Sum is great, everything is tasty and we enjoyed the whole experience.
