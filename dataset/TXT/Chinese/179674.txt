X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Came here to see DJ Tiesto. Tickets on a Sunday night was so much cheaper for guys than on a Friday night  ($30 vs $75). Compared to Marquee, this place is a lot smaller. Although they have 2 rooms (hip hop on bottom and edm on top), it is still not enough to fit the amount of people who are here to see these world renowned DJ's. Common, if you're building a new club in Vegas, you have to build it big. 

Furthermore, there isn't even an outdoor area here. Although I did have a good time, it would be much better if the club was bigger.
