wOmtCPiB-xeU-HknjTW4hQ We visited Diamond China for dine in and take out many times; we have lived in Summerlin since 2000 and was sorry to see it close up. We thought at first "dirty dining" which was not the case. We, hubby, son and myself, stopped there for dinner Sunday night; The restaurant has a refreshing new look, flooring, booths, tables. We ordered the 2nd meal for 2-6, extra shrimp skewers, won ton soup, egg rolls, cheese wonton, lemon chicken (was ok, coating a bit dry; use duck sauce for dipping) beef chow fun, special chow mein, pork fried rice and must tell you everything was hot, delicious and the bill was not expensive for our order (plus take home!) The wait staff/servers are nice and friendly and kept sodas full. I like that the noodles weren't plain, bland beige. Colorful orange along with the veggies and meats. Next time will try sesame beef and orange chicken and who knows what else. Keep up this 5 star rating!! Debbie, Gene and JR..
