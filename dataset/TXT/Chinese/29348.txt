9-lGjghZUEPmKyviTyYLUA A good friend of mine told me about this new restaurant.  I have been looking long and hard for authentic hand pulled noodles in GTA that matches Peaceful Restaurant (Vancouver) and Lan Zhou Noodles (Montreal).  Kung Fu Noodle is the best in GTA that I have tried.  

The broad noodles had amazing chew.  The broth had lots of flavor (accomplished with minimal amount of sodium).  My wife had the stir fried noodle and we both thought there was much too much garlic in that dish.  Stick with the noodles in soup broth.

Restaurant is clean and service was excellent.  I am a fan and will be returning.
