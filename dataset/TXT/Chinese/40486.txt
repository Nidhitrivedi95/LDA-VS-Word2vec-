B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA I just moved to the area from the east side where I had already established my favorite place to eat Chinese food. I always compared other places to that one spot and none compared in taste. I didn't feel like cooking and started to map the closest places to me. Mr. Beijing popped and I immediately noticed they had the family dinners available. Ordered Dinner A with chow mein and mangolian beef, spicy. Delivery arrived timely and I had the BEST greeting! "Here's your delicious food!" That was awesome! And, I must say... the food WAS delicious!!!! The only thing is the hot and sour soup needed a bit more flavor and sourness but I added some lemon and garlic. Overall, it was excellent and I definitely will be re-ordering from Mr. Beijing as well as recommending this place to others.
