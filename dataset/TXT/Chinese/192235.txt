z_XUh5ep_Fj8s95SlriNZw I've had three sessions with Dr. Brookman for some pains I was experiencing in my arm after a skateboarding accident. I have been feeling better after every session. In addition, I feel that she went above and beyond by recommending some herbs that I can take along with a few dietary suggestions. All I can say is that I'm truly impressed and trust Dr. Brookman. She is very affordable as well.
