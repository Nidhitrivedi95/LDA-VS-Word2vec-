fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA A typical restaurant in Chinatown (i.e. substandard service), grungy looking especially the restrooms, decor stereotypical and a dragon lady owner to boot. This is a home style cooking establishment with questionable food handling practices and high probability of contracting e.coli. The dumplings are nothing awe inspiring, cathartic or earth shattering enough to keep me coming back for more.  For my personal health and peace of mind I would go somewhere else.
