O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw The most striking feature? Everything runs incredibly quickly here.

I was seated, ordered, received tea and water, and received my food in less than five minutes, seriously.

I'll reiterate that the food is yummy. And the tables are clean! That's the magic of disposable plastic table"cloths", I guess. And while the portions are a bit smaller than average, but the prices are accordingly lower ($3.28 for shrimp dumplings!)

Even though it was busy, I never felt rushed - I only noticed afterwards the huge room in the back.

$9 for one person, yum.
