xhCedppPevQmpaxQqSbp7g I've always come to Mandarin (whether this one, or other locations) not out of my choosing. To state the obvious: this is Westernized Chinese food 101. I won't be too proud to admit that I can find some guilty pleasure in some of it (though my bloated-ness and fatigue after eating is not pleasurable). That said, why would you ever want to pay over $20 for food no better than Manchu Wok at a food court near you? I'm not even saying it to be cruel: the food is directly on par with Manchu Wok. Won't the chow mein or fried rice with 3 sides at $8.99 suffice for people? And some of the 'unique' things they offer over Manchu Wok are either forgettable (dessert) or plain nasty (sushi).
I'll give them credit for running a tight ship and always having good service. But I won't lie to say that I cringe anytime I hear 'x' family member wants their birthday dinner there, and I can basically throw away my valued (and limited) money.
