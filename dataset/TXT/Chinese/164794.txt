UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w I went to this place yesterday. It was really close to my hotel(Rio), the price for dinner was good. Foods was ok, dessert was great but there was a waitress middle age with black hair and glasses she was really rude! I have never ever seen something like this before! I was speaking with her and she rolled her eyes and went! When I asked her for tea she was angry! She was rude when she we asked for something she threw spoon on the table! Never recommend never come back again!
