My husband and I went in for dinner recently and ordered edamame, as well as one roll each. The edamame was fine, the service was great, but unfortunately I have to say that the sushi was just mediocre. I've had much better sushi at other small local places. The variety in the rolls was also just ok. I was bummed... If we want sushi again, I think we will go elsewhere.
