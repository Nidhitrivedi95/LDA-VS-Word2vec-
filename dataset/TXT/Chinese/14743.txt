3HrT5IcO3sd4pSBCFP4OYw Was not sure after seeing the mixed reviews, but it is always good to make up your own mind. My GF and I went last night (Xmas eve) and the staff was amazing! They were all super friendly and accommodating. We got the Mongolian Beef and Volcano Chicken (both with Lo Mein noodles). Both dishes came out quickly and were delicious! The meats were tender and cooked just right, The veges were very fresh and not over cooked. with a bit of crunch 

The table across from us had ordered the Sizzling Hot Beef Plate that was reviewed earlier. It might have been a dud that time, it was a winner this time. The metal plate was so hot you could smell the wooden holder underneath it (kind of like summer camp craft class). When the server put the beef on the hot plate, it was like a fourth of July Fajita! It sizzled like crazy and then went up in flames when the server poured the Ginger wine on it. Very impressive and the people said it was great. 

We will deff go back for that and the rest of the menu.
