5XX1w4WbwSlrACQ5vKuLDw Really really good pho. We were craving pho while visiting Montreal and came here. It's right on the main strip, one flight below street level. The place is spacious and clean. The sauce bottles weren't dripping from usage. I had #11 rare beef and brisket; the small size was good for me. The beef was fresh and sliced thin. The noodles were perfectly done and the accoutrements were so fresh. Now the broth - flavorful and clean, really outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant.
