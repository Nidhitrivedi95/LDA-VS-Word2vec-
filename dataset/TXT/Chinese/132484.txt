pofDmHoIsdvPcSKzb2iMag I checked this place out because they had carts, like dim sum is supposed to be. Got a spot far from where carts would pass by. I had to chase them. And what I found in those steamers was far below the average I have experienced so far-- I must have been in 30 dim sum places around North America now including San Francisco
