JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A One thing I really miss about Southern California is the vast selection of Asian restaurants. It's pretty slim pickings out here in Glendale unfortunately. When I found Cafe Ga Hyang in the Phoenix, I seriously jumped for joy. Stopped in with my family this past weekend and basically had a huge feast. We ordered:

-Ddeokboki appetizer: rice cakes cooked and tossed in a spicy sauce. There is even some veggies and fish cake thrown in. SO GOOD and A MUST ORDER. 
-Jjamppong (or Cham Pong as it's written in the menu): spicy seafood noodle soup. It's pretty large so either order with a group of friends or when you are EXTREMELY hungry. Delicious! My mom was raving about it.
-Dolsat Kalbi Bibimpap: Rice mixed with veggies and beef. Sounds very plain but it seriously delicious. It comes with sauces on the side so you can personalize it a bit. This was my sister's favorite.
-Naengmyun = Cold Noodles. I can't really describe this dish too well. It's buckwheat noodles served in a bowl of ice water, rock sugar and pickled veggies. Sounds funny I know, but it is actually really good. I enjoyed this dish as it was a nice palate cleanser for all the spice I was eating.

For a Korean restaurant, the service was actually pretty good. It seemed like there was only one waitress working the entire restaurant but she checked on us often and was nice. My only quip was that overall the restaurant could have been a bit cleaner as my table was somewhat sticky when I arrived hah, but the delicious food made up for it for the most part. I shall be back!
