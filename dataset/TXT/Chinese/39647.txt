aWu1homxB6lciXU6-ZlpSQ We came here as Chris Jerk doesn't open on Sunday... I tried the popcorn chicken with rice. For $6.49 + tax you get a generous portion of popcorn chicken, rice, soup/water and a choice of three sides.

For the price, it was quite a good deal..my only complaint is that the sides are cold (they try their best to cover it with foil to keep it warm or clean but it still gets cold!).

They also serve a ton of other very traditional Taiwanese dishes such as stinky tofu, three cups chicken, Taiwanese sausage, noodles, etc.

There are about 4-5 small tables and plenty of utensils/napkins available which is appreciated.
