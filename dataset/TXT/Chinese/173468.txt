W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g It's hard to find good Asian food in this part of the country...so I didn't really have high hopes for this place. It was right next to my next work appointment which made it convenient enough. I got in there around 1 -2pm for a late lunch. 

Food: 
They were out of Pho =(
I ordered what I typically order to test the skill of the chef. I ordered a Chow Fun.
Chicken Chow Fun - It wasn't too greasy, didn't clump, and had a good balance of flavor. I approve. Not the best but definitely not bad. 

Service: 
Friendly staff. Owners work hands on as well. They seem to know half the customers walking in. 

Environment: 
Very pseudo Asian design in here...like the stuff you see on TV. I actually felt like I was sitting in an Asian porn set. Not that I know what an Asian porn set looks like....but...ok...nevermind...

Price: 
Well priced for the type of food. Honestly if they raised their prices...people would still come because there is not much else nearby.
