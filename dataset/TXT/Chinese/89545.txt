I7eqTdTmRTWYwF9HNZAHxw Quite possibly one of the best Asian restaurants I've ever been to. Who would have thought you could find that in Arizona?!?

The interior is very open, with a classy feel and high ceilings. The staff was all extremely welcoming throughout the entire dining experience. 

We started with a few appetizers, my favorite being the Spicy Cucumber salad, which was so delicious. I'd never tried anything like it before. We split a few entrees, some common staples (Pad Se Ew and a shrimp curry), but the entree that unexpectedly stood out was the Hot and Spicy Eggplant. I've never ever had eggplant prepared like that - the strips were cooked so they almost melted in your mouth (not chewy like I anticipated), and were soaked in a dark brown sweet and spicy sauce. Amazing!

We were far too stuffed to try dessert, but I can only imagine how good that would have been. A five star spot for sure!
