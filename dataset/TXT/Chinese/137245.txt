qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA Love the food here! Walked into Heart Sushi for a weeknight AYCE dinner. Been here a few times already so I know what to expect. Yes they use the iPad ordering system so food comes quicker than the old pen and paper system. Some food doesn't arrive so you have to remind a server to follow up. Thankfully, this time around every order started trickling in around 5-7 minutes after hitting the Send Order button.

I stay away from ordering the Chinese dishes because they do taste a little bland. Besides when I eat at an AYCE sushi restaurant, my appetite is screaming for sushi or sashimi! Every time I have eaten here their sushi/sashimi is fresh. Their Korean kalbi pieces are good at times when we are served the good parts but sometimes I do get a lot of fat on the trim.

So that you are all aware, when you are seated in the back-to-back banquettes, sometimes the person behind you has a tendency to move around a lot. Do not lean back on the seat if you plan on resting for awhile or you will feel the impact of the person behind you.

For the most part though, place is clean and most of the staff speaks English well. Food is great and the presentation of sashimi (for dinner only) on an illuminated bowl of ice makes my dining experience a lot of fun.
