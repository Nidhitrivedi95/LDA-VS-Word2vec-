Started with jasmine tea, don't get the black tea when jasmine is available, it is so much  better.

Wife ordered and we got thinly sliced pork with bamboo and fried tofu. There is also sliced leaks and celery. It is one of my favorites. Pretty healthy and tastes awesome. I could eat most of it myself. 

Also had the sliced pork and rice cakes (mochi for you Japanese aficionados). This is sautéed with salted mustard cabbage which is just amazing. One of my favorite vegetables. Got to find out how they make it. Rice cakes are tender and flavorful.

Those two dishes are not your run of the mill. They have orange chicken and Kung pao too but you can get that at Panda Express. 

The one thing that I want to try is the Peking Duck but you need to call ahead. Perhaps next time.
