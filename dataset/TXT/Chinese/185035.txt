xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw Genghis is okay. I have had better and I have had worse. It's nice being able to customize your bowl and adding only what you want. You can really stack a lot of protein into your bowl and the price is the same. Service is average- nothing notable to me. For a quick tasty lunch, genghis is good.
