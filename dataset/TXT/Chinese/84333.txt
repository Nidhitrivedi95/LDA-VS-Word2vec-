HgL6gGEGoAUBKGrT6BXU4Q I'm actually rather shocked by the reviews, come here with my girlfriend once ever 2 or so weeks. It's fantastic. The rice isn't over seasoned but has an extremely pleasant hint of ginger. Chicken, having almost zero seasoning on it, some how is filled with flavour, definitely don't use msg because I have an allergy to it, so that was a plus for me. The chicken skin, which some people have complained about is my favourite thing here. The trick is to take the skin, put a little bit of hot sauce and rice on it and devour it. It's absolutely delicious. I will continue coming to this gem on spadina regardless what haters say, and you should too. Their simplicity on the menu is a bonus, don't need to look at pages for 15 minutes to decide what you want. They have successfully perfected the poached chicken and rice in my eyes, no need to distract people with loads of options. Give it a try folks, you'll enjoy it.
