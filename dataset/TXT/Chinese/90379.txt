And even that wouldn't necessarily be a deal breaker, except, they pretty much hide the price from you, until it's too late.  What do I mean by "hide"?  They don't list it anywhere on the menu.  They only tell you, if you ask, once the food is already ordered. They also strongly suggest trying two different broths, but don't tell you there's a $3 surcharge to do so. You find that out when you get your bill. Now, I will tell you, the hot pot is pretty good, although, not the best I've ever had.  But good. They bring you as many items as you want, and will keep it coming. But how much soup can one eat??? When we got our  bill, and it was $72 for two people, for SOUP, plus 3 tsing taos, we got a little cranky. This place is probably a really good deal if you're starving, and can eat and eat and eat.  But if you're just normal hungry, there's very little way to justify spending $72 for two people for soup.  And they don't let you take home your left overs, of which there's a considerable amount. Seems incredibly wasteful to me. Next time, we'll hit the noodle shop next door, and save ourselves $50, and walk away feeling like we got a good value, and weren't bamboozled. If you decide to go, a little advice, don't get any of the spicy broths.  They're delicious, but the heat squashes your appetite.  So order the mildest broth they have, and load up on the meats to get your money's worth.
