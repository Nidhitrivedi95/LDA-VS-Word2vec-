vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA We were craving dim sum for dinner and heard from friends this place was one of the best in town. Their dinner dim sum menu is limited to 8-10 items and char siu bao is not on it. We were disappointed about that but the dim sum did have was really good. I recommend the baked Bbq pork bun. The bun was flaky and fresh out of the oven. 

Since most of our dim sum favorites were not on the dinner menu, we ended up getting the walnut shrimp and the yang chow fried rice. Both were really good and we left happy.
