Much better does exist out there... somewhere... and cheaper too.  Unfortunately, they don't exist as close by for when I need my version of comfort food.

Short answer is yes, they'll do if you got a hankering.  I went for a low risk chicken chow mein.  If they can pass this simple test, then at least I can give them another shot later on.  Decent ingredients and decent serving size, but I'd say about 25% over-priced.  Tastey noodles; therefore they'll receive a passing grade from me.  Stir fried just right and without excessive oil.  When I can't take it any more, I'll probably be back.

The Asian staff was a bonus, but it looked to me that the menu had been Americanized some.  Sad what has to be comprised in order to survive.  I guess my biggest qualm is that I've been spoiled by growing up surrounded by good, cheap, authentic Chinese food.  So when an establishment can't meet all three criteria, I just pine for days of ol'.  Maybe my standard isn't terribly fair, but since I know it to exist, the burden is on them.
