a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg I grew up in the Valley and as a teenager we'd visit Jade Palace on Shea at least every month or two.  Then I moved to another part of town and found a local Chinese restaurant near me that I came to enjoy on a regular basis.

Well, I was meeting a group of college friends for a late lunch on Xmas day, and Jade Palace was central for many of us so we gathered there.

Server was nice, but not amazing (when 20% tip is automatically added to the bill for a group of 12, I expect top-notch service).  Food was good too, with a decent portion size and flavor.  Nothing amazing, but it was good food in a nice place.

However, what really shocked me and my guests was... #1) the very limited menu (it was just 1 page, large type, with only 3-4 chicken dishes, 2 noodle dishes, a few beef and shrimp entrees and 2-3 soups/appetizers like egg rolls.)... and #2) the ridiculous prices!  Because of Xmas, they took away most of the menu options AND they jacked up the prices on EVERY item that they did offer.  These weren't special holiday recipes or entrees, just increased prices on their everyday items!  (Our server confirmed this, and tried to justify it as "not many places are open today").  I tried to order moo-shoo, but was told they wouldn't make it.  It was an assembly line process, with some of their more popular items premade in bulk, offered over-the-top prices.  If I want that type of food, I'd go to the fast food Chinese place (and save $$ too).

WOW!--  That's not what the holiday spirit is all about.  It's because you are one of only a handful of places open on Xmas that you do so well.  The wait was long, but I doubt anyone choosing to dine there anticipated the limited menu or raised prices.
The owners are greedy, taking advantage of loyal regulars and new customers who decide to give them a try on this day.  

It's sneaky, it's wrong and I vow to NEVER step foot in or oder from this place again.
