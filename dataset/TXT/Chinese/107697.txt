LckZpP8V1F5zU5ZKVrhp2Q Came here on a Sunday night and there was no parking because there was a party at the banquet hall. Managed to wait for a parking space because it was 11pm and guests from the banquet hall were starting to leave. 
We went inside and were seated straight away. It wasn't too busy. We ordered a variety of the bbq sticks. We got lamb sticks(spicy and non spicy), chicken wings, sausage, mushrooms, corn, chicken carcass and chicken. We also ordered a portion of deep fried buns (man tau) that came with the condensed milk, for dipping. And a picked veg and fish soup dish. The bbq items we got were not that great. The lamb sticks had not much cumin and spices and the meat was dry and chewy. The other items were ok but all were lacking spices. We had gone to Harbin Bbq a few previous nights before, and their bbq food was way nicer. The wings were the cheap tiny wings too. 
Would not really go out of my way to come here again. Parking lot looks rough and sketchy and I've  had much better lamb sticks at other places.
