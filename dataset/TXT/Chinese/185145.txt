XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA GB is pretty new to the block. With a simple menu, GB offers a bowl of beef (pork or veggie as well) noodles where you can choose the size and thickness of your noodle. Size 3 was recommended by the waiter making for slightly thicker than spaghetti style noodles. I got mine spicy although there are chillies sauce on every table for you to customize it yourself. Definitely recommend getting a small (and maybe extra meat) as the bowl is more than filling enough!
