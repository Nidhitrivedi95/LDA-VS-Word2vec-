This place easily makes 7-10,000 daily average and I came in to get a thai tea to go with no ice and the supposed owner at the register fills it 3/4 of the way and said if you want more it's extra. Doesn't care about his customers to top it off 10oz. To be cheap. On top charged my card twice and gave me incorrect cash back. If customers read this at least they will just make the effort to go next door and get better service. These days it's more about customer service and reviews online than turning into a fast food place.
