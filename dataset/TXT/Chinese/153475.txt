taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg today was my first time at Qing Hua - the first of many more to come. upon entering i noticed a number of quirky decorations and a somewhat curious split between a cafeteria style seating area and a more intimate section, but the place is small enough that i felt lucky just to get a table. my companion very cleverly called ahead to order so almost as soon as we arrived, we were greeted with their new soup (as of the start of this year). while it was only so-so (hot & sour soup consistency without hot or sour flavours; it looked rather like plum sauce with tofu but was rather tasteless), i knew there was more to come. the carrot-cabbage-vermicelli salad had a deliciously sweet dressing and was devoured in no time. it was followed by another delicious salad, and although i couldn't identify it, it was wonderful. then came the dumplings. we ordered pork & shrimp, beef & celery and curry chicken. all three were steamed and absolutely perfect. with a splash of bouillon in each, every bite was fresh, textured and simply bursting with flavour.

the entire meal came to just about $40 before tip. this included two soups, a decent sized salad, a second smaller salad, and about 30 dumplings in all. i couldn't ask for a better value or more flavour. the staff were courteous and accommodating making this my new favourite place to eat!

(sorry for raving, but it really was that good. i'm sure other reviews will be more critical.)
