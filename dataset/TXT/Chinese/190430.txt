YKHCSOBLCHpb5K6GgaabCQ I had never tried Panda Express due to my own personal skepticism. When a coworker mentioned that it was good, I decided to give it a try. She was not wrong. It is surprisingly good! So good, in fact, that I have eaten here several times since my last check in.

I take lunch later than most people (2pm) so I have not experienced any problem with getting what I want. The Chow Mein noodles are consistently fresh. The Orange Chicken is always flavorful, the Beijing Beef satisfies my need for fried meat, and the fried shrimps are always big enough to satisfy my appetite.

I have to admit, I have only tried the fried meats, and I am happy to keep it that way. Give it a shot. It is A-Ok.
