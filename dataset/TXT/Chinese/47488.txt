bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ I love this place.  My husband and I stumbled on it when driving by.  We have been back several times.  Honestly, I am usually disappointed by the Chinese food found in Vegas (*disclaimer, I have not explored China town: we live too far away to go on whim). This is BY FAR my favorite Chinese place on our side.  I am in love with the Walnut Shrimp and my husband really likes their fried rice.  The broccoli is never mushy, the ragoons actually have flavor, I have never been disappointed.

The tables are a bit cramped, but the service is always pleasant.  They are very polite and attentive, and seem to know what I want before I do. =)
