hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA Been here dozens of times and it still hasn't dissatisfied me. The food is good, always the same quality--between good and great, never something amazing. Service is good and recently they've been opening a little earlier than 11. Sushi is decent, never got problems with it. 

One star off for the food and service just being good, not spectacular.
Another star off for lacking in some areas. Deserts and fruits are their weak points--and I love deserts! 

Go here if you just want a no BS asian buffet. Good all around, but not great at anything.

EDIT: I've been here for dinner. Not exactly worth the extra $$$ for the dinner service, but they do have different dishes. The coconut chicken (which is the "leftovers" bits of the chicken (skin, tendons, scraps) at lunch) turns to coconut shrimp, they add in some seafood, and the choppy tri-tip mix.
