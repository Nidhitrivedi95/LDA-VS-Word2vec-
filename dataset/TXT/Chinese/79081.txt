GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Everything here was fantastic, but for one thing: the Shrimp Mojo is highly overrated and downright subpar. It is drowned in sauce that overpowers the shrimp itself, and the sauce isn't even all that good. It was especially disappointing because we weren't going to get it, but our waitress said it was to die for. It cost $18, but shouldn't have been more than $5.

If you go with a big enough group (3 or 4 people), it's probably better to make your own tasting menu than to pay the $55 or $75 for their tasting menu. We as a group of 4 just asked them what was on it, got all of that except for the guacamole plus several other dishes, and could not have been happier (except, of course, with the shrimp). The best things we had were: Tuna Ceviche, When Pigs Fly, Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You, Dan Dan Mian, and Mongolian Beef Lettuce.

Can't wait to come back!

PS, when it comes to the drinks, the Mezcal Negroni and Salt Air Margarita are both amazing. I'd avoid the Jade Garden, however. It was kind of boring.
