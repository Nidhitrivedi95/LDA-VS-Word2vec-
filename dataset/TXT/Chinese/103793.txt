KMYLwjpx6cjanynnc4mJvw This restaurant is a place to go for fast food Chinese. It is not authentic Chinese place far from it. The fried rice there is very good and the chicken terryaki is okay. I have eaten at this place since they opened. Real simple food with slight asian flair. Nothing special. Staff is always friendly and super nice.
