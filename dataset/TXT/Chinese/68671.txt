eV-5b1Bjtnn-QePN3t3taQ Coming from the Bay Area, have been looking for a decent place like this in Vegas. Not a huge selection like some say, but they have a good amount to choose from still...and what they have tasted fresh, and to be honest, was plenty to choose from. Come hungry. Cool place. Will definitely come again. If you like stir fry type things, and like picking your ingredients and putting them into a bowl, to then be grilled in front of you, this place does the job.
