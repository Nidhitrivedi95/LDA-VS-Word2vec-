Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw I'll be honest, after reading the reviews for this place, I really, really wanted to love them. The restaurant itself is very clean, inviting, and the staff really sweet. The menu had everything I was looking for on it. I was making a quick stop for lunch before meeting up with someone, figured I had plenty of time.

I placed my order, got some water with lemon in it, and then glanced at my phone - woops - I had miscalculated and was going to be late, especially if I took my time eating! It was totally not their fault, they were on it with the service, it was all on me.

Glad that I hadn't ordered anything more exciting than water, I grabbed my purse and went up to the front counter. I apologized and asked if I could change my order to to-go. She was cool about it. A few minutes later, I had my bagged up lunch and was out the door. I made my appointment in time, and, luckily, it was casual enough that they didn't mind if I whipped out my chopsticks and started munching away.

I had ordered the orange peel chicken. It sounded really good on paper. It tasted like...salt. Honestly, I found nothing really good about it. Nothing really bad, either, just kind of meh, like grocery store Chinese. I had ordered it spicy, and it wasn't. It was just so-so.

Just for the record, when I order "spicy" - babes, that means melt my face, curl my hair, steam out my ears spicy. Not just extra salt. Perhaps there was a communication problem?

I gave them three stars (rounded up from 2-1/2, which isn't an option) for service and because I'm willing to come back with the hubby to try other things. Based on the other reviews, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try again. They've been here a long time and I haven't. Maybe we were both having an off day?
