D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA We had a late lunch at Yong Kang Street. 
My boyfriend got the lobster fried rice and I had the BBQ pork fried rice. He added something spicy and I added duck sauce. It was the perfect amount of food and tasted great.
The best part was the Steamed Pork Dumplings. Freshly made and tasted amazing. 
Great, friendly service.
