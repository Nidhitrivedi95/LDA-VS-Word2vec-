KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw Great tasting food and great value - the lunch special of $5.95 can't be beat.  We dined in and had the Chicken in hot garlic sauce and the Pork in garlic sauce.  Both were fantastic and came piping hot just out of the wok!  The portion was enough for two meals and that was what we did - doggy bagged to take home.  Place is clean and service is prompt and friendly.  Will be back many times.
