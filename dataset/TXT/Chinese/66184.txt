Ef9crW61OYp2UJ0ysi3nEw I've always liked this place because it's super super cheap and the food is edible. My husband and I always eat for about $13. It's nothing fancy but does the trick for cheap Chinese. I usually stick with the chicken fried rice and crab Rangoon. And they always throw in a couple egg rolls for us.
