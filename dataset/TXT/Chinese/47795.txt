c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ Maybe we should have come here when we were drunk. We came here as our first stop in Vegas in the morning. Like everyone, me and my friends ordered the steak and eggs special, except for our party pooper friend who wanted pancakes.

The steak was okay. I've had better but of course the price correlates to the quality I guess? I really wish the steak and eggs special was still $4.99 instead of the new price of $8.99 though. Also I think this special is a midnight special from 12am-8am, methinks.

I noticed there were a lot of people at the time we were there. A mixture of old and young people. Ah, it's Vegas. Everyone comes out to play in Vegas.
