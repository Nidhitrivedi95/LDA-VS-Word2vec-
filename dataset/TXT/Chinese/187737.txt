yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA The best Pho I have ever tasted in my life.. and no I was not drunk or hung over lol. Good amount of food for the price, really good service, and the food didn't take long to come out even though they were busy. All I have to say is the broth is amazing the perfect balance of salt and herbs. Definitely stopping here everytime we come to Vegas.
