The dim sum is good and def. higher quality than most places. The service can be slow in the morning, during weekends because they aren't as busy - given there is no special pricing.

The food can add up because it is on the pricier side. But if you want to take friends to a nicer dim sum place, check out this place. For 7 people and 15 dishes, the cost was around $115. (Yes we are a family of eaters)
