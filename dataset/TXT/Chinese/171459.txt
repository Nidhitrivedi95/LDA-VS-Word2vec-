vYbpodi9utup_njMK5PAfw I only ate at the Eaton Center Nudo so far, I assumed it will be the same...I was wrong this one is MUCH MUCH better. More selection and even the dish I usually take is better her with different vegetables etc. 
If you like noddles or a soup filled with good and magic come here :)
