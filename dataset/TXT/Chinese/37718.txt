We all chose different entrees, which included rice, white, brown, or fried, and a spring roll. I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp with vegetables, and fried rice. The spring roll was a little disappointing, no real filler.  As for the veggies and chicken, delish, but skimpy on the baby shrimp, will pass on that option next time. And, unfortunately I was given brown rice, or maybe it was fried, if so, not great, and on the colder side. Overall, it is a quick lunch, with good prices, but nothing stood out in my mind.
