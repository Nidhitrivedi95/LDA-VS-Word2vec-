q_Oe5sLa138EA-AY6nggeQ We weren't exactly sure what to expect when we went to China Go Go. We live in the area, but had never seen a sign or even noticed the shopping center it's in--it's pretty obscure. We happened to find it online and tried it out. We're glad we did! This place offers authentically-favored, well-cooked Chinese food, which is limited in the Charlotte area.

The basil popcorn chicken was a highlight. The chicken was among the best I've ever had--crunchy, with the interior still moist, well-seasoned and satisfying. The basil leaves were lightly fried and crunchy in themselves. Not just an accompaniment to the chicken, they were really good in their own right.

My wife ordered the ribs. They were crispy and the meat fell easily off the bone. It had a bite but was still moist. I had two bao: the "Original Pork Bun" and the "Sriracha Bao." I was afraid, upon seeing the cut, that the fat in the original pork bun would be chewy--but it wasn't. It was very tender and sweet; perhaps a little too sweet, but not terribly. The Sriracha Bao, I think, was a little less successful. It needs a second flavor element, as I found it a little flat. Both had extremely fresh and fluffy buns.

I hope, next time we visit, that we'll see more people in the restaurant.
