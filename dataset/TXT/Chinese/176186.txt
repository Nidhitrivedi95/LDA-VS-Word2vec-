WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg I fell in love with YT many moons ago when I first tried their chili chicken on rice and shrimp with lobster sauce on rice.  I still fondly recall all the lovely meals I've had here and when I happened to be in the area, I thought I'd pick up dinner to share their lovely food with the family.  

Had I written this review some 20 years ago, it would have been a solid 5 stars for sure but the take out experience wan't exactly as great as I remembered my old favorites.  

We had hot and sour soup (still yum), chili chicken (was too greasy and not as good as I remembered), niu rouk (ok), ...etc that I can't exactly recall because they were so underwhelming.  Perhaps it was the take out factor or I'm just getting older with fading memories.  

I wouldn't mind going back to try my old favorites in the restaurant but I just don't know when that'll be.
