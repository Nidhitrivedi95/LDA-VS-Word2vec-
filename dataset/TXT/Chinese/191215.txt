ySHeT6Y6HuCxYoe27swKrw You know its good food, when in an ethnic restaurant you are the ONLY white person and the rest of the restaurant, just tolerates your stupid questions.    I love the Lamb Noodle Soup , the Cucumber salad is made with shards of garlic and szchewan red chilis, insanely good@!   Back to the lamb noodle soup, homemade egg noodles in a lamb broth, 8.50 a bowl, best in town.  It is like the best northern chinese food in Vegas.  Its a small place, but they do a great job on the food.   I give the food a 5 star, but the location and ambience is a little less that perfect.   But, dont miss it, its a great place for chinese.   Also, try the stewed pork sandwiches, they are just sublime!   mmm mmm good...get some!
