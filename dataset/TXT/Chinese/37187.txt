An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg My friend, Precilla C., visits this restaurant quite frequently so I was starting to become very interested in trying it out. We came here with a group of friends on a Sunday night and we had to wait for a couple of minutes for a table to free up. I would highly recommend making reservations if you're planning to come here during the busy dinner time.

I got the Malay laksa soup base with beef stomach, pork intestine and u-don. The soup was just the right level of spiciness for me and I was pleased to see that they weren't stingy with the amount of beef stomach and pork intestine.

I also got a side of deep fried pork chop (for $1.95!) and pan fried sausage slices with honey glaze. I have to say that the pork chop was done to perfection and I would highly recommend it. Although there was nothing wrong with the pan fried sausage, it's just not worth the price and I would recommend trying something else.

I also tried their cold milk tea and it's one of the best that I've ever had in the city so be sure to get it!
