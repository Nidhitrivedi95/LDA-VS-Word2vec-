L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA Came here because our first restaurant choice was closed. 

Since we're not Chinese, the service was blah.  It took forever for the waitress to come, and when we asked her for her suggestions, she said, "I don't know what you like, so I don't know."  Thanks, that was sooo helpful. 

Their noodle broth dish was good, and so was their chow mein.  I saw many families ordering BBQ duck.  At the end, my dad paid and gave them a big tip because he's nice, and then they started offering more tea and thanking us like we were royalty.  Too late, lady!
