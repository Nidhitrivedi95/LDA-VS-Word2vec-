7SemopLjhDc3IQkI-JUYdQ Soooo glad new ownership came to the rescue. This was our first trip for lunch and we can say "Loved it". We'll be back for sure ! Portions were ideal , more then enough and most importantly the quality was spot on. Give this place a try .... You'll be back . Oh yes , almost forgot .... Very courteous service. See you soon .
