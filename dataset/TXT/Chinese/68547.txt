euksvHm653hJMJBqzcvMzQ For quick and cheap Chinese food, this isn't a bad option. A close friend of mine grew up in a household that owned several Chinese restaurants (which is funny because she is Taiwanese), so if she says this is authentic, I will take her word for it.

Food: I've only gone for the lunch special- very cheap and quite good. I usually get the Lemon Chicken special- You get soup, an egg roll, entree and rice for $5.95, much cheaper than places like Panda. I love their Egg Drop soup. I have always been a fan of Egg Drop but I love theirs the most- It's not to thick or goopy, they use the right amount of corn starch in my opinion, and they actually add seasoning flavors, so it's not just the bland chicken stock, thickener and egg. A little soy sauce and pepper on this and I am golden! The Lemon Chicken was good too- Not too sweet, tangy and plenty of the lemon sauce on the side to spoon onto my rice for a little flavor kick!

Price: Did I mention they are cheap? You cant even get a combo at McDonalds for this meager pittance any more! Great portions for the cost, and the service is fast.

All in all, if you're looking for some place quick, affordable and Chinese, this is a good one to keep in your pocket.  Great.. now I'm craving Egg Drop soup.. *grumble grumble*
