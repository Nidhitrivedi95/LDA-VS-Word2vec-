uwlQWhtrqm8k7CZwrNtRsg Love this place. I usually order the popcorn chicken rice and it never disappoints. It always come out fresh, hot, crispy, and flavourful. The best part is, it tastes like the ones I had in Taiwan so it is totally authentic. The bento comes with rice and 3 sides that you can choose from. All sides are good and have a unique taste to it. I like mine spicy so they usually add a little bit of spicy miced pork with some sort of vegetable to my rice. So good! Popcorn chicken bento is $6.85 + tax. The restuarant is quite small with only a few tables because this is mostly a take out place. If you want to sit down and eat it fresh, I recommend eating it in the food court beside the restuarant.
