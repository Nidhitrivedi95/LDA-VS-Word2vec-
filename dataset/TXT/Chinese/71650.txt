The dim sum here you order by selecting dishes from carts that are continuously pushed around the restaurant and they have a wide variety of options as you would expect at a regular dim sum joint in your area except special orders as their kitchen doesn't open until 11am.

All the dishes we got tasted fresh and was really well done except the shanghai soup dumpling as it was a bit cold. If you want good inexpensive dim sum near the strip i suggest coming here.
