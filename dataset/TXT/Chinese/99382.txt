Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Came here once on my last trip to LV. My sister and I were craving dim sum, so we took a ride to this restaurant even though there were other choices. The food was okay. I'm not sure if it's because we got there late for dim sum, but some things were hot while others were warm. We also ordered a Pan fried noodles and it was a little salty for my liking. Not the best dim sum I've had but not the worst either. I would be down to give them another shot if I'm craving dim sum in LV again.
