zEd3Ex_k3vHiBbBPWRrO7Q OMG Never again... !!!!    If zero stars were an option that it would be.  WOW  the Walnut shrimp was like eating stringy vainy (raw rubber)  had no taste was mushy, stringy, rubbery and tasted about 1/3 of the way cooked....kind of like a dog chewing on an umbilical cord  hope I don't get sick, am sorry but it was GROSS !  I have ordered this same thing many times at other Panda Expresses and it was very good, so I know what I am talking about.  Secondly the  Chow mein noodles  were dry and tasteless.  Thirdly the broccoli in my other side was OLD and had yellowing on the crowns and soggy along with 3 and I counted three tiny pieces of beef in my other side which were the size of 1 third of a teaspoon....Seriously it was ALL HORRIBLE!  last BUT not least........ the employees were RUDE did I say R U D E ?  The WORST RUDE!!!!  UN BELIEVABLE!

I DEFINITELY WILL BE CALLING CORPORATE  spent around $35 / $40 on dinners and drinks to go!  WE WILL NOT EVER GO BACK TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT EVER.

It was GROSS AND THE EXPERIENCE WAS UTTER MOST THE WORST!
DONE DONE DONE.  I hope management and corporate read YELP...but i will be calling corporate.  Our visit was  Thursday the 4th of December 2014.  I really hope we don;t all get sick.
