ABRgXNwdOX_JyqChNr8IYw This place only barely passes because you're never hear unless you're hungover or drunk. This is old-school quick and dirty Chinese food. Most of dishes are greasy and come out hot. I still love it whenever I need that fix but please people...this is by no means "good" Chinese food.
