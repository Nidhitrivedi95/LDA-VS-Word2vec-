W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ This simple, drinks horrible but strong. Over prices for what is worth. I don't mind one bit spending money on food like they are shoes but not here. Appetizer chicken wings on a skewer not very much flavor. Shrimp ramen, mushroom ramen had both, both bad. Service not bad but could be much better. We sat on the patio. Nice being outside on the so but the restaurant is completely opposite of the valet. I'm glad i experienced it but will not come back.
