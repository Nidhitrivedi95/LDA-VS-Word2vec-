Mkpg9S2j0ZrZc3q-VjfLsA Congee Queen is a fairly standard Chinese restaurant -- I love that it has a very strong franchise and the different locations are generally quite consistent. The menus are the same and the dishes are generally prepared in the same way. My favourite dishes to order here include the radish cakes, the curry fried noodles, and the purple rice/coconut milk dessert. 

The wait time can be 10-20 minutes on a weekend evening but the staff are very efficient at clearing and seating tables. The waiting area at this particular location is a bit tight and it can be difficult to find a place to stand where you're not in the way of everyone. 

Would definitely recommend Congee Queen if you are at a loss for where to dine and looking for some classic dishes (read: Chinese comfort food). The demographic consists most frequently of families with three generations. It also provides a very Chinese atmosphere -- sometimes, it can be hard to communicate with the waiters in English -- and definitely has the bustling environment that is definitive of this class of restaurant.
