many meals - Lunch/Dinner/Late Night

LAYOUT
very spacious with an overflow private room.   lots of asian themed decorations (thai, buddha, fish tanks, etc).

SERVICE/FOOD
great service...  maybe because i'm a regular.??   

PRO
1. great PHO
2. good appetizers (pot stickers & calamari)
3. huge menu
4. boba tea selection is always good
5. rarely closed - 25.hours/day

CON
1. chinese menu is OK.   my american friends enjoy it.^^;
2. seafood menu is MEH.   i've ordered Clams in Black Bean Sauce and their Giant Scallops and can recall how awful they tasted.

PRICING
average cost...  nothing that will blow out your wallet.

CLOSING
i love eating here because it's always busy, even at 2am...  and that lends to a very exciting upbeat atmosphere.   my only gripe is it tries to do too much with it's menu and the result is not all that great.

NOTE* i hate being served only 2 meatballs for my Pho Dac Biet.!!
