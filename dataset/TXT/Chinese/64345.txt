e7M2GgkCfDYTxdPN1LL1sQ Excellent food at very reasonable prices. Attentive and friendly wait staff, fast service with a smile. The presentation of the food was far above average, a visual delight surpassed only by the superb taste.  For those reasons alone a 5 stars rating is warranted. The simple, efficient atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. Convenient access on a busy downtown street. Looking for a delicious Chinese meal at a surprisingly reasonable price? Wai Wai Chinese Cuisine will not disappoint you. I look forward to many more visits to this gem of a restaurant!
