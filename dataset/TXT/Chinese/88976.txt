I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w Ordered from this restaurant right before closing on Saturday  January  7th. I have been to many Chinese restaurants, but this one, I  will never return. I ordered the pork egg foo young  with fried rice  and egg rolls. When my friend  returned home with my order, immediately  the Chinese  food had a strong fishy/seafood  odor! I know each restaurant  may prepare their dishes their own particular  way, but I  have never in my life had egg  foo young the way this restaurant  prepares it--there were two big puffed, dried out  patties with huge pieces of tough, inedible  pork! There was no evidence  that  this egg foo young had any egg in it. When I  tried to cut into it (it was tough), it was nothing but a mound of onion and pork dipped into a batter and deep fried.

The fried rice  was  just that--plain, fried rice--no onions ,  bean sprout, peas, carrots, or eggs. Last, the egg roll filling had a mushy texture  like it was overcooked . Will not  be returning...will go to my usual  spot on highland  road.
