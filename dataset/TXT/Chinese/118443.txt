nMo0ozHO7cqsPaxw_7N6ow This is the best Dim Sum restaurant in Charlotte, even though there are only 2 in Charlotte. This place is better. Get there by 1130AM if you don't want to wait in line. They push the dim sum carts around and you get your typical dim sum variety. Shu Mai, Shrimp balls, tripe, chicken feet, ribs, duck, and etc... Pricing is pretty typical $3.50 for small plate to $6.50 for a larger plate. You can also request a menu and order from that. 

For tripe lovers out there this place no longer use real tripe for their tripe dish. Now they're using a different intestinal lining which is easier to cook, but doesn't taste as good as the normal tripe that we typically know and love.
