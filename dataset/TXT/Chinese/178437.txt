x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg And once again, for our weekly fam dinners, this Asian Legend location delivers all our needs: great food, efficient service, and relatively inexpensive considering the amount of dishes ordered. Yesterday, we had a group of 8 and we had:

1 large Hot and Sour Soup
1 large Fish Maw soup with white egg drop
Fried tofu - crispy on the outside, and warm juicy on the inside. This dish is extra yum due to the garlic bits
Onion pancake
Pork dumpling 2 orders
1 vegetable dumpling
1 plain white bun with condensed milk
Fried chicken wings and legs (6 pieces)
Assorted vegetables with vermicelli noodle in soup. This is a great dish that is in a big clay pot with tons of crunchy Napa cabbage and extra soup. A great meal all in itself!
Baby Bak Choy with Enoki mushrooms
Tofu with steamed shrimp and peas
1 steamed fish with vermicelli noodles. This fish was slightly fried which made it tastier. Sometimes steamed fish has a fishy taste - however, if its fried, there is lots of flavour.

Needles to say, we were very hungry which is why we ordered everything and anything. However, the total came out to be $127!! We have the discount card which is 10& off the bill so $12 bucks off already. The discount card can be bought for $20 and is valid for one year.

They also gave free dessert which was the signature Chinese soup paste dessert (green bean). Not my fancy but you cannot argue with free. Our family prefers this Asian Legend location out of all the ones currently open and it is also close to certain members of the fam.

If you are looking for good eats for a large group, but without spending too much, let this Asian Legend location be your next destination!
