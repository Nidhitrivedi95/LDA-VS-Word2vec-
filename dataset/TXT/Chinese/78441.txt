GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Don't be fooled by the overall appearance of the outside of this restaurant which may look a bit like a typical low budget cantina compared to the interior. The exotic mix of two cultures collided into one bring out a unique fusion of flavors and amazing taste. If you love trying new things out of the ordinary, this is definitely the place to dine! I've eaten here multiple times and consider it to be one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.
