cw0wVQxImxix2GoChgIYNQ Well, I wouldn't call myself a Chinese buffet expert. But if there were such a title, I would like to say I'm in the running since it's become sort of a family tradition of mine to try new Chinese buffets.

And in my maybe-expert opinion, World Buffet is among the top, with the exception of a few dishes: 
- the coconut shrimp, honey chicken, and spicy salt shrimp dishes were soggy (should be crispy dishes).
- sashimi was not properly thawed and still had bits of ice on it
- bathrooms smelled really bad

With all these negatives, 'WHY would you give 4 stars', you ask?

Staff was friendly, dining area was clean, food was not too salty, fruit looked fresh, sushi looked fresh (albeit some were still close to frozen)...all things I RARELY say about Chinese buffets.

With the exception of the dishes previously mentioned, the food was at or above par. I particularly enjoyed the beef short ribs, clams, coffee cake, fish balls with pork filling (in soup), and fried crab. These dishes were the best I've tasted in a Chinese buffet.

High ceilings and a brightly-lit atmosphere are icing on the cake.

And the cherry: compared to similar buffets, World Buffet is a couple bucks cheaper ($11.99 on a weeknight).

Now if I could only become a professional buffet critic...
