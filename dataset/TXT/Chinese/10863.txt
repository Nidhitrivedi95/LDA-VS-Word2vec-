26Kt6gQRF7S6m7crwR0tjw Hibachi Grill is a relatively new Japanese-ish restaurant in Pickering and they've been getting some really good reviews. It's a small place catering mostly to a takeout clientele. They have seating for 10 people inside and a table for 2 outside on the curb. I'm sure that will change in winter.

I had the pleasure of meeting the young couple who own and operate the place. They're very enthusiastic and passionate about what they're doing and very much interested in finding out what their customers want. Top marks for customer service and appreciation!

Although geared mostly for takeout, their menu goes well beyond the typical offerings of chicken, beef, shrimp, noodles, and veggies. They offer lobster and scallops!

I had the Lunch Special A, consisting of the Hibachi steak, rice, spring roll, soup or salad, and pop. It was a very good value at $8.25 and tasted very good. They also have a variety of house-made sauces available, with varying degrees of sweetness, savoury, and heat.I can't remember which one was their signature Yum-Yum sauce but they were all good. Yes, I kinda tried them all.

Their food presentation could use a little work. Even though I dined in, everything was served in takeout boxes. The salad, in its own box, was colourful, but the box with the steak, rice, mushrooms, and onions, was just monotone brown. See photos.

I will definitely be back, and not just for the food. I wish these young owners lots of success! Please visit them.
