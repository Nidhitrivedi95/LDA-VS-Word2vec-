Ly48L1qSRdLpCSWcs_DWIw The Phoenix is a place you'd only go to if you were looking for poor service, queues, or if there was no where that you wanted lunch at and it was close by. 

Incredibly poor service with attitude. The food has taken an exponential dip in quality per year. 

Parking is difficult and quite the battle with other patrons in the plaza.

Only redeeming item is the Hainanese chicken, which is alright. 

1/5 would try not to return.
