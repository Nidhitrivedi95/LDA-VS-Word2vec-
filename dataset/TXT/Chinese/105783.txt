Kxop0nGA-BUrwYD4EGhyPA This restaurant serves Chinese steamed buns as their specialty. The ones that are front and center on the first page of the menu are best. They also do other stir fried, noodles, etc. miscellaneous Chinese food.

The buns are the only things really worth having but it's hit or miss. If you happen to be there when they are hand making the buns then and there they are delicious and delicate, packed with flavor. If you show up on a day when they are pulling them out of the freezer and steaming them they are mealy and stick to the cloth that lines the bamboo steamers. 

Earlier in the day there is free soy milk available on a serve yourself basis but when this runs dry from the large carafe they do not refill. The waiters are terrible, speak very little English and mumble when speaking Chinese. They are slow and sometimes do not bring all the dishes you ordered. The decor is terrible and the hallway to the washrooms are lined with chest freezers that take up half the hallway. The restaurant is in a basement and in winter it can be treacherous to get down the stairs after a snow storm.    

This used to be a great restaurant and would make the buns on a rolling basis so they were always fresh. I still go back occasionally hoping to catch the just made buns.
