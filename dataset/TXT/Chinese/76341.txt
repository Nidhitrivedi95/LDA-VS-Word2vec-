g7bVip6ncXJC5xzkQMjohQ The ambience here is amazing. The decor really is cute, and to quote a man sitting near us while we were there, "It's a nice change from the usual traditional Asian restaurants."

The food however... maybe it's because I only tried one dish from there, but it was lacking a bit. My friends were satisfied with their meals though.

Give it a try though as I think the decor is worth the visit. The prices aren't too bad either.
