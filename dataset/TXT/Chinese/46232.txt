"WTF??!  WHY?? IT HAS SUCH HIGH RATINGS!!"

Well, dear reader, lemme tell ya: 

- xiao long bao aka "the soup dumpling".  I LOVE these.  If I could be reincarnated as any type of dumpling, it'd be these little fellas.  I've eaten them at one of the most famous restaurants for them in Shanghai, their birthplace, so I know good soup dumplings.   What I got at Mother's Dumplings were no doubt very tasty...but not good examples of soup dumplings.  They were overcooked, the dough completely fell apart, there was little if any soup inside...just a giant sad face.   Not only that, but the restaurant does not even supply you with proper eating utensils and condiments for it.  No soup spoon?  No pickled ginger?  Those are ESSENTIALS!  It's dumpling blasphemy.  

- The wonton soup.  Yeah yeah wonton soup or whatever dumpling soup it was called.  The dumplings were delish (pickled cabbage and pork if memory serves me right), but the broth was completely bland.  I actually added soy sauce to it to make it feel like I wasn't drinking flavored water.  Boo.  

Everything else was fine!  Tasty and fresh steamed and boiled dumplings.  Can't argue there.  It was really the soup and the soup dumpling that killed me.  But, otherwise, pretty standard.
