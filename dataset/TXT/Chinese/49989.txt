cdLBNUBgPurw3PyLXvbiGA I love coming here for lunch because they have different lunch combos everyday and portions are very good! With the lunch menu you get coffee/ tea, soup (either cream soup or borsch) and garlic bread on top of your meal. You can replace your soup with salad for an additional dollar.

I've come here so much to the point I purchased a VIP card for $5 to get 10% off my meals for as long as the restaurant is opened. 

Definitely recommend this restaurant for a nice Hong Kong styled meal. I usually have some sort of pasta when I come here.
