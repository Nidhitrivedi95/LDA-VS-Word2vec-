ENplmnTDn6Xpbt548yAtZQ Lots of attention is made to this dim sum place's table settings. The table, plates, tea pots, it's all the kind of geared to wow white uptown women who want to nosh on something that's not Eggs Benedict. 

Service is excellent. There's an excellent English menu. Dishes are brought out in order and on time.

It's small, quiet, and romantic. If you're a woman looking for a place to take your woman crush/pilates buddy, this might do you.

But. Hmmm. The food. Hmmm. Portions are small. The CUTE! Chinese Girl seems to think the chicken's feet were too salty. I enjoyed the bbq pork fried rice but would have liked more than a finger bowl of it. End of the day, I'll give up decor for portion size and flavor.
