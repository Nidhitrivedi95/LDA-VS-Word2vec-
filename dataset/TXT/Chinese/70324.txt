This is the friendliest Chinese eatery for a Pittsburgh vegetarian/vegan.  There are tons of dishes with wheat gluten and soy protein in addition to the more standard tofu.  They even offer veggie shrimp on the menu.

I ordered a spinach and seaweed salad, and the Sizzling Sensation, which is wheat gluten and stir-fried vegetables in a very peppery sauce.  The salad was pretty much what you'd expect, and the Sizzling Sensation definitely perked up my taste buds.  I usually love black pepper, but this was a little much for me.  The vegetarian dishes aren't cheap, running around $12-15 for an entree, though the minimum order for delivery is $12.  The portion size provides at least 2, if not 3, servings.

I should also note that I placed this order on Super Bowl Sunday and wouldn't have been surprised if it arrived later than my requested delivery time--but it even arrived a few minutes early.
