lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA Went to Palazzo and was shocked to find that Zine had closed and this placed opened in its place.  Apparently they renovated it (maybe a slight make over) but it still looks roughly the same.  We went and had a late night (1am) meal and found the place empty.
Ambiance:  Brightly lit and decent decor.  The restaurant appears more open than before. Like I mentioned, pretty empty at 1am.
Service:  Since we were the only one there, it was pretty good.  Hostess explained the menu and stated that 75% of Zine's menu was the same.  The rest was a new asian/hongkong/fusion type of offering.  Waiter came right away and took our drink orders.  Food came out quite fast.  Overall, service was decent.
Food:  We went with the basic fried rice, a crispy egg noodle, and a wonton soup.  The soup wasn't terribly hot (one of my pet peeves) but had decent flavor.  The crispy noodle was something that I had never had and I thought it was interesting.  I would probably order the pan fried noodles or chow mein next time.  The fried rice was on point.  Good flavor and lots of meat.
Value:  Because it is located in Palazzo, this place is terribly over priced.  Almost $20 for fried rice is a terrible rip off.  But hey, when you need or want food at 1am, you can't be choosy.
