I had kimchi with beef bowl with hot and sour soup.  The soup was ok.  Kimchi with beef bowl was terrible.  I could not eat it at all.  Honestly I am not sure if I would go back there again.  I also tasted sweet and sour chicken while I was there.  Man... Did they get confused with catchup as soy sauce? It tasted more like catchup than sweet and sour sauce.  Is catchup sweet and sour? Now I am all confused.
