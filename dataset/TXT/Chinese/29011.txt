8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ My family and I did it again! We could have ordered less dishes because portions in Canada are much bigger than those in the US! We arrived early to avoid wait time. Service was okay-most of the servers were friendly. The ones with an attitude probably had a bad morning. The food came rather quickly. The dim sum tasted delicious. This restaurant is definitely one of the best ones in the area.
