Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA I was here on a Friday at about 4pm. The food was great... but the service... WAS ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT!! I never had to ask for a refill, our server was informative and helpful and his use of teamwork with the other servers/food runners was awesome. This business focuses on quality and customer service above all else. I'm glad to have found this Gem. Kudos to the management. Having an awesome staff is a reflection of your leadership. ***Shawn was the name of our server***
