M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g We found this place one Saturday afternoon while looking for somewhere to eat. When we got to the door, there were workers going in and out. We thought they weren't open and we were about to leave. The hostess who greeted us was really nice. The food was great. It was the best family style restaurant that we've ever been to. The whole restaurant looked fancy. We've been there 3 times since they've opened. You won't be disappointed.  The staff members were all awesome. Love this place so far!!!
