9ad0-8h-DRUheY9dF9rYjQ Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and it was packed! Even around 2pm when we were leaving, there was still a lineup so that's always a good sign. The restaurant is pretty small with about 10-12 tables so for our party of 6 we waited about 15-20 minutes and the layout is terrible, you are pretty much jammed near the entrance while waiting. The actual restaurant itself was however clean and tidy.

Our group ordered several bowls of pho, steamed rice rolls with ground pork, and fresh rolls with shrimp and pork. Loved the rolls, both were so fresh and tasty! The soup broth was decent, it was warm, not too oily but maybe needed a little more flavour (does not compare to Pho Metro in Scarborough!) The meat to noodle ratio was adequate. Price is average for a small bowl of pho it was $7 and for a large $9 so comparable to other pho places.

Service was below average but that's what you typically expect at an asian restaurant, no communication, just give you your food, eat quick and get out. 

Overall, this restaurant is fairly decent. I would come back here if I was in the area.
