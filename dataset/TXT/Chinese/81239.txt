Any time the sushi "goes round" there's a little bit of a question about freshness, but from what I can tell, the rotation is pretty solid.  I haven't had anything that didn't seem like it was the right temperature.  I like conveyer belt sushi because I can get 2-3 pieces of sushi without committing to an entire roll.  This is the time to try something new!  I like the color-coded plate system so I'm not surprised by my bill at the end.  But be careful, the purple plates look awfully close to white when they're directly under the light.  It's easy to tell the difference when you realize that there aren't many options for the white ($1) plates.

The crab puffs are some of the best I've ever had.  During Happy Hour they come .99 cents for a plate of 2, and I definitely need at least 2 puffs for myself.  

I've had mixed results with communication with the servers; some speak very little english but I've met some native english-speaking (yet still asian) employees.  Either way, service has always been prompt and friendly, quick with drink refills.  The times I've ordered something from the menu, it came out hot and fast.

While this isn't the best sushi in town (except for the crab puff...that might be the best), it's a great value for what you get.  If you come during happy hour your bang is even bigger for your buck.  Seksun is a solid choice for a quick sushi fix.
