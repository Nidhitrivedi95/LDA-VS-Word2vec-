zfiSQ1dl3vTJ-og96eqXGA I got a flyer from this place in the mail. I am a little bit picky so I did not know if I would try them or not.
But, out driving around on my way home, I saw it and decided to stop here.
First impressions. Very clean, Staff is helpful, not too high priced. Lots of choices.
We got our order to go. Ordered both items with brown rice. You have 3 choices, white rice, brown rice, or pork fried rice.
We got the Kung Pow Shrimp and the Beef and Broc. Both were good , although the rice could of been a little more cooked than it was.
We also got Crab puffs, very good price and not bad. They were honest as well and told us right away it was imataion crab.
I wanted to wash my hands while we waited, but there is no public restroom in the shop/ I always think that makes it tough for a restaraunt to be truly enjoyed.

Place is very clean and they even have cold water for you to drink while you wait for your order.
The deliver also with a $15.00 min. purchase. Which is not hard to do.
