Ol-IE8GDY3GVxUZbJiMZXQ Came here for a quick bite to eat. Was kindly welcomed by the new hire (in training posted in his shirt). 

When it came to check out. It was a disaster. They did not have ice cold Izze. Which was fine, so I asked for a cup of ice. I was given a water cup (small). When I asked for a larger one as my drink does not fit into that one, the Asian lady looked at me and said we don't do that, and that I must buy the beverage cup. 

I believe that should of kindly offered me a larger cup as was their fault they did not have any cold ones left. But instead made me feel like a big hassle. I definitely do not want to return to this place.
