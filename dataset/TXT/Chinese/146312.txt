S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A Noodles! It's all about the noodles as it appears in the name! The superstar ingredient!

Your taste bud will be blown away by the authenticity and freshness of the noodles!  Whichever dish you order you will taste the same consistency in the noodles!  Comes in various shape, style and sizes! You can order it soupy, brothy or stir-fry!

I had the minced pork dish and a taste of a seafood and beef stir-fry.  Overall great tasting flavors! Most Chinese joints is about the sauce, here it's the opposite, it's the noodles! When you take your first five bites, you almost forget about the other ingredients! It's that yummy!

I also ordered the pan-fried, dumplings! Delicious! I assume they used the same dough to make them!

It's situated in an Asian mecca of Chandler, so do not be surprised if you see many Asians around.  Its true per other reviews and pics, you get to witness one of the cooks twirl and toss around the fresh dough behind a glass window!

I plan to return for more magical goodness, next time, I will try  the broth/soup style!
