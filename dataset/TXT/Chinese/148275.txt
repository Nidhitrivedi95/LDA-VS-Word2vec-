SEURrw7032BR15PKZ_aleA Impressive. I seldom enjoy yumcha experiences but I must say, the food here is pretty good. Thinking back to the many similar restaurants I've been to, this place definitely surpasses them all. 
All of the dishes were served steaming hot, the flavours, textures, and colours of the food were appetizing and delicious, and service was quick. The deep fried tofu rice noodle roll in particular, was a unique and very yummy dish. I would highly recommend you order it.
The only complaint I have for this restaurant is their egg yolk buns. It's one of my favorite dishes so you could see why I'd be a little disappointed. The yolk wasn't runny and the bun wasn't hot enough. 

I would definitely come back again the next time my parents force me into eating this type of cuisine (yum cha).
