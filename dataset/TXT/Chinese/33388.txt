$4.50 - Sticky Rice Wrap (2 pieces)

$4.75 - Hongkog Curry fish ball

$2.25 - HK milk tea 

$5.75 - Beef & shrimp chives noodle rolls (Recommend)

$5.50 - Pork liver congee (Recommend)

Definitely recommend the noodle rolls and congee, what they're known for! Place is always packed and flooded with people, didn't have to wait long at all. Cantonese speaking with they can work with English.
