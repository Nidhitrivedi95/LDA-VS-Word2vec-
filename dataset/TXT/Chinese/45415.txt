BrORoLCE5zVY6ekUb6omNA Very tasty, but delivery order was kind of wrong. I ordered the pineapple fried rice, but there was  absolutely not a single pineapple ! I was disappointed, and it's extra compared to the Thai fried rice that you can also get with shrimp. It was most likely a mistake, since I ordered the pineapple fried rice ... I was really looked forward to the pineapple. That was pretty disappointing. At least the rice was tasty so I wasn't too upset. Delivery was quick and professional. which was great. Took about 30 minutes and the food was hot. Hopefully if you order this rice you'll get some pineapple in yours!
