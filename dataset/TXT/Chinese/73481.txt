fjE-jiwnTQysz-rLl6YMQg This was really good delivery Chinese! It got to our house very fast and the combo meals had a ton of food. It also didn't break the bank. We just moved from the East End and I'm having a ton of luck with Dormont/Brookline restaurants. Definitely true if Amazing Wok. I had garlic chicken (and there was a lot of chicken AND veggies, not just filler stuff) and my husband got Hunan beef, another winner. Menu is to the point, definitely a new go-to for Chinese takeout.
