X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Came here soon after their grand opening on a weekend Tiesto was spinning. I've been to Tiesto's shows but this was a disappointing one. Maybe he was just being lazy or maybe it was an off night, but it really was not that great... It really could have been ANY DJ spinning and I wouldn't have even known the dif.

That being said. The club is just like any other Vegas clubs now-a-days. It's a little darker and it feels like it's not as open. The dance floor does have a high ceiling but it's shaped like a long rectangle? And of course there are the tables all across the dance floor in plain view of the DJ booths. 

I didn't have any problem getting to the bar when we were there and it was easy to get drinks. The second floor was not impressive, but I guess it's for people who like to chill. Not the best club and not the worst... However, it's def a distance from the strip so unless you were staying at MGM I don't think it's worth a trip just to come here.
