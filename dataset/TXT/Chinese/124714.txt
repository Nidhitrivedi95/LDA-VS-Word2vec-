They do all the dishes you'd expect from any Chinese restaurant.  I'm a fan of their hot and sour soup as well as the General Tao's chicken.  Portions are huge so what you can't finish you can easily reheat the next day.

The restaurant is cash only so come prepared.  In case you forget there is an atm there so you can withdraw some.  I can't comment on the actual service in the restaurant because I only ever get take out here though they are quick at preparing take out orders.
