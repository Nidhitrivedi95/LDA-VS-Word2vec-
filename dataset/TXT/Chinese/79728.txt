GkY6UWWn0Fz2ehcuBp66pg This is one of the best vegetarian restaurants for dim sum that my family has ever had. There are numerous varieties of dim sum dishes that are tasty. 
Their service deserves a full 5 stars for their friendliness, prompt service, polite staff who bring your food and the owners are very nice one of the them offered to help us take a family photo after seeing us attempt to do a selfie.  We ordered a few dishes from their dinner menu and the food was average as it lacked slightly in flavour and the rice noodle dish came with a lot of noodles but very little vegetables.  The tofu casserole dish lacked salt and flavour.  Ever since we started going here we have been going back 5 times for their dim sum.
