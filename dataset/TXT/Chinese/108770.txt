LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ I went to a birthday party luncheon yesterday. No services at all even as the host knows the owner very well. We sat there for more than 30 minutes. No one came by to offer drinks/tea. Food is very greasy. The appepitaizers taste like it's been sitting outside for too long. Luckily I didn't get sick.
Went there before and have food that were not fresh. Don't suggest there at all. K J Kitchen down the street on Spring Mountain or inside Rio is a better bet if you want good Chinese food.
