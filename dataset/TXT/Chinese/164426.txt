UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ We enjoyed our dinner here. The service was excellent. My boyfriend and I started with potstickers. Very good. He ordered spicy chicken fried rice as his dish. He enjoyed it. I ordered the orange chicken. They gave me fried chicken cutlets with orange sauce and oranges. It wAs a fresh unique twist on the dish. It wAs a huge portion so I had lunch for the next day.
