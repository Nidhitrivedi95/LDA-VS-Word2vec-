6N9NClBpOi-GoWckg137NQ Went to order to go since other reviews said delivery was shotty, the place was a hole in the wall, small and dirty. You can see into the kitchen and it looked very messy and unclean. Still have it a shot so I ordered by numbers as they requested and when we came back to pick it up the lady said my order was taking longer because of the spare ribs... Thing is I didn't order the spare ribs, and when I told her that she basically said I was lying and that I did. She kept saying I ordered the ribs and both myself and my friend kept telling her she was wrong. She ended up not apologizing, handed me back $0.50 even though she didn't undo the tax she originally charged me and gave me dirty looks. Worst customer service EVER! 

Plus side was that the food was actually good (got the crab rangoons and shrimp and garlic sauce even though the shrimp dish hardly had any shrimp), so there's that. Too bad I won't ever go back because of the service.

1 star for the service, 3.5 stars for the food so 2 stars overall it is...
