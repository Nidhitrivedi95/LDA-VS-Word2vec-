cxVp-a28Cp7lavjaPMvK5w Unfortunately I cannot do a food review because I was unable to eat at the restaurant.  If you have food allergies....Social House is not for you!!  The chef does not have a separate grill or wok to prepare shellfish dishes.....so the fish and shellfish cross-contaminate.  Additionally, all the sushi...even shell fish sushi has fish eggs on the outer layer.....in this day and age, I was shocked.  Went with a group...so I just had a cocktail.  

I did appreciate there honesty....this could have been deadly!  Ambience was to die for.  There is a curbside bar that fully opens up in good weather!  Cute date night spot if you can eat all types of fish!!
