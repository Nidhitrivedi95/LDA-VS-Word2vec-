tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw I don't know how I haven't written a review yet, this is my family's go to for yummy Chinese cuisine. 

The egg rolls are a must have, if you're a first timer, get the Bobo platter. WORTH IT! 

I have been coming here for years, and I'm only in my early 20s. It's a staple for delicious food,  I have never been disappointed.

If you like spice, I would suggest getting the tangerine chicken with the sauce on the side extra spicy. You'll thank me later, it's superb. 

They also have complimentary tea that is always delicious, their prices are reasonable and the staff is the best.  

Do yourself a favor and make a reservation if you're a big party. They fill fast on Friday and Saturday nights!
