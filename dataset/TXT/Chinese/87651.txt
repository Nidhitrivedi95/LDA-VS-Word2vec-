HV3Q2JYwK9AvMHPYXcxzag The absolute BEST Chinese food in Arizona.  It is authentic, fresh, always served hot and one of the few resturaunts that is ALWAYS consistent.
The place lacks ambiance, but let's face it, it's difficult to find this kind of food in a resturaunt that has what a 5 star steakhouse has as far as design and ambiance goes but......who really cares about that when the food is as exceptional as it is at Silver Dragon. This place reopened after being closed for about 5 years in a new location and I have to say I wasn't quite sure what to expect the first time we went back as I didnt think they could be any better than what they use to be...but they nailed it big time. Try the Hong Kong menu and get the beef and eggplant hotpot....you will not be sorry!
