hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Jury is still undecided. Jury being me.

I reeeeeally wanted to like it. I love noodles, so with noodles in the name, I expected greatness! I was surprised to only see 12 noodle options with many many other food dishes listed on the menu. There were way more options for soup noodles, but not feeling like soup, I went with the "dry" Dan Dan Noodles with shrimp. 

I will preface this by saying, maybe it's just a certain preparation that I'm not used to, but the peanut sauce tasted vinegary to me. Am I crazy? Maybe. But I swear it had a specific taste I could not get past. I honestly couldn't decide if I liked it or I didn't. I came to that realization three days later after I had eaten the leftovers for that amount of time (yes, they give you THAT MUCH FOOD!). 

As I said, maybe it's just in the preparation. But I'd like to come back and get some dim sum, or some bubble tea (very limited flavors) or maybe another noodle dish. A girl's gotta do her research, right?!
