VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Flo's is good! Gourmet? Well, okay...I agree that it is predictable, but I enjoyed what I had (NO LIES!). Their brunch/lunch specials are sort of affordable. At least, the dishes are cheaper, eh? The Dan Dan noodles, crab rangoons (although I think they call them puffs here), and we got a spicy beef plate...I forgot the name. NERDS! It's not really authentic by any means, but it still filled me up and was tasty. 

There are these crispy won ton chips that they bring out, too. And a small salad. 

I know probably none of this is actually good for you -- health-wise, even the salad drenched in that orange dressing (which I personally really dug). Maybe it's just that I was really hungry when I went? Isn't that why you're supposed to go out to eat? To NOT be hungry at the end of it? 

Mmhmmm. Flo's. Comfort American-Chinese food. For me.
