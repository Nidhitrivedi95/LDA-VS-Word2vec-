TIu83s4sWMdhbwimzdfzIQ I would like to be able to give a rating on the food but I did not have a chance. My husband called to put in a substantial order. We were told that we were out of their catchment area for delivery and they wouldn't do it. Apparently they don't go beyond Jarvis and Gerrard. We live 1/4 block from Jarvis on Carlton which is the next street above Gerrard. Maybe the driver would have been a minute's drive north of Gerrard to get to Carlton and Jarvis where we essentially live. My husband was trying to explain to the woman that we were on the border but her rigidity just lost customers. Worse, she just hung up on my husband! What rude treatment from a business owner. We order a lot and this place stupidly missed the mark to gain a loyal regular customer.
