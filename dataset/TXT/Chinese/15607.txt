3qrfY-XCUKVyrO5T6GskqA I love everything about this noodle place and wish more franchises would open. So you can choose your own pasta (whole wheat, regular and dozens of shapes), sauce, and protein.  Its basically a quick fancy meal that is made the way you like it and most importantly, FRESH.  I loved the steak stroganoff, mac n cheese with pulled pork, and pad thai.  Will be back for more!
