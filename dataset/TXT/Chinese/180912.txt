X9ftU-exKhTMOjtr3B52rw I was extremely excited to know that they expanded near me. So I went and had a delicious bowl of egg noodle shrimp wonton! 
The soup is very tasty and the size of the Shrimp wontons are big and stuffed with Shrimp and not a lot of fillers like other wonton places.
The spicy sauce on the table is very good in moderation as it can be very spicy for certain people.
A very Hong Kong style place with very affordable bowls of wonton that can satisfy you, especially if you are looking for a quick bite.
