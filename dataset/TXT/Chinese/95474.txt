jhP9rUsV-KvgHu1n--7Q3w I noticed that Khoo's Garden was under new management (and they have a nice new sign, too), so I figured I'd give it a shot for lunch. I noticed that they had a lunch buffet, but elected for takeout instead since the buffet was small and only had a handful of choices.

I ordered beef and broccoli with an egg roll to go. The counter staff was polite and friendly, and the order was ready quickly. Unfortunately, the quality of the food was pedestrian at best. The egg roll was good, but my entree was flavorless, and the beef was quite chewy. I was actually quite amazed at the utter lack of seasoning and flavor in the brown sauce.

I'm hopeful that Khoo's Garden can turn it around, and use higher quality ingredients and boost the flavor of their dishes. If they do not, there is no reason to go here when there are other high quality Chinese restaurants in the area like the Sesame Inn and Empire Palace.
