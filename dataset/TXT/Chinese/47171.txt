BzgeGVOPetKDcgv9FCbpkw This was my first time visiting this Panda Express. I was very disappointed.
They ran out of the teriyaki chicken and it took a long time to make more. I guess it's understandable for something like this to happen once in a while.
Not only were they late with the food, they also left out several items in my carry out order. First was the two extra plates I requested. They also failed to include the items I'm accustomed to see in my bag at their other locations. Those items they missed today were forks, napkins, say sauce and fortune cookies.
My low rating of this place, however, is mostly due to their chosen reaction to failing a customer. The cashier, I think her name is something like Maribella or Maricella, didn't even apologize. 
It would behoove the manager of this place to teach their staff better customer service skills. Sure, they might fail to meet the customer's needs from time to time. In those cases a sincere "I'm sorry" or maybe a free egg roll can go a long way to appease an unsatisfied customer and could dissuade him from taking the time to write a negative review.
