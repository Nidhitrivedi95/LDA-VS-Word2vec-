afdthOntL8hfhomIFX-NWg Went there for lunch and the food was pretty standard Chinese food, but the price was great! The sushi was good too, and how can you go wrong with three rolls for $11? I would highly recommend this place for lunch, especially for the price. The interior is nice as well, I'm definitely going to go back for dinner.
