KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ The food is truly a 3.5 but I rounded to 4 because of the service, portions, and value. I tried to order from Little Saigon several times and it just went to their voice mail. Finally someone picked up but the little bastard said Little Saigon was too busy to take to go orders at the time. So I went on yelp to find somewhere else in a pinch. I have seen this place before and the outside looks really suspect. 
I ordered beef and broccoli, chicken and vegetable stir fry, and some crab puffs. Picked it up in 15 minutes. The lady was extremely nice. She gave me some extra hot sauce. Then when I left a tip she seemed as though she was shocked. She said to wait right here and came back with a bag of two free egg rolls. I guess people don't tip often for take out. Anyhow, I told my wife I sure hope the food was good cause I loved that little older lady in there. 
Got home and it was pretty tasted. Everything was very hot, fresh, and had a pretty good flavor to it. The only thing I would have changed was a little spicier and a little less sauce but other than that it was great for pick up in a pinch. 
Best of all. They gave me enough food to feed a family of five and all for under 20 bucks!! Now that's what I'm talking about. Left over Chinese for lunch tomorrow.
