ud45YT67UCbtNfRxNeR2Yg We found ourselves in this area last night and ate here for the first time.  Dining area looked very clean, there was lots of different varieties of food.  There were people constantly cleaning the buffet areas and taking dirty plates.  As I would expect of a place with so many dishes, the food was ok, but not spectacular.  I enjoyed the general tso chicken and steamed wontons.  My fiance loved the sushi. I was not able to enjoy two of my favorite dishes-dumplings and chinese donuts.  Both had a few very old hard as a rock pieces on the buffet that were not replenished during our visit.  Other dishes did seem to get replenished often, and lots of people came in to get take out while we were there.  Price was good.  The worst part of our visit was when i decided to use the bathroom before leaving.  It was absolutely disgusting!  Trash all over the floor.  The first toilet was unflushed from a previous visitor, the second had what looked like vomit-also unflushed, the third and only clean stall had no toilet paper.  I walked out without using the bathroom.  I am leery of eating anywhere with a gross bathroom.  If I had gone in there before eating, I would not have eaten there.
