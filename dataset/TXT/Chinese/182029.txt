xftWto4IdilizsGdE07AQw When I moved to the valley, I was looking for a good Korean style Chinese restaurant that have noodle dishes that is only served in places like this. Where I came from, there were many of these restaurants to eat at so my expectations were high. I have tried other places and have been disappointed. My friend recommended this place and now I'm happy. The bad thing is I live 40 min away (no traffic) and can't go as often but it is worth the drive. It is a family owned restaurant and they are very friendly.
