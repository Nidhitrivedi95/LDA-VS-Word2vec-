LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA Made a reservation for 14 on a busy Friday night and our table was available when we arrived a few minutes early. Wonderful menu selection. The salt and pepper chicken wings may be the best fried chicken I've ever had. If I have the opportunity to come back, I may order it as my entree. Very, very good. Everyone in our party was happy with his or her entree choice. The only suggestion I have for improvement is service. It was a bit slow, but I realize a party of 14 is  never an easy assignment. I hear happy hour at Flo's is unbelievable. And if I could get those wings half price, I would eat dinner early every night when I'm visiting Scottsdale.
