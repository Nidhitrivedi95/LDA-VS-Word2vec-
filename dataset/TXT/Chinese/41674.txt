B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ So after 5 years, we have another party.  We decided to give bamboo gardens another chance, again because the food is usually good.  We interviewed 3 Indian food places and obtained 3 quotes.  We asked all 3 places for the exact same food and Bamboo won as far as quotes.  So we went with them.  A 2nd place then said they would match bamboos price, but we stuck with bamboo as they could not beat the price.  

The manager who took our order, rung up the order and then called the night before and read our order to us verbatim, then increased the price by $90 dollars when we showed up to pick up the food stating that "the person that took the order forgot to ring up the 2 orders of byriani."  You, asshole, were the one who took the order and rung it up!!!!  And now 2 hours before the party you are going to screw us with no food?  How dare you!  

They are the worst to do business with.  DO NOT ORDER or DEAL with them.  They should have just given it to us as it was HIS FAULT for being stupid.  Again $500 worth of food...  absolutely terrible customer service
