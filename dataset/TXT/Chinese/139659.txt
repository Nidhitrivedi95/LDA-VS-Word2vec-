QxngAo1AnfcihXqdk3IA-g First off if you are in Chinatown this should be the last place you should eat Chinese food! However I used just eat one night and was very disappointed. I ordered chicken corn soup which was probably the best thing of the 3 I ordered but then again how can you mess that up? A med soup was 7 bucks.

 I ordered shanghai noodles and this is the worst shanghai noodles in the world. No joke even frozen dinners are better!! The noodles were not fresh and extremely soggy. As I write this review the memory  of the taste is making me feel disgusted with. Also what kind of shanghai noodle is sweet? On the menu its labelled as spicy with a chili icon but instead it was rather SWEET. Sweet and soggy shanghai noodles are the worst. 

Next thing I ordered was pork dumplings which came steamed. $8 the price seemed ok I believe it came with either 10 or 12 but this was a tasteless dumpling which I was unable to finish. This place is a disgrace to Chinatown eateries. Please save your money and eat something decent as there are more options available. 

Those 3 items came to be 30 bucks including tax. Seriously food court Chinese food at the mall makes this place look like a dump.
