GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog The first time I tried this place, I didn't like it at all. I tried it again a few times after and now I love eating here when I'm at The Cosmo! I love their rice with vegetables with shrimp added. It's the best! Their margarita with the salt foam is delicious! Their shrimp/pork wontons are also really good. It's a nice little trendy place, and really worth trying.
