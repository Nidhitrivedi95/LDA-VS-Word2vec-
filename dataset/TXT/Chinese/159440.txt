U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ I had the I really wanted to like this place and give them a glowing review. Sadly, the food was a little lacking in the taste department. My friend and I went here for lunch. Arrived there at 11:15am to avoid the mad lunch rush and overcrowding. So, that part was pleasant. We ordered the Gi Cun (Spring Rolls), which we shared. They were average (I make them better at home). I had the Bún Bò Hu (spicy thick rice noodle beef soup). This was probably the most bland Vietnamese soup I've ever had. Which was very disappointing because I've had it at friend's homes, and other restaurants. It's normally very flavorful and delicious. Sadly, it was not the case here. The Thai iced tea was good though- not too sweet.  Service was average. The inside is smaller than it appears from the photos listed on some reviews. So, I can certainly see how quickly it gets packed during lunch hours. It was a bit crowded when we were leaving. I seriously doubt I would bring my kids here. I don't think it's a good idea, unless you have very well-behaved kids. Otherwise, it may not be a fair or pleasant experience for other diners since the area is pretty cozy and no separate areas for couples or adults dining alone to enjoy a quiet lunch/dinner.

I don't know... I am a fair person. So, I may give them one more chance. I certainly hope this was the exception.
