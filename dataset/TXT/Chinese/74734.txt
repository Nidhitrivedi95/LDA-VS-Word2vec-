fsqLNNiViaTPFk5ggOy-gQ Just ordered food from this place and deeply disappointed. My family picked out the  1) Chicken Fried Rice ($6.75), 2) Sizzling Soup ($6.50), and 3) Orange Chicken ($8.50). Our expected total was somewhere around $21.75 given the listed prices. However,  after getting our food delivered, we were hit with a bill of $30.95. 

After calling to see why there was such a big discrepancy, the lady on the phone informed us that there was a delivery charge added to the order ($3.00). Nowhere on the menu is there anything that notes a delivery charge. Rather, the "We Deliver" notice on the menu simply states "Min. Order $20.00, Not Including Tax." Usually, at most places I've eaten at, where there is a minimum delivery amount, no delivery charge is added. Here, they just shove a charge onto your bill without telling you.

Without any satisfaction with respect to the bill, we decided to eat our $30 rice, chicken, and soup... Try should be more appropriate for what was attempted. The sizzling soup contained a single shrimp (no exaggeration) and was cold. The chicken fried rice had roughly three pieces of chicken with the remainder being mostly eggs. As for the orange chicken; well, I am not sure it was chicken. It was the equivalent of attempting to eat the connective tissue found between the joints of chicken bones (if that description helps). 

All-in-all: I won't be ordering from this place again. The amount of food and bogus charges aren't worth the hassle.
