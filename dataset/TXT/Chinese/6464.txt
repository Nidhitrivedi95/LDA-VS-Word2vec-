0J-QM0fIxBNNiSK_n19y9g I've gone to this place several times for their 3 combination plate.  I always get the seseame chicken with the fried rice and add $2.00 worth of shrimp.  It's the best I've had since I've been here in Phoenix.  I've also order shrimp fried rice and love it.  Great place, decor not that great but very good food.  Will continue going there.
