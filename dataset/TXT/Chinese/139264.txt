qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA It's been a while since I've had P.F. Chang's. Last night my boyfriend and I ordered through Amazon delivery.  Fast, one delivery fee,  and large variety. I also like the pictures of most of their entrees. I've been to this location several times over the years and they are pretty consistent with service and delicious food. 

I started out with their Hot & Sour soup which is perfect in my book.  Spicy but not burn your mouth for minutes later spicy. It's rich and velvety and perfectly done. I went back to a good old stand by,  the Orange Peel chicken with white rice.  The chicken was nice white pieces with a tangy, spicy coating that was amazing.  A new dish we had to try was Hokkien Street Noodles, the picture looked great and when it arrived, it looked and smelled heavenly.  I love the thin rice noodles!!  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the light curry sauce was perfect amount to noodles ratio.  I will order this dish again!! I notice they have changed up their menu adding Dim sum which is nice for variety.  Dessert was New York Cheese cake with berries and it was delicious. Great dinner!!  Thanks P.F. Chang's and Amazon delivery!!  Fresh and hot!!
