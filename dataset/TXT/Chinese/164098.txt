uU8up3hGwW9qnzQD1HZsMQ Some of the best orange Tofu I have ever tasted, we have been eating here at least 3x a month for years. the only dishes I don't love is the moo goo gi pan, its bitter, like something went bad but since it always taste that away I have come to the conclusion I should stop ordering it.. its actually the flavor and never going to change. I can eat the beef and broccoli all day every day. I have read negative things about delivery,  its true some nights its crazy and I have decided to pick up my order instead of letting my stomach growl with discontent and I can say they were legitimately slammed not being lazy or unable to deliver in a reasonable amount of time due to inability.
Staff is great, very friendly, strict on delivery it must be 15.00 not 14.96  or even 14.99  which gets frustrating but buy a .60 cookie and go on your way. 
My recommendations orange tofu, beef and broccoli, walnut shrimp
Stay away from Moo Goo Gai Pan, Egg Drop soup, steamed pork dumplings
