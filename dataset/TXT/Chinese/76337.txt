g7bVip6ncXJC5xzkQMjohQ The terrible choice in decoration and the super confused menu of ALL asian foods made Fickle a place I had no expectations with.  Seeing as it was a viet restaurant (apparently) I had to try how good they could make pho. positive: portions were AWESOME if you are hungry and willing to eat anything. a decent amount of meat and large bowl of noodles and soup.  negative: no siracha sauce, bean sprouts, basil leaves, limes and all the TYPICAL viet sides you put in pho. their personal hot sauce came in some crappy decorative sauce container that wouldn't allow it to come out properly.  also most people there ordered chinese food and apparently enjoyed it. so if you want to come to a Vietnamese restaurant to eat chinese food, you should come to a place called "fickle."
