Fj0zObYm5McHcbtE6MSU0A I always order for delivery via the Eat24 app. Food arrives in a timely fashion every time & very rarely disappoints. I'm not a big fan of the egg rolls, but I am a HUGE fan of the fried wontons and crab Rangoon. Delivery drivers are always friendly & there's no minimum order amount which is really great. The malasadas are also pretty good, though I wish they were a little less greasy & had a little more cinnamon & sugar. My boyfriend really likes the Orange Chicken & I'm a fan of the teriyaki chicken. Overall it's a great restaurant with good food and affordable prices.
