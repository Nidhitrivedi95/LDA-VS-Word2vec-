T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ Let me start by saying this place is huge!! Where have you seen a koi pond inside of the buffet?! Unlike other Chinese buffets, I haven't had to wait for a table. And for $14, drinks are included! 

My favorite things to get include the hot crabs, oysters, sashimi, baked mussels, and grilled items. They also have a Mongolian Grill where you stack your plate with items you want (vegetables, meat, noodles, egg, etc), give it to the cook, and presto-freshly cooked noodles! It's especially good when you add garlic & chili paste at the end! 

The staff is also very attentive, they're always quick to take empty plates from the table, refill drinks, and lately I've noticed they do their best to quickly refill the crab legs and oysters (since people have been taking 'em by the platefuls). 

Also sashimi quality has gotten a lot better!  They offer mackerel, salmon, tuna, and one other fish (I don't know the name of, but it's delicious!) I've tried them all during multiple visits and so far haven't had problems with my tums, so the fish is good by my book! 

They also offer two aisles of desserts, 4 different soups, salt & pepper crab, seafood delight, chicken, pizza, and a whole bunch of other typical Chinese buffet dishes. 

If you're looking for a cheap Chinese buffet that offers crab legs, oysters, and a Mongolian grill, this is the place to go!
