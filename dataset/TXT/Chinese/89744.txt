IAqyeVG1ZMrv7hiV3FAB6Q I was rather surprised to see their big selection.  Some of the foods tasted like they had come from a frozen packaging i.e the wontons.  BUT I was really shocked when I tasted their sushi! It's pretty darn good! It's the first Chinese buffet that has good sushi that I've seen in AZ.
