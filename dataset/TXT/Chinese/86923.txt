HQpMwOOrGND3GaRqMNV9ig Tiny menu: choice of 3 toppings with 3 carbs served with soup or soup on side, maybe side Yo Choy; that's basically their entire menu; but everything tastes great

PRO: noodles are awesome, springy on teeth and smooth; fish ball is everything it should be, wanton is smooth, generous, and delicious, soup is delicious all by itself

CON: beef appears to be not choice cut, tenderized with tenderizing mallet and baking soda (or something), but it's delicious and smooth; Yo Choy is a bit chewy (old), I prefer younger vegetables

Don't expect service, get your own water/tea and pay cash at counter
