q-3Q3t3RS4qiW51fDIEvyQ I was hesitant to go here, as buffets concern me (food temps, cleanliness) but my husband insisted.   He should have listened to me!  We tried to find somewhat healthy options, but it was impossible. ..no cooked veggie dishes, no tofu, and everything was deep fried except the poached salmon which wasn't bad.  Bottom line, if you are someone going to a buffet for quantity, not quality, you may like it.  As for us, back to local wonderful Thai food!
