b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag I've been here two different times and both visits were great. Good service and great food. The food took a little bit long but Chris, our server made sure we are taken care of. He's great and we had a great time. We had the Chicken and Rib with rice combo. I forgot whats it's called but it was very delicious. We also had the Yang chow rice, hot and sour soup and the Vietnamese spring vegetables. 

Whenever I'm in the area, I'm sure to put Chin chin on my places to eat.
