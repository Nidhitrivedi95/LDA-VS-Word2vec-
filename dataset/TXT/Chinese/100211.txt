jyZqmlaziZKtPv8AVTzciw Yes, the food at this place is okay, with killer prices, however, if you are okay with the filth and rancor of this place, even for takeout, then you must like to drink the water in Mexico, and pick up gum off the ground to chew on.

I watched the owner scoop a fish out of the tank, then chase it around on the floor when it jumped out of the bussing tray. Needless to say, noone cleaned up the fish scales, or mopped, or anything so pedestrian-gotta keep it authentic, right?

And the food, while good, is not great. One time our duck in brown sauce and spicy chicken ended up as damn near the same dish-both had the same veggies, and the same gloopy brown sauce. The only difference was the poultry, and I know my food well enough to know the dishes should have been very different. Due to the awesome cheapnes of the place, I didn't mind throwing out most of the meals.

Other meals with friends have been decent, but not a good as Gourmet House of Hong Kong-which has its own brand of dive, but at least there I never had to fight a cockroach for my meal...

Based on my experiences, and the wonderful bridge of connection that is Yelp, I will not be dragging myself back to this place anytime soon. I always see a lot of asian families here, and they seem to enjoy it very much, which is usually indicative of a great spot. Not this time, I pass. They can have my share of the roach w/ vermicelli...
