2ZZp5V8N0nHlsml01XBJUQ Great dumpling restaurant, highly recommended. 

Came here for some late night dinner at 9pm on Saturday in a group of 5 and got seated within 10mins wait. The server handed us a paper menu and we basically just had to mark down which item we wanted. 

I was recommended to try this dumpling restaurant by a friend, so we've decided to try out 3 of their dumpling flavours. We got the Vegetarian, Pork and Bak Choi, and Pork and Shrimp, all steam cooked in the bamboo plate. The price was good too, around $7 you get 12 dumplings per plate and it was definitely really filling. I liked how thin the skin of the dumplings was, it showed the skill of the chef. The meat on the inside was really juicy, so be careful so you don't burn your tongue or accidentally squirt the juice across the table lol.

We didn't get try out their other items, but if I'm coming back for another meal I'll definitely order some other items. Just judging on the dumpling, this place is A+
