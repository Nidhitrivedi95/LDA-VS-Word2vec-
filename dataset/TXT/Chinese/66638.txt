EhTYPpGzs2MfDspt1nU7Hg Do yourself a flavour. Ignore everything on menu. 

If you want an excellent bowl of Braised Beef Noodle in Soup <U+7D05><U+71D2><U+725B><U+8089><U+9762>($8.49), Chef Lin probably serves one of the best in Markham and Beyond.

The beef broth is rich and have layer of flavour. The beef is of premium cut and so soft and tender. Noodle cooked perfectly with a great bite.

The wait though was long for my Perfect bowl of noodle even with an empty restaurant. But it definitely worth my while.
