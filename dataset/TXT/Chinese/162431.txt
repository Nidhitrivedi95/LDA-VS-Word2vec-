uLzgiSqVg5Pr93VVXSdOlg I don't understand how I've not heard of this place! I have heard of it as the noodle place with the supermarket downstairs but you should all remember that it's called LAN ZHOU. They have delicious asian noodles with an assortment of different noodle thickness and shape of the noodle. I would go for the small if you're not too hungry. If you're starving you should get the medium. Their sizes are humongous and remember that it's noodles in soup as well and soup really fills you up! Their spicy is a little bit too spicy for my liking but these noodles will turn your sad day upside down. You can also watch the employees make noodle by the window at the front or inside. It's pretty mesmerizing watching them make the noodles. Don't come in a group of more than 4 since there isn't that much seating.
