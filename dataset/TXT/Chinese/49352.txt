CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Your service is terrible. If you're going to tell me your food will be ready in 15 min then I expect 15 min. Why should I ask you after 25 min where my food is? And when I do it takes another 20 min before you bring me my food. I know the Pad Thai isn't that difficult to make.. you know what's more annoying.. When I opened my food. it looked more like pad see ew than pad thai. I hate you Noodles for keeping me hungry and getting my order wrong. I was very upset with this place. I had to pay that much and get treated like a nobody. Noodles will not get any more business from me..
