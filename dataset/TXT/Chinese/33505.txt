A5Xd85djipsW546Bq6qIYA As a previous reviewer mentioned, the place before Sesame Garden (it was called China Palace) didn't have the best reputation or the best food. But this wasn't just a remodel and a name change- it's a completely new owner. The food has done a 180 and as a life long Mount resident I'm so glad to have a place to get my Chinese and Thai fix. 

Portions are generous and prices are certainly reasonable. Welcome to the Mount!
