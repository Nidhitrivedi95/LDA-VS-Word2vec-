VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA Right up front, I need to say that, despite a lot of gastronomical adventurousness that I have, it does not translate to Chinese food.  I like Chinese food, but I always eat the same thing--potstickers.  My wife introduced me to the Dumpling Haus a couple of months ago.  Wow!  The ingredients are fresh, you can watch them prepare their food, and it comes out fast.  I freakin' love this place.  It may not be the absolute greatest food I have had, but if I am going to have Chinese food, this is the first and last place I am going in Madison.  Noodles and dumplings!  This place was made for me.
