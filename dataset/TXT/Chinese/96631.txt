I didn't feel pressured to leave and I wasn't given a dirty look for eating plates upon plates of delicious spring roll sushi, bread, mashed potatoes, lemon meringue pie, noodles etc etc etc.  This was actually my first time at the Mandarin so I have nothing to compare it to but I would definitely want to return to this one as it wasn't too busy.
