qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA Uhh... I love Ipads, Iphones, Icomputers, Itouchmyself... Joking...

I think the ONLY good thing about this place is that you get to order with Ipads. I think it is an unnecessary gimmick... Food is more important then these novelty items for me unfortunately... 

I review sushi based on two things:
1. Type of sushi (buffet versus al la carte) 
2. Sushi prepared by whom (Chinese, Caucasians, Japanese, Korean)

This place is a Sushi buffet cooked by Chinese people -nothing wrong with this at all, because most buffets generally are and some turn out quite well. 

You may try if you want to play with free Ipads or hey, why don't you just visit the Apple store :) It is a sushi buffet so we expect quality to drop. The Kitchen items are relatively tasty... but I mean, you do get sick of it after a few bites. The sushi is VERY bland... Fish is a bit on the unfresh side... and the rest of the menu falls on the sweeter side of things. 

Wonderful service staff! Except this one girl. She was definitely having a bad day haha. She had this angry looking face all day. She would bring us our food and slam it at the very edge of the table. But I mean, as a customer you need to be polite always and so we were... tipped her well because I mean you reap what you sow? Anyways, the other service staff were very genuine. So if you like poor quality food, Ipads and friendly wait-staff, then by all means.
