fseN-tYwcbjtYm7DjjEjLw Ok, I wasn't expecting a lot when my husband and I wanted something quick to eat and a little different and our usual Rubios, but I should have trekked a little further to Pei Wei. 

I was craving pad thai and I knew this place had it, so I order that with no meat. I then asked if I could have tofu instead. The guy at the counter asked if I wanted the tofu deep fried. I said no and my husband ordered two egg rolls. The total was $19! I knew that was off, so when I mentioned it, he said that the tofu was a brick of tofu. I told him I didn't need a whole block of tofu, just some to put in my pad thai. He then said he couldn't do that? What?? You can sell whole blocks of it, but you can't put it in my food? I said no to the tofu and waited for our food.

After we got home, I opened my food to find big chuncks of beef, chicken, and shrimp in my pad thai. I'm a vegetarian, so that's not good. My wonderful husband took it back for me and when he returned, I only ate about 5 bites. Wasn't good at all. Next time, I'll stick with Pei Wei. Maybe I'll have that for lunch!
