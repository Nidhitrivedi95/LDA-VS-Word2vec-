jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg Absolutely love this place!!!
After eating on the strip for 2 days, food got a little mundane... so my friends and I decided to give this new mini hot pot place a try in Chinatown. Lets just say that everything we got was absolutely delicious. The hot pot portions are HUGE for what you pay for. (average around $10 per pot)

1) Chinese yogurt
      MUST try if you have no idea what this is and if you do, MUST get it!
2) Lamb and beef skewers
      very authentic! Taste just like the ones you find in China's night markets.
3) Hot pots
     So many different flavors... Luckily I went with 7 other people and got to try a lot of different ones. I have to say my favorite one is the cage free chicken broth with chinese herbal medicine. You do not taste the medicine part at all and the broth is soooooo authentic. The individual flavored pots came with A LOT of stuff inside. We thought the cost was just for the broth and we had to order other stuff separately to cook in the pots...boy I was wrong. The flavored pots you order come with a little bit of everything they sell separately so there really isn't a need for you to order more side dishes in addition to what comes with your pots already. 

Though the tendon soup pot is very delicious, I think they should add some meat inside and less tendons. 

It was a great experience overall! Everyone should stop by and try it!
