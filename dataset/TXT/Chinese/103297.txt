KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ We have been ordering Big Heng food for years. Recently I gave up meat and consider myself a vegetarian. I have had the bean curd vegetarian dishes which I thought were very tasty until tonight. My husbad got the food. He ordered the bean curd dish and after eating through a little of it I noticed there were several pieces of chicken in it. So needless to say I won't order anymore from Big Heng. That is pretty careless.
