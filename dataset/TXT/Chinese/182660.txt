xjlMlnxWqMd3FGODA_z1NA I should've just gotten sushi from Albertsons because I feel sick, and didn't even eat any fish. Over $50 wasted, and I'm still hungry because I honestly thought I was going to vomit if I ate another piece. Best place in town for bulimics. Excuse me, I'm going to sit by the toilet for a bit.
