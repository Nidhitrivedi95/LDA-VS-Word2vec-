UPSzbM6D2SkarWAINq1I9A It was OK.  Superior Pho was closed on July 4th so I yelped this place.  Feels really mom and pop.  Feels like you walked into an 80's Chinese restaurant.  Owner was like a typical Asian grandma type- no nonsense.  We asked her to cut the spring rolls in half so we could share.  She said no.  Fresh spring rolls were forgettable.  Fried spring rolls were thin and crunchy.  Seems like an authentic selection of Vietnamese dishes.  Pho broth wasn't bad- but there wasn't a ton of noodles or meat in our large bowel and the bean sprouts had seen better days.  Our rice noodle dishes were ok- not mind blowing but I could imagine someone's grandma making them.  It was ok- I probably won't go back because it is kind of out of the way.
