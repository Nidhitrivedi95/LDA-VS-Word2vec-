OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I'll start by saying that I'm from Hawaii and we have some excellent dim sum choices available to us on the island. Therefore, I felt the dim sum here at Chang's was just okay at best. I tried some of the basics, including their shu mai, ha gau, and the charsiu bao.

I had big pieces of shrimp in my shu mai, but the pork flavor was lacking. The ha gau wrapper was mushy, but at least the shrimp tasted okay. The charsiu bao paper was difficult to remove. It was almost steamed into the bun itself. I had to dig into the bun a bit on one of them to remove the paper. The flavor of the charsiu bao was just okay, too. None of the other items I tried were anything to write home about. 

One other thing I noticed was their chili sauce seemed to be watered down somehow, like they added some water to stretch the sauce. Overall, I probably won't make a return visit on any future trips to Vegas.
