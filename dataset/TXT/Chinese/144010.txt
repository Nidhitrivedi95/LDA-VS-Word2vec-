rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg we ate here for dinner.  there were 3 adults.

i had the cashew chicken, my wife ordered the chicken with mixed vegetables and my brother ordered sushi rolls ( i don't eat sushi so i don't know exactly what rolls were ordered).  the food was just okay.  it was not bad or great.  we felt okay about it because the prices were reasonable.

the service was great.  the service met all our needs and even tried to tend to our 2 year old son.  that was kinda cool.

this place is not a favorite but we don't mind going back for something average, quick, and with great service.
