fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA I've been here at least once a year for the past 6 years, it used to be a very family-styled restaurant and all dumplings were made at the front area, now there are only some. They have gotten a renovation on the restaurant and now the restaurant looks superb and possibly may have changed owners. In the past, it used to be only the people who cooked the dumplings at the front take your order and serve you, but now they have 2 servers on at a time . The servers were very friendly and nice, however I didn't experience any sort of introduction at the time, or really get to know their names or much of anything about them at all (more common in asian restaurants, so it is not a big deal). However I did find that the owner / manager, to be sloppy, he didn't wear the attire that is used for the FOH positions, rather a stained old blue shirt and jeans. I also went to the washrooms, which can be acquired by walking down some slippery steps. The washroom itself did not smell or look nice and the garbage can was overflowing with paper towels, the toilet itself was also very dirty.

I later ordered various types of dumplings both pan fried and boiled/regular, overall they were good. When comparing the taste, the boiled ones are the best because the fried dumplings that I ordered were drenched in oil (enough to fill a small dish used to hold the sauce). I also ordered a green onion pancake, which in the past was my favourite dish but now it, I would only rate it was average, if not below average, and once again drenched in oil and the portions were smaller. I do suggest trying the boiled lamb meat dumplings, the filling was very nice and was not too overwhelming. However the shrimp ones not the other hand were not too pleasing, the shrimp turned out mushy and one of the plates were slightly under cooked. The busser noticed my parents talking to each other about the uncooked dish and asked if anything was wrong. When we told him about the dish. He brought it back to the kitchen and had it further cooked to perfection before bringing it back out for us. The price is decent, not too different from other dumpling restaurants, expect at least $10 a person with tax and tips. Compared to the past, it increased by $2-3 per order on the menu however that is to be expected due to the rise in living and eating. Overall the experience was nice, and I was able to enjoy some time with my parents.

Pros: 
- Service was good, staff are very observant when it comes to refills and orders
- Fresh dumplings
- Gets to see part of the process of making the dumplings (however compared to the past, I do wish I would be able to see all of it)
- Various options on the menu

Cons:
- Very busy, its very hard to find a time when there is no waiting line (especially during dinner unless you have a really early meal)
- minimal seating (however more than they did before the renovation)
- pan fried dumplings is very oily and were slightly undercooked
- unsanitary washrooms
