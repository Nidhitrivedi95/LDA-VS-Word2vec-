M9fOuiesoUSaouOqNQ3U2w Not a very good first impression. My water came in a glass that had very obvious lipstick stains on the it and my spoon had stains that showed someone had recently used it to stir tea or coffee. 

There are two menus a blue one which is given to "Asians" and a pink one which is given to everyone else. Ask for the blue if you want "more Asian" choices.

I had Egg Flower Soup, Egg Rolls and Singapore Style Rice Noodles and added chicken , only comes with pork. Soup was good, egg rolls were typical buy they frozen throw they in the deep fryer and server them soggy and greasy. The Singapore noodles weren't bad and they weren't great either. Not enough curry or spice oils, so not enough heat. This is supposed to be a spicey dish. It also seemed very dry, did not seem like the meats were cooked fresh and I was the first customer in the door for lunch so being early May be a drawback if they start prepping too early.

By comparison, Wong's Jr. In Peoria, this same dish (can be served how you want from mild to spice) comes with a great mixture of shrimp, pork, egg and snow peas. The price is the same and I think Wong Jr. Portion are bigger.

I guess if I was in the area again I would eat here again, but thoroughly check for dirty silverware and glasses before you drink or eat.
