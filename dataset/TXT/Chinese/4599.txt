_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Called for a dinner reservation on our way to Toronto from NYC last weekend and was told that they were full and the only availability was 4:30pm! Since we can't make a trip to Toronto without dining at this place, we took the 4:30pm reservation. We then drove directly to the restaurant once we arrived in Toronto only to find that they have moved to another location! Luckily, it's just  a few blocks up. Their new place is nicer and probably slightly bigger BUT they don't offer their old prix fixe anymore! Everything is more expensive :( Although the food is still better compared to Cantonese food in NYC, it is not as good as before. Still cash only and RSVP in advance! This place is packed by 6pm and we saw so many people without rsvp being turned away.
