0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA I think the best part of this place is the service. The food came out really fast, and for a lunch time place I really enjoy that when I'm on the run. Just the conversation was fantastic, the manager is simply the funniest (and sweetest) woman who calls everyone "love" or "dear" and lets you sit wherever you would like. I will say its a bit pricier than being in Mesa, but the convenience of being closer to my house is such a plus that I can't knock them down anymore than one star!
