Their lamb skewers are good! Not that gamey tasting and the seasoning is just right. 

We came for their soft opening and it's still really new restaurant because they didn't have a lot of the items on the menu. They came from Hamilton where they had a restaurant there as well. 

The food we ordered tasted good and the service was excellent. I especially liked the sweet and sour honey spare ribs and the garlic veggies. 

Portion sizes of the clay pots can be big so it's enough to share with two people at least. 

Don't be alarmed with the decor though. I think they didn't renovate much after the takeover from the previous restaurant (used to be a middle eastern restaurant) so a lot of the look and feel is very similar to the restaurant previously. 

LAST TIP?!

Order the soup noodle dishes in a clay pot if you want a good meal for a good price. For $9.99, the portion size looks decent to either eat alone if you're hungry or share with someone else!
