NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ I'm a fan of this location - it's roomy, not too noisy, and the booths are ideal for just working or having private conversations. Although the bubble tea and drinks are more steep than you can get at around Yonge and Finch area, it is really fresh and the food is worthwhile to try!

I would personally recommend the Minced Pork Rice with Sausages or the Minced Pork Noodles!
