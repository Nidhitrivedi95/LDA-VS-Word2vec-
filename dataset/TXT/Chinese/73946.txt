fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw I went in to XO Chinese food w an open mind. Was and craving a quick bite to eat. I had tried other Chinese food restaurants nearby, Jacky Chans, WTpho? I ordered my go o Chinese dish of General tso chicken. I told the man working as the cashier that it was dine in. After waiting awhile a woman emerged with my to go order all bagged and tied up in a plastic bag. I told her I was eating there and she looked surprised. After opening the bag and container of food and  trying the chicken which was hard and looked old like they had some leftover chicken and dumped sauce on it. Everything was dry and old. The food looked absolutely nothing like what was pictured on the menu on the wall. Not sure if I'll ever go back.
