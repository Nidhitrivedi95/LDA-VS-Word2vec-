This review only focuses on the afternoon tea portion of the menu.  Afternoon tea runs from 3pm to 530pm everyday.  Prices are cheaper for certain dishes and they all come with a drink for free.

Pros:
Big portions 
Great prices
Free drink, even cold one

Cons:
Service gets slow when busy

If you're familiar with Hong Kong style restaurants, they all have an afternoon tea promotion.  Basically in the mid afternoon, usually after 3pm to about 5-6 pm, they have a couple of dishes priced a little cheaper than normal and they offer a free drink as well.  

I love coming here for afternoon tea.  They have a lot things to choose from, much more than most other places.  The prices are great too.  The free drink is nice.  I always get a cold HK milk tea.  Usually, you're charged extra for a cold drink.  This is standard practice actually but Keung Kee does it for free!  Another bonus!!  YAY!!

I loved the baked rice dishes. You choose a sauce,  and a choice of protien (pork, chicken, fish etc.)  The portions are big so you always leave full. 

So if you ever wake up too late on a weekend and you feel like something that can last you to dinner, think about giving Keung Kee a try.  This is my go to place on Saturdays when I sleep in.  The service can get slow when they're busy, which they can get on weekends, but nothing that will disappoint you.
