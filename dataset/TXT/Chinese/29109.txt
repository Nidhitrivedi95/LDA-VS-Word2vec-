8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ This review is for dim sum only. I have not been here for dinner.

DO NOT come here without a reservation on a holiday. The wait time can be as long as over two hours, no exaggeration. 

This place is a little fancier than your typical regular dim sum restaurant. Prices are a little more expensive too but you pay for what you get. The food quality is good and portions aren't small. Needless to say, the extra small amount you pay is worth it. They do not stinge out on ingredients. For example, the har gow has pretty large pieces of shrimp and they will add edible garnishes to the dishes like a shrimp on top of the order of har gows!

Food (Taste): 4/5
Food (Presentation): 5/5
Service: well, it's an Asian restaurant, I wouldn't count on it.
Ambiance: 3/5
Price: 3/5
