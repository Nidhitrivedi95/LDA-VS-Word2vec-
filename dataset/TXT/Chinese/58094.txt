DA3Dzic8NAJ0LYnYZG9nyQ Friendly staff and usually good service behind food that is typical of Asian strip mall buffets. Usually the food is of good quality, and more traditional than adventuresome in the available selections, which I suspect is what clientele here want, as the place does a good business. However, beware the oil: everything fried tends to be swimming in it, as the food does not seem to be well-drained after frying, and is sometimes literally floating in oil in serving bins (every time more food is added, the oil accumulates...). The furnishings are attractive and the recently remodeled layout eases traffic flow. Overall a good place for a quick Asian bite or lunchtime pig-out.
