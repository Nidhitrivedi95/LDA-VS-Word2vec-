T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw Right off the bat, our service was great. The hostesses checked us in and got us seated faster than fast. Our server, JARED, was amazing. Someone in our party can't have spicy and ordered an entree (without the chili pepper symbol) but just to be sure, Jared brought him over a small side of the sauce for him to try. That was SUPER mindful of him to do. We didn't like a certain tea, he whisked it away and was back out with a different beverage in about 2 minutes (if that!) This was my first time here but with this service and food quality, it won't be my last. THANK YOU for the great experience!
