pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA My favorite restaurant in Vegas. I go here whenever I'm in town. I always leave it up to the server/ chef when I order so I've tried a little bit of everything and have never been disappointed. On my most recent visit I really enjoyed the skewers & the scallops. You really can't go wrong here.
