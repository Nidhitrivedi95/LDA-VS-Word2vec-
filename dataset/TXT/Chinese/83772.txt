HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ I really hate to do this, but after over 5 recent visits, my feelings toward Ginbu 401 has faded and I think I will move on.  Ginbu is not too far my office and also delivers to my home, only a few miles away so I have taken advantage of both, restaurant visits and delivery.
I have typically ordered sushi, which I feel has gone downhill. The sashimi slices seem to have shrunk over the years and aren't the best pieces of fish I have seen/had. And, I don't really feel like they offer a good varirty of rolls, almost everyone includes a fried item or cream cheese.
However, being disappointed with the sushi I decided to check out their chinese dishes and ordered the Sechuan (spelling??) chicken and UGH is all I will say!!! The chicken tasted like frozen chicken and I ended up spitting have of every bite out because it tasted so bad. I resolved to eating the bland white rice they sent and the veggies out of the dish which weren't that great either.  I won't make that mistake again.
