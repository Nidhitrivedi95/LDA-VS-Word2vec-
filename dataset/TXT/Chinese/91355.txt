IjNwvrCE3RWpI4bllEcJWA came here on that chinese new year day where you have to eat vegetarian..
 
jammed pack.. and the menu?  what menu?  they only were serving 1 thing that day... one set combo that everyone must get.. (unless you know the staff or manager.. then you can order special dishes)

price was insane... ended up paying 50 bucks a person for a very very weak tasting combo... not tasty at all... we ended up ordering something not on their set menu.. a pop corn chicken chow mein which was the saving grace for us ... otherwise i would give this place 1 and half star...
the stuff tasted like manchu wok with the heaviest cornstarch sauce on top of it all.. 

cornstarch sauce... i mean no taste jelly coat on top... you know what i mean..

anyways.. it could be cause i came on a bad day.. but still... shame on them for having no menu that day.. tsk tsk.
