pdy6EAcJvZks1hKogxOj6Q So glad to of found our new go to Chinese restaurant. Everything was AMAZING. We got egg drop soup, crab puffs, general tsao chicken, curry chicken, & noodles. Not a single complaint. We ate there, but next time will get it delivered. I overheard another guest in the restaurant saying "we just drove across town to eat here again." HUGE portion sizes. We can't wait to order again!
