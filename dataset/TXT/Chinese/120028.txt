nztjmkY4LZp18kviHIO7ow Ok, so I don't know if I made the wrong choices but I went here on tues and wed night I started getting sick and here it is sat night and I still have massive stomach. Bug from this place. I got all the fish choices and broccoli and two pieces of sushi, I'm on a diet so I skipped all the fried choices or noodles.  I had to leave work early on Thursday and go to a little clinic to get seen, they prescribed me zofran for bad nausea and vomiting. I will never return back to this place. This was the only thing out if the ordinary I did this week and no I don't have the flu cuz I was tested for that at the little clinic cuz I was in so much pain. I just think their food is not kept at correct temperatures or removed when out for too long.
