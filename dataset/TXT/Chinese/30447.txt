9BBWtaSvsootDkKTVBgv_A Very happy to see another Chinese buffet in the area. And this one has more parking and easier street access than Dragon, so it will be a better lunch choice when time is limited.

The food is very good, standard Chinese buffet, plus sushi bar and hibachi grill. The buffet has many American comfort foods as well; fried chicken, mac & cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, and even pizza, so even my non-adventurous family members are happy. Great addition to the neighborhood.
