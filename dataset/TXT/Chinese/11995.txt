2meb5cwKh125tF5IwUiIJA My arteries will not thank me for visiting Harmonie countless times over the years. Even now that I do not live permanently in Montreal, this bakery becomes a must-do appointment whenever I am in Chinatown. 

Harmonie has an outstanding selection of buns to suit every taste. The sweet ones revolve around red bean, taro, coconut and custard. The savoury ones are mostly pork and some beef, though I rarely go that way anyway.

Ladies, gentlemen: one word: TONGS. Use them! Unless you are picking up pre-packed items from the center counter or the fridge, do not touch what's about to become my food.

My staple diet at Harmonie consists of coconut whipped cream buns, mochis, green tea sponge cake and at least one taro bun. If you are having more than just a dessert on-the-go, it's worth getting some more buns and asking for a box at the cashier. With a smile and the dexterity of a magician, your full tray is boxed and bagged before you can say "yum". 

Proving the virtuous circle theory, Harmonie has such a high throughput they can afford to charge almost nothing for awesomely-baked goodness, which means they attract more customers, which means they have a high throughput; bake for 30 minutes, taste, repeat.

I fed, filling up for good, a 3-person office and a 2-person family for $12.75. It is absurdly cheaper than celery, and certainly more pleasant to eat.

The bubble tea selection (enormous with endless customizations) deserves an honourable mention. I always go for the less sweet ones, and could even recommend the just-green-tea version - your blood vessels might thank you in the future. In the meantime, please do check this place out.

Oh, yes: CASH  ONLY.
