eLExQY6_KOYaayapWNp5IQ Peking duck tastes good. Yes, maybe that is the only one I like.
But it seems a little bit expensive .
Anyway,this restaurant is clean, because it's new. Hopefully they can keep it clean,and I will try it soon. Because they have promotion now, buy one duck and get one duck free for next time. I like this deal.
