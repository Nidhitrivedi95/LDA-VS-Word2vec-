LsgE9TBlyvGFF2n7esSd2w We love going here.  We love the friendly, quick service and quality meals. Dillon, the manager, is really good. He is friendly and helpful with suggestions.  

Food is delicious and has good variety from Sushi to Chicken & Noodle/Rice bowls.  It's kind of a midway point between Panda Express and P. F. Chang's.  You also earn loyalty program points.

Ambiance is fun. We like sitting at the counter to watch the food get prepared.  It's one of our favorite 'go to' places.
