pGjtxXBq4tZcdKdgTU-Tww One of my worst meals ever. Yuck! Had sesame chicken, I swear they used sauce out of a jar. The wonton soup that came with was mediocre. The fried rice was completely awful. The egg roll also awful. Maybe the rest of you are easily pleased? I won't be returning. I would imagine it stays open another month at most.
