bzMO8LJmJtgo3KuyWGKUxA First restaurant that I ate at in Toronto during interview season a few years ago. Went back recently and still very satisfied with the food and dissatisfied with the service. Really cheap (under $10 for a large portion size/big bowl of noodles with generous amount of toppings) tasty Chinese noodles with broth-y or dry options. Difficult to find true vegetarian options though and vegan options are basically nonexistent. The ingredients taste and look fresh - the veggies, meat, and especially the noodles, which have a chewy, handmade kind of texture that I really enjoy. 

Food 4/5 - Generic, but fresh. Noodles are dough-y/chewy. Not a lot of good vegetarian options.
Value 5/5 - Even compared to other Chinatown restaurants. Definitely way cheaper than Dundas options. Big portion sizes.
Service 2/5 - Not friendly or attentive. A waitress spilled a glass of water on our table and threw us a few napkins to clean it up ourselves. Needless to say they work super fast paced here.
Venue 3/5 - Small for the volume of customers (they are popular!), but enough tables to seat more than a few groups. I've never made a reservation for here and so far have always been seated almost immediately. However, definitely would recommend making a reservation if you plan on bringing a group of people since the place does frequently fill up at dinner time! Brightly lit. Loud. Washrooms are fairly clean and not dingy like some old school Chinatown washrooms.

They also do pickups.
