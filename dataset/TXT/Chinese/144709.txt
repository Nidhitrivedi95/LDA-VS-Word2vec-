RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ Food here was terrible. The eggplant and short rib hot pot was super tough and fatty. The pork, cabbage noodle soup was very bland and tried eating the leftovers were inedible. The server was friendly but inattentive and we had to ask several time for water. Also, didn't tell us until after she opened the wine bottle that there was a 5 dollar corkage fee. Overall: Would not recommend this place at all!
