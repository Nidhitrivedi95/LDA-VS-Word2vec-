yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA This place is a definite MUST when you're in Vegas. It's like a hip Vietnamese restaurant where all the young kids go after a night of clubbing. They're opened 24/7 so it's perfect to stop by anytime.  It IS called PHO Kim Long so you gotta try their pho and nothing else because my aunt did NOT enjoy her Com Suon Nuong (rice with grilled pork?). I'm not sure if it's always packed on weekends but when my family and I arrived at 11AM on a Sunday, it was a full house.  Service was mediocre.  Our server could have been more attentive.  It took a really long time for our pho to come out due to the party of 15 before us.  Other than that, Pho Kim Long was a good experience.  I'll be bringing my friends here after a long night of drinking and dancing :)
