Pros:
Service is good

Cons:
Portions could be better
Not as good as Kiko was

Fav Cafe took over what used to be Kiko.  I really liked Kiko so I was hoping Fav would take the over the torch well.  Sadly, it doesn't. The service is friendly, but that's all it has going compared to Kiko.

When you come in for lunch, you're presented with one sheet for the menu.  The lunch menu consists of 25 entrees/noodle bowls.  That's it.  It's really not much variety compared to other HK style cafes.  If you're coming expecting a lot of the HK style cafe standards, you may be out of luck.  Fav centralizes around fusion of HK style cafes and western dishes.  If this is not your thing, Fav might not be the place to go for you.

We ordered the chicken alfredo and the pork chop and onion sauce on rice.  The food doesn't take too long to come out after ordering.  When the food came out, even before a bite, I knew I wouldn't be impressed too much.  Just by looking at my pics, you can see that the pasta barely had any sauce. My pork chop dish just looked bare.  It was a pork chop on a bowl of rice for $10. I know I'm at a HK style cafe, but it just felt like there should be more.  My little one didn't like the pasta (a rarity) so we ordered a plate of fries and wings for her.  I forgot to take a pic of that, but I think there was something like only 30 fries on the plate.  The portions could of been much better.

I actually liked Fav's first location.  I just feel that the second one could be a lot better.  A little more variety in the menu and better portions could go a long way.
