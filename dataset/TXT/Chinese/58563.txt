dCX6CvWGn8oiPSD_yxrm0Q Went here for the first time and was pretty disappointed after reading such great reviews. The egg drop soup was so thick I couldn't eat it. Very gelatin looking. I had the orange chicken as directed by reviews and it was OK. Not wonderful but not bad. Left much of my Chinese craving unsatisfied.
