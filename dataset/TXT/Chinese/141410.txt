rfnxqUGlB0njcjEWJCZ9mg I saw Dr. Zhou for stress reduction and for managing my narcolepsy and his treatments were very helpful. For comparison, I saw 10+ different acupuncturists in Chicago during grad school and can honestly say he blows them all out of the water. His needling technique is  different  from the generic version taught in American oriental schools and much more effective. He's a little more expensive than other providers but his treatments also come with a short massage. I agree with the previous reviewer that he's hard to understand at times and will recommend  X number of treatments. The directness of his treatment plan is a cultural difference. In China a provider takes ownership/responsibility of your complete health and payment is not rendered until there is improvement (regardless of number of appointments required for this to happen). This ideology doesn't translate as well to an American fee per service model but as long as you are upfront about your finances something can be worked out. I cannot speak high enough of him.
