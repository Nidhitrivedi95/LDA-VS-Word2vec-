IBNWrN1k9E0E_bMcRD-GwA Wow! My family origins are from Taiwan and this brings me back! Great comfort food like ma po tofu and duck. We had the crispy duck with shrimp Lo mien and boy Choy w shiitake mushrooms. Apps are great also - 3 for $6. We had the pig ears, seaweed and kimchi.

Service is friendly and polite and the chef came out to check if the food was good. We went on a Monday night and it wasn't busy.
