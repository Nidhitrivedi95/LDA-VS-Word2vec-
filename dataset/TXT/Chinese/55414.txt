cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg Probably my favorite restaurant around the area.  George is a character if you happen to run into him and the staff is friendly if sometimes a little backed up on busy nights.

The sign of a good American-style Chinese place is a good quality Egg Foo Young, and George has the best one I've have in Arizona since Ming's in Tempe closed.  I'm also a huge fan of their lemon chicken, and kung pao chicken.  

The Kung Pao Chicken excludes peanuts which I've never understood in that dish and delivers a nice spicy kick.  I normally ask for it extra spicy.

We've probably picked up dinner here 20 times in the past few years and they haven't had a bad night yet.
