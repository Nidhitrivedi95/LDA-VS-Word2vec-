ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ Dinner Buffet on Sunday night 

I'm not a fan of buffets, especially at a steep price of $29.99, but I came here merely for the experience of eating with friends and checking out the elaborate ancient Chinese decor. That said, I lowered my expectations for the food to buffet standards.  

The decor is pretty nice to look at. It actually reminds me of a restaurant I went to in China with the deep red walls, dark wood and vases/decorations. I also like the double walled glass tea cups for the dim sum service but didn't try as you have to pay for tea and drinks. 

Food Recommendations: 

Sushi bar - I would say this was the best section of food. Good selection of special rolls and sashimi. They limit 2 per turn of salmon, scallop and hamachi sashimi , all of which are pretty thick and fresh. (Sweet egg is way too sweet.)  

Cold seafood bar - Cold mussels, shrimp, crab legs - not meaty though 

Peking duck - the wrap is pretty thin and the duck pieces are thick. 

Grilled pineapple

Black sesame icecream 

Other food that could be improved:

Sweet and Sour soup - I thought this was ok but could be more sour and more spicy. 

Beef Green Onion Roll - too tough to chew 

Cooked to order steak cubes - good texture, but overly salty, and some pieces were under cooked. 

Noodle Bar - this is a good selling point - fresh knife-cut noodles with choice of three soups (chicken broth, fish soup, spicy beef). A bit underwhelming. 

Creme Brulee (individual) - not creamy enough, but i like the sugar on top. 

Ginger Milk Pudding - no ginger taste, just milk pudding

Skip the taro dessert!! 


Overall, a wide variety of food (sushi bar, grilled foods, Chinese stir fry, dim sum, noodle bar, desserts), but hit or miss on the taste.
