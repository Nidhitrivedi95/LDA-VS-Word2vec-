szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A This is the BEST place for dim sum in Az. One of the most exciting parts is that they don't only serve dim sum on the weekends. They have great tea, fabulous Chinese broccoli, and MANY other dishes that are very fresh in spite of coming to you via the traditional carts. I always recommend coming here if you are looking for dim sum in the Phoenix area!!!!
