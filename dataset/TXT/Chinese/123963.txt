It was Saturday night around 9 pm and the place was very quiet. It took 25 minutes for some pork and cilantro dumplings, green onion pancakes beef noodle soup and wonton soup.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but most Chinese places have that shit ready for you in 5 minutes tops.

Service was sweet and polite but certainly not speedy.

Food was just ok. Wonton soup was super small and the dumplings were not te best but had some decent flavour.beef soup had a beef heart in it. Not a problem for me but  my friend was grossed out by this. Also a really weird small size for a cow's heart. Perhaps something smaller? A goat?

Not a great spot.
