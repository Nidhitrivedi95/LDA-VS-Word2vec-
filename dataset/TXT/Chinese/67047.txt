ElCX49QVRf-IJlvKLOZSlA Not real Chinese. I have lived in Beijing, Shanghai, and Taiwan and the dishes were not at all authentic. The Kung pao chicken was heavy on a thick sauce that was gooey and loaded with sugar. The chicken was so soft as to be almost like mashed potatoes in texture.  The sauce tasted like it came out of a jar.   I have had the kung pao all over asia and it was nothing like this.  It can be served with a sauce or more like a dry stir fry, but this was not good.  My wife had the shui Zhu niu rou (a beef in soup dish) and it was tasteless, as was my daughter's extra spicy chicken.  The wait staff got into a small argument with a customer over a mistaken order of fried rice, which was odd as they were locals and the restaurant risked chasing away future business.  Anyhow, there are better choices in town.
