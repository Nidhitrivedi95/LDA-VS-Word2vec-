QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw The owner helped us make an awesome sauce at the sauce bar.  The favorite broths for our family were the Szechwan for those who like it spicy and the Korean Kimchi for those who like it flavorful, without the heat.  For 2 adults and 2 teenagers, we ordered Two Dinner Combos and we each got our own broth.  We thought we would then add on with side orders if needed, but this filled us up plenty with the extra noodles available at the sauce bar.  We even had a couple containers to bring home.  Not bad to feed all 4 of us dinner for $40 plus lunch the next day.  The owners and their daughter were just great.  We were celebrating a birthday and they noticed and commented on it.  Looking forward to a return visit.  The only bummer is that the tables are barely large enough to hold a drink, the platter of food to cook and the cook top.  A bit of a juggling act, but worth it!
