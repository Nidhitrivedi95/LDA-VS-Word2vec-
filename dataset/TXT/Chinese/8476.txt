So I was quite excited to see a grandma preparing fresh dough in the window of Dumpling Queen.  My my experiences uptown, usually places that make dumplings also makes their own noodles.  When I got into the restaurant I noticed the distinctive Northern Chinese accents of the servers and chefs (who seemed to be related) so I knew I was in good hands.  OK. So far all signs are pretty promising. Juuuust one little thing: my own dumb assumption. For some reason (maybe it was the cute grandma in the window), I thought that they hand-made all their dough-related dishes (including their noodles).  So I was not to pleased when I got my order that not only were the noodles not hand made but have been over cooked to a level of no return.  They were disintegrating between my chopsticks.  The soup was very soy-saucy and had very minimal beef taste.  I also ordered the family style salad which was pretty tasty but I was too grief stricken over my beef noodle soup to appreciate it.  

To be fair this place is called Dumpling Queen and I did not order any dumplings.  I have a feeling that they will be better than the noodles because at least they are handmade from scratch.  I feel bad about writing this review because the people who work here seem to be really nice so maybe I will come back and try their dumplings.
