D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA If you need a helping of dim sum<U+200B>, this is not a bad place to go. I came in the morning and the service was excellent. The food was decent <U+200B>but too expensive for the amount you recieved. 

I had the short ribs, sticky shrimp balls, pot stickers, and a variety of other types<U+200B> of dumplings. As you can see, other than the short ribs, all I ate were different types of dumplings. Yes, they were appetizing and I recommend<U+200B> ordering these dishes, but I expected more options from the dim sum menu. Additionally, the limited amount in each dish can put a hole in your wallet, so hopefully, <U+200B>you win big at the casino to make up for your loss here.  

The atmosphere is nicely decorated and full of life. With the convenience<U+200B> of being located in the Paris casino, I would probably return if I really wanted some dim sum in Sin City.
