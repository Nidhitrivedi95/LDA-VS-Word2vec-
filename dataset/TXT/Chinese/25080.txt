773ovbZW7HvfaNy5laUznQ I usually order a combination Lo mein with no veggies at any Asian place that sells it, and so I tried Jia's. I got it with veggies this time, and it honestly was amazing. The next time I went back, I didn't ask for no veggies it was so great. The first time they let me combine shrimp/scallops. The scallops were perfection, so were the shrimp. The second time I had beef/chicken/shrimp (wouldn't let me do shrimp/scallops over the phone, I guess?) but omg even the take out was amazing. Definitely recommend.
