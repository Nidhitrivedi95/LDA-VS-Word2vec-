JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA I've spent years out in other states devouring their takes on Mongolian BBQ, and yet for some reason YC's takes the cake. Everywhere I've gone defaulted to an AYCE style, so color me surprised when the best I've had was largely single order/take out.

If you aren't familiar with the format, you prepay for either a small or large bowl, so you don't have to worry about check at the end. You start with sliced meats, that they graciously provide paper to smash it all down and maximize space. You can dry spice if you want, then follow up with plenty of vegetables. What impressed me about YC's is the option of multiple noodles - after dozens of iterations, this is the only one with anything outside egg noodles - and the udon, rice, and wheat are all kickass! Then you finish off your sauce mixture in a separate bowl and you're off to the races.

I've tried the all you can eat out of habit a couple times, and I've found it not worth it. The norm is basically stacking your bowl as high as physically possible, with some of the most impressive bowls over twice the height you start with! When you get a quick stir fry from a bowl that big, with rice, soup, wontons, and ice cream at dinner, a large is actually ridiculously filling.

Not only am I a fan of their wheat noodles, but their sauce selection is straight up the best. With options like lemongrass, black pepper sauce, and Spicy Hunan on top of your regular selection, you can create something that can hit pretty much any flavor palate. 

When all my friends in high school kept inviting me to go to YC's, I passed out of sheer ignorance. Never again will I give up a chance at some of the best tasting and valued Asian food in Scottsdale period.
