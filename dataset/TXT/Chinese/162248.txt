UlyCnc4_Suu2DSqYQSwkqQ The buffet here is pretty good. The BF and I have been here a couple of times. However, each time we're there (usually a weekend) they seem to be having some weirdo little "deal" going on. This past Sunday you received tickets when you walked in and on the half-hour the manager was going to spin the wheel.

What followed was the weirdest thing I have ever witnessed!! They brought out this little Wheel-O-Fortune knockoff and proceeded to spin it. The number that came up was 9...well about 9 people had that at the end of their ticket number! So then each person had to spin again, and again, and again! It was SO strange.

The whole while, the manager kept prattling on and on in broken English over a very loud P.A. system and the BF and I just kept looking at each other like, "Is it okay to go get more food during this, or what?" IT was like a campy game show!

All the strange-ness aside, this place is really decently priced, the food is good, and the wait staff is really friendly! Hey...you never know what you might see...it definitely won't disappoint in the entertainment department!
