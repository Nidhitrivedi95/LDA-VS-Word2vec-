J8PbfZbU7XTs-h55ezuQcQ This is my new Friday night Chinese take out.  Dinner for two includes cheese ragoons, egg rolls, soup, two entrees and rice.  All for just under $13.  I have yet to be disappointed with any.  It is truly the best egg drop soup I have eaten in Madison.  Sure it is in a random strip mall, and limited seating but the guy who runs it is always friendly.  He will cook it up for you if you ask.  Yummy.
