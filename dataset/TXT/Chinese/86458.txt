HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Yum yum get you some........bao!!!

    This is one of the hidden gems that is rising on the foodie radar charts. I have not brought one friend yet (around 7 so far) that has not devoured the pork belly bao and wanted more.   They have a great, small menu that mostly pleases.    

My favorites in order:
Pork belly bao
Fat Choy burger
Duck bao
Potstickers
Short rib grilled cheese
Sesame noodles
Wonton soup

You can also get some decent draft beers from
Casino bar and bring them right in.    

Great bang for the buck.
Ghetto location.

Would be five stars if it had a better location.
