Be on the lookout if you want to go to this place though, as this restaurant is located on a fairly small lot that is easily hidden by its large mini-mall neighbor. It is quite easy to miss when you are driving by. Not too much parking in the front either, but luckily there is a parking lot in the back.

Of the lunch menu, I would recommend the green beans in X.O. sauce. The green beans are usually crisp and seasoned perfectly. The X.O. sauce provides a slight spicy kick to the green beans. If you're into noodles, the Hong Kong style chow mein is a dish containing a bed of pan-fried noodles doused with a rich meat gravy. It's my personal favorite. The spicy salted pork chops can be hit or miss. Sometimes it's tasty, other times it can be bland. Most of the lunch menu includes white rice, which means you could probably get away with just ordering one dish if you're eating alone.

Recently though, they have raised their prices to be $5.25. That's an increase of $0.25, which isn't too much of a big deal, but just know that so you aren't surprised when the bill comes.
