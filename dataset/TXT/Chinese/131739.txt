PlP0c_u3g-3LiWHpb2XnOQ My dining mates and I ate here for dinner. Very extensive dinner menu featuring  regional choices for example of Cantonese, Szechuan dishes,plus combo dinner specials. Lunch menu also extensive. Sushi cuisine offered also.

Menu prices very reasonable.

The atmosphere was plain but comfortable. Our waitress very friendly and eager to explain the menu we had questions about.
Our dinners were plated nicely, good portions. Food was warm not hot.
Spicy dishes were not that spicy and we actually asked for a extra little dish of hot sauce for the food.

Everything we ordered was very tasty.
Our waitress made a few mistakes on our orders but quickly apologized and brought out the correct dishes.


We ordered, hot and sour soup, miso soup, lettuce wraps, salmon roll. Entrees were Hunan chicken, beef and scallops, sesame chicken, and spicy fish. Brown, white or fried rice choices with dinner.
All in all an enjoyable dinner. We would come back again for lunch or dinner.
