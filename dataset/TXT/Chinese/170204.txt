VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q Come here often since my fiancé is a huge fan of noodle soup and just realized on my 10th check-in that I haven't wrote a review so here goes. Meal selection is unique because you get to customize your bowl. Ex. You select the type of noodle, toppings, and side items. I'm a big fan of the peanut chili soup with instant noodles and a side order of chicken wings. Honey glazed sausages are recommended too. Service is typically quick but place gets busy at prime meal hours so be patient or stay clear for you might turn into the hulk. Overall, it's worth the visit and I recommend the joint
