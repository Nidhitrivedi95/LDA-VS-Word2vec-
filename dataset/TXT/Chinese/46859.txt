bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Staff is amazing! We went on Christmas and they were packed. The staff remained so efficient & friendly. That in itself was impressive. And the food! The quality was spot on. Try the tender beef & broccoli (with carrots too! Nice Touch). Also try the Singapore rice noodles, lots of shrimp, chicken & BBQ pork all seasoned just right. Can't wait to return & see the entertainment & of course, try more entrees. Yum!  Thanks to everyone at the Singing Panda for a great dining experience:-)
