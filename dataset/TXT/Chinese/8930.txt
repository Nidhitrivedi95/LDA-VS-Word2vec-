1nM-ES-xVqL0yQGTCwtd-Q So being Sunday and feeling kinda lazy I wanted to order in. If you have been following me, I have been reviewing more Northwest area restaurant due to the fact that I live near Summerlin. This restaurant I spotted one day driving in the area and found out they deliver. So I got Appetizer - Gyoza , Pad Thai, and Green Tea Ice Cream. Gyoza was amazing -- very fresh had a spicy sauce with it witch was good but killed the dumpling meat taste. Pad thai -- it was average unfortunately no peanuts or crushed on it or little, and noodles where good. The Green tea ice cream to me tasted more like vanilla ice cream with a green color but it was good I have seen some where its intensely green tea flavored. I have no major complaints, The Gyoza where probably some the best I have had. Will be back to try other items.
