Dl-hhPCjRJM221XSwiuTbg I LOVE this place so much. I used to go to another hotpot place either the one near leslie & hwy 7 and hwy7 & Kennedy. After first time i tried this place two years ago, i always go to Legend Pot instead. Sometimes there a lots of people and you have to wait for around 15-30 mins to be seated. The food is good (they are a bit expensive and you can get most of the stuff from T&T, but i still like eating here) and the food come really fast after you order it. The place is very clean.

Food: 4.5/5
Price: 3/5
Atmosphere and staff: 4.5/5
Overall: 4.5/5
