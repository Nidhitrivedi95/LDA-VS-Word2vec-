Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Yelp Deals saved me $10 at Pan Asian! I bought it 5 minutes before I got to the restaurant. 

I always really enjoy the grilled tiger prawn salad. The shrimp has a great grill flavor, the mango slices add an interesting texture and flavor, and the fish sauce based salad dressing is light. 

The only thing you should be aware of is it's spicy! I've ordered a 5 and I would tear and my nose would run. This time I ordered a 4, it was still spicy but tolerable and only my nose ran. 

I really like the roti and I think it's homemade. It comes with a curry sauce. It's a little oily but so so good.
