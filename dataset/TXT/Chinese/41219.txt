b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag Chin Chin, which mostly has locations in Los Angeles, is one of my favorite restaurants because they carry one dish I love: their Chinese Chicken Salad (with no chicken).  This is California Chinese food, not authentic Chinese food, and some dishes are hit or miss.  Favorites of my friends include: paper wrapped chicken, orange chicken, lettuce wraps, and spring rolls with delicious apricot dipping sauce.  They have low fat versions of several of their dishes.  I'm guessing this isn't a popular dining destination within the New York-New York, as it wasn't crowded at dinner time.
