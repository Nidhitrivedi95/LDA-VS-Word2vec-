1czIVv2iyOHc3WMgtUWXCQ Chi Zhang is the owner of Persuasion but you don't need me to tell you that because he will most likely introduce himself as you get settled at your table. 

Persuasion has some of the best customer service of any restaurant I've ever been to. My boyfriend and I go at least once a week and since day 1 Chi and May made it a priority to know our names and get to know our likes and dislikes.

A few of my favorite dishes are the beef and/or tofu in spicy garlic sauce, and the chicken in ginger white wine sauce. The eggrolls are delicious! I also had the Pho one day and it was on par with any pho I've had at any Vietnamese restaurant in the area.

We love Persuasion and will continue to frequent there as guests!
