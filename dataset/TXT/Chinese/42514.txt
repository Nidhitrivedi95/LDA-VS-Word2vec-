The service was phenomenal with attentive, patient and knowledgeable staff. Even though we did not make a reservation, they were kind enough to seat us.

I had the chance to try a wide variety of items on the menu, but I'll just expand on my favorite and least favorite. My favorite was the steam bun with mortadella, pickles and some mustard sauce. It pretty much looked like a white burger, but tasted so unique, unlike anything I've ever tasted before. The pickles and mustard really added a special kick. Even though it's one of the cheapest items on the menu, it's one of the best. The pork belly dim sum small plate was pretty good too--savory pork bites with a crisp sweet glaze on the outside. The best part was the fat (go ahead and cringe, but I love my fats). 

My least favorite item was the roasted pork ramen. How can you really mess up ramen? Well, just have terrible broth and add a crap load of sodium. I was not a fan of the broth at all, tasted straight up like soy sauce mixed with water. The noodles were good though, but the bit of goodness was drowned in the pool of horrible broth. If you want to try ramen, I recommend the chicken meatball ramen over the roasted pork. 

The food was overall great, but there are a few hit or miss items. The portion was itty bitty, but the price left a decent dent on the wallet. Bill ended up close to $100 for a party of 5. Not super expensive, but still expensive enough for me to label this a luxury. Even with that hefty bill, I didn't leave the restaurant full, just satiated not fulfilled. I definitely recommend Grit and Grace for its unique flavors, but crack open that piggy bank! As for me, oh praise Mc. D for their fries and nuggets!
