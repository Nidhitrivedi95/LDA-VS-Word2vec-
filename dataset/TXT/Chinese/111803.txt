mBFGYVLh588BrvfmGsOhrA I came across this place on Yelp. Being a food truck, I was expecting some bold and spicy flavors and it's safe to say I wasn't disappointed at all. The food was great! I ordered BBQ roll, lamb skewer and chicken wings. Everything was full of flavor and tasted great, especially the chicken wings. As mentioned by previous comments, the service was great and the owner took good care of us. I might even go ahead and say it's the best chinese food in the area. Definitely try it!
