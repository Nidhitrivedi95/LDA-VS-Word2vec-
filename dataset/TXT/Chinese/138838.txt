QS7_BPmaBNvznOMhcVBemg I would of given 5 stars but the service was very slow, our waitress was very slow and forgot we asked for extra napkins and straws. However, the food was amazing!!!!!!! I would go back for the food.
I had the duck, absolutely perfect. And the sauté spicy beef was so good! The tempura shrimp was the best i ever had.  Thank you silk noodle! A great find!
