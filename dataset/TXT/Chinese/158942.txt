U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ This was a little place.  There were customers crowed around little tables.  They were located on Spring Mountain Rd/Arville St next to Mr Sandwich in Chinatown.

The waitress handed me a paper menu, like a sushi menu that you mark.  The menu was limited and didn't have descriptions of the food.  I wasn't really familiar with Taiwanese food.   They need a website, but have a Facebook page.

The waitress was very friendly, but I never saw her again until the bill came at the end of my meal.  I wanted a fork, but could never flag down a server.

I ordered the Won Ton Noodle.  It turned out to be a soup.  There were about 5 flavorful won tons topped with baby bok choy and scallions.  The noodles were chewy.  The broth was tasteless.  The jar of hot pepper sauce was almost empty and needed to be wiped down.

I won't be back.
