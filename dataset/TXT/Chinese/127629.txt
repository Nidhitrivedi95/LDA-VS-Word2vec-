PD3ganU8NAGkqkcIXYPSxQ Perfect for a chilly night! Unlimited noodles to satisfy your carb needs and leave the restaurant with a belly full of warm and delicious broth. 

The standard soup base + 10 toppings is $8.99. We tried the spicy base and the pickled cabbage base - both were pretty good. We didn't come home feeling parched like we would from other MSG-heavy soups at other restaurants - a good sign!

You can also add in extra meat for $2.99 - we added in lamb to ours but it was just a few pieces (4-5) so best to leave your lamb slice cravings to a hotpot AYCE place instead of here.

We also tried a cold chicken appetizer - this was similar to a hainanese chicken with some spicy / peanut sauce on top. Great app to pair with your soup!

This place is an affordable dinner option that's perfect for the cold weather. I personally like a lot of veggies in my soups, which I thought this place lacked. The 10 toppings had a good variety but it was only a little bit of each thing. But if you're in the mood for good broth and lots of noodles, don't count this one out.
