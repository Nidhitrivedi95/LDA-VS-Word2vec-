kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A Went in there for Lunch. Busy and slow as it can be.  

Ordered the Beef w/tomato broth. 
Noodles were Fresh and Amazingly good.  The broth was decent.  I've had better from Cali. The flavors didn't seem all there, needed to be cooked more.  Beef wasn't completely soft & tender. 

Also ordered the vegetable pancake, that was really Good!

I don't think I'll b back there when I could get it in China town (LV & CA).
