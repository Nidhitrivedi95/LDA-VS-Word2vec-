VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ The Chinese food was alright.  Our egg rolls were probably the best out of everything.  I ordered the cashew chicken and I didn't like it. The chicken was very rubbery.  The twice cooked pork was a tiny bit rubbery. I gave it three stars because the egg rolls were delicious and service was good. I will not be coming back here.
