O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw I love dim sum and have eaten it in many cities.  Rol San has amazing dim sum and is definitely worth the trip.  The Har Kow (or shrimp dumplings) is a favorite of mine and many.  It comes out very fresh here and is always tasty and wrapped in a very light rice paper.  The cuttle fish (baby squid in a curry sauce) is yummy and tender, not rubbery.  Usually comes out super hot which is great, as cold cuttle fish is awful.  The steamed barbecue pork buns are tasty little delights, especially when dipped in a combination of the hot chirashi sauce mixed with sweet and sour.  The sticky rice comes in two individually wrapped packages and is just the right consistency of sticking together with a wonderful flavor and almost every package includes a piece of spicy Chinese sausage.  The shu mai is a masterpiece here - you can taste its homemade, bursting with flavor in a very light wrapper and topped with an orange caviar.  The turnip cakes almost always come out hot (if cold, they are gummy) and have small chunks of turnip in them, which I love.  Any of the steamed dumplings I've tried are wonderful - hot and full of flavor.  The greens are amazing, especially those in a black bean sauce.  The atmosphere is okay, the staff is usually helpful, although you come across the server that from time to time is a bit grumpy.  The plastic cloth on the tablecloth must be ignored in favor of the delightful food.  I've eaten at other dim sum places in Chinatown on Spadina and this one is tops.  Would totally recommend as a regular customer.  Really worth it for taste, cost, and overall choice of traditional dim sum dishes.
