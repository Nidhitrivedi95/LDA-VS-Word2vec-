iPtSfoSBj7r72pxDlM3pcg People just like to go and rant about only the negative things, this is like any other typical Panda Express, been going here awhile now and never had any problems with anything, also always receive friendly service. And if they take awhile to remake an item that ran out be patient cause at least you know they're cooking it fresh and not just microwaving frozen food 

FYI IF THEY'RE BUSY DONT BE RUDE AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WAIT... It's literally the McDonald of Chinese food in America lol stop expecting so much for the amount you're willing to pay
