f8R1qFYugdhQRR-ym8SUxg A really authentic Sichuan restaurant with very nice decor and decent service!  Having tried other restaurants in Toronto this one stands out for the flavours and ambiance.  Husband's family is from Sichuan and we have travelled there many times and this cooking is similar to the food over there however his family says its toned down a bit but good but for me it's the right spice.  They even have private rooms which remind me of restaurants in China.  Prices are decent too.
