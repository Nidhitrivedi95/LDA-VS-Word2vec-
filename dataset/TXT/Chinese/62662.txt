dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw Oh, my....this is the kind of Chinese food I am crazy about.  The flavors are so intense and complex that I get full within a few bites.  I had Dan Dan noodles and a plate of their cold dish offerings from a converted salad bar setup.  I don't know exactly what the cold dishes were:  I think one was some kind of seaweed, one had edamame, chinese greens, cilantro and dried red peppers, one had big chunks of cucumber, one had fried or braised tofu slices, and one had pork ear (I asked because I like pork ear).  There were other things, but I wanted some green stuff to offset the noodles.  The plate of cold stuff costs an extra $4.50, but I got way more than my money's worth.  The Dan Dan noodles were thick and chewy, with a distinctive wheat taste, a rich, oily, spicy meat sauce that perfectly embodied ma-la flavors underneath, and chopped peanuts on top.

I'd had a very difficult time trying to choose a dish from the menu:  so many things looked good to me.  Sliced fish?  Preserved pork?  Lamb?  I'll have to go back again and again.

If you aren't used to spicy food, you might want to avoid some of the dishes marked as spicy on the menu.  Or maybe not, because you would be really missing out.

The atmosphere and decor are spartan/casual.  It doesn't matter.  The food is that good.
