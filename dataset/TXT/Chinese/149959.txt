sr0rCMn-XtKATvl9adYQxA Good staple Chinese desserts. A go to for quick eats and warm sweet soups. A bit cramped, small chairs, don't go in with bags and heavy jackets, you won't have a place to put them. Take out friendly. Good to have them running for so long. A nice traditional dessert in Scarborough.
