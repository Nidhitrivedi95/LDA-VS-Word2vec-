EWmYNndtI9G0c2lI58vQWA Seems to be less popular than the resteraunt next door that shares the same hostess. The menu next door seemed a lot better but had a 30 min wait vs no wait. It was Relatively quiet Saturday night. The menu itself is rather small, but filled with great dishes. We got the duck wrap, seafood Stevie, kimchi fried rice, jumbo prawns, and one of each dessert.

The duck wrap was delicious. Great taste with a spicy kick at the end. Seafood Stevie was very light, I wish it would have had a bit more flavor. Jumbo prawns were... Well... Jumbo. Great taste cooked perfectly. Kim chi friend rice was done as you'd expect. The desserts were also delicious. In order (best to worse) my favorites were there the mochi ice cream, then the mango pudding, and then the cream puff.

The food for the most part was above average, but why this place really gets 5 stars is because of it's service. We admittedly had an obnoxious group of 6, but the wait staff was beyond friendly, patient, and accommodating. The main server was also training and I believe the resteraunt's service will be in good hands going forward.
