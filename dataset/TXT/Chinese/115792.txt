N2M0WyGCyTV5jMOYPH7odA So let me first say this was my first sushi since moving to Charlotte. Umai had some big shoes to fill as the sushi restaurant I went to in Orlando, I loved. Umai was almost as good definitely worth going back for a second time. I had the shrimp tempura roll and the XOXO roll. The tempura was just your typical tempura roll which is my go to roll and I loved it. The XOXO was just ok in my opinion. It had mango, cream cheese and basil. I wasn't a huge fan of the basil so I probably would try a different roll next time.
The reason for the 4 rating was my husband does not like sushi so it's hard to find a sushi restaurant with good "other" food and he loved his food! He got a miso soup, that I tried, and it was refreshingly delicious. Also ordered an appetizer of potato croquette which is like fried mashed potatoes with cheese and corn also really good!! For his main meal his ordered the chicken hibachi dinner with fried rice. He claims the best food he's had at a sushi restaurant, which is saying a lot for him!
For the service, our waiter was really friendly and we loved the atmosphere. We will be back!
