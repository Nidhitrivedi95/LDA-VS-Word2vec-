UDZMTxC_5wa_kdh0gbG-cQ If one likes the idea of choosing one's own ingredients for the Noodle Soup, then this is the place to go.  The Noodle Soup comes with soy milk.  And if one is willing to pay $1.00 extra, one can get a bowl of so called "Sharks Fin Soup".(regular price, $3.00 per bowl)  It even offers choice of noodles, see the photos.  So this is Hong Kong style "Cart Noodle Soup" all about.  The 4 star rating is solely based on food.
