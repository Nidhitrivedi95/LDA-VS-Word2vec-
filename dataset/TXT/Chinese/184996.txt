xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw I still haven't found a Mongolian bbq place as good as the one in my hometown, but Genghis comes pretty close. They have delicious food to choose from, great drink prices (especially during happy hour), and spot-on service. Not much bad to say about this place other than that I'm partial to "my" Mongolian bbq place.

A while ago, the restaurant next door closed down (like literally in the middle of a day) so they still had food out and everything. Something happened with the drains since they weren't able to fully clean up before shutting down and the whole place smelled like the worst possible odor you can imagine. Unfortunately for Genghis, the smell seeped into their restaurant which totally, totally sucked. I almost walked out when I walked in one day until the server explained all this to me from the start-to-finish and then apologized as if he created the stench himself. For that service, we endured the smell and stayed because we wanted to support the business. The plumbing has since been corrected and the place smells better than ever. It's also fun to bring my dog here and eat at the outside tables. Come here over Bar Louie.
