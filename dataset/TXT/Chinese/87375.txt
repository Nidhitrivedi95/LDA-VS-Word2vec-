HTAAMVDZ4P0VX5F9euJBoA I feel as though this place needs a little more love.  First of all, its nice to go to a Chinese restaurant that specializes in Szechuan food.  If you haven't had food from this region of China, it kind of like comfort food.  It tends to be spicy and, yes, a little oily some times.  Most of the spicy dishes are also complimented by the nice floral flavor of ash berry, also know as Szechuan peppercorn.  Some people have complained about oil but when I have not ordered the spicy and hot, the food has been less oily than most places.  Everything I have tried, I have enjoyed.
