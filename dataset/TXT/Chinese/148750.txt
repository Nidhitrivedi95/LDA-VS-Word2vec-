I ordered the General Tso's Chicken [they call it General Chicken, and you will be corrected if you order General Tso's!] as I frequently do, and it was a nice treat to have the broccoli warm but crisp, not drowned in the szechuan sauce as you typically find. In contrast with other reviewers, i did not find the service to be anything special (though the food did come out as quickly as it usually does at Chinese places). My boyfriend had the chicken with mixed vegetables and he was as happy with his meal as I was with mine. It's now his go-to place for Chinese cuisine.
