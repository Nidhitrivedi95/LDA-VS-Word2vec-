yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Went here last night with a couple of friends for the first time in a while because they were craving pho.  It was a fairly busy early Saturday morning.  We were sat pretty quickly which was nice, happy that they have such a quick turnover for tables.

The food is consistently good every time I come here.  Today the dish I usually order (pork chop w/ baked egg) was extra delicious!  They had a special salt & pepper eggplant that was pretty good as well.

The only reason I took away a star was because they forgot my drink order and when I asked for utensils they also forgot to bring some by.  They didn't check on us after all the food was dropped off and we had to go to the counter to get our check.

But all in all, still a great late night place to get your Asian food fix after a night out of clubbing or work!
