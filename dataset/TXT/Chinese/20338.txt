5Yb7uq3eYp2w57uFOYFHtQ Definately will pick this buffet place over Tin Tin for these reasons:

-price is worth what you pay for and will cost less then Tin Tin
-less variety, more quality food
-great sushi selection, you will find sushi rolls at this place that you will not find at other chinese buffets and you won't be disappointed! The sushi here are way more quality then other places. 
-I love their seafood stir fry dish with the shrimp and crab meat. 
-love their jello! 
-great service, they are always refilling your drink (sometime way sooner then you want them to)
