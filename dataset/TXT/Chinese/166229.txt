vbVJzKDhHlhMnKRpES5QzQ Fantastic Szechuan food.  We were in Vegas for two nights, and decided to eat our favorite dishes at two different Chinese restaurants.  Last night we ordered Spicy Boiled Fish and Kung Pao Chicken at J & J, then tonight ordered the same thing at Cheng Du.  J & J was okay, but this one was amazing!  We polished off all the KPC, ate some fish and took the rest home, and ordered a second KPC to enjoy tomorrow after we leave town! 
This place is in Chinatown, every table was full and constantly turning over, and there was a crowd waiting outside to get in.  
Tip: no alcohol is served, but you can bring your own if you prominently display the sales receipt so they don't get in trouble. 
We will definitely eat here again next time in Vegas!
