7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew Awesome, authentic, trust-worthy Chinese food. Did I mention this place is affordable? With an average price per person being $13, you really get more than you pay for. Bottom line, if you want great chinese food, come here.

**Update: With new management, if you arrive before 7pm, they offer 20% off your ticket. Also, Tuesday is "buy one get one" day...
