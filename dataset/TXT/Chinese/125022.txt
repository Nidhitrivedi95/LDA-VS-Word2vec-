oVYRkSsSYWyBMKP_AqUtkw I have no idea who would give this place 5 stars, but I took my mother here on the strength of the 2 seemingly impartial Yelp reviews. Now I am no stranger to Chinese carry-out, and I never expect much from these places, but this place was truly awful, and the prices definitely did not reflect the cheap quality of food that was served.  

Where to begin?

Sesame Chicken Combo - the eggroll was TERRIBLE.  It was extremely oily, and the insides were dry and tasteless. Didn't even make it past the first bite. The "pork fried rice" was equally horrible. Yellow steamed rice mixed with bits of pork. No frying of the rice at all, and the whole thing was utterly bland and tasteless.  I know, I know.  It's "combo fried rice" but places inside mall food courts have a better cost-cutting "combo fried rice."  The sesame chicken itself had clearly been sitting in sauce too long, as there wasn't any crispness left. Small balls of over-fried, yet soft and squishy, chicken.  Worse than most carry out holes-in-the-wall I've ever tried.

Alaska Roll - I'm always dubious of Chinese/Japanese places, but the Yelp reviews specifically highlighted this place's excellence for Japanese. I don't buy it. My roll was loose, the rice not sticky enough to hold it, and, to add insult to injury, the avocado was COMPLETELY UNRIPE!  What kind of Japanese establishment can't tell when an avocado is not ripe??  The same was true in the california roll.  Gross.

Shrimp toast - Utterly disgusting. I love fried food, obviously, and this was just terribly fried and had an off putting taste beyond the frying.  In my frying expertise, I would say they hadn't changed their oil in a while, which allows the food to become literally soaked with off-tasting, old oil.  

Dumplings - not bad. Not great. Standard fare.  A safe bet if you get stuck here and need to find something edible.
