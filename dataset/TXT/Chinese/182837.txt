XJo_kPFlbuORqL-mE2Ny6w The food is always ok.  like- since we are in the area, might as well go here, ok.  i like to make my own dish and our waitress was soooo sweet and let me have noodles with broth, but the veggies cooked on the grill.  It was great!  - had a soup with noodles and some veggies I threw in, and some grilled veg!

Good place to pop in if you are in the area- not really a destination.
