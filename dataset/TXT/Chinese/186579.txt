YBIhTjmEH3IEZW4Dr5ReRA I've been looking for the closest thing to NY/NJ style Chinese food in the valley and I think this is one (of the two) closest to it that I've had so far and thus the 5 star rating. It isn't chinese from NY/NJ but it's my favorite one tied with Maxim Restaurant (19th Ave & Osborne)... since I live in the west valley, I will be coming back to Wong's more often! 

Started with a welcoming greet from the server and I ordered crab puffs (half order),  cup of dumpling soup, and the emperor's chicken. The crab puff were large, seemed like each piece had a tablespoon of cream cheese filling with which you can taste the slight crunch of shell, scallion, and minced onion and carrot. My fave crab puff in the valley lol. The dumpling soup was also really good. Balanced flavor. Now, when the emperor's chicken arrived, it came with plentiful of rice and was delicious! My cup or water was always tended to and never reached empty. I recommend for others to try this place. I for sure will be coming back for their fast and friendly service, and delicious food!
