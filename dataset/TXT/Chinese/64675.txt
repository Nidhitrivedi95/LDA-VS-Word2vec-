E9aC5bLfXdQVZ5csvLuLJg I've been to Taiwan once already, and am heading back there again in a few months.  Mostly, I adore the night market fare.  The menu here had me soooo excited.  I was with my fiancee, and we ordered the fried squid, tan tan mien, scallion pancake, and a cup of milk tea.  The milk tea and squid were very close to what we had at the markets.  However, I was extremely disappointed in noodles.  I'm not Taiwanese, but of the many times that I have ordered this dish, it has been spicy.  This was not...it lacked much of any flavor.  The scallion pancakes served only as a belly filler.  I may return, b/c there are so many other dishes to try, but will not be repeating any of my last order.
