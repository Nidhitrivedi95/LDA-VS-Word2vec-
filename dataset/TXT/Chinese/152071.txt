t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA When I first walked in, there were a bevy of confused customers, walking in a circle, trying to figure out how on earth to place an order. Everything was written in Chinese, except, of course, for the giant sign on the wall, with moderately clear instructions (it's above the table on right, just as you walk in.) 

So, we took a menu, an ordering pad, and a pen, and sat down. You write the number of the order, not the name, on the pad. They didn't indicate whether you should write the type of rice you wanted, but we did so anyways. You then take the pad to the cashier (there was a decent line) and pay for your order.

Over the next 20 minutes, the wait staff bring your dishes to you. The first dish arrived easily 5 minutes before the rest, so I ate a lot of that... But it was sooooo darn delicious, and the helpings were generous. We spent about $70 for 5 heaping plates, a pot of tea, and two sides of rice. However, I did ask the busboy if he could bring me to-go boxes, and he never did. Granted, we're not supposed to tip, so there's that.

Overall, it's well worth the confusion and questionable service. I'm pretty sure their system is there to optimize price and quality. The only thing I dislike is the shoddy directions. I feel like a big "seat yourself sign" with menus and an ordering pad at the table would eliminate the constant stream of bumbling newcomers. Or simply placing the sign immediately in the view of the entrance, instead of high on the wall to the right. Otherwise, it was a delicious adventure!
