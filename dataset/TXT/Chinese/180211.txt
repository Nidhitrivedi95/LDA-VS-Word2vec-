X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I came here on my first night in Vegas on 5 de Mayo weekend. It was a Friday and Tiesto was playing. We got invited to a table on the very top floor with an amazing view for Tiesto. We partied and danced all night and I absolutely loved the VIP experience. I will definitely be coming back to check out more of their resident DJs. I had so much fun.
