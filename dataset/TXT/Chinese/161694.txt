uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw The hand pulled noodle with beef brisket soup was way too salty ( I wonder how some would say it's flavorful, hmm). We ordered the pork burger.We have to remind the server about it after waiting until we were almost done with our soup. Somehow I believed she had forgotten to order it. When the server decided it was time to serve the burger, we ended up not having it as it had been sitting on the counter. 
It was a waste of time coming here, there was definitely no Magic here.
