oQg9JbKz7T1Zmm6GW1plrQ B and I were on the way up the her parents for Christmas and needed to find some place for lunch.  Add to this, she wasn't feeling so hot.  The egg drop soup really fit the bill that day.  The other dishes (I think general's pork, but can't be sure) were good too.  The portions were huge and the prices were very reasonable.  Also the ladies that run it were very friendly.  Definitely a good stop on our trip.
