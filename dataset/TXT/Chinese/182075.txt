xftWto4IdilizsGdE07AQw As a Korean American, it's hard to find a Chinese restaurant that provides both American style Chinese food and Korean style Chinese food. This is exactly the reason why I love Chef Chiang. In addition to standard dishes such as Orange Chicken, this restaurant also serves jajangmyeon and jjampong, two Korean-Chinese fusion dishes. The lunch special is around $6.99 and is so much better than mainstream restaurants such as Panda Express because of the taste and quantity of food that you receive. The restaurant is family owned and operated, so I've always thought the services is super friendly. I have been going to this place for over three years now, and won't switch anytime soon!
