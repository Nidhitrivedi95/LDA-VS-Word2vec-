The Peking Duck is amazing!  Prepared tableside with care.  I've had Peking Duck at a high end place in Beijing, and Jasmine met my already high expectations.

What stood out for us was the Sommelier, Sarah.  She was attentive, friendly, and paired an amazing Pinot Noir from Martinelli that went perfectly with the duck.  We quizzed her a bit and she really knows her stuff.  Thanks Sarah!  I will be back!
