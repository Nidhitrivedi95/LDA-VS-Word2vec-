ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg I always enjoy the food here.

Pho: beef is surprisingly tender! Amazing. Broth is a bit bland. Needs to cook more? Not very good pho, other than the meat.

Pumpkin congee hot pot with crab and glass noodles. Pumpkin is crisp, perfectly cooked. But the broth looks starchy. Definitely needs salt, and theres lots of that on the table. The crab wasn't really detectable until I added salt. 

Chicken wings with honey garlic sauce. Wings sadly over cooked (by a deep fryer no less), they need seasoning, the meat is bland. At least the sauce was amazing, a perfect balance of sweet and garlic.
