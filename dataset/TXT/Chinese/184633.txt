xVHzCbDWCwmyavF5PgJRmg My fiancee has been going here for 9 years and loves their food. Not only is it perfect for students with their affordable lunches and prices, but they have a lot to choose from and it's delicious. 

My favourite is their Special Noddle in Soup and it is very filling. Their Special House Rice and Special House Pad Thai come with shrimp chicken and beef and are delicious and always piping hot.

We always order dim sum and their avocado bubble tea is great and cheap. This is an affordable, great eatery at Yonge and Wellesley and you cannot go wrong with tasty, cheap Chinese, Vietnamese or Korean meals (with big helpings too).
