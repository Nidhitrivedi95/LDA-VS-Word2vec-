vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw Do you ever wonder how many crappy places you have to try to find a good place if it Yelp doesn't exist? Dude, it's unfathomable!!! (is it a word or did i just made that up?) 

Anyway, I was so hungry one day last week and craving some pan fried noddle, and it was closed to midnight. I didn't think any Chinese restaurants were still open but I went on Yelp anyway. Voila, I found Food Express Chinese Restaurant and they opened until midnight. I called them on the phone and ordered Chinese broccoli and beef pan fried noddle and salt/peper pork chops to go. The guy taking order said they're closing soon and I need to be there within 10 min. I said "no problem". Good thing there were barely any cars on the road, so I got there with 2 min to spare. 

The pan fried noodle was sooooo good. Crunch noodle, soft beef and cai lan (Chinese broccoli). The salt/peper pork chop was crunchy on the outside and yet juicy inside. Will definitely come back to this place to try other items later. 

One tip: Reheating salt/peper pork chop through either microwave or toaster oven will yield the same result, which is stringy stale pork chop. :=)
