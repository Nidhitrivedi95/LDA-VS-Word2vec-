Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA Best Chinese takeout I've ever had. It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall place. We call it 'Richie Chinese' because one time for about 2 months, the half of the sign that says 'Chan's Restaurant' was burned out.  Nobody cared. 

There is nothing fancy about this place at all. But that's the best part. No bathroom, cash only, mish-mash handwritten menu tacked to the wall, half of it in Chinese - all of this adds to the aura. When you get your food, you'll understand. They just don't give a crap about the decor, your credit card, or the fact that the 'special of the day' was the special 4 years ago and every day since then because they are too busy kicking ass at making Chinese food.

All your favorites are here - Kung Pao is awesome! But also some less common items as well (salty hot pepper shrimp, salty fish fried rice, and a whole section of black bean sauce dishes.) We love this place and get their takeout every couple of weeks when we're feeling lazy. Huge portions, fresh ingredients and an orange with every order!

They do have some seating and I've seen real live Asian people eating in there almost every time we go - usually a good sign for me.The owners are a super cute husband-wife team and they do a fantastic job. My favorite part is when you order, the lady turns around and barks out the order in Chinese to her husband who never says a word or looks over, just keeps busting it out at the stove.

Great service, awesome food. Check it out!
