U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q There was no line and no wait here on a Saturday evening. After dining here, I know why. The wait staff was not too friendly. We were seated quickly but received our first trickle of ice water about 10 minutes later. Our cucumber salad with garlic had enough garlic to season a month's worth of salad. Yikes! Hand-stretched noodles seemed a good choice for the Shanghai Pork/Veggie Mein but it was soo salty with an almost burnt bean taste. We also ordered the vegetable spring rolls and they were fried on the outside but mealy and un-done on the inside. Ick.  If it were up to me, I'd tell you to skip it and find something better.
