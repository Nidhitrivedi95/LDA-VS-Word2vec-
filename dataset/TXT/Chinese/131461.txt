Pj9DDbTmjBEKXezLb0qmTw Bp Street is like a heaven-sent on Mondays because that's the only day of the week when they serve bak kut teh. The meat just falls off the bone and the soup is herbally which invigorates the senses and gets you excited to resume work. To get you through the week, Bp serves these special chicken wings smothered with some magic sauce on Wednesdays. A great pick-me-up that motivates you to work harder so you can make more money to order more of those chicken wings.
In the regular menu, I highly recommend their pork chop rice, nasi lemak (get it with chicken thigh, heed my words), sambal fried rice, char kway teow (best fried noodles you will ever taste), and whatever the tiny lady owner suggests. Will be dropping by like everyday now.
