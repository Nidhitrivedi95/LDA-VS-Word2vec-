taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg I haven't been to Qing Hua for a few years but I'm glad to see it's still as popular as ever. This was THE place where I first discovered my love for dumplings. We came on a Tuesday evening, around 8:00pm, and had to wait to get seats! I couldn't believe how busy they were.

The menu is dumplings, dumplings and more dumplings. Although there is a lunch menu available Monday to Friday (11:00am - 3:00pm).

The inside looks exactly the same. I like how you can peer through the kitchen window and see all the dumplings being made in house. They're lightning fast! We ordered and had our three dishes in no time. We may have gone overboard but hey, leftovers are never bad.

- Shrimps with pork and leek (#21) ($9.99) - we got one order boiled and the other steamed. Each order gets you 15 dumplings and the filling is nicely stuffed. Don't forget these dumplings have soup inside so be careful with your bites.

- Pork and dill (#31) ($8.99) - first time trying out dill in dumplings. Loved it! Not overpowering but the perfect balance. These were my favourite of the night. I need more dill in my life.

- Mix flavour dumpling soup (#3) ($7.99) - I also wanted to try their dumpling soup out which was totally unnecessary for two people (10 dumplings included) but it was way better than expected. They throw in an assortment of dumplings, I'm assuming extras/reject ones but I liked it. The broth was surprisingly light and flavourful.

40 dumplings later (well, with a few for home), we left very satisfied. Qing Hua is the OG when it comes to dumplings in town and I'm happy to report it's still as good as ever.
