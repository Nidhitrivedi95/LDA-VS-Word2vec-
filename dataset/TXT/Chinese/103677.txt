Km0sT7E_dc2U1BkyRoy1xA Well, let me first say that Baxter Village is such a cute spot for a date night or Saturday afternoon. This was my first time and it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the beef pad thai and it was one of the better ones we have had. The portions are quite large here so come hungry! I had the vegetable pho and I will be back to have more! It was more authentic than I was expecting for a non specific Vietnames place! It came with all the traditional pho fixings. I would highly recommend trying the pho.

Next time we go back, and I assure you, there will be a next time...I will be having sushi rolls as well (even though I know I will have leftovers). The sushi rolls are buy one get one free. How awesome! There were many other Asian dishes I have yet to try! 

The only reason I did not rate five stars was because the service was not top notch. They acted like they could care less that we were there or not.
