0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA I've been wanting to try this place for a while now because of all the Yelp reviews but when we went there for dinner last night I wasn't that impressed. Maybe because my expectations were too high. We started with the pork spare ribs which had a really yummy sauce on them. But the sauce was a little too thin and didn't really adhere to the meat and the ribs themselves were chopped up into bite sized pieces which made them somewhat difficult to eat. I ordered beef pho for my entrée and of course it was delicious (Is it possible to have bad pho?) but I found that the broth had less flavor to it than other places I've tried. Like some spices were missing or something. My hubby ordered the mixed grill with rice and he was pretty happy since it came with a lot of meat. We also split the flan for dessert and it wasn't anything special. The fun and funky décor was cool but I found the plastic chairs to be pretty uncomfortable.

I thought that the prices were pretty reasonable. We spent $35 for a fairly large amount of food. I am surprised by some of the other reviews that said Cyclo is too expensive. Who says authentic Asian food has to be dirt cheap? The owner has created a cute little trendy restaurant with a loyal following (we saw lots of regulars greeted warmly) and so she can charge a little more than your average strip mall dive.

In summary, I enjoyed my experience here but was not overly impressed with the food. I might come back if I was in the neighborhood but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
