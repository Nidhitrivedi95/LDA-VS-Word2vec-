Q_Iia5C2quTUVfE5_8jObw This restaurant is in a small plaza and apparently, I have driven by here several times. How do people find these places?!? It's a small restaurant, and NOT FANCY! Cutlery can be bordering dirty (our family saw three dirty tea cups). I haven't tried the bathroom, but one can probably imagine the state that it is in, especially after a busy night.

Service, at the start, was absolutely horrible. My parents and I arrived first (we had a family of 14), and we didn't know if my uncle had made reservations. My mom asked if there were reservations made under the name of Kua, and the man said no. No problem...we would need a table for 14 anyways, so we asked for one. The man again said no, and for my mom to call my uncle to make sure if there were reservations or not. So, if there were no reservations, than we wouldn't get the table? *rant*

Food was greasy and uninspiring, in my opinion. Service - mediocre. But, again, I guess this is okay for many people because?!?! By 6:30 the place was packed and the line extended outside the restaurant!

The only good thing I remembered about this place were there juicy oranges which they served for dessert. Everyone loved them so much we actually asked the waiters where they got their oranges!! No need to come for their food!

In the end, the food was not that great, but it was actually quite expensive! My dad footed the bill for 14 people and it came to around $300 and change! For cheap, greasy, seafood. Ugh.

Not impressed and not going back anytime soon!
