fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg My daughter and son-in-law were excited to go here but I was disappointed with both the food and the service. I ordered chicken breast fried rice and the chicken was very tough and difficult to chew. My daughter ordered udon noodles and vegetables and she said they were good. But my son-in-law didn't receive his order of fried rice for another 10 minutes after we received ours. He said his was tasty. I probably won't be back.
