8Fsg2BdHy1e0Pa_TfK58iw I'm surprised at all the bad reviews!  My family and I love this place - as do all of our Chinese friends.

You can't expect much from service - it's pretty much on par with all other Chinese places that are about high turnover.  Actually, their servers can be downright frosty-faced most of the time.  And if you come when it's busy, the wait can be atrocious (so make a reservation for weekend dinners!).

The food though, is always reliably delicious.  Authenticity is a given.  But their Chinese dishes ("siu chow") are just right!  Sweet and sour pork is delicious (and stays crispy til the end of the meal), their meat pies/patties are delicious and hand-chopped, which is the traditional "right way" of making it (try the one with squid!), their stir-fried veggies (gai lan) with preserved meats is delicious as is their ginger stir-fried gai lan, their fish and tofu pot (hung siu ban lam) is awesome...we almost never have anything here that we don't like.

Prices are reasonable, though not dirt cheap.  We come here often for "proper" Chinese food and especially for things we don't make at home.
