8lPxiYChdJdTV24NJvOB3Q I love their hand pulled noodles! The first time I tried then was in North York. Their restaurant was so tiny there that we sat at a small table on the side walk lol. Obviously when I heard they opened a location in Markham I had to eat there. I ordered the Braised Beef Brisket Flat Noodle small bowl for $7.99 and added a small order of chicken wings for $2.99. The noodles are super tasty and full of flavours. The beef was meaty and savoury, not too much tendon. They have 6 different types of noodle styles. If you come here you have to like beef as the title suggests lol.

I prefer this location much better! There's free parking and 3 times the amount of space for seating. I would definitely recommend everyone to come try this place. It's located next to Moji facing Kennedy. I know sometimes the plaza can get confusing since there's so many different restaurants here!

The only down fall is the chairs here are like small benches. they are a big too high for the table....
