5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g I came with my family to try Taiwanese noodles. It's nice to have somebody that speaks their language as well. I ordered the number five beef with noodles and it was very good the soup base was very delicious.  I also ordered the beef roll which I shouldn't have nothing was huge and really good but even with four of us we still left two pieces behind.
