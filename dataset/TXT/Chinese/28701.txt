8TpKY3zo6UzG3SVk6a-FRg Tasted like the takeout food from Chinese groceries like T&T or Foody Scarborough. If you are starving then this will do. If not then suggest you go elsewhere if you are in search of authentic Chinese cuisine that will wow your palate. I was here during my pre-Yelp days so don't have pictures for it. Prices are reasonable.

I mention Foody Scarborough specifically because the Foody Markham's cooked food for takeout is not better than Congee King.
