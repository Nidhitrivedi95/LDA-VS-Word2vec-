W8xPHUqL088jdcmNZyH-eA Noodle Pot in Las Vegas has just opened a 2nd location, Noodle Pot II in Henderson. The restaurant is bright and airy and service is friendly. Seeing that I was Asian they automatically greeted me in Mandarin. It is a language I learned as a child and haven't used for over 20 years but I understood. Our servers English was adequate but obviously not her first language. We were seated and given menus and the most popular items were pointed out to us. We chose to try the pork hock with noodle in soup, beef stew with noodle in soup and spicy ground pork over noodles. The noodles were perfect, nice and al dente. The flavours of the dishes were average. The beef and the pork were nice and tender but not much difference in the flavour between the stew and the pork. I found the ground pork in sauce over noodles a little bland and uninteresting. Of the three the beef stew had the best flavour. Each dish was under $10 so fairly cheap eats and portions fairly generous. It's not my go-to for this type of noodle dishes but it saves you a drive to the city and dealing with Las Vegas traffic. It gets three stars more for the combination of food and service, if it was just food I probably would give it 2.5 stars.
