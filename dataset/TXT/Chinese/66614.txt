EhlOUjd2dh52SV_XfoORSA We used to be big fans of Sesame Inn, eating in or ordering takeout a few times per month. But their quality keeps going downhill, and we find ourselves eating it less and less frequently. It's been awhile since we've had an amazing meal. Tonight, the straw that broke the camel's back was that two of my takeout items were inedible. The wonton soup was so salty that it immediately shrivelled my lips.. And when we removed our egg rolls and set them on plates, they left little puddles of oil. I hope they get their act together and rise back to their former glory. We miss the excellent food that we used to get.
