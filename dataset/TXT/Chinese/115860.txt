N2M0WyGCyTV5jMOYPH7odA I travel down to Charlotte pretty often for work and this place is my go to for sushi! I order from this place once or twice a week and it's always delicious. I usually get a nirigi or sashimi combo and a few items from their specialty nigiri - usually toro, uni, or soft shell crab. They do their portions right and give nice thick cuts of fish. Occasionally I'll get some of their rolls . All very good!
