ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg Expertly prepared Cantonese food, including congee, noodles of all sorts and Popular dishes including fried squids, bbq pork and duck. Busy at lunch and dinner time. Why not go for their "afternoon tea" (3-5pm weekdays) with a wide selection of regular dishes. It comes with a complementary drink. A glass of red bean with a scoop of ice cream is one of the selections. 
Highly recommended.
