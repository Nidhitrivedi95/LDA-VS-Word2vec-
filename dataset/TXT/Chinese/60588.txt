dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ My friends and i always come here on our trips to vegas. It's almost a tradition. You can get great food at decent prices.  We don't like to eat all our meals by the strip.  It gets way too pricey.  We usually order the chop chicken with basil and the crispy pork. It's very similar to stuff i can find in LA if i want a taste of home, but different enough that i still find it special.
