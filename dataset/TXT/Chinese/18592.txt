5E0PpI00mM-oaQBtxAy9BQ I saw Stephanie for skin rash (an allergic reaction from brand new wool sweater) on both of my forearms. Went to 2 different dermatologies and they just gave a steroid creams that didn't work ( used it for 2 weeks) before I decided to give acupuncture a try. After just one treatment the skin rash started going away and after the 2nd treatment the rash were all gone.
I also refer Stephanie to our Lymphedema patients from Lymphatic Therapy Services for different types of problems like salivary gland not producing saliva, chronic pain and more...and we always get positive feedback. Thanks you so much Stephanie for all you help.
