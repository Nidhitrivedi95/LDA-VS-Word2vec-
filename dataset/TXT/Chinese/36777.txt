AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw We went there for the first time this past week. This will be our only and last time there. The food was not even edible and I left it. My friend had a cup of tea and it smelled like cleaning fluid. The waitress agreed and, took it off our bill. I would never go there again, ever. Besides the horrendous food, the place was not clean at all.
