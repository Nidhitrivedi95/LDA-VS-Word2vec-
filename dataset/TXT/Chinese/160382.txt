U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Best pulled noodles ever! that was sooo delicious - texture, consistency and cooked just right.  The fried rick was also fantastic - surprisingly (I mean, I am after all Asian and I always go to chinese restaurants and have had a multitude of variety of fried rice).  We also had the pork belly with the clear noodles - the meat was tender and the sauce was simple and understated but complemented the dish very well.  The pancakes were also tasty.  Staff was friendly and accommodating. Would come back and eat here again.
