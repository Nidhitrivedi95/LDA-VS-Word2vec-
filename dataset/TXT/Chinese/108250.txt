liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA I don't really understand all the haters here- I thought the food was good, at a decent price!

We had the pork dumpling, hot and sour soup, and soy flavored noodle dish (can't remember what it was exactly called, but it came with bean sprouts and beef). Everything was really good! The dumplings came out steaming hot, the soup was well seasoned, and the noodles were just delicious! 

I would go back. But no fortune cookie? Sad.
