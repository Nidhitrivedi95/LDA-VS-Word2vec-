ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Fantastic venue!  I think Clever Koi is a great fusion of Asian cuisine. I attended the soft opening. It was busy as expected. There are a few kinks to work out as this is a new concept. But the food was great. I ordered the kimchi fried rice with seafood sausage. 

My drink was also wonderful with hints of ginger and a beautiful garnish. 

Our server was very kind. The restaurant has nowhere to go but up and the server believed this with great conviction.
