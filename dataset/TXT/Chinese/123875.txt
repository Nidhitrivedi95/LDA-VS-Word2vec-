OnGPegQGuQ5_uuFLvezvKw Went there tonight they are not interested in catering to dietary needs such as not using vegetable oil and using the organic olive oil that I have brought with me.  I don't think they are up with the times when some people are focused on their health as some other restaurants are.  So we ended up leaving and going to The Great Wall of China where they have and did cater to or dietary needs.  Another place that has also done so is Thai Taste in Matthews.  The reason the restaurants use vegetable oil is that it's the cheapest one to use even those it's bad for you heart wise.  I don't blame them but at least if a customer request and brings their own oil use it.
