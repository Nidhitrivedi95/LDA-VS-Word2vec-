AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Yummy! Now let me clarify... I am about are carnivorous as they come. It's not that I don't like vegetables. I just think they are more delicious along a big juicy slab if meat. My close friend, however, is vegan. So  we went one day after getting reflexology since we were in the area.  Delish! Now will I go so far to say that I actually thought I was eating meat? Absolutely not! However everything was prepared and seasoned properly that it satisfied that savory sensation. I will DEFINATELY go back when I am in the area again. Oh... And make sure you save room for dessert. Great Vegan ice cream too!
