I also love the rice pilaf (<U+624B><U+6293><U+996D>). I usually just order the vegie one without the lamb because it is really a good deal, 4.99CAD only. And their dried grapes taste so good. 

It's better you come early as the restaurant is quickly packed but they open after 3pm and close on Sundays.
