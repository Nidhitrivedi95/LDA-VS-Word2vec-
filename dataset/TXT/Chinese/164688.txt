UX1pAKQtRHX5fejaWbIy6Q Thought there's tons of vegetables in hot pot, so it's safe to bring a vegetarian friend. The staff there recommended non-spicy soup base to my friend. When we ask them why the soup is creamy white, they told us it's pork bone soup base . Apparently they have no idea what vegetarian is. 

I'm not a big fan of their soup base. 5 of us ordered 5 different soup base and they all taste the same. It's fairly standard, definitely not a place I'd crave to go back.
