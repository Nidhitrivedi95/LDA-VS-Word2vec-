I was alone and they would only seat me at community table, which looked like it was being used by some homeless people. It wasn't that busy so I offered to wait.  The server would only respond "You alone. You no get table" Then just looked past me like I was invisible.  I tried to speak with another server and everyone just looked away like I was crazy.  All I could say was "but....but....I wait".  So embarrassing and awkward.  A couple of my friends have also written this place off because of the bad service.  Now I see why.  They really are arrogant with their clients.  Ended up going to Phohung up the street.  Should have gone there first.
