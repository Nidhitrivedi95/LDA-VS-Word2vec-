I1pLg_ZjLMcie3g58I_GZA Inside Metro Square Plaza at the west corner facing Steeles. 

After a slight renovation it looks a bit more modern but the menu barely changed. They added some fancier and westernized items like garlic prawns and beef tenderloin, scallop and sirloin steak, etc. 

The food is not that amazing. Their combo soups taste like nothing and had no bits inside to chew on, pure liquid. The Hong Kong style milk tea is not as good as before. The combo prices typically range from$5 to $8. 

For a cheap filling this place is okay, but if you expect good tasty food, I wouldn't suggest this place. The service is average I asked for a dessert (French Toast w/ Ice Cream), the server dropped the plate but I had no forks. The table was empty I had to ask for forks. Not the brightest or attentive server.

They have Wi-Fi available. The password is hongkongtea.

Overall I rate this place 2 out of 5 because this place just didn't impress me. I wouldn't purposely come be k for their food.
