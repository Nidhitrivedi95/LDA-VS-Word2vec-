uSANDilamc1QSiCinFSKYw My boyfriend has been begging me to come here. I finally broke down to get it out of the way. I usually check reviews of places before going some where, so I had my expectations very much lowered. Some how, this place was still disappointing. There was very little selection and the food wasn't very good. The sushi was average.

I really don't advise going here, but if you do they have coupons on their site. They're far too overpriced without it. Even with it I still wouldn't pay the money, but oh well.

Oh, and it definitely doesn't compare to Journey. I don't particularly like Journey because the fish made me sick, but Journey has an pretty amazing selection. This place does not.
