b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag This restaurant is located right by the elevator to our room.  We stopped by here numerous times before heading up to our room for drinks only.  Here's what I remember....

In Vegas and needed a couple drinks to take back to the room to enjoy the hot tub.  12 oz Bud=$7.00
22 oz Sapparo=$9.00
Vodka soda=$11.00
"Strong"Vodka soda=$11.00

I didn't eat here but got drinks numerous times.  I strongly suggest using the word "strong" when ordering mixed drinks instead of using the word "double."  The breakfast buffet looked average, although we didn't try it.

Will I again?.. No because I won't be staying at New York New York again.  Tootles
