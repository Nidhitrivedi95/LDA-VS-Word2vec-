9RSgLa87uZTZKdTvxy2qyg Love Pei Wei, hate this location. Everytime I come to this location for an order to go, it never seems to be right. Tonight I ordered shrimp and tofu Pad Thai to go and specifically asked when I grabbed my bag that it was shrimp and tofu and the guy said yes. I get home and there were 2 shrimp in the entire dish and NO tofu. The 2 shrimp were literally soggy and tasted like bisquick because of whatever batter they put them in and didn't cook for long enough. Along with that, the noodles were dry and flavorless, it was like no sauce was put on them at all. Very disappointed, won't be coming back to this location.
