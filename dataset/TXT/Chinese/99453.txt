Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Not very friendly service, but adequate.  Pick your deem sum from the carts being rolled around the restaurant.  We went during the week and the selection wasn't as varied as we would have liked.  Authentic Cantonese dim sum in Vegas outside of their Chinatown.  

The parking lot was actually full despite the restaurant itself being only a third full during the week.  

A sign outside said dim sum all day.  I've heard of this trend.
