13ngZbrJVhnngzhc-MlXYg China Gourmet have mostly westernized chinese food mixed with some authenic.  I order here when I have some craving for some deep fried food.  They have the Special combination plates.  You can pick from 4 choices - All are $5.95.  All comes with Egg roll, Chicken Chop Suey and Fried Rice - the 4 main you can choose from are Chicken Teriyaki Sticks, Sweet and sour Chicken Balls (my fave), Deep Fried chicken Wings and Diced beed and veggie.  Other notable is the Sinapore noodle, Chicken fried rice, Orange chicken, general Tsao's chicken and Young chow fried rice.  This place is fast and on the menu states there is no MSG but I am not too sure about that.  Overall if you want cheap, fast and westernized chinese food this place is for you.
