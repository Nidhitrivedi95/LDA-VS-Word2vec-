rwKJHC-DE2aLTZiS_xFy7g Hand pulled noodles does make a difference. It's an alright place to grab a quick bowl of noodle to satisfy that noodle craving. Just be prepared for the sporadic "bang" from the sound of dough hitting the table...the violent process of noodle making. I like the lamb soup noodles because the broth is quite clear and not too salty. They have different noodle shapes to choose from so whether you like thick or thin noodles, you'll find noodles you like. I do have to mention the poor customer service especially from the manager (at least she seemed like the manager, you'll recognize her).
