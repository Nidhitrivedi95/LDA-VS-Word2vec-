EHKzu5r2NEz5Zq2R84J4ow This place is and always has been consistent.There is really not many decent places to eat in the eastern side of Pittsburgh (Monroeville, Penn Hills areas).
This is an exception: Fare menu pricing, good middle of the road Chinese food and ok Sushi.
I've never gotten sick eating here and my food is always hot.
The staff is always friendly and the service isn't bad either.
