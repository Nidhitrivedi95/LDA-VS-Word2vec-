3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug I've only been here for dim sum with my colleagues, but I've heard amazing things about their lobster dinners! 

We came as a group of 14 people and were seated in the private room. The restaurant has your typical dim sum dishes, which you choose from an extensive list. In addition to dim sum dishes, they have your larger plates such as fried rice, noodles, wonton skin. 

Quality is pretty good, but it's not mind-blowing. Service was quick, and they were quick to assist. Overall, if you're craving dim sum, and you're in the area then drop by, but I wouldn't go out of my way from downtown to eat here for dim sum.
