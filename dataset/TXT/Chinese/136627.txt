QHZw2L6LV1qmExNJbfhIsQ The customer service was horrible.   We made reservations and realized it doesn't help.   If you know the hostess/people there, you get seated right away.    They were rude and didn't think twice about their responses and tone when you ask about your seating.  We waited a long while and in the end our large party had to split tables and not even close tables to be "semi-together".  Their attitude was take it or leave it.. even though we made reservations.  The food was not bad but service is important to me.  Even if the food is fit for the emperor, if they treat their customers poorly, it's a big turn off.
