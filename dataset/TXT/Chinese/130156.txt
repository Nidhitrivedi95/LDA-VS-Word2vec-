pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA We came here on our second night in Vegas. It came highly recommended from several friends, and I was excited to try it! It's Japanese and Brazilian fusion, which sounded exotic and awesome.

We had a reservation, and I am quite thankful for that. It was PACKED by the time we got there. The hostess seated us immediately. The tables were all a little close to each other, and you did sort of feel like you were sitting with a bunch of strangers!

Our waitress was awesome and knew the menu inside and out. She had some great suggestions (which we ordered).

We had the wagyu beef sashimi (which they had to make twice because they messed up the first time). It was delicious. Next, we had the pork belly, which was just ok. I don't think I'd get it again. Then we had the yellowtail ceviche tacos, which were amazing. Finally, we ordered two rolls, the bobobrazil and the neo tokyo. I loved both of them.

For dessert, we ordered the mochi. It was OUT OF CONTROL. By far the best mochi I have ever tasted. 

I had prosecco and my boyfriend ordered a beer. It went well with our food.

I'm excited to try the location in Chicago!!!!
