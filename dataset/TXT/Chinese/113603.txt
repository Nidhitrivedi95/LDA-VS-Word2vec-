MpT8KheTjs7TSDWIoMUFxg I always order delivery from the same Chinese restaurant and yesterday I decided to try out someplace new. This place had good reviews on Yelp AND they deliver. 

I placed my order at around 8:30pm and my food was here before 9pm which was shocking because normally places take extra long. I was already very pleased.
The food was also great! I ordered the chow fun noodles, beef w/ spicy garlic sauce and honey walnut shrimp; which were ALL GOOD! The honey walnut shrimp was seriously the best I've ever had. It has a hint of lemon in there which made it super good and not too rich. The portions were perfect as well. 

Think I found my new go to Chinese delivery :)
