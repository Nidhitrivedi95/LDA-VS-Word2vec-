uLzgiSqVg5Pr93VVXSdOlg Restaurant is located on the ground floor of a building. Shares an entrance with an underground grocery store. Shoppers going to the store have to walk through the restaurant. Don't expect much service or ambiance at this place. it is a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown after all.

You have to have the beef hand pulled noodles at a place like this.

Smashed Cucumber app - 5, very unique taste, peanut butter with Sichuan peppercorn. 
Noodles - 5, as good as it gets
Broth - 3, not a lot of beefy taste, mainly salt

Overall - 4/5, maybe graded on a Montreal curve, this is a 5.
