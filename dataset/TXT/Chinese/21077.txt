68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw Staff was overly friendly, could tell they really take ownership in their place!  Walked is through the menu, all of their recommendations was spot on. 
I had the 1/2 roasted chicken (it's actually Cornish hen) with salad.  Everything was fresh, tasty, and in season!! 

I would definitely recommend and will absolutely be going back!  Only complaint would be that they close at 3:30pm and not open later
