xSplhd6mlpQzbjUAq3rP6w I'm glad we returned to eat at Max Asia!  They continue to be pleasant, helpful and friendly people.  We tried a couple of dishes we knew little about. First we had "King of the Dragon", wonderful tender and moist breaded fish fillets, I believe Swai, in an Asian wine and garlic sauce that I requested be spicy.  The sauce was so good, with a nice kick, that I put it on our 2nd dish as well.  Satay Kway Teow, shrimp, chicken, bean sprouts, onions, egg, flat rice noodles, in curry sauce.  I'm not crazy about the curry flavor in general so the other sauce helped a lot!  If you love curry, this is a fab dish!  All of the ingredients tasted fresh, well cooked and seasoned.  Even though I didn't care for the curry flavor (my mistake not looking at the menu description) I feel they deserve a 5 star rating.  We will return many times, it's that GOOD.
