But what makes it different (stand out) than the rest would be the offering of Peking Duck Wrap, Hand Cut Noodle and the amazing decor. These three items alone deserve +1 star, compared to the rest. Keep in mind, crab leg and oyster are offered on weekends only.

It's not everyday you get Duck meat at a Chinese buffet.

Great for large groups! Spacious tables and seating.
