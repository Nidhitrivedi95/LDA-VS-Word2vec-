8lPxiYChdJdTV24NJvOB3Q Atmosphere: Decent sized restaurant with many small tables (can easily fit small groups of 4 with). Very casual vibe and "cash only or Debit" only type of restaurant. It is a very family style restaurant with minimum decoration. I went on a Friday evening with a group of 3 of us and was able to get a seat right away. No one was waiting in line or taking too long to get seated. Plenty of tables were available. Tables were also nicely spaced out and didn't feel at all tight to the next. 

Service: Can communicate with servers in Mandarin, English, Cantonese. Service is pretty quick since there is less to order in these type of style restaurants. 

Food: 
I ordered a small braised beef thin noodle soup. I really enjoyed the soup. I didn't feel thirsty after but I also couldn't finish my whole bowl of noodles. 
To me, the size was very good. 
I got adequate amounts of meat but I think I was still served more noodles than I would be able to eat. 
The noodles were not as chewy as I would have liked (like in ramen). I tried my friend's flat noodle and it was OK and maybe had more chewiness to it. I shall try the flatter noodles next time.

My other friend ordered the pickled veggies soup noodle. It had good flavour of the soup broth. The meat was a little too lean for my liking. I usually like more fatty and tender meat. 

Overall: I would go back to have soup noodle if craving. Especially since the price per bowl is not bad and the place is not overcrowded.
