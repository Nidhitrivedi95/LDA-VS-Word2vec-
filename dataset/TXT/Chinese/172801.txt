W8xPHUqL088jdcmNZyH-eA I had bookmarked Noodle Pot II to stop by in the future and slurp some noodles. That opportunity came not too long after. My friend and I stopped in one evening to try it out. It's not noticeable from the main road, but it's right behind Flame Kabob, where Quiznos (I miss that place) used to be. If you come in off Siena Heights you will be able to see it. 

I'm vegetarian and was so happy they offer noodles in a vegetable broth. The bowl comes full broccoli, bok choy and other delicious vegetables. I must say the broth is not as hearty as a meat broth, but if you add some chili sauce it tastes delicious! You can order extra noodles, but one bowl is plenty. I was full. My friend also got the vegetarian bowl and was happy with her decision. She needed to add some chili sauce to hers as well. 

The lady taking care of orders and serving was so kind! She took care of everyone in the place and made sure you were doing well as she scurried table to table. 

The price wasn't expensive either. Definitely a go to spot in the future!
