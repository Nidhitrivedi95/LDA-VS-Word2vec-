wOmtCPiB-xeU-HknjTW4hQ I too was sad to see Diamond China go and held off on visiting the new owners. However we ordered a large take out order $160 worth the day before Thanksgiving. When my brothers and I arrived early they had some free appetizers waiting for us and were very gracious to us. They sent us home with a boatload of food and I can say there were no complaints from anyone. The spicy garlic shrimp was a favorite as well as the broccoli beef which for a change from most places didn't have over cooked limp broccoli. We will definitely be back. And thanks for helping our family continue our pre Thanksgiving Chinese food night tradition.
