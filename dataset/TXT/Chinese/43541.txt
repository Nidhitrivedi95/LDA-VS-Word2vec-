bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug My gf and I go here often as the food here was once the best Chinese haka in Scarborough or even Toronto!

We went here a few times in the past few months and we have noticed a significant change. The food portions are much smaller. We ordered our usual of Chilli chicken and chicken pakora with shrimp. They both come with steam rice so we were surprised to be told by the waitress that "their medium bowl" (which looked fairly small and of course didn't go around two small females) was 2 orders of the steam rice. We got the Chilli chicken and it looked as if it were a lunch order with no sauce! This was at 6pm btw. The shrimp pakora tasted like the shrimp was a week old. Spoiled and tasted like it came from the garbage can. We ate 1 shrimp and left the rest. 

I'm giving it 3 stars only because Federics has been good to us in the past.
