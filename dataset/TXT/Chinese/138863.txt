qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w Pretty good for local take out & delivery. Unfortunately the deliver often takes an hour or longer. Our last order had a large container of soup that was broken and it filled the bag it was delivered in and saturated the rest of our food. When we called to explain what happened rather than credit our next order for the same amount ... The manager said he could only offer 20% off our next order. We will not be ordering from here again.
