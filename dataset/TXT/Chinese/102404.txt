KhYA1VGwy1naIiIAvPfolw I've driven by Chow Mein Express a million times. It's located in the same strip mall as Naked Fish's Sushi (one of my favorite spots) and Dairy Queen (where I've been too many times for my own good). I finally gave in and tried the place for lunch. It's cheap but totally underwhelming.

I love Chinese-American food and cashew chicken is one of my go-to meals. Their version was a large portion of fatty, mostly dark meat chicken and plenty of veggies. It looked like they tossed in the cashews after it was all cooked. Bland in flavor and completely uninspiring, it was the kind of meal that I regretted eating after I was done.

I also got an order of egg rolls which had a weird taste. The veggies were overcooked and mushy. Who knows how long they were sitting around waiting to be fired up. blah....
