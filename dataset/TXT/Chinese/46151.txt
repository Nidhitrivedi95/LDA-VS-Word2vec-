BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I love Mother's Dumplings, the food is so savory and delicious. I've gone there at least ten times now, and every one I bring likes it too. They have those menu cards that you check your selections off yourself, and sometimes the waiters bring things in random order so its a good place to share and collaborate on selections, that way you can eat things as they show up. The waiters are pleasant and efficient, but this is not a place to go if you want to ask endless questions and have elaborate service. Don't be surprised if there is sometimes a bit of a line to be seated they are almost always busy and for good reason...the dumplings are magical! You can openly see them being prepared..from scratch! The bathrooms are very clean and well kept, they have only two though..men's and ladies. I am especially loyal to Mother's Dumplings now because the last time I was there I left my Christian Dior glasses behind and when I called the next day they had them waiting safely behind the counter for me. I've had almost every flavor and type of dumpling the vegetarian chive ones are my very favorite and the onion pancakes are tasty, they are pan fried so I'd treat them like a very hearty appetizer, again, you might want to share. Don't know much about the other dishes, I had a soup one time but had to share it it was so big, I think it was hot and sour soup, it was delicious, but my friend had their basic broth soup it was kind of bland with seaweed floating around...not something she'd order again. Otherwise they've got my thumbs up all the way!
