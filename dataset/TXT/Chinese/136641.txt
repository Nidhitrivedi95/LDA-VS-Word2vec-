QHZw2L6LV1qmExNJbfhIsQ I'm a huge fan of the dim sum here. Even though we come here a lot, there is one complaint that I have with this place. 

Reservations here mean nothing. You can be booked for 1:00, but when you arrive, you can still be waiting for 30 min to 1 hour depending on the speed at which people eat. IT REALLY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF A RESERVATION. This is exactly what happened to us the last time. 

Overall, I can say that the food is worth the wait. The food is fresh and tasty. Portions are standard, so you may want to order more for larger parties. 

Atmosphere wise, it isn't too loud, but it isn't quiet either. I know that this review is kinda short, but there really is nothing to say except that the food is good, but the service with reservations suck.
