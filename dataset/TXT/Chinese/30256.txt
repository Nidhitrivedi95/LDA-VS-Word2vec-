98NaJ8FWzPuoymHfj6IIeA Love the HK cafe vibe here, so homey. It can get pretty busy and slow here during meal time, so coming here for the afternoon special is not a bad idea. I love there HK style breakfast like macaroni with egg and ham and French toast. My favourite is their baked rice and spaghetti, the noodle soups are great too. Portion is always more than enough. Great place if you are not in a hurry, come here to enjoy a cup of milk tea reading news paper or catch up with friends while your order is prepared. No stunning food but definitely satisfying.

There hot sauce is just as good as the ones from congee queen, more crunchy and less spicy tho. Highly  recommended to have some with your baked rice or fried rice, perfecto~
