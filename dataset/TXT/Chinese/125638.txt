Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w I am convinced that most people that take the time to write reviews of restaurants online have absolutely no idea what good food is.  They mistake quantity for quality.  They pour A1 on a $75 ribeye.  Thus chains like Applebee's, Golden Corral, and KFC remain in business.  

Anyone that rates a Chinese buffet for more than 3 stars needs to stop writing online reviews.  Seriously.  Stop.  

As buffets go, Tin Tin is average.  Yes, they have sushi and crab legs.  Oysters were not fresh, but I wouldn't say they had gone bad yet.  Sushi was akin to what you might find at Costco or Publix.  Others dishes were bland and there's something weird about their food warming stations.  You shouldn't have the steam fogging up the glass or turning the room into a sauna.  

Do yourself a favor and go get some real sushi or Chinese food if that's what you're looking for.  Try Lee Cafe in Fort Mill.
