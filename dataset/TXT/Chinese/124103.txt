It's got a varied enough selection and is yummy for the price.  It's clean, well stocked, child friendly and spacious.  I've never had to wait for a table at peak lunch or dinner time hours.

Hubby likes it quite a bit.

Everyone is friendly and the food is almost always fresh, even during off peak eating times.

Getting drinks are a breeze thanks to an attentive wait staff.

If you're looking for fast, quick, easy eats in a Chinese food category, this one's for you!
