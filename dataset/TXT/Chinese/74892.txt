fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg Came here for lunch with my daughter after her doctor's appointment. We ordered shrimp dumplings, Xiao Lun Bao (soup dumplings), Chinese beef meatballs, pan fried dumplings, and Taiwanese chicken fried rice. Shrimp dumplings and Chinese beef balls looked and tasted old. The skin on shrimp dumplings were kind of hard from sitting in the push cart too long, the beef ball just tasted old. I didn't care for the xlb but my daughter said it was okay. The fried rice was pretty tasteless and we both had to add salt to it. The pan fried dumplings I thought was pretty good with homemade dumpling skin and pork inside. It would have been perfect if they were pan fried a little longer to get a better crust. 
The hostess was friendly and service was good. A bit over priced, could have had same and better in Chinatown for half the cost probably. A nice place for lunch but wish the food could be better to make the experience worthwhile.
