ooFlFjIuGW8Lx0bxmvEZJg I've got to say first, if you're looking for a good varirty priced buffett .... this is not it. For the amount you pay, I would expect more foods that can be made into the type of meal you want, instead it's a hodgepodge of unrelated cuisines next to one another that may share 1 ingredient together. I've been here a few times, and never by choice. 

One particular time has haunted me ever since. Waitress was obviously not skilled in her position and poured Pepsi on to our plates... with the food on it. No apology, no 'let me get you another plate', nothing. The wait staff since has only gone past the expectation of not spilling soda on our food. The management staff didn't seem to care and weren't willing to fix the situation either. 

The food is usually pretty luke warm. as I stated above, the foods do not compliment one another well. The meat section feels like you're eating meat back from your high school cafeteria. The sushi is poorly constructed and typically stale. The dessert bar is extensive however like everything else is left out too long and chews like hard candy. 

I go back not by choice but because it's one of the few places others in my family enjoy; thankfully they are beginning to see why I don't like it and see the other options available in Gastonia.
