The hot sauce sweet, sour and hot minced meat noodles was not cooked traditional way, they are cooked using some kind of Japanese style sauce, maybe not suitable for every one. 

The place was pretty compact, services were good, however the food qualities have room to improve.  If they can do it more traditional way, they might be able to retent more customers and maybe  return customers.
