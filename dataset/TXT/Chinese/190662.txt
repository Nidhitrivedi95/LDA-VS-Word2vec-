YNjW13ls0enqM2Lep2cCsQ So sad that Chef Lin is gone. When my husband and I arrived here hoping get some really good general tao chicken, we noticed the restaurant had changed. We decided to check it out anyway. This place serves a million different dishes, but I figured I might as well try the general tao chicken since I was craving it and some hot and sour soup. My husband ordered the Portuguese style chicken. 

You get free soup with some of the meals so we got the wintermelon one which was delicious! Since the free soup was so good, I was hoping everything else would be just as impressive. The hot and sour soup was decent. I can't really describe it but all the dishes we tried were kind of bland or wasn't as flavourful as I would like. The Portuguese chicken was just terrible. The sauce was a watered down bland buttery sauce of some sort. It didn't really taste like anything and my husband usually eats whatever he orders and he barely touched it. The general tao chicken was just average as well. It was sweet and pretty sour, but didn't have that kick that I usually like. The prices were cheap so I would come back and try other dishes.
