ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ This place has everything:
- all-you-can-eat oysters OR crab legs (depending on the night)
- sashimi, sushi, squid sushi!! And they're thick-cut sashimi
- tom yum soup, sweet papaya soup
- fried mackerel fish, fried cod
- french fries, fried chicken wings
- dim sum (shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings)
- fried rice, fried noodles
- mainly Chinese dishes (stir fry vegetables, stir fry chicken/beef/seafood)

This restaurant is gigantic, but the food area is pretty small. I don't like crowds, and I really hate Markham crowds. I also hate Markham parking lots... so you get of all the above here. No I didn't calculate this into my 4/5 rating. I'm just giving you a warning!!

The food is great, but nothing to run home about. Service was alright. I'd recommend reservations! (which I got!!)

My table was very close to the buffet, but there are tables that are INSANELY FAR. WOW. What a walk.

All-you-can-eat oysters = really bad, not-at-all fresh oysters

My glass of hot water is SO tiny. They're not coming fast enough to fill my water even though the restaurant wasn't busy that night.

Total was $32 for dinner
+ $5 "special" drink (I had the warm black sesame milk tea, that was delicious! Their drinks remind me of Green Grotto's. The size of these drinks is a Large)
/ per person
+ tax and tip
= $95 for two people!! 

I chose this restaurant because I couldn't decide what to eat, and at the time I was craving everything (sushi, dim sum, I also want soup and ice-cream). Thanks to Dragon Legend, I had everything I wanted!! But then I also know specific restaurants that make fantastic dim sum, another that does authentic soups and Chinese dishes, another that has amazing sushi... so Dragon Legend's food obviously doesn't compare to the specialty restaurants, but it was "good enough" for the night (when I wanted everything without visiting 3+ places).

The price however is suuuuper steep.
