DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ Ohana has a lot of great stuff, its close to my house so i come here whenever i dont want to cook. I love their tonkatsu ramen, i always order it with spinach noodles to make it a little bit healthier :) i love the spam musubi!! Ive also tried their curry, but it wasnt really that great. Order thai iced tea with bobba, super yummy!
