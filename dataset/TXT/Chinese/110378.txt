LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA My family and I are somewhat "newbies" at Flo's and we love the happy hour. The food is great and service is fantastic. Last Friday we had Katie, she is very knowledgeable and attentive. She seemed as if she has worked there forever! We asked her how long she has worked there, and told us 10 years. She is very genuine which is hard to find in people these days. We told her to not stop smiling because her smile is contagious. Katie's recommendations were spot on! I can see Flo's being a weekly dinner night for our family! Btw Hot and Spicy soup is to die for!
