5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Blossom is a high end restaurant located in City Center at the Aria. The restaurant looks beautiful and it really sets the mood for an intimate dinner. Waiters and guest are most definitely at the top of their etiquette. Table setting was decent to me and their menu look beautiful. However, when opening their menus, I was blown away that their menu wasn't entirely expensive. Yes, they do have dishes that cost between $50-$200, but they also have a wide variety of dishes between $10-$40. I went to this restaurant with a few other people and we decided to eat family style. We ordered a bunch of rice dishes like Walnut Prawns, Clams, Bok Choy, Choy Sum, Seabass, Duck, Beef Tendon, Duck Tongue, and Fried Rice. I had to say though, the presentation of the dishes was not all that great. They seemed to just placed the food on the plates and bring them out to the table. Plus, they did not clean the plates before serving.....what kind of high end restaurant doesn't clean their plates?!? The portions were small, but it was expected. Now the food, it didn't have the flavors that stuck out to me, in fact, a lot of dishes tasted bland to me. The only dish I actually enjoyed was the duck, I was actually surprised that this dish wish tasty and the texture was just right. Overall, if I am going to pay hundreds of dollars to eat an expensive restaurant, I'm going to need more than a fancy setting, I want my food to actually look and taste good. Don't think I'll ever come back. (But it's not like casinos care if you come back cause they continuously have customers year-round....just saying)
