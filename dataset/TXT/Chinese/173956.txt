wbJQWVyJKTUh9ryZ4jUgwg Very good take out. New to NC and I will be happy to have this place as our go to take out spot. Only given 4 stars because I wasn't a fan of the eggroll or lomein but both were good when doctored up with some of the sauces in the other dishes. Also the restaurant's ambiance could be improved.
