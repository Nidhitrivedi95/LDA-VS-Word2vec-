HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw Despite the slower than usual service this place reminds me of really good Chinese food in SF. I would come here more often but it's usually a trek. 

Soups are super large. The egg drop and hot and sour are both really good. I think my favorite dish is the chow fun with the fish and white sauce. It's amazing... I have to tell myself not to eat the whole dish since they give you gigantic proportions. 

They also have pretty good bobba.
