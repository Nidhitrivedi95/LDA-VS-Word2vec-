rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g Enjoyed the Dim Sum. Its not knock your socks off but where is in Phoenix? The service is spotty. You'll get five carts in five.minutes.and then not see one for thirty minutes. Some poor guy in the restroom had a bad accident and that was rough. Not their fault but it didn't appear to be the cleanest restroom already.
