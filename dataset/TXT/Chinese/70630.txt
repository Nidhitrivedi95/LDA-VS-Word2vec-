f9ERQpAPOAMv5Ay0kyD3Yw I have been here twice in the recent past.  After living in this area for 11 years, I can hardly believe that I had not heard of Shanghai Grill earlier.  Now, I know it is going to be my very favorite Asian Restaurant.  Had the Honey Walnut Shrimp both times but will definitely venture out and try other items in the future.
My friends, who own a home in Westbrook Village, arrived from Seattle last evening for a three week visit and they, too, were super impressed!
Talked on the phone this afternoon with Tony, the owner, to question him about the use of MSG, which he said is not even on the premise!  He did say, however, that powdered chicken broth is used in some dishes and if another friend who I want to bring there but is highly allergic to MSG comes in with me, he will suggest dishes that do not use that either.  VERY ACCOMODATING for sure!  Love, love, love this place.
