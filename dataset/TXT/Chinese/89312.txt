I6oxEn1HT41S2GPrDKPPvA service sucks. period. we have a group of 13 - they expected us to all sit in one table - when we requested two tables - the waitress push back saying no and we all can squeeze together...not satisfied with this of course we requested again unitl we had to ask for management approval.. even though there are several empty tables next to us. we had to ask for utensils and water several times...food was average
