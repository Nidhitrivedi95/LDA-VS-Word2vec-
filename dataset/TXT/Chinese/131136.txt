PhNdyQTtZjOQ1bqoT4S3oA Love their food! Tom the owner and Cory the manager are wonderful. In a world of customer service going down the toilet, their customer service is top notch, but Toms wife is not a nice person and knows nothing about customer service. Will need to look for a new Chinese restaurant to give our money to.
