LKuzbx5Yt3yqiokUFdjVhg This place is close to the house and doesn't look very good on the outside, but the inside is nice, and the food is awesome. I feel like I need to clarify why this place is called China Wing but everyone talks about the Korean food here. In Korea, Chinese restaurants are very popular and abundant but they put a Korean twist on the food they make causing it to turn into almost a fusion type cuisine such as jajangmyun which Koreans would consider chinese food but is very distinctly Korean in nature. I guess the proprietors here kept with their Korean roots and opened up a fairly Korean Chinese place. The more you know!

Anyways on to the actual review, the owners here seem very friendly. The guy on the register remembered me on the second time I came here to eat, which is impressive considering there was a pretty lengthy amount of time in between visits. I almost always order the bibimbap which is delicious and freshly made. It also comes with a nice side of kimchi, pickled daikon, and small bowl of soup. prices are reasonable, and at the end of our meal they usually throw in some stuff for free. The first time I ate here they gave us some orange slices at the end of our meal, and the second time some hot tea!

This is a nice place for some decent Korean food, they also have an American, and Chinese menu as well. They've recently added delivery service so that's awesome for the lazy times you don't want to go anywhere! Seeing as there aren't many Korean restaurants in Charlotte, this was a nice find and I'll be back whenever I have cravings for Korean food.
