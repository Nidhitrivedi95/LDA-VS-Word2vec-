I7eqTdTmRTWYwF9HNZAHxw If you're looking for authentic Thai, Chinese, etc., this is NOT the place for it, hence the word "fusion" in the name of the restaurant. That being said, what cuisines they do fuse together come out impeccably tasty. I've had better experience at this location than at the location on Thomas. Friendly staff most of the time. Clean and relaxing atmosphere.
