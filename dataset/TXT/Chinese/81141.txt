GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg I'm not gonna step in to this place anymore. This place has serious management issues. Food is Ok when sushis are fresh but most of the times sushis are not fresh and specially items on the rollers seems to be there for days. One night I and my girlfriend went to this place and there were bunch of drunk mexican guys drinking and laughing at the bar. They were so loud an disrespectful. There were pointing other guests and making fun of them. To be honest I was a little afraid and just wanted to walk away since those guys were behaving like crazy. But the most annoying part was the owner lady was flirting with these guys and seemed just care to recieve more tip. She was just bevaving like she is part of that drunk gang. So disrespecful and unprofessional. I couldn't believe my eyes there. 
And finally last night I went there to order togo since all other plcaes were closed. I ordered beef curry with rice but when I opened the box when I got home I saw some Thai noodles. They really take advantage of their customers. Not walk in to this place even if It's the last place in the world
