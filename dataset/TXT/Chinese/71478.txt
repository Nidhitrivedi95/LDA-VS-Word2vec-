fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A My guidelines to enjoying good dim is to only go on the weekends and during prime time. There is almost always a wait, but at least the food is hot and fresh. 

This is my go-to spot when I get a craving. Food is pretty consistent and the service is better than what I've received at other dim sum places. Their tripe is really good, and custard filled pineapple buns are a must!
