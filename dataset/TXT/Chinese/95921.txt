jKduhy-gJ9hyFzd1au6pOg This particular Panda Express has steadily gotten worse each and every time I go there. After today, I won't be returning there and may not any other Panda locations. This place is a complete joke in management and customer service. The food is bad too. Arrived Sunday afternoon at 12 PM to a customer line all the way to the door. Only one employee is taking orders, serving plates, and working the cash register. The other employee was working the drive-thru. It took 25 minutes to take our order. I asked to speak to the store manager (Roger). He wasn't there because he had to go get money - the store had no cash! My wife and I should have walked out earlier along with others. This is the worst Panda in Las Vegas, which I told them upon leaving (verbal sparring with the employee). I wanted a nice lunch with my wife. Instead I got bullshit service, shit for food, and highly pissed off.
