YfeTH4jtz_gpWz0QRYJFnQ I have been to both the yonge and sheppard location and this one at first markham place. The yonge street one is way better. I came to the fmp location yesterday with my friends. I ordered the matcha cheesebread with black sesame icecream - big let down! The matcha cheesebread was not soft and creamy at all. It tasted like stale bread with cream. My friend ordered steamed ginger milk and she did not like it either. This may be a newly opened restaurant issue, so I will give them another try in a few months. Hopefully their quality then will be the same as their midtown location!
