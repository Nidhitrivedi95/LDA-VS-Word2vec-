wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA If you know how to do Mongolian BBQ, you won't have issues with the "bland tasting" as some of the other reviews have stated. Remember, you're making your own plate, they just simply cook it for you.

With that said, this place was an absolute treat for the senses! The ingredients are plentiful, and they were constantly freshening them while I was there. The service was amazing. Such an awesome staff, and the owner takes the time, and actually has a conversation with the guests to make sure they are having a great experience.

All in all - wonderful experience, GREAT food, and GREAT staff! Definitely want to go again, and again, and again!
