xCgHUDW-rMrqDLN7GMQpyQ I've been to A LOT of dumpling restaurants in Toronto, and when I Was getting my poutine we drove by and my mom saw dumplings!  So we stopped..... 

Can I tell you, this place is AMAZING!  Everything is made fresh, so have some patience ok this isn't your manchu-wok, szechuan szechuan buffet to go.  You can see the ladies in the back preparing your dumplings and it was WORTH the wait. 

Probably the best dumplings I've had outside of Asia... I wanted to get more but I stayed too far away.  Fantastic food!
