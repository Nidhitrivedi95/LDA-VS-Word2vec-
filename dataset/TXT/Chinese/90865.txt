IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Went here with a group of 11 this weekend after a wedding, reception and a little bit of after partying.

Everyone got something different and there was a lot of sharing and tasting around the table.

Every single one of us was happy with our food, another reviewer said that they would rather go to Panda Express and that just blows my mind.  The food at Noodle Shop was really well prepared and perfectly seasoned when we were there!

Some of the standouts from the evening include the Pad Thai (both shrimp and chicken) the Pho (expensive for Pho but tasty!), the eggplant, the black bean chicken and a tofu dish.  The lettuce wraps were tasty but the ones at P.F Changs are better (and I hate PF Changs).

The place is a little pricey but it's a restaurant in a casino in Las Vegas.  I don't think they were priced more than any similar places we saw and the food was MUCH better than most casino/hotel cafes I've been to.

I will definitely hit up the Noodle Shop again when I am in Vegas next.
