9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw I get it now! HOT POT hits the spot! 

This is not a place that I would have gone if it were just my husband and I. Thank goodness we went with two other couples experiencing this for the first time. So we were hesitant but open minded at the same time.

Let me just make this clear, this isn't shabu shabu. I totally suck at shabu shabu, but that's another story. In short, shabu shabu is Japanese SOUP that you cook; you add the flavor for your broth, your meats and vegetables. Hot Pot is Chinese (not sure which part of China) and is a STEW that you add your ingredients to including,thin cut meats, vegetables and seafood.

At Red Pot, the very large bowl is split in two. You pick a regular and spicy stew broth. My husband and I went with mixed mushroom and yellow curry.

While waiting for the stew to come out, we went to get our stew contents.

Because we sat at a table that fits six, our table had three burners, one for each couple.  When the broth came, the burners were turned on for us.

This is an all you can eat Hot Pot. Because the pots are large and there's some much broth, you can go back and try all the different produce they have. The meats are cut thin, so it takes less than a minute for it to cook, which the waitress showed us how to cook our meat. Our waitress recommended the lamb.

They even have different types of noodles in case you want to make a noodle soup. I would suggest going with the thin noodles because the thicker noodles takes too long to cook.

There is no dessert but they do offer fruit. After eating so much and with the different flavors, it is refreshing to follow up the meal with fruit.

As for drinks, I got my favorite, a tall glass of lychee iced green tea.

I know people that just love shabu shabu. Hot pot is more my style. However, if you've never done this, I recommend doing both.

Before I forget, be sure you check-in on Yelp for your 20% discount.
