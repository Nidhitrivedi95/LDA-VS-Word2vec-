c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ Let me set the scene:

It's about 5am on a Friday morning. My bf and I are at Flamingo, ya know..drankin' and gamblin' a bit...Then it hits me: I'm hungry.

Hmm, well he HAD been stuck on trying some "steak and eggs" in Vegas. (Why? Your guess is as good as mine. lol). More specifically, steak and eggs from Bill's (which just happened to be RIGHT next door to the Flamingo). All the ads we had seen said that they had some breakfast specials from 12-8am. Perfect. 

So we head over to Bill's and as we get closer to the Victorian Room (It's in the far, back, right corner of the casino) I notice a line. WHAT?!!? Then the thought crossed my mind: Could this place be...GOOD?

No. It wasn't. 

First of all we put our name on the wait list, and the hostess told us that they would call us within 10-15 minutes on the overhead speakers. So we agreed to gamble for a bit until they called us. 20 minutes later...nothing. 

We go to check, and there was no more wait or line. WTF? Our name was never called or anything. So we get seated and I ask for the 3 egg special that they advertised on the side of the building. I ask for egg whites and the waitress, shook her head and said "No, sweetie. The eggs have to be regular for the special". Seriously? If you can't do egg whites, fine...but you really don't have to be condescending. Get outta mah face. From that moment on, I knew it was NOT gonna be good. 

In short:
-The table next to us was REALLLLLLLLY loud. Screaming/laughing..the works. It was just really annoying.  Not my type of crowd. 
-The AC was on FULL BLAST. I was shivering! I get that it's Vegas and it gets hot outside...but at 5am? =(
-My eggs were awful. They were watery and seemed like powdered eggs. Very gross. I had to DROWN them in ketchup just to stomach them. =/
-My bf's steak was rubbery and really tough. It took him a good 3 minutes to even cut the first piece. Just plain nasty. 

Overall, the best part of this meal was the toast. -_-
