However, we were a bit startled to be served on styrofoam with plastic utensils for eating and a serving spoon only in the soup. We had the B Family meal which could have easily have served 3 or a family of 4 if some in your party are okay with dividing up pieces of the appetizers. The Kung pao combination had both jalapeño and the traditional red peppers which made it eye-wateringly spicy hot! Servers were attentive and helpful.
