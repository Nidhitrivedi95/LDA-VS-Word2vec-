O7_rXHN_-cFp0TgiMaNulw I absolutely love this place. Very authentic and original taste. I had the Hong Kong noodle and my fiancé got the curry kick. Delicious options with a great depth of flavors. I look forward to trying more dishes here in the near future. As in, I had lunch and want to go back for dinner.
