MLVBJjbgk3sLZYyxqBD4XA Marathon Cafe Milk tea won many awards as I first tried this couple years ago at their Scarborough location.  The newest addition is in Richmond Hill so I stop by to have a look.  Place is in one of the strip plaza that is usually deserted so it was good to see this place bring people in.  So I walked in and notice you have to seat yourself and order at the counter like Timmies.  They even have a sizing chart for your milk tea like Timmies.  Overall, I got to say I am really disappointed with the whole experience even the good milk tea can't save this place with food that lousy.  You can this a sandwich when you have 1 tiny piece of meat and 1 lettuce.  And you didn't even toast it for me.  You going to charge me $5+ for this junk. Wow. just wow.  I will only come back to get the milk tea for take out next time and go elsewhere for food.  Going to give them 2 stars since the milk tea was pretty good so extra point there.
