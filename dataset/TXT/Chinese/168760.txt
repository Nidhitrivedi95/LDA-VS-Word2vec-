Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA It's been a little while since we've been here, shame on us! The menu is a fusion of Thai and Chinese and there isn't anything on the menu that isn't fabulous. There were four of us. We ordered the mango shrimp salad to start, then two whole red snappers that were flash fried then sautéed in a spicy Thai chili, ginger, with a tiny bit of sweet craziness. I had the meaty pork ribs that were more like short ribs with a crispy bark and a ponzu like sauce over Baby Bok Choy, it was stupidly delicious  We had an order of the DW Rice which had flavors that would keep you up at night just thinking about how good it was. Finally, a mango coconut curry over Salmon, so tasty! The place isn't large, the ambiance is a B, but the service is an A.
