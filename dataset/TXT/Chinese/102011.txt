keQlXWfz2K7GukqaReVyow Great Chinese Restaurant with acceptable prices! We eight went there tonight and were very satisfied with the food. The dining fee is less than $20 per person. One thing is, if you have more than five people, the tips will be automatically added to your bill, you don't have to pay for a second time. I will go back again: )
