o5t33JVLpZWf269AEPB95Q I've been to Greens twice, once to eat there and once for take out. I was not disappointed either time. I bought the shanghai noodles, lemon chicken, mushroom noodles, mango salad, and spicy chicken (all mock meat). It's great food and very friendly staff. Will be going back definitely.
