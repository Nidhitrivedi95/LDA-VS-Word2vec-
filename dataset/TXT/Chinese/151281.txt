szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A Dim Sum in Phoenix is like asking for rain in the desert.  It's few and far between, and you settle for finding water rather than asking for rain.  As far as dim sum goes, Great Wall is one of the best you'll find in Phoenix; it ain't the rain, but it's good water.  They have a line-up if you're not there early (a good sign), serve all the basic dim sum dishes using the traditional cart service.  Not the best dim sum I've ever had - but then, I've had dim sum worldwide - but certainly good considering this is the desert.  Within Phoenix I'd give it a 5 star, but my rating system is based on what I've tried worldwide in my many travels - so only 4 stars.  If you're in Phoenix and looking for Dim Sum, this is one of the few good watering holes around that can satisfy that thirst.
