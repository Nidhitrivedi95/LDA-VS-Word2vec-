cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw The food is outstanding, the staff is extremely friendly especially the owner.  Our whole family loves going to Yao's and we are always treated like we are family.  The prices are very reasonable and the serving sizes are very large.  Also, for a Chinese restaurant, Yao's is very clean.  Yao's is an excellent value.

We have been coming for the past couple of years and the food quality is consistently delicious.  I strongly recommend this restaurant.
