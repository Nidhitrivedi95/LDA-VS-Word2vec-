8KsMtzkmKgNsiVWyeeYQYw Definitely wasnt the Chinatown I was expecting, especially given the one that I'm used to in NYC. Just a strip of eateries. I did get the foot reflexology for $18 for 30 minute special. Wasn't quite 30 min, more like 20 and I've had better pedicures than that. Good way to escape the Vegas heat and chill out for a few.
