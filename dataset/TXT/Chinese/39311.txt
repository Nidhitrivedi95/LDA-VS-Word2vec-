Av5toUG7wweXfiX6FW4F0A The serving per dish is ample we had the chicken
Pad thai which is good. The teriyaki chicken was good. We also had the crab puffs which is ok.
The pho tai (beef soup) tasted like instant soup broth and needs more beef slices. The taste is far from the original vietnamese style.
