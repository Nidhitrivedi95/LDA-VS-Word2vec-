cxVp-a28Cp7lavjaPMvK5w I've been here before and both times were meh.  First time was with a date and they seated us at these tables where you're closer to the neighboring table than your date.  The food is overpriced for the serving size.  I got ramen that had two pieces of pork and some sparse noodles.  The sushi didn't even come out with soy sauce and we had to ask for it.  Every beer on the menu they seemed to be out of.  Overall, not impressed.  The decor is nice but that's about it.
