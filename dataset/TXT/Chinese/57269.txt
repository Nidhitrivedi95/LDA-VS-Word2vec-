D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Two stars because the food was decent. The place was empty so maybe that should have been a sign. Only one other table was seated the entire time we were there. Ran out of water and the waiter was no where to be found until he brought the check.

Thankfully i get email alerts from my bank because not only were we charged for our bill, but for the other table's too. Waiter tried to give us some crappy excuse and the manager didn't seem to care.

Won't be going back.
