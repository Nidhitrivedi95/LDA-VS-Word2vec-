r9J4uFdWhDgH8poy1KTdDg The worst Panda Express ever. I got food poisoning from this panda. I felt like I had to throw up and shit at the same time, same thing happened to my sister. This panda was just a bunch a younger people talking about how they are off on the thirty min..... well they sure acted like they were already off work, they ran out of entrees and didn't start preparing them till about five minutes after they noticed they had to make more. Also this one time I went through the drive thru and I was ordering my food and the young man closed the window when I was still talking to him. Like I said worst Panda Express ever.
