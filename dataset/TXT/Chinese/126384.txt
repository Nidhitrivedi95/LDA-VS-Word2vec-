p0aNNb7o6Ou6kn4apz4lkQ Went there a few times since it close to school. Their bubble teas are not the best, but they are still good (also a bit cheaper than the others). Food is also quite good, and really cheap. I think it is a great place to study, since they also have wifi. Service is fast and courteous.
