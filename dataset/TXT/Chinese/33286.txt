a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg I gave this place a 5 star due to the fact that they do have a very savory and fresh quality food. So far they're better than the other Chinese places especially with their dim sums (Bo Long).  

I would go here first before I would go anywhere else esp. if I am in the mood for some dim sums.
