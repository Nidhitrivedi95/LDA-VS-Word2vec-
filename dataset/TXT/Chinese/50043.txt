Not horrible, but not really good, either, and I really wanted it to be good because I needed another Asian take-out place for when Thai Basil was closed (during their annoying after lunch / before dinner break, or on Sundays) or I didn't want to shell out the big bucks for Swaddee across the street.

So, their take-out process: they've never botched an order, but the food's never once been ready within the time frame given - I usually have to sit and wait and watch while somebody else comes in, orders, gets their food and leaves, when I freakin' called ahead.

And the food: I've sampled various veggie and seafood options, and they're all just ok. It's cheap Chinese. If that's what you and your wallet are in the mood for, it'll work.
