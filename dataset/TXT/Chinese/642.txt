-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw I do not find any significant difference between this location and others (downtown @ Dundas, Scarb @ Midland, Finch-Leslie plaza). Nevertheless, here are the key things to be aware of when considering this branch.

Very convenient location for commuters, just steps away from Finch station. However, street parking only for those coming in cars. Allows use of vicinity rewards card. Limited seating capacity. Expect a line up if visiting from 4pm onwards, especially on the weekends. Washrooms are just ok. ***Accepts cash ONLY for the past few weeks!***
