eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ Great dumplings and ramen! We ordered the classic dumplings as an appetizer, and they were fantastic. I also really liked the soy vinegar dipping sauce. I had the shoyu ramen, which was very flavorful and interesting. I've never had ramen before, and I really enjoyed it!

The restaurant is inside a house, which makes it really cute. It has great decorations, and would be a great place for a date or a dinner with friends. It's not too big though, so it might be hard to get a table for a big group.

I will definitely be back!
