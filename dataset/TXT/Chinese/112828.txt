Mkpg9S2j0ZrZc3q-VjfLsA i've been here on multiple occasions but my most recent visit was not a great experience.

we made a reservation for 13, and they were cool with that, but when we got there, they didn't have a table to seat that many people. so they expected us to be separated. one round table for the majority of the people and a booth table which seats 4.

with asian food, the idea is to order multiple dishes and share the different foods, how the hell do you do that when the tables are split? the other thing we wanted to do, was to pull the big round table over to the booth so that even though it is a bit awkward, we can all kinda sit together, talk together, and share food with each other. they didn't want us to do that because it blocks their path to other tables. mind you, we were sitting at a corner, and if we pulled the table over, they would have a different path (an more convenient one at that) to service the other tables. maybe these people are programmed robots, because we pulled the table over on our own anyways making sure not to block any fire exits and such and these servers really looked confused when their normal route was no longer available.

we ordered a lot of food for 13 people and the food was at least good so the cooks did a good job at least. good job, cooks.
