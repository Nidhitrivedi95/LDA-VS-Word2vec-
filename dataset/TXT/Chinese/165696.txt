V48sDS4bUB1H31NEXU1nZg Felt like some Chinese that was not Panda Express-like and being this place was very close and on my way home, I decided to give it a try.  More like a fast food place with lots of pictures of food than a typical (Hawaii style) Chinese restaurant. It did smell a bit stale inside, do not think I would want to eat in. The menu was about what you would expect. Wanted some good noodles, with veggies, etc. Ordered the House Lo Mein to go. Took about 10 minutes, paid and left. Got home and unpacked the food. Good amount of food, mostly noodles, not much taste. I added some hot mustard and soy, salt and pepper which made it  better. To me, it did not appear that much care went into the preparation of this dish. I could not eat all of it and my two canine pals did not seem to be interested in what was left.  Think I will pass on any further visits to New Wok.
