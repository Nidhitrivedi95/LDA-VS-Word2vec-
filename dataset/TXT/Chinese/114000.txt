Ms_el67lrNsKBmdEXVxl6Q I have been here quite a few times since they opened. The past few times i went, I thought that I must've gotten them on a not so good day but now I'm realizing that the quality has gone down from all the other reviews I'm reading.  :-(  This is very disappointing. I was looking forward to have a decent American Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood.  The food when they first opened was top notch.  Well seasoned and well prepared but now the past few times I've gotten them, the food was still hot but there was no seasoning and the noodles and meat were overcooked.  I hope that they fix whatever was changed back to what it was when they first opened.
