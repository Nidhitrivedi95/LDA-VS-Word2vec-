These descriptions pretty much sum up my impression of this Congee Wong location.  Congee Wong is known for authentic Cantonese food that is flavourful.  I am not sure how the business management ensures taste consistency across the locations, but so far the flavour tastes relatively similar from location to location.  If you have eaten at one, you have been to them all.  This location stands out among peers with bigger portion.  A Sweet and Sour Pork entree ($7.50) is 20% more than what I have gotten at other locations.  The Spicy Clam Stir Fry was a small mountain.  The Scallops Stir Fry with Vegetables ($17.50) had a lot of scallops and vegetable.  The scallops were not fresh, though they had not gone bad yet.  I would not order this entree again.

Services were good.  They refilled tea pots and took away empty plates promptly.  The only irritant was they mixed up the orders among tables.  We were asked at least 3 times if some dishes were ours.  I was sure they almost handed our orders to another table.

I will come back to eat more.  I can't pass up a dinner deal like this.
