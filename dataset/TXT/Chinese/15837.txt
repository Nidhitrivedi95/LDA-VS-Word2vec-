3sdUVTMBHPiVN5zqZjb1zw Hibachi Grill and Buffet just opened up in Matthews about a few months ago. This is now our "go-to" buffet place.

It has a huge variety of Chinese food and some american dishes. It also has a hibachi grill area where you can pick out fresh veggies and meats and have them cook it for you right there. 

Since I love Japanese food this is such a cheap way to have both Japanese and chinese food together.

They also have your typical sushi rolls from buffets if you enjoy Chinese buffet sushi. They also have a good variety of fruits and desserts options and and you won't be disappointed by their ice cream. Its not the typical three flavor yogurt ice cream. 

I love their Teriyaki steak and my daughter loves their sesame chicken. She says its the best in town. :) 

The prices are very reasonable too. Its under $8 per person and thats very reasonable when considering their buffet selection. They also have one in the Kannapolis area.
