X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Perhaps its the goal of Vegas clubs to encourage people to get table service but it just seemed like I was always trapped. There is limited bar space, limited free space, and rearlly no central location where people hang out. If you fight your way to the dance floor there's a good chance you'll be stuck there for a while.  I just felt trapped in our table and the setup isn't conducive to walking around, hanging out at a bar, or even going to the dance floor to dance. They essentially just want to pack people in and have them drink and dance in place, I didn't like it. The crowd wasn't very attractive and the music was something I may have enjoyed 10 years ago but is now truly "pots and pans" music. Again considering the table minimum of $2,500 I'd consider other place first, but maybe I'm just over this scene so perhaps my opinion isn't the same as 24 year olds..
