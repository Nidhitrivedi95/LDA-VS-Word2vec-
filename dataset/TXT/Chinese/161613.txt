uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw Came here with my bf at 1am b4 and it was packed!! I thought it was pretty decent for a 24/7 restaurant. (Food wise) 


Only problem was that our meal totalled to $5 short in order to pay with debit/credit i believe min was $20.... So we ended up buying 4 different pop drinks..... Otherwise the food was 4+ 

Advice: dont forget your cash or order more food. ^_^
