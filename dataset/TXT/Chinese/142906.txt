rLyGCFULUSbLCt8J3U0_kA We were looking for somewhere north to have Peking duck. Worst dining experience ever! The restaurant was the ugliest decor I have ever seen, the bathrooms were utterly filthy and the food cold and very unappetizing. In addition there were families there with loud children running around the place. 
Staff was nice.
