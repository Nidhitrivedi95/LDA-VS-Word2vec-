It loses stars for inconsistency.

The Hot & Sour soup is good one visit, less good the next.

The Singapore Noodles are consistent in their well-preparedness, taste and volume.

Their version of Chicken Fried Rice is eye-opening. Yellow - blindingly yellow - rice, with no traditional egg, carrots, peas nor green onions. Only white onions and some bean sprouts to accompany the chicken. 

I wish it was open later, and I want to know the story behind their sign.
