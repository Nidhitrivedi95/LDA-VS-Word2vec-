I love that TAS not only offers a sliding scale ($20-$40 per visit, no questions asked), but they also offer lots of great promotions and specials to make acupuncture readily available to those who might not be able to afford it -- check their Twitter feed and sign up for their mailing list to be in the know.  

I could not recommend Ash more highly. My experience with her has always been pleasant, and she really listens to my needs every time I visit. I've been to other acupuncturists elsewhere where the placement of the needles has felt a bit painful, but Ash has a magic touch that makes the acupuncture experience as painless as possible. In fact, everyone I've encountered at the clinic -- from practitioners to front desk staff -- have been really friendly and welcoming, and have made me feel right at home. 

For a community clinic, it's also an incredibly clean and inviting space. It's comfortably cool even in the hot summer months, and I always drift off into a state of relaxation for the duration of my stay. Finally, the online appointment system makes it so convenient to schedule appointments from the comfort of my own home. I look forward to returning, and would recommend it highly to anyone seeking affordable acupuncture in Toronto.
