cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw If there was a negative rating, this place would deserve it!

It was advertised as a Dim Sum place and when my family and I visited the place there were no carts going around, like a normal dim sum, and the menu was very limited!

Hard enought that we did not speak the language, and the server spoke little english.  We pretty much had to point at what everyone else is ordering and there were only a few customers at the place.

When we got the food, it lacked meat in the Char Siu Bau and the Shaomai was salty, plus no Sesame Ball!  The order was incomplete and the place did not have regular ICE TEA!  They only served Brisk Ice Tea in a can.

The only restaurant that will make you feel hungry when you walk out!

My departing comment is " You should never go in when you see a restaurant with few patrons".
