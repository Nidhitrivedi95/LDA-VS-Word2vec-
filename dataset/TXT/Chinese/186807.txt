yD2jmBrBPbLJ2yN3lQQHjw This is by far the worst Hakka place in GTA, who would have thought Hakka can be flavourless?! Their chilli chicken was so dry and hot and sour soup was too thick to swallow, they might want to go easy on the corn flour. 

To top it off, worst service ever, not only the food took super long to come, our server was so rude and made it clear he hated being there. 

Definitely wont be returning here ever again!
