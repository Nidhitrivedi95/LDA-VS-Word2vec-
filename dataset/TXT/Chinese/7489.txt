0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Great place around the corner from me. They offer an array of hakka foods with all different levels of spice. Love the chicken pakoras here-big and meaty, more like an entree than an appetizer. Also love their butter chicken, its different-not spicy and savoury with a sweet aroma great on steamed rice. Chili chicken dry/wet both the best in town. Fung mei mein, szechuan noodles, and manchurian fried rice are my go to carbs. Honestly anything you get here will not disappoint, so long as you can handle heat.
