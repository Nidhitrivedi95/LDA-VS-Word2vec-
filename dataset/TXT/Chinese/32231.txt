9WAnQD1nj1j3zLZ7ONtvfQ Food is gooood!

Ambiance is excellent!

The only thing i noticed is that everytime we go there (usually in groups of 8-12 or more) they will give us a small booth and leaves no elbow room to enjoy the meal .... even tho there are open tables at the back for better sitting ... dont be afraid to spreak up and ask for a better spot, i think they are filling up the front tables to look busy ??? i dunno ... but it didnt make sense to sit 12 people in a booth fit for 8 ...  we got a decent table at the back.  other than that service and food are excellent!  

btw the cocktails are great also.

the fish dishes are very fresh !  dont miss the grilled spiced edemame ... yummm!
