VvSmE1NnTjnaTPHT0WrCaQ Very good food. I had the following: crystal rolls, vegetable curry, spring rolls, veggie dumplings, veggie duck, hot sour soup, and sushi set. I especially loved the curry, hot sour soup and the spring roll. Their tea is best too. I had the jasmine green tea and it tasted really good. You can really taste the jasmine in it. Other brands, the jasmine flavour is very weak, almost washed out. I also love how they have section where you can buy the mock meat and teas. I bought some of their tea and the mutton and beef mock meats. The staff is very friendly and helpful too. I will definitely return, especially to buy their excellent products.
