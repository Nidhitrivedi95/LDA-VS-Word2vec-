And for all the people complaining about the language barrier, here's my take: it's part of the experience! When I step into the restaurant I feel transported to a different country, and now I am the foreigner! Everybody, including the customers, is speaking Mandarin, and that forces me to communicate with the cashier rather than just read off of a boring English menu.

There is always just enough seating for everyone, but--- Oh no! --- you might have to sit with someone you don't know.  This restaurant gives you an excuse to sit with that cute Chinese boy or girl sitting alone eating pork noodles.

That being said, I am not Chinese, so I don't have much say in what is authentic Chinese or not! But at least that is the way it seems to me; also the sheer volume of Chinese International students that I see enjoying a meal here attests to this as well.  

Definitely worth visiting at least once. You could spend thousands of dollars to buy a plane ticket to visit China, or just spend 9 dollars to get a taste of China right here in Campus Town.
