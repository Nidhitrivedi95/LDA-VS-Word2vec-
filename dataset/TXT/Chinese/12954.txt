2tiFUn8EU0EpjWBHjt1L6w Despite the bad reviews below, I've been going there for years and love it!
As a student, the price is very reasonable and the plates are huge. I always have a good amount of leftovers that I bring home. The servers aren't the best servers ever, but I've never had a problem with them. They've never been rude with me or i've never felt not welcomed. Whenever i'm downtown and want Chinese food I always go there without hesitation.
