lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA The walnut shrimp is probably the best I've had at any Chinese restaurant. The milk tea was also good, but not really out of the ordinary. I also had a rice roll with XO sauce that was really good. I don't think I've had the same thing at any other Chinese restaurant, so I don't know how it compares, but it was good nonetheless. I would recommend any or all of these items.

The service was all pretty good. I saw some other commenters saying that they felt Chinese customers were getting treated better than white customers, but I'm white and didn't feel any different in the way I was treated. Maybe not all of the staff has great English, but the hostesses and servers all seemed pretty fluent, if not native speakers. Either way, they all seemed like they were doing their best to provide good service regardless of who the customer was.

Overall, it was a pretty good dining experience. It was a little bit on the pricey side for what you get, so I don't feel justified giving it five stars, but that's most likely because it's on the Strip, so I'm not going to rate them too low, either.
