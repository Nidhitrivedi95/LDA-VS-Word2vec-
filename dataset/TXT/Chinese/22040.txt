6eUJ3BbrP7tsEKwYhMI4_Q This place is just ordinary, there is nothing really great about it except that they deliver.  the best item I had on their menu was the shrimp in lobster sauce, the sweet and sour and orange chicken tasted like it was previously frozen and similar to something you can buy at costco in the freezer isles. They are a bit overpriced, but I think most of the asian food in Arizona is overpriced and lacking in authenticity.
