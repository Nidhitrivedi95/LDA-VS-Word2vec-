rsQAS-k7GldsJm7UAtVyYA I went here with my parents for a late lunch recently.  The place was pretty full for a weekday afternoon.

My parents had #42 Pho Dac Biet (Special Pho, which contained rare beef, well done beef flank, brisket, soft tendons, tripe and meat balls).  My mom had the small ($5.50) and my dad had the large ($7).  My parents think this place has the best pho in the GTA.  

I am not a fan of pho, so I had the Beef Pad Thai ($7.50).  I know, I know, it's just asking for trouble to order Thai food at a Vietnamese restaurant, but it actually was pretty good.  It did not have that authentic Thai flavour, but it was very tasty.  The noodles were nicely done (not too mushy or too dry) and the flavour was tangy and sweet.  There was a lot of tamarind in the sauce.  It had a nice spicy kick to it.  They were very generous with the meat.  Lots of tender slices of beef.  There was also 3 large fried tofu puffs in the dish, along with onions, and some red and yellow peppers.  The dish usually comes with bean sprouts but I asked for none.  There was a small pile of iceberg lettuce on the side with a sprig of Vietnamese basil.  

Service is competent but not all that friendly.  Do not expect any smiles here or any warm greetings.  The pho bowls are really full to the brim.  The waitress spilled some broth in my tea and promptly removed my cup and replaced it with another one.  Service is speedy and they get the job done, but I would have liked it if they were a little nicer.

Decor is minimal.  Washrooms are not that clean.  

Lots of free parking.  It's across the street from Sheridan Mall.  It's in the same strip mall as Shopper's Drug Mart, TD Bank and Scotia Bank.
