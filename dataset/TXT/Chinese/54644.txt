CTsLzuZ_AR841SiSacdEvg This is me and my wife first time eating here.  She wanted Asian food and this place was in walking distance. I wasn't expecting what I got. Really clean small little place. The employees were really nice and worked quickly. The food was very fulfilling and tasty. Definitely will be back
