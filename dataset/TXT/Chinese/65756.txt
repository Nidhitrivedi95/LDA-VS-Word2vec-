ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw I live near by and do love the food from Pei Wei but the service, organization and management could use a ton of help. It seems the staff is minimally trained and I have had multiple wrong to-go orders or the service is slow because they are trying to fix someone else's messed up order. Almost every time I come in here there is an issue with my order or someone else's.
