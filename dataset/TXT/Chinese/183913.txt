Xu1_lZl30we4PQlJ58zQ9w If you live in the Beach/upper Beach area, this is definitely your local and you know nearly everyone in there.  

This place has everything a good ole pub should have, clean tap lines, familiar faces, good food and bar tenders who are friendly and remember what you drink.  What more could you ask for?

The owner Patrick is a super nice guy who seems to genuinely care about everyone who walks in and ensuring they have a good time.  He even hosts an orphan Christmas dinner where he puts on a big feed and welcomes everyone in, especially those without family to share the holidays with.  

There are affordable daily specials and the bands on the weekend are actually good!  They are happy to have your kids in with you during the day and everyone from their 20's right through goes in, everyone is welcome. 

Make sure you get there early on weekends or you'll be in for standing room only!
