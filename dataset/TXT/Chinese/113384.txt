moMLPfZhhhmJpJYZHeManw This place has been around longer than I've been calling this small town my home. Restaurant business is hard to survive in this town sometimes and for them to stay in business longer than I've been here, something must be good about this place.

 I came to pick up to go order the other day, it's been at least a few years since last time I dined here. 

Beef with garlic had a very nice flavor, I always enjoyed Singapore noodles, nice dinner size portion, I forgot how good their food was.

It is nice neighborhood Chinese. May not be the best but they've been offering good food for a long time
