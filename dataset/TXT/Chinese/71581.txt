fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A I have to admit before I visited this place Ping Pang Pong was my number one dim sum spot in Vegas. KJ actually has better location in my own opinion. It's really close to Rio's parking lot! (no need to walk all over of casino and stuffs) Both their food and deco are more delicate than Ping Pang Pong. Service here was really good. We constantly had waiter checking our table even when they pretty much had full house of customers. price is very friendly too (small dish:$2.28 / med dish:$3.18/ large dish:$3.98 / special dish:$4.98) I definitely recommend their dim sum time!!
