pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I'd love to give 4 stars. It almost deserves 4 stars. Let me start with the good, then I'll get to the minus 1 star. 
The have a happy hour that has drinks and food specials. (usually 1/2 price). Was coming here often, loved the service and loved the food. Thank God they HAD happy hour specials as it can be expensive. It's the strip, of course it is. The shrimp seviche stands out. It was delicious, very tasty and very clean. The asparagus was very tasty too. 
So, after coming here a few times a week for a few weeks we show up and ask for the happy hour menu. They proceed to tell us that since a convention is in town, they are not offering it! WHAAAAAAAAT? I'm a local, I come here (somewhat) often, and I'm being punished because you have an opportunity to take advantage of out of towners! That reaaaaaaallllly rubbed me the wrong way. So, down from 4 stars to 3 stars. If you are an out of towner, you wouldn't know. But if you are a local, then it's really disappointing to treat locals that way.
