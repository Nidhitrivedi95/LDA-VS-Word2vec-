2Cmpz9lgr-wfOLAwgUf79g I think I like this place for all the reasons that others have listed as ones to not like it. They don't have General Tso's? THAT'S AWESOME!! Why would we honestly need another chinese restaurant that serves that in this city. I'm so excited to have new things to try. And these dishes are actual authentic dishes they would serve in China. 

They have a eccentric menu with photos and weird fonts? THAT'S AWESOME TOO! People are going to need help since they don't serve the typical Chinese fast food fare. And they provide awesome photos! I liked being able to pick my food based on picture. It felt fun and like I was a kid again.

I drove up to this place on a Friday night, you're more likely to see the sign for the supermarket than the restaurant sign but the entrance is in the front. But that's cool too, eat something, feel inspired, go buy the ingredients for it next door!

We got the lotus root appetizer. This was spicy and crunchy. Nice way to put away some vegetables. The three cup chicken dish, this was mild in spice, the chicken was coated and a bit crunchy. It was very good and I think a good safe dish for someone trying out new Chinese dishes for the first time.

Then tried he beef pot soup/stew. The beef was very tender, there was a good bit of collagen which is normal in this type of cuisine but can throw others off. The flavor of the soup was quite herbal so may be strong for others. I think it was tasty but a bit more adventurous for the palate. 

Thank you ZenZen for being bold and putting out new dishes for Madison to try!
