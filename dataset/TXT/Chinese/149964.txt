sr0rCMn-XtKATvl9adYQxA Traditional Chinese dessert in Scarborough, you can find most representative of Chinese dessert there.
Traditional Chinese environment, wood chair and tables, blue china. But it is a small place.
Price is quite good( dessert on menu), expensive for seasonal dessert (such as Mango series for this season, all around $7.25).
Definitely good taste!!!
Sums up, I give four star.
One star missing because of narrow space,lack of variety and high price for seasonal dessert.
