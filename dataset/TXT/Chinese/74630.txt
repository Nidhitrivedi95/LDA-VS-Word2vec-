FscCtUIsAL8cBL-S-A4FEQ I've been wanting to check this place out right next to the Sprouts I shop at. The first time I went, I had the chicken and vegetables. Nothing too great, but good. The second time I got the moo goo gai pan. Not only was it the most tasteless chinese food I've ever had, but the most tasteless dish I've ever had anywhere! Blah! I'm not going back. The dishes are very cheap price wise, so in this case you get what you pay for. The restaurant could also use a deep cleaning. These average chinese restaurants are a dime a dozen. They've got to put some flavor in their food. I hope they read their reviews and can make changes. Hate to see anybody lose their business.
