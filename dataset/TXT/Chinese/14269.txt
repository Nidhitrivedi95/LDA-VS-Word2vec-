3cAy1gxlprn1ue0q3L_ziw Food was alright, staff was very friendly. I guess the price is ok for Yorkville area but I still feel like there are better places with cheaper costs. The decoration inside is very nice although the seats in the booth we sat in are wooden and stiff so it was difficult to get comfortable. The overall atmosphere was nice.

We ordered hot & sour soup ($6ish) and was able to share it among two people. If you like spicy food, this was definitely spicy enough for me and I love spicy food. We got their signature fried rice ($13ish) and it was just typical yang chow fried rice with a fancy name on it. It was also a little oily for our preferences. With the rice we got their mapo tofu ($12ish) and I didn't think it was anything special. Finally tried their onion pancake ($6-7ish) which wasn't bad, a little salty for my tastes but my friend liked how layered and crisp the dough part was. Also I got a corona ($6-7) with a nice looking chilled cup to keep it nice and cold.

Probably won't go back because I have better places to try and nothing made me want to specifically come back but if I were in the area and not willing to blindly try something new, I would want to try their other food to give them another chance.
