Steamed Seafood & pork dumpling with lotus roots stands out, wrapped up in thin layer of seaweed. Compact seafood flavour! Steamed BBQ Pork Rice Rolls, must try!!! Think they really perfect the rice rolls, with its nice bounce and silkiness. Also the Steamed Shrimp Dumpling ( Had Gow ) has the same texture. All the seafood they use in the dishes are indeed fresh. Deep fried octopus tentacle is just okay a bit tough in regarding to the texture. The mustard green with clam & preserved egg congee serves as a good finishing touch to the meal. The menu is extensive and there are pleasant surprises with the fusion twist.
