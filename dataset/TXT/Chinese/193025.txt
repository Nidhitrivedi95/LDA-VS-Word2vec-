ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ This is a great little restaurant.  We are recently huge fans of the Parlor, so thought that finally eating some Chinese food (that's not dim sum) since we moved to Phoenix was called for.  Plus, Central Phoenix is our home.

We tried a variety of things.  Spring roll with beef neck, steamed buns with duck/lamb pastrami, dumplings with pork & kimchi, the mission chinese kung pao and fried rice with bbq pork.  The spring roll was good, glad I tried it, probably wouldn't eat it again (the sauce was weird).  Steamed buns were amazing and delicious and I want more of them.  Dumplings were ok, interesting, spicy, probably wouldn't order again.  Husband loved his kung pao (I want to order it next time) and my fried rice was smokey and full of flavor and veggies and pork (as opposed to the mostly rice version of most chinese take out).

Cocktails.  I would come here just for the drinks.  Oh my goodness they were amazing.  Sloe burn is at the top of the list, first recommendation to anyone.  One of the best cocktails I've ever tried.  Temperance tamer was just what I needed tonight, which was a little sweet and a little sour (grapefruit, yum).

This is a place we will certainly come back to.  We could also see ourselves just coming in for drinks and steamed buns.  That would be delicious.
