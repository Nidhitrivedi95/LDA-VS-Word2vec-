JOrz9T33rVHDbusIKPj96g This restaurant is always my family's first choice. My kids were born in Canada and they are as picky as you can imagine. The lunch special particularly the Won Ton with beef brisket Soup and Szechuan style Chicken with rice was exceptional. The order was fast enough, and the taste was excellent. We come back each time to indulge our taste buds.
