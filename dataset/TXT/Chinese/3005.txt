_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Booooo, not satisfied at all by this place!

Had come here with an open mind and left disgruntled and frustrated.

First off, the waitress was very sassy and aggressive in tone. Had asked her about some of the items on the menu and she answered in a tone that suggested that I should already know!!! I do not work here so it would be very nice of you, as the waitress, to help me understand. Additionally, my lady had asked about getting some steamed rice and this waitress acted liked she had asked for her soul! IS IT REALLY A BIG DEAL TO ASK FOR A 2 SIDES OF RICE!!! REALLY!!! This waitress clearly needed some time off of work or something because she was dropping the ball for her team and this business!!!

Secondly, the eating utensils were not clean at all! Ewww, do you really expect me to use these dirty utensils to eat my food with! I am not a fan of bacteria and to think that it was appropriate to put these out on the table is just foolish! Luckily, I know how to use chopsticks but this is just not okay at all. I felt bad for the all the other customers that did not inspect there silverware! 

The food was alright! I was just more let down but to fact that I had such an awful waitress. 

Side note, I had some family friends come out to Vegas while I was there and they also ate at this same restaurant and had the same sentiments. They had bad customer service as well and had issues with their order as well. 

I would like to give this place another chance but this disaster that took place while I was here needs to be addressed at some point.
