naIri3sawHNvekftRyrasg My Wife and my son and I were looking for a place uptown (north york) to have Korean BBQ. We saw on Yelp that this restaurant was close by so we decided to give it a shot. 

Disappointing is all I can say.

The kalbi ribs were very chewy and the chicken had a funky after taste.

I`ve made better ribs at home on the BBQ buying them at Costco and the marinate from Korean grocery stores. 

The part that is shocks me the most is that genuine Koreans run this place. 

The Korean Grill House run by Chinese has better food.

To add insult to injury, Children age 4-10 are charged around $15.

My Son is 4 so anyone with a 4 year old knows they don`t eat that much and there is a huge disparity between how much a 4 year old can eat and a 10 year old.

Needless to say we won`t be returning.

The only good thing was the people were nice.
