WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg Inside the Fremont Casino downtown this casino snack bar serves up chinese fast food & fresh made hot sandwiches. 

Hot dog,fries & drink $2.95, 2 item chinese combo $5.99, French Dip & waffle fries plus a drink $6.99. 

French Dip was suprisingly good, waffle fries were fresh & crisp. Chinese was not so good. 

Definitely a good spot to know of if your downtown drinking & on a budget or craving some chinese.
