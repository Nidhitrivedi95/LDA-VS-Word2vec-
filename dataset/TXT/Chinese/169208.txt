vsi_PMRgyFy4_vVfQErtCA Good food at average prices for chinese. Great portions and food comes to the table quickly. The staff are the average chinese food experience with not the friendliest demeanor but attentive and efficient. Love the fried rice. Noticeable pieces of real chicken not the questionable processed chicken other places serve that's rubbery abd chewy.
