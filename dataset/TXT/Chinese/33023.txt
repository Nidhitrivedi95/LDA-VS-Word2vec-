That being said, they ARE handmade, and the pork & cabbage filling is delicious and flavorful, though they could be more generous on the filling:dough ratio.

I know how hard food business is, so I'm not one to tell anyone how to run their business, but I have to say this: 
1) BEWARE- you never know when this place is open. We've gone multiple times, hours before their posted closing time and they were closed (they dont even have an open/closed sign). 
2) THEY DONT CLEAN the tables after customers left. When I went, there every single open table still had plates and cups from the previous customers. You have to ask them to clean it for you and they reluctantly do it as if they are doing you a huge favor. The rug that they use to wipe the table carries the STENCH of MOLD
3) STUDY YOUR MANDARIN - as only one of the workers speaks English. The MENU is in Chinese, the only English menu is at the counter, hastily scribbled in pencil on a piece of cardboard.
4) OPEN YOUR SCHEDULE to come here, because they are severely understaffed- 3 regular workers, and you will wait to order (usually theres no one at the counter as they are all in the kitchen busy so you have to stand there and wait)
5) There is a table near the front of the restaurant where they lay out plastic cups for hot water (no cold water? what?) and tiny plastic cups (like you get for condiments) for the chili oil, which is laying open with no lid. The chili oil was pretty much completely empty, the cups and stuff were lying about in a huge mess from inconsiderate customers (but its the business's responsibility to keep it neat). Its unsanitary and disorganized.
