1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA NOTHING WONG HERE!! This place is great! But you must want an authentic experience and enter with an open mind. 

You will not find the typical items on the menu. I actually had no idea what to order: not many familiar Asian dishes. But as past Yelpers have said before; the shrimp wontons, salt and pepper wings (eat with the little peppers), beef ramen, and pork chop were all excellent.

You won't find fried rice, but the seasoned rice is light and delicious. 

The VALUE is amazing! I will be back.
