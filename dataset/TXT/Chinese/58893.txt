Dh2Z3WNu6M71LbMNHEeg3w BEWARE!!!! We ordered a Hakka dinner for 2 and less than 3 hours later we were all sick with food poisoning. 

Our 20 month old son was so ill and all he ate was the noodles that came with the dinner. 

We have ordered from them maybe 3 other times and never had an issue but we will never be going back again.

Awful costumer service! We called today to tell them what happened and they didn't believe us since they didn't get any other complaints. For a resolution they offered to give us the money for the noodles back. They seriously thought offering less than $10 was acceptable. We demanded back our full money back (Less than $40!) and they refuse.
