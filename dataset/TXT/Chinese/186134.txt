Y6Vw0FF8Qz9XD8fY4Z9Vfg Boba tea here is pretty good for an Arizona boba tea shop. Customer service is just on the OK side. The cashier got my order wrong and was not at all apologetic about it. Instead, when I went to go pick up my tea, I was given a lecture about how I supposedly the one who got my order wrong. I always order the same thing at every boba shop and this is the first shop that has gotten my order wrong. As I mentioned, the boba is good but customer service goes a long way in this industry. A smile is all that is needed to please me and I did not see a single smile from the cashier, let alone a pleasant greeting. So, three stars for decent boba...minus two stars for not being as friendly as they could have been.
