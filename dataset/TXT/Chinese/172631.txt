w4EX3F0KjJIXL7O1fFWXJw Still in it's soft opening we came here for Father's Day Lunch. We were the third or fourth group in the restaurant. The interior is awesome so we were excited. We ordered two noodle dishes and three dumpling dishes. The noodles came quick but
the dumplings were nowhere to be seen. We asked a couple of waitresses and the manager. It took about another half hour for them to try and correct the mistake. Overall we were here for an hour and a half when we would easily have been out in 40 mins or so. 

As for the food. The stewed beef noodles had no flavour (and it was nine dollars!). The only thing worth having was the fried noodles and xiao long bao. The food is pretty expensive for what you get compared to other places. 

They are still in their soft opening so they have a TON of work to do. I'll probably stick to The Chinese Dumpling House.
