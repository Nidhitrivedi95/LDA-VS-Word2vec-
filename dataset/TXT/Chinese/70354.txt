F3xksTtZUfanOcLQqJn0eQ We were eating too much rich food during our Scotland stay and just wanted some simple food! We had the won ton min and some dim sum and it totally hit the spot. The restaurant interior was very nice, clean and organized. It was a pretty big place too!  The restaurant was conveniently located off Princes Street and we were also seated immediately. The service was good and speedy. There were a rich mix of diverse cultures as patrons, including a lot of Asians. The price was fair for the food, service and atmosphere. We would go there again!
