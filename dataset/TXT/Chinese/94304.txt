jDehhKtVZa62k32WHbnc2A I ate here a little while ago for dinner with my girlfriend.  Originally I had been turned onto this place and their Sichuan style cooking by a couple of grad school friends from China and wanted my girlfriend to experience it as well.

We decided to start off our meals with the pickled vegetables in red oil.  Whenever our dish was served a man who I am assuming to be the owner stopped over and explained the many spices in the oil.  Even before he had mentioned it we could easily taste the complexity of the dish and really enjoyed it.  For our entrees we both ordered off the Sichuan menu with my girlfriend getting the salt and pepper squid while I got the extremely spicy Chongquing chicken.  My girlfriends dish was good while not being spicy at all.  The entree I had was a different story although I had been aware of that when ordering.  My chicken was fried nicely and cooked with some spicy dried peppers and prickly ash ( Sichuan pepper) added in.  If you have never had it before the pepper can be described as giving a numbing taste.  I ended up thoroughly enjoying my entree between all of the flavors.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here again.  They have all of your normal Chinese food in addition to being one of a few places to have an authentic Sichuan menu which is sure to take your tastebuds for a wild ride.
