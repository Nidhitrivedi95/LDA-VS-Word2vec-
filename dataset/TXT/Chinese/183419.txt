XplJHcYSQTFlwv3Rk8WsYw I really enjoy this place. Small but got really good and cheap Shanghai dumplings ! First order is $1 and every order after that is a bit more. Good deal! 

Also their pork ramen is delicious $8.99! Except I could do without the bamboo. 

Quick service and food is served fast.
