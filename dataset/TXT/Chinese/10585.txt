1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Where should I begin?? After being seated and waiting 10 minutes, our waitress bypassed our table twice to take orders from people that were seated after us. Not sure if us being the only black couple had anything to do with it. I ordered the curry chicken with roti pancakes and there must have been a chicken shortage because I received a bowl of curry potatoes with a few chicken scraps.. Needless to say, I won't be back.. I'm only out $1.00, so that's a plus..
