X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Hakkasan tries to compete with the big two clubs in Vegas right now. Marquee and XS. In a way, it does, but in another way, it's your typical Vegas club just magnified 10x.

While it didn't have as many stairs as Marquee, there were still quite a few. Granted, there were a bunch of rooms playing any type of music you wanted and I guess you can't be taking the elevator all day with those many people.

Suffice to say, it's layout isn't as good as XS which has that gigantic open area with no stairs. On the flipside, XS can get packed enough where you have to wade through the pool just to get out.

Both a downside and upside of Hakkasan is they don't close off the main dancefloor. Marquee and XS will have security shooing you away. Hakkasan did not the day I went. However, while you can make your way to the floor, you're packed like sardines.

Also, $100 for Calvin Harris? C'mon. Really? I've paid less for Kaskade and Avicii in Vegas.
