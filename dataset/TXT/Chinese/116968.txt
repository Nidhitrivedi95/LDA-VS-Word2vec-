nbVtxapTeq5HELUeNRgc6w Horrible service ! Terrible and rude receptionist! Tried to make a reservation over the phone for the next day.But they insisted we go to restaurant there for confirmation in person which is very unreasonable. My husband tried to know why , but she just hang up on him. Never happened to us before ! We always tried to support Chinese restaurant because we are Chinese , but they just don't deserve it . 0 star ! 0 ! 0 ! 0 !
