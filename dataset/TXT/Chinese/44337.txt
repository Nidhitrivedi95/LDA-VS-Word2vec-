bj6Km1RvgD6oyppCe5yDog I am embarrassed to admit that tonight was my first time here, even though I've lived within walking distance for 5 years, because I assumed it would not be good. WRONG. Why is this place not more of a yelp gem?

(Actually, one reason I've never pursued it is because I think at one point the reviews were mixed up between this place the the place on McDowell. This review is for the restaurant on the NW corner of 24th St and Indian School.)

It was totally empty at 6pm on Saturday when I stopped in to get takeout. The woman helping me was very polite and helped me pick out a few things from the Chinese menu. 

The Singapore noodles were scrumptious and I ate the whole order by myself. 
The green beans with XO sauce were also tasty, although plan to use those more as a side than an entree (and as a heads up, I do not think they are vegetarian, though one might assume them to be; I think there is some diced dried fish in the sauce making it YUMMY but not veggie).

The soup of the day was described as "rehydrated bok Choi soup". I'm not sure what that means, exactly, since when is bok choi DEhydrated anyway? I don't think she thought I'd like it because it was more of a traditional Chinese soup, but I loved it. It was very brothy with ultra-boiled greens, some unfamiliar mushroom or possibly dried plum thing, and (I think) boiled peanuts. The broth had a slightly sweet quality to it, similar to Pho broth. I'm not making the soup sound that good, but it was. Just try it. 

I had heard that the winter melon soup is great, but the woman told me that while occasionally they have it as a daily soup, usually you have to call a couple of days in advance to order it so they can prepare.

I'm so glad I finally found a good neighborhood Chinese restaurant.
