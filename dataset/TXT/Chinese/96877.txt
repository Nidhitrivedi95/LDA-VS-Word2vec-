joMyW9KcBEsHJxQuAMulaQ This is the first board game café I've been to and it was quite a treat! 

Since my friends and I went on a Sunday night, the place wasn't over packed but rather relaxing! The service was great and since it was my birthday and they realized after we had finished the giant slice of cake, the waitress actually apologized for not knowing and said we could've gotten a sparkler on it. To me, that was a friendly gesture. 

The place was a slight bit pricey but in terms of the hot chocolate I had gotten, the size was big and it was actually pretty good (and I am picky with those sorts of things). I think it was worth it. The games were in good condition and we were only ever short one set of instructions. 

The prices were a bit strange but I understood why they were set this way. $5 per person but you need to order something to eat or drink or else it's $20 for the person who didn't order anything. So depending on what you order, it's cheaper to order some small thing then just come in to play. 

I would recommend it if you were in the area and I think I would go there again some time.
