F9h98ZFHLCHG7SdVbXMz0g Modernized dimsum is more for me than the traditional type. It's definitely more relaxing and pleasing to the eye. 

Everything is ordered from an order sheet instead of chasing down any carts. Although some like the carts cause you can see before you buy. But I find that style the food usually gets cold from being on the cart for so long. They have a moderate selection and dishes are not too greasy. Everything displayed nicely on the dishes. Each dish is on the small side definitely. Rice rolls only have four pieces vs six on the traditional ones. Sticky rice wrapped in lotus lead 2 here vs. 3.

Overall, food generally tastes good and the service is good. Decor is nice and new, bathrooms generally clean. Tea you pay more for here but I find their tea is real tea vs. powder tea in other places so I don't mind paying extra. Dishes smaller and pricier but I like the more relaxing atmosphere vs the loud bustling traditional dimsum restaurants.
