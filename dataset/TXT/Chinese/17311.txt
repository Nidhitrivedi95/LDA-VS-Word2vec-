4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA Ordered Chinese over the phone - easy and FAST! Great communicator as well. Egg drop soup was hot, egg rolls were delicious, and they gave us a ton in our entrees (enough for at least 2 meals)! Also gave us steamed rice. Broccoli Beef was awesome and included other veggies which was a nice touch - plenty of meat. The Kung Pow Pork was "really good," says my fiancé! Over the phone he said 40-45 minutes, and it came in 20 MINUTES!!!! So happy because we were so hungry. So pleased with J&K! Will definitely order again!
