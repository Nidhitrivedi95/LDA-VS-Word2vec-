hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q Came here after a friend recommended it to me. Order a beer which came with a chipped glass and about a 2 inch crack. Chicken fried rice and orange chicken was ok but I've had better. Richie Rich roll was good. Apps were ok again I've had better. The salmon tartar took 20 minutes but was good. Overall experience was not that good. Restaurant wasn't even half full. It's Monday 5pm.
