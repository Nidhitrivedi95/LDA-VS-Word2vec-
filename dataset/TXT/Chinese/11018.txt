2cetuQgbP1Bnzm-uMRlocQ Is owned by the same people who own dragon I and serves the same exact food. I would say it's probably the best Asian food restaurant in the Regent / Monroe area, but not in Madison.

Like dragon I, the entrees are over priced and are often a hit or miss. Some dishes are very authentic ( such as the pho and topokee) and others are very Americanized. Most of the dishes I've tried have been suggestion (not on the menu) from friends  .If I'm feeling sick, I typically order pho from them, and that is usually pretty good. I've also tried the kimchi fried rice, which was pretty yummy as well.

In terms of the decor and the place itself, it's pretty low key but is not a nasty hole in the wall. Would be a nice play for a cute date if you're in that area and are having some Asian food cravings.
