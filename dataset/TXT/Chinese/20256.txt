5XX1w4WbwSlrACQ5vKuLDw Really yummy pho -- small is really small so get the medium. The soup was so umami I almost finished but was too full. Fried spring roll wasn't impressive -- tasted more like a Chinese fast food spring roll. Vietnamese coffee was good but disappointed they don't let the coffee drip in front of you. Will definitely go back!
