My son and I had early dinner here last Saturday (3/19) and I had the oysters and he didn't. 

That same evening, I was having non-stop diarrhea and 2 days after, violent vomiting. I'm still not well but self-medicating with Imodium and trying to take fiber and liquids when I can . I may go to Urgent Care tomorrow if this doesn't go away.

I had a sense this was a dodgy place but had a craving for seafood and this is close to my place and I didn't want to spend a lot. 

Serves me right but never again.

If anybody reading this has the misfortune of having a similar experience, I hope you will go to this Southern Nevada Health District link and file a complaint: http://southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/foodborne/fbi-form.php

Let's work together to make eating out a much safer and enjoyable experience for all of us. Thanks.
