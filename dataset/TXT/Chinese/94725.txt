JfbbFcJgj8Zfn9SjGDnBgQ I came here because HoHo BBQ was closed.

The verdict?  this place only survives because Hoho bbq closes on Wednesday and closes early.

they take the left over customers who initially come for Hoho BBQ.  the roasted pork may have been one of the driest roasted pork ever.. texture was like the dry turkey breast left out for a day.  

the sauce in the rice is not that great.  I give it 2 star for food and .5 star extra because my friend felt totally sad for them.

so overall 2.5
