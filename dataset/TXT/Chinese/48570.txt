C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ If you are craving Chinese buffet, this is not the place that I would recommend. Sure, there is a large variety of items to choose from.  However, the food is terrible.  Some of the items seemed to be on the inedible side.

I wouldn't have gone here for several reasons, if it were not because it is a mecca for tour bus and there were no other restaurants in the same shopping center.  1) The price for Sunday lunch was too expensive.  $14.99 for Sunday buffet?  That's outrageous.  2) The service.  They obviously could not handle a sudden rush of folks.  That's the unusual part as I am sure that tour buses stop here at least once a week. 3) I would have chosen to eat for the same or cheaper price at a off the strip buffet restaurant.  And 4) The A/C wasn't on.  With the weather outside in the 90's.  Are you crazy?

BTW, I ate at this restaurant two months ago.  The only reason that I still remember the dreadful experience is that it is in Las Vegas, one of the buffet meccas.
