2gDHQELrlq3jVuZZfJeWUg A surprisingly Taiwanese restaurant located at an unexpected location. The name I love and use; the food is a different thing. Hardly any decor and basically you eat and run. Not a place to hang out. The small open kitchen can be seen and it reminds you of your parents' kitchen. Some seats can be uncomfortable. The washroom is small too. 

Food: the beef noodle soup was hot in temperature and in spice which I love. The beef looked more like pork to me. They didn't have the sour pickled veggies that go with it. The noodle wasn't chewy enough. Good thing it was a good portion. 
The "ma pao tofu" was alright. Nothing special about it. We did ask to delete some spice to it. The sad part is that the steam rice came like 2 minutes later and it was an additional cost. 
The pan fried green onion pancake wasn't what I expected. It was hard instead of chewy. Dry too!! 

It's not the best Taiwanese restaurant, but I'm glad that they are trying and giving that community a little taste of Taiwan. 

Verdict: I would go back to try their other dish. Not a lot on the menu which then they can focus more on their specialities. Perhaps only if I'm in that area again. 

Improvement - perhaps play Taiwanese music instead of loud English songs. For a small place, the music was quite loud for lunch time.
