6t7U64hS_cBZtVKSP-q5Ww Definitely the place to avoid at t1 international gate. Service was really bad. Servers just ignored customer. I was expecting the food could taste better than average Chinese restaurant food because of the name. I was totally wrong. The beef noodle taste much worse than $8 noodle from China town.
