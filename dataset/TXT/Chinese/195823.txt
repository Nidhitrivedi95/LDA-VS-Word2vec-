ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg I have never been to this Congee Queen's location till now.

Menu is identical to the other Congee Queen's location up in Markham which I frequent.

The deco though is a little outdated and in need for some renovation.

We ordered a Congee and a Noodle to share which were both really good and the portion was generous.

Good price and opens till 12:00 am. A great place for a late night snack!
