nd3FuTBL1ezKFmfhLmJY2w The all you can eat buffet here is pretty standard and nothing special but they also have a Chinese Fondue, and it's brilliant! I was in once and saw a couple with a gas ring on their table with a big pot of soup on it and lots of raw food and asked what it was. The first time we went we werent sure how it worked but we were put in the back room where it was full of people eating the Fondue. We were asked to choose two soup bases and given a laminated menu and a pen to mark down what raw ingredients we wanted, there's prawns, squid, thinly sliced meats, noodles, Chinese vegetables and lot's more. You then get the gas ring put on your table and the big pot that's divided in two for the two soups and you get your ingredients and put them in the soup and cook them at your table. There's a table to the side with lots of ingredients to make dipping sauces, soy sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, garlic, chilli sauce etc. It's good fun and once you master the art of mixing a dipping sauce that doesnt blow your head off or is too salty then it's really tasty. I would definitely recommend this, just ask for the Chinese Fondue when you go in or reserve a table. Oh, and it's only £10 each!
