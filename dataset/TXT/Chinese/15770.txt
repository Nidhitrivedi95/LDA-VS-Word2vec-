3Ru1_F8GoUcV-QwhX378hA I was once again tricked by the claim that it was like new york style Chinese food not even close I don't think they could even  pass for  Chinese food by itself I had lunch there today at 12:30 2 other people in the restaurant that should have been my first clue I ordered BBQ ribs They almost ripped out my teeth trying to chew on the meat it was smothered in store bought BBQ sauce definitely not Asian style next I had 1 pork egg roll it tasted like a frozen type you get in a super market last but not least i tried the shrimp toast  it was a greasy over cooked piece of i don't know what  This is my first review i usually never waste my time complaining but I needed to get the word out I love food and I work hard for my money and this place not only wasted my money and time i had to go and have lunch after this place because it was horrible and as I'm writing this about 2 hours after my experience my stomach is doing back flips i hope i make it threw the night without puking
