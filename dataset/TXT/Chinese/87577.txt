I don't have to drive so far to the East Valley for good Chinese comfort food. My favorite is the brisket beef hot pot. When the wait staff serves it on the table it sizzles and you can smell the anise, cinnamon aroma from the sauce. When I bite into the beef it melts in my mouth. Just by the meal itself and of course rice is filling. There are also dishes that are unique such as beef and bitter melon chow fun. I liked the taste of bitter melon because I grew up eating it. This is a restaurant to try something new and get out of the same old taste of American Chinese food. Be bold and expand you're taste buds! 

The restaurant is only open for certain times and days. Make sure to call first. The waitstaff are friendly and they also have an American Chinese menu available.
