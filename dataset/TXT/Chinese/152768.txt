The steamed dumplings are delicious little pasta pockets of soup and hearty to. A plate of 5 dumplings will stuff you like a thanksgiving turkey. The rest of the whitey-Chinese food is also awesome even though not authentic. Shanghai noodles are a meal and a half, as with every other meal. The crispy beef isn't a huge nugget of breading with a tiny bit of meat, you can see the meat through the breading and they are fresh and tasty. I've been there more than a few times and never regret my meal. 

The restaurant looks spartan; decoration is not urgency here. Just tables, a giant screen TV playing Chinese television. Both menus are flavour explosions, service is OK, delivery is speedy. Local Chinese take-out acquisition complete.
