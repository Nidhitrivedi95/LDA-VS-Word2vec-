OnGPegQGuQ5_uuFLvezvKw I've been going to Shun Lee Palace for more than 20 years.  Its just a few blocks from my grandmothers house and she was always a fan.  The place was purchased by new owners a couple of years ago and while the food is still pretty good, the service is...spotty at best.  I think they try to make due with fewer servers than they should have so once you place your order, you never see them until they drop off your food and then you are on your own again until the check comes.  If something is wrong or if you need something extra (more to drink, etc.)...too bad.
