X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg What a joke.. My friend came from out of country visiting and had made extra efforts to get his international license to carry around with him.. And apparently that's enough for proof of identity for this club. He had that plus credit cards that match the name but no.. they want him to bring his passport?? Really?? To the club?? And if it gets lost at the club.. Are they going to replace it? Smh.. Never again.
