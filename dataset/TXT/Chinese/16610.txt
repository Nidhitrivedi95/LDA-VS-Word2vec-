We ordered crab Rangoon which seemed to be handmade. They were flaky and yummy. Our main meal was general tso chicken and egg fried rice. The general tso was perfect; crispy and lightly battered, delicious sauce, good white pieces of chicken - no mystery meat or chewy grizzle pieces in sight. The rice was fresh and delicious. 

Lastly, the owner, Gary, is so friendly and upbeat. All around a five star experience. Bomb!
