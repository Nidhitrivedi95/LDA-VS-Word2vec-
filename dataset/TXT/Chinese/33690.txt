A6lKCuTrDSJ_eFKyumZCJQ Yummy Chinese eats!!

I ate here twice on my recent trip to the area and loved the food. This is located inside the *Silverton Casino* next to Starbucks and the food is fresh and made to order.

What I ordered:
-Salt and Pepper Tofu.. plentiful
-Honey Walnut Shrimp.. scrumptious
-WUHU Fried Rice.. yum!
-Mandarin Noodles.. mMmmM
-Salt and Pepper Pork Chop.. pretty good
-Half Soy Braised Chicken..delish

The food was well portioned with good pricing. Each item I tried did not disappoint as it was savory and hit the spot. They have three sauces for dipping at the table. The service is pretty good and it's a casual restaurant where you pay up front with the cashier, seat yourself, and they deliver your food. I dined in here and also did take out here.. both times were tasty and I would give this place 4 Stars.~
