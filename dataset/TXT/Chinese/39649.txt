aWu1homxB6lciXU6-ZlpSQ Known about this Stinky Tofu place for a long time. Was stopping by Chris Jerk's and got pulled it by a friend.

Got a small order of Stinky Tofu take-out for about $5 and change. 

Tofu had good texture, not completely deep-fried and was juicy.

I think the sauce needs some work, not spicy or smelly enough..

4 stars because it's still one of the best in the  neighbourhood.
