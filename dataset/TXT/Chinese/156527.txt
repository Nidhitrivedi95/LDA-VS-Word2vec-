trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ Tuesday special tower is not recommended, 1 dozen of tiny oysters, 2 crab legs (with black dots, maybe it's normal), 4 shrimps and 3 slice of, well, half roasted salmons. Oysters are fresh but they are really small, about tea spoon size, crab legs are ok but doesn't look very good, salmons taste a little bit bad, shrimps are great. I thought this special tower is same as the $68 normal one, and if you saw the picture of $68 tower and decide to try a discounted one on Tuesday, please NO. Everything else is ok level.
