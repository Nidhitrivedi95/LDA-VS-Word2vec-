Make reservations because many people are coming for the special pricing 

We ordered one of the largest lobsters I'd ever seen. A single 12 lb monster of a lobster. The claw itself was larger than 2 hands put together. Even though the lobster was so large and so old it still had the same taste and texture of smaller lobsters. However, if I were able to turn back time I would have order two 6 lb lobsters to get more tail meat.

Deep fried salted eel $22.95 - decent but I would rather have fried eel with a sweet honey sauce or Chinese XO sauce (3 stars).

Sweet and sour pork was nice and crunchy but not overly hard and not overly battered (4 stars).

Beef sirloin was done very well with the caramelized onions but portion was small (4 stars).

Service was a bit slow because of how busy they were.
