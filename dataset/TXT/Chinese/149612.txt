sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg If I was only judging on food I would give them 3 stars. 

But they are just really nice and charismatic people and they asked for feedback. I love when they want to improve.

I ordered the beef udon. I was warned it was salty. Man was it salty. Black bean sauce and oyster sauce... I would maybe say tone it down with some beef broth or utilize, dare I say, sugar to balance out the flavor. But the udon noodle texture was on point. Not too chewy, not overly starchy. 

Hubby had the Orange chicken. He loves orange chicken and fried rice together but the rice felt was not complimenting the chicken. 

The atmosphere. Clean and orderly no complaints. 

What would I change? Tenderizing beef too long. It's weird when you don't have to chew your meat.
