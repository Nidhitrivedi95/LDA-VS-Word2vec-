We ordered the lemon grass chicken, it was pretty good.

I have read from previous reviews that non Asians are treated a bit 'differently'. They made us sit at the centre communal table shared by another non Asian family. Could be just a coincidence.

They only accept cash and literally force a tip which I found upsetting. 

I also found them expensive. We spent $52 for a dimsum, soup and 2 mains. 

Don't think I will go again.
