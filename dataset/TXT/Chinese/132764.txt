prHnRsgY-PuM7vxe8-RwEA I also didn't read the reviews before we ate here. Big mistake. I don't know why they still re-fry their chicken after all these negative reviews about how uneatable it is when they do this. The owner obviously doesn't care about their food quality. We couldn't eat the orange chicken. We returned it after one bite (we dined in).
