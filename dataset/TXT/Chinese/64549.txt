E8ugJa02FVCgfnjqV817iw My friend took me here for my first experience with pho. He had shrimp spring rolls and egg drop soup. There were various condiments on the table - soy sauce, hot sauce, sriracha, etc. and he went to town with those in his soup. And oh my god the soup bowls here are massive! They were bigger than my head! I ordered pho that came with sliced beef of various doneness and rice noodles. The broth and the noodles were delicious. I didn't care for any of the veggies that I could have added - bean sprouts, jalepeno, lime, etc. The beef was good but I didn't like that there was an edge of fat on many of the pieces. Had they trimmed that off, it would have been a 4-star experience.
