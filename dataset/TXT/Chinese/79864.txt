gnkyosoOepBUqog7iDdggQ Really nice noodle house ... you get to pick the soup base followed by noodle type and what toppings you want.
We got the laksa base With sliced beef and cuttlefish balls ... and the pork Katsu rice bowl ... plus the chicken wings side /Vietnamese fried roll and pork dumplings.  It was all good but we ended up taking home the wings since we couldn't finish it. The soup and rice dish comes with a drink as well .. we didn't upgrade our drink I went with the lemon and honey and my guy got the ovaltine! Really nice place will definitely go back !
