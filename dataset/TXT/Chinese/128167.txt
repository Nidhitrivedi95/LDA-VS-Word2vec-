pFg0ZuTVVZMZpANZXI0LtA Yuck.  Just yuck.  Seems hard to mess up 'run of the mill' pre-prepared Chinese food... but somehow this place managed to get it done.  Overly fried, drenched in breading, dry fried rice, and very weird and awkward feel when you walk in to pick up your food.  Go somewhere else.
