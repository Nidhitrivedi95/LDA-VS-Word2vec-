uFNM9ICvZN0TEbURIpiIDQ I am on vacation in Georgia and I craved some Chinese and went out to be utterly disappointed.  On the plus side it really made me thankful and homesick for Chinese Dumplings which is located down the street from where I live in Toronto.  I realized that I hadn't written a review for Chinese Dumplings even though I've eaten in at least twice and ordered take out countless times.  

My favorite dish here is Szechuan Beef.  Always crispy, spicy, fresh and always delish!  Seriously can't go wrong with it.  Their take out portions are just as amazing as dining in and I'm never disappointed.  Another dish we tend to get is the Shrimp fried rice - it's done just right!  The hot & sour soup is okay, I wish they would improve on it and fancy it up with some little shrimps and I felt that the green peas were a little weird in it. One time we got the cold kelp dish which is offered on a sign when you dine in and loved it.  It was only a couple dollars for a big plate of it and it went well as a side with the hot & sour soup to start.  

Really happy with this place - it's authentic Chinese and super good!
