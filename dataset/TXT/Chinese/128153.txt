pFA2l8MG7hFTmwc6zjDgtA This is not my first visit to this store; been here many a time!  By the time I've ordered and someone finally decides to come to the register to ask about drinks, my food is cold from the excessive air coming out of the vents right by the cash register!  This "cold food scenario is not the first time; as a matter of fact, it's every time!  On top of cold food, this particular day a woman walks in to purchase gift cards, steps in line in front of us and the cashier gal had to help her first as our food is getting colder by the minute!
We did ask one of the employees to lower the A/C and she was kind enough to do so!
Great food as usual though!

After reading the additional postings, it is clear that this store has no regard for it's customers or the quality of food or employees!  Maybe Corporate should have a talk with this franchiser!  Hit the franchise owner in the pocketbook by trying to make a wrong into a right!  Give that wronged customer a freebie!
And, I was there again this past Thursday; low and behold, my Mothers and my food was Luke warm when we sat down to eat and cold within minutes!  
Way to go Panda!  In my opinion (as a customer), stop trying to appease with "your talks to Corporate ", it's not working!  You're going to lose customers that will find someplace else to spend their hard earned dollars!
Shame on you!
