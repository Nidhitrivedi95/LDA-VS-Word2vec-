uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw my friend introduced my to this place tonight. i was really hungry after a long day of driving and im told this place is open 24/7 but dont' quote me on that.
the noodles are hand made, you can see them stretching, shaving, swinging, and whatever it is that they do with the noodles.

point is, the noodles are made fresh and are delicious. i ordered the sliced noodles beef brisket and it was bomb. i really like it, the beef was nice and tender and didn't get stuck in my teeth. the soup was delicious. and the noodles were cooked to perfection. based on just the food, i'm definitely coming back.
