dgIrIkCBiHtAHZ86_-awFQ Grand Lake has been in the New Kennedy Square for as long as I can remember. Definitely one of the first establishments in the plaza, and it has consistently maintained a loyal clientele.

I've been here a few times in my life, although ever since I joined Yelp I've never came back to dine here until recently. Came here for dim sum, and it was nice that they still use a dim sum cart system (although you can order from the menu if you're in a rush).

Dim sum here in general is okay. I'd say if this was 10-15 years ago it would be one of the best dim sum restaurants in Markham, but times have changed and I've definitely dined in better places. Their prices here, however, are quite good, especially the early bird discounts.

Service is poor if you're not a regular, my table was largely ignored and it seems the employees kept breaking into conversations with tables that were regulars. I don't mind having conversations and all that, but at least do your work and provide hospitality to everyone else...

I wouldn't say no to coming back, however as I stated there's better dim sum restaurants out there now.
