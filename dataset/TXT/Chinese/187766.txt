yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Nice and clean spot for a good bowl of Pho.  Fried egg rolls were great too.  The only reason I didn't enjoy the experience 100%, and this was really not a fault of the restaurant, was because of the customers next to us.  As soon as their food arrived, they both started playing some video/TV shows on their phones.  Yes, two phones!  Each person had his/her phone out and was watching something on the phone.  It was the weirdest thing to see and annoying to hear.

We had Vietnamese coffee to go after we finished our meal.  It was quite strong and delicious.
