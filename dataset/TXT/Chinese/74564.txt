fRRgBZGxQ-BeAlJTS4JaWw My rating is mostly for the service, which was incredibly friendly :).  However the way the food is setup is like a buffet style but they dish it out for you is cheesy and cafeteria like.  And, as always with that style, you're never really sure how long that food has been sitting there.  We had the teriyaki chicken with white rice and it looked delicious but the sauce was so unbelievably plain that it was not good at all.  Egg rolls were average.  Maybe if they have something like General Tsao's (which I didn't see on the menu) I would try it.
