Rz2LLfRYb35cjZovwITOGg WORST Pad Thai I have ever had (why even offer it when it's this bad???). My mistake, straying from China Bistro but they were closed (it was Monday) and I was "desperate."

The reason I don't give it one star is that my husband and I went there once before for lunch and thought the sushi was okay and the service was good. Can't really comment on the service for the Pad Thai since my husband called it in and picked it up.
