2UaMR7lOJ3IcXizaDpv7KA Bangkok 9 is easily one of the best restauraunts in the state. My regulars are the Tom Kha soup, the cream cheese rangoons, and the Yum Nua salad (medium spice.)
It's a hidden gem, and I will be coming back like I have been for the last 3 years. =) five stars for great food, cozy atmosphere, and best service possible!!
