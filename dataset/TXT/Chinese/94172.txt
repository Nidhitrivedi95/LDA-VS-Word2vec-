JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A Fantastic! How often can we say in Arizona that we have a Korean restaurant open until 2am?!? Not only is that great, but to top it off, the food was excellent. My girlfriend had the squid stir fry which they cut the squid the cross pattern which allowed it to stay soft, and I had the kimchi soup, which was fantastic as well. 

It's a bit far from where I live, but I would love to give it another try when I'm near this area of town!
