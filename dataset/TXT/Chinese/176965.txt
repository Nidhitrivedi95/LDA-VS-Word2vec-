WTuBrN0z2h7xvTaP7eN_XA We came here as table of 13 on a Sunday night. We were given a room at the back which was nice.

My initial reaction was that the plates and bowls were very dirty. There were food remnants on almost everything and several wine glasses had lipstick on it.

Our first few dishes came back to back and were decent. We changed our fish dish to deep fried fish and filets.
It arrived overcooked and cold.. Quite a disappointment.

The break between our main courses and the rice/noodles was a 50minute wait and we had to remind them we were still waiting on it. Our server was not even aware we had both rice and noodles.. We had to pull out the menu and show her.

Another main issue aside from the cleanliness is that there were many, many fruit flies/tiny mosquitoes that were hovering our table the entire night. I could point out at least 5 at one time.. Literally gave me goosebumps.

We also added two order of sweet and sour pork on top of our set menu meal at the beginning but this never came.. Their loss. 

Overall our server for the night was quite attentive but sad to say I will not be coming back.
