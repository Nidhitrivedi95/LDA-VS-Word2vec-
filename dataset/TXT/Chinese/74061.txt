The food is ordered off the menu, but they also have servers that come around with items occasionally. Everything that came to the table was lukewarm edging the point where it was almost cold. However, the taste of everything was good. The vegetable dumpling was piping hot though! 

The restaurant is huge and the quality of the dim sum isn't bad. I definitely prefer it to Emerald and would come back again if I was desperate for some dim sum. 

Note: don't expect service to be phenomenal, it took a long time for some dishes to come out.
