AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw Substandard compared to their other location City Hollywood.  Waitress forgot to enter my order and was looking for someone to blame for her mistake.  Took an hour an a half to get my lunch.  2 rounds of people had come and gone before I got my food.  New waitresses (not the ones that got transferred over) need a whole lot of training before they should even be on the floor.

Temperature of the food was not hot enough and the rice had actually cooled down to room temperature.

I also caught the lady at the bar that makes all their beverages taste test a customer's cup of (I assume milk tea), before putting it on a tray for a waitress to bring to a customer.  Unacceptable.

I do not recommend anyone going to this place.
