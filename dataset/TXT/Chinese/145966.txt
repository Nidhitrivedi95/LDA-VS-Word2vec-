S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A What a great little find.

We had flat fried noodle with chicken (best thing of the night)
spicy thick beef noodle, tasty
You choy with oyster sauce, very tasty
green beans, very yummy
Pan friend buns, also delicious

I really enjoyed my meal.
they hand make every noodle to order

I typically don't care for fresh noodles because they have a "raw egg taste," to me, but this place had fantastic noodles.

I'm excited to go back and try one of the noodle soups.
