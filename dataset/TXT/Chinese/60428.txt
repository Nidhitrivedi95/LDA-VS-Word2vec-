DncR06kFZ_u2O4NlbPPE4w I only gave this place 3 stars due to a couple of reasons. First the prices are pretty steep around $10 or so for one meal. Second the food quality is mediocre. Expected more fresh taste, home made flavors from the place being a small facility. At this visit we tried the sizzling rice soup, it is large enough for 2 and the price about $10. The broth was bland adding the hot sauce made a difference. We also had Kung pao chicken and chow mein with beef. The noodles were dry and needed more flavorful sauce. The meat was ok. Will probably not g back, will probably not go back.
