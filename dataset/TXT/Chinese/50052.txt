Cdywb13_07M1_g3U85VKTA We went for their lunch buffet, which has a limited amount of food but it's all the best of the buffet choices and the price is unbeatable.  I loved their fried rice and chow mein, could not get enough of their orange chicken, chicken wings and chicken skewers.  Everything I tried was really good.  Like others have said, the service kinda sucks, the waitress was kinda rude when we got in because a big crowd had entered right behind us but she did get nicer throughout the meal.  The desserts section of the buffet was definitely lacking as well.  If you are looking for extremely well priced lunch buffet of great Chinese staples, this is the place.
