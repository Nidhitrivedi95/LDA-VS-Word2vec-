g7bVip6ncXJC5xzkQMjohQ Terrible wait  45 minutes
we walked out before the main dish was even ready after waiting 45 mins.with no entree.
2 people handling the whole place-ridiculous-even they having to handle phone and handle the cash.
And they said they were not understaffed.
place is nice-sort of cheap chique.
Back to the Golden Turtle for us and tearing up my $10 WagJag-this place was too irritating-there is enough good competition ,even more reasonably priced,to be able to visit.
