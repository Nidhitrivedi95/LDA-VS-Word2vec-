cykzJbkgweJvZsvkrHMR7g I came in on a Thursday at 11 for lunch. Service was horrible. The main guy seemed out of it and took about 7 minutes to get me water and take my order. Then I got half of the lunch special about 10 minutes later. I was missing the soup and egg roll. The waiter never came back to check despite asking for the check when I got the food. I finally had to go up to the counter because I needed to be back for work and the server had never come back. They did give me a discount which is good
Food wise - not bad. I had the shrimp with veggies and was pleased. The fried rice was soaked in soy sauce and wasn't my favorite.
The Thai tea - the main thing I came for was horrible. It was WAY too sweet and they had no boba. 
Perhaps I went too early. I would try this place again but would probably call in my order and carry out.
I hoping their food continues to be decent so I have a good Asian place near me but I don't know I they'll be worth the hassle and the wait.
