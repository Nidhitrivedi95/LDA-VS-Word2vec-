nQ9603jcJ_Nk9WBxvSFH_Q For take out Chinese food this place is pretty good 
Eating there is not as good for some reason 
Food is way too hot!
Take it home or sit around while it cools off a little!
Fried rice could be better lacks taste
But if in the area this my favorite place to take home Chinese 
General Tso's shrimp is one of my preferred meals
