kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA OHHH Hakkasan, why did you have to close in Beverly HIlls last year? Now, I have to fly all the way to Vegas, just to get your DUCK SALAD! YES!!! I did, last month I came to see Pitbull and since the concert ended late and it takes 10 miles to get from one hotel to the other, it's pretty pathetic when you are running to get to your restaurant, not the club at 11:00 PM. and the cutesy hostess tells you " Sorry, we're no longer serving food at the bar" My heart just dropped and I asked again.. " so, your not going to serve me a duck salad?" NOPE.. You can go eat at Wolfgang Pucks, which serves food till 4:00 AM. 
I decided to take my weekend away, which was a Monday & Tuesday with my schedule to fly to Vegas and had the taxi driver drop me off at MGM. Suitcase in all, Yes, I was there at 5:00 P.M. when they open and sat at the bar alone, My latest new drink, the HAAKATINI was by far one of the best cocktails I have ever had. So, took a snap shot of the menu, so I can have my LA bartender replicate it. HA!!!!! Got a bit daring and got the noodles too, OMG!!! I hate mushrooms, but the flavor of the noodles were almost a smokey taste. Vegas isn't my favorite place to unwind, but they do have plenty of amazing dining choices now and since I don't gamble, it's better for me to spend the money on amazing food!
