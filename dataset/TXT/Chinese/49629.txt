CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Late flight & needed some food while staying at Bellagio...1AM, ordered the calamari (gross, frozen, over-breaded--any cheap bar would have these), pad thai was unlike any I've ever had--meaning NOT pad thai in any way, shape, or form. The flavor was OK, but not sure what it really was. Hubby had shrimp fried rice that had exactly 2 small prawns & dry, flavorless rice. Would not recommend unless you have no other options. The snack bar place would have been way better.
