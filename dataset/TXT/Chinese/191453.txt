yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A This location just opened in June and I finally stopped in last night with friends to check it out.  SO glad we did!  There were six of us so I had the opportunity to try a bit of everything!  Such a great menu and I couldn't find a dish on our table that wasn't awesome!  A bit pricey, but well worth it!
