Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Definitely a must try. The manchurian Chili chicken was amazing. Rice dishes were good.  Don't go for the atmosphere, go for the food.   I had first went here with a Groupon, but going back without any discount was still worth it.  Food quality is good and price is very reasonable.
