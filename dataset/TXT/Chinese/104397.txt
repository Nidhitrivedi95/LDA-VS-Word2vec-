Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg I worked at Planet Hollywood for four years, so I ate here at least three or four times a month, and every time it was great. I really never noticed a markup from other Changs that are located off of the strip. The noodles, rice, and egg drop soup are all fantastic, whether eating at the bar or at a table. Service is quick and good, I would definitely recommend... especially compared to some of the other insanely priced placed to eat on Las Vegas Blvd.
