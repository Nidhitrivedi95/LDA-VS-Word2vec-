yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA BEST PLACE TO GET HANGOVER PHO, HANDS DOWN!

The delicious beef broth, light rice noodles, and strips of beef are sooooo delicious. Also, I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to get seated here. Not only is this place open till the wee hours of night, long after you've consumed multiple shots of alcohol and danced your booty off, but there's nothing better to cure a typical Vegas hangover than some MORNING-AFTER PHO!! I know there's now places to get pho on the Strip, but Pho Kim Long tastes authentic and you can get a decent meal for under 10 bucks. 

I love this place. And it's a cult favorite. Literally every time I go I unintentionally run into someone I either know from 1) my sorority, 2) Los Angeles, or 3) other random people.

Virtually everyone who's a Vegas regular knows about this place and has been here.

And FYI - I have also had pho here when I was NOT drunk, and enjoyed it!

Recently they've had a restaurant makeover, making the place more classy. Yes, you can expect to see people there of all ages - from seniors, to children, to under dressed club hos.

Parking is easy as it is located in a small Asian strip mall. It's also about a 10-15 minute drive from the Strip, which is not exactly pedestrian friendly but definitely worth the trip if you have a car.
