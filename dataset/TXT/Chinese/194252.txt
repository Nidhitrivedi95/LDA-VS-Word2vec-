zEd3Ex_k3vHiBbBPWRrO7Q I sent my son in to pick up dinner and they charged us twice but claimed the charges never went through. My bank app showed 2 separate transactions. I called and spoke to 3 different people and had my son show the bank app showing that they charged us twice. Then they put someone named Daniel on the phone and he claimed that there was no way we got charged because a receipt didn't print. He was extremely rude and condescending. Even laughed at me on the phone and said that this wouldn't have happened if there was money on the card. Do not go to this Panda! I wish I would've read the previous YELP reviews regarding this location. They have several reviews regarding their horrible service there. They could've made this right but instead they chose to humiliate my son and demean me over the phone. Totally unacceptable!!
