jIujTHt4Mr-ygwpBDGHmFg This is the worst Chinese-American 'food' that I have had in a long time.  Since I'd never had their food before, I went with a safe dish: General Tso's chicken.  It was wholly inedible.  The chicken was chewy, and the sauce that came with it seemed to be a mixture of corn syrup and soy sauce.  I don't recall if there was garlic or ginger in it.  All I remember is how horrible the food was.  And it was.  I'm losing my appetite just by recalling my experience.  *shudder*
