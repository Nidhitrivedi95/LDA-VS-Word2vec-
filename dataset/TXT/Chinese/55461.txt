cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg The kung pow 3 seas and green bean with pork were excellent.  The orange peel beef and Thai spicy basil chicken were also very good, as was the hot and sour soup.  Based on the food along, George and Son's would be a full 5 stars.

The service was only OK.  The waiter did a fine job, but some of the other service staff were not as attentive and did not fully support the waiter.  This brings the overall rating to 4 stars only to leave a fair comparison to truly best in class restaraunts.

The decor and atmosphere were appropriate for the price range and had a very comfortable feel.

I would recommend George and Son's to friends visiting the Scottsdale Area.
