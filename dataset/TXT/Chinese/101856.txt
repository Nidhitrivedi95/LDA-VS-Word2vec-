KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA This is our go to place for any major events or as well just a gathering. I had reviewed them before but considering their consistency in quality and service, I am reviewing again. Food is great and truly authentic Indian taste. Service is top notch always and very friendly staff. This is coming after about 6+ visits on different occasions. They have nice ambience with bar and a big screen along with musical nights on some weekends. 

This will be mine and our group of friends go to place whenever we crave Indian food. Highly recommended.
