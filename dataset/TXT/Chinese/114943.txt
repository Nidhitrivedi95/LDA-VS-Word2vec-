myw0csRck6XG4w5Z-EFyqg How did I not know about this place?!!  Family owned and operated, the food is fresh and delicious. Don't be shy - ask for recommendations. We were told that the egg drop soup, which is really tasty, is better with green onions and chili. The potstickers are divine, and the dipping sauce is perfect. We had the chicken dragon bowl - too spicy for me, but the chicken was super tender. We also had the Shanghai Noodles, a great alternative to fried rice or Lo mein. The flavor was great, and there was no skimping on ingredients. 

I'm a little far for their delivery service, which is disappointing but probably for the best as I can see eating their food frequently.
