kLiMrnkcV_dfVpejfRlhSg I found myself at Sang's Great Food on Spadina on Saturday night between 1230 and 0100 with Michael after we had had one sidecar too many at Pete's birthday party.  No, you don't know these people but that's the story about how I ended up eating here.  They do not have dumplings, which broke Michael's heart.

The good:
There was a dinner special for $8.50.  You have to ask for it.  Even in my late-night-chinese-food state I remembered the words eight dollars and fifty cents from the sign outside when they gave us the regular price menus.  Much to the waiters dissatisfaction, he went back to get us the special menus.  $8.50 buys you: soup (choice of 4 - hot and sour was pretty good!) spring roll and choice of entree (choice of MANY).  

The bad:
Ha, the food is the bad.  It wasn't terrible-bad but it certainly wasn't the best.  It may have been the best at 1am actually.  But I would never eat here before I went drinking - only after.

The weird-and-awesome:
The $8.50 dinner menu comes with a full FAMILY SIZED entree.  There was NO way we could have eaten all the food we were presented with for $17.00.

Would I go here again?  Yes.  Would I go here again before 1am?  Not a chance in hell.
