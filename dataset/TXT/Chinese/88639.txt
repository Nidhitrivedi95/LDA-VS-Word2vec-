i_t_UJTSScw4srpb8aHUiw This place is a Hong Kong style cafe with some tranditional southern chinese dinner. 

This place runs a long time, from breakfast which serve a trandition Hong Kong style western breakfast. Then you get the Hong Kong cafe lunch. Bake rice, noodle soup etc. Then for dinner, it's a Chinese restaurant with dishes. 

This time, I stop by for the high tea. And got the satay beef on rice noodle. The food is not too bad, passable. The dish is quite large for $7. But man, the service sucks. You are almost guarantee to share a table if you are there with 1 other. They don't have too many small table. Then they don't listen to any of the ordering. No patient at all. When I wave them over to add order, they just came by with the bill. And the sharing table can be more organize. Like, please take a look at the table to see which dish goes where and which bill goes where. Like don't ask the customer, they should know

Overall, it's a place to eat. That's it. Service is not there so don't expect anything.
