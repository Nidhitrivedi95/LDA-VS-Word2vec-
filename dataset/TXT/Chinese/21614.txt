6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q Uhhhh! I knew why it is cheaper than other restaurants, cauz they got a rude cashier waitress. I ordered a pick up and wait 1 hour( which she said 30minutes). When I ask if my order is ready, she shouted at me?! 
And the reason she yelled at me is "I'm too busy". Then I ask her to apologize, she did but then ask her manager to tell me she's pregnant(well I don't know if it's true since I'm not an X-ray)
 I know a pregnant is innocent and tough, but can u yell at others who you not even know as a "pregnant "? I wondering will you tell your customers u r still a pregnant after u yell at them in 1 year.
