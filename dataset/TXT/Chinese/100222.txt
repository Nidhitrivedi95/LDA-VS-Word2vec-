jyZqmlaziZKtPv8AVTzciw I love the run down family ran hole in the walls; they usually make some of the best food around, while Diamond's isn't the best around, its certainly solid authentic style Chinese cooking. Look around, you'll probably be the only non-ethnic diner in the place which is a very good sign. On our visit the place was busy with Chinese and Asian customers, Id say they are far more discerning than most and the harshest critics if it's horrible. 

They do offer the American style dishes I strongly recommend that you not even look at that menu. So first things first, ask for the Chinese/Vietnamese menu, this is where Diamond's really shines. On the back page of the menu you'll find full family style meals complete and affordable. We ended up ordering the #3 which was a huge selection of varied dishes. Dry Fried Rice Noodle with Beef, Half Roast Duck, Half Crispy Chicken, Lobster with Ginger and Onion, Whole Steamed Fish, Subgun Tofu and Chinese Broccoli with Beef, all for under $54! I felt like we were at some sort of celebration as each dish emerged from the kitchen. All the dishes were well prepared and tasty. They steamed fish as well as the lobster came right out of the tanks in the front of the restaurant, talk about fresh!

I only have a couple of gripes. I love soda pop pairings with Chinese food, the carbonation cuts through some of the oilier flavors and leave you ready to eat more. While Diamonds does serve pop, they serve it from a warm can which then poured over ice waters down the sought after carbonation. My other problem is their use of oil on some dishes. The steamed fish was cooked perfectly but then they cover it in this oily sauce that lacked flavor and simply did not add to the dish what-so-ever. If you order the fish, ask for them to not use oil in the sauce. 

With so many different real deal Chinese dishes to chose from, why even both with sweet and sour pork?
