D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Well Let me start off by saying You will not be disappointed! I came in for lunch HUGE fan of Thai food so what the heck it's close to where I am. Let's try and This place gets 5 stars because the food was that good! I had Crab Rangoon to start! One of the best I must add I've ever tasted. So fresh, flavorful and that dipping sauce that goes with it! Fantastic....Next I had the Pad See Ew with Chicken/ Shrimp Combination. Yesssss! It was Amazing! Again the flavors are there my ingredients were fresh and I loved every minute I was there! Last but not least I had to get dessert to go there was no way I could fit it in but I had to have they had a few things I wanted to try but I took the deep fried banana fitters home with ice cream and some sauce. Let's just say this place will not disappoint. Everything I tried down to the Iced Coffee almost forgot to mention that was Outstanding. Thank you Team and staff!
