O0zyXuEw_aojAK5ILW6WJA Ok honestly, this is a hidden gem, and the best northern chinese food you'll find in York region area. Fresh delicious dumplings, noodles, side dishes, can't really go wrong on most things on the menu. 

Price wise, amazing, don't know how they do it. 15 dumplings for $4.99, and they taste better than most of the other more expensive places. 

Decor is typical chinese place, but honestly, I'm not gonna rate it on decor, because the price is beyond fair and food is AWESOME. 

Definitely help spread the word about this place as they don't seem to get a lot of traffic yet, would be a shame if they closed down!
