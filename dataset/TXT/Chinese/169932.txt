Vuk8Xn0RmP1o88QqfB75qg 2.5 stars! I've been here twice and the first time was better, but the second time it seemed as though their quality went down a bit. Their prices are very expensive for the small portions you get, particularly with the fried squid tentacles. I haven't tried their well-known buns with "faces" on them, but they don't really seem all that appetizing or special. The servers speak some English and the place looked clean with modern plates and tea cups. Never been here for dinner so I cannot comment on that.
