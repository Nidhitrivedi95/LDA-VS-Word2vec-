zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ It was alright. My expectations were really high, considering all of the 4-5 star reviews they got on here. To their defense, I probably just ordered the wrong thing. I got the Thai Curry because I've been craving it for a while and I was surprised to see that they had it there, and for really inexpensive too (about $6), but when it came out it tasted so bland. There was almost no flavor to it and absolutely no spice. The best way I could describe it to my boyfriend was, its like when you're sick and your tastebuds can't taste anything.
And to make matters worse, the lady totally forgot to give me my Thai Milk Tea that I ordered lol.
My boyfriend, on the other hand, loved his food. He ordered the charbroiled pork chop and a side of egg rolls. The only negative thing he could say about it was the portion size was super small compared to other pho places like Pho So 1, Pho Kim Long, Pho Mailan etc.
If it weren't for how clean the restaurant aS and how welcoming and attentive the staff was, I'd probably give this review lower than 3 stars. 
Not saying I wouldn't go back though. If my boyfriend loved it and 13 other people on Yelp love it too, then I'm sure I just ordered the wrong thing lol.
