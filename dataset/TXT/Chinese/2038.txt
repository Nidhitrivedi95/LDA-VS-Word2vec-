-XH3-e3jDVdjHJq7GfNY7w Bang for your buck! Love this place, as good if not better than other Vietnamese places in town, except so much more closer to campus than any of them. Their menu is simple but so far everything I've tried was good. And at a really really great price! big bowl of pho or vermicelli costs only $7. Their banh mis are also pretty good.
