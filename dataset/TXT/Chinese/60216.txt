DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ The service was very good, ordered food and it was delivered to the table with in 10 minutes. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and it came with two scoops of rice. It was very good and the serving sizes where very reasonable. It's definitely a place I would recommend to anyone and yes I will be going back again.
