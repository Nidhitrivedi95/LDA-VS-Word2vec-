_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA we ate here for our last day in vegas. everyone was hung over and we needed some soup to make us feel better. i ordered the fire chicken wings which weren't spicy at all. but it wasn't bad. the dim sum was yummy because they had a good amount of shrimp inside. the duck noodle soup thing was ok. the duck was good. hot and sour soup- a bit spicy, too much pepper. and the chrysanthemum iced tea was delish.
