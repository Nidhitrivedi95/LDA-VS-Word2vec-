nV8mDMin6c964MgjK6JZgg Love the food here! Hot, flavorful and fresh every time. Haven't been disappointed yet for dinner. In the summer they do a house dessert that has coconut milk, grass jelly, tapioca, red  bean and Mung bean..... Have no idea what it's called but it's served cold and it's so good. Service is very quick and actually kind of pleasant considering customer service isn't really a priority at Chinese restaurants.
