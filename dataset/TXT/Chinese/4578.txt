_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w As a lover of seafood we made sure to order the lobster HK style tower which definitely was worth the wait and the cost. The fried garlic was a generous portion with the fried fish to add to the crunch!! Puts any other restaurant with seafood to shame. Will be back for more!!!
