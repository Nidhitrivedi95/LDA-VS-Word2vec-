U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q I went here back on November of 2015, tried to post my feedback but it didn't work so attempted a few times, same result. Today I'm trying again since it was sitting in my draft inbox. This place is overrated. I should of stick to Spring Mt Road if I wanted real authentic hot pot aka shabu shabu soup.

I wanted soup so I figured I check out Groupon of there were good deals or recommendation. Long behold this popped up. Pretty decent, value at $50 for $25. Deal! Being that it's hidden in Ceasars palace it might be good right?

Walked in, took us a few minutes to find it. Don't get wrong the place is beautiful! Tanks of gold fishes all around. So we sat down, dinner time, wasn't that busy. So I attempted to order this hot pot meat (Beef, comes with cabbage, tofu, enoki mushrooms, spinach, hand pull noodle and clear noodle.) At first the waiter advise me he was sorry, apparently you need to rsvp that since it takes the cook longer to prep it then later nicely said we will do it for you. The soup came out scorching hot! Had the meats, veggies and super red broth. Really it's the way I like it. I put in the meat for it to cook then the veggies and here I go scooping it into the little bowl. Oh my!! The flavor! What the heck is this??? There's no flavor and super oily not to mention it's plain for the Sichuan Style which is their hottest broth. Basically paid $50 extra on top of what I paid for Groupon total of $120! Hmmm should have ate elsewhere for that much. Tired it once....no thank you. 

I do have photos of the place but that was back 2015. The place looks stunning but as for the food. It's not that good (only speaking of the soup I had). Came out unsatisfied for $120 meal. Service was okay. I felt like the waiter was more attentive if you're not Asian since they think they don't tip well.
