uFiGYsAWSLpmVIMgDgN9mA Horrible experience at this place today. They messed up our meal, severed our orders to the wrong table twice! We were not eating what we order because they served to wrong table and ate by that table. The plate for steam fish is huge but the fish is a small size fish, they don't have to use a such big plate! LoL.  Also, there is one order of steam item was raw!! Even the waitress said she must bring back to the kitchen, seriously? Steam is the basic cooking skill.
