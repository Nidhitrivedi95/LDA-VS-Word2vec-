RAKSBqeNb-p_ZABwAWH_jA Best little sushi secret in Charlotte.  Hidden away in an old Pizza Hut building they have some of the best quality sushi selections around.  I only live 5-7 minutes from Koishi but can honestly say it is as good as some of the top Sushi restaurants in LA, NY, and Chicago.  I had the spicy Salmon roll and some tuna nigiri and the quality of fish is consistently good.  Moderately priced and the service is always good. Give it a try!
