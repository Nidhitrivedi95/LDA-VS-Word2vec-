C8Ehjy_oDzYcy3-wf32Y4A The lunch specials are great. For under $12 with tax u get a few options on lunch menu
plus a spring roll, soup AND sofa pop! 
Only prob I have is with their pho, they totally skimp on the meat. I ordered the "special" which typically comes with all the "meats". I may have gotten couple slices of beef, 2 sprigs of tripe, a half slice of tendon and half, yes half a measly little beef ball!

Other than them skimping out on the meats in their pho, the many other dishes I've tried there are tasty and decent portioned.
