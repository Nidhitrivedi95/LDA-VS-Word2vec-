U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q The food was good. A bit overpriced but good.

However the service was shit! The staff acted as uf we weren't guests and they were unfriendly. Upon asking whether I could have a spoon they just threw it on the table.

It's a pity that in such a nice venue they act like they don't have to bring up their efforts anymore.

Never gonna come back.
