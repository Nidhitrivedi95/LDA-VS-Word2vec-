URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg I went here with my dad today for lunch at his suggestion. We got here around 11:45 and this place was hopping! We were sat right away and the very efficient servers came and gave us soup straight away. It was egg drop with chicken, which isn't my favorite, but it was ok. We decided to order some potstickers and an order of Hong Kong style noodles with chicken. It took five minutes for them to bring out the food... wow. The potstickers were really good, and the potsticker sauce was a nice balance of savory and sweet. The noodles were also very good. They were crispy, just like I like them. All of the veggies tasted really good, I could taste each veggies' individual flavor. It had snow peas, broccoli, carrots, and celery. It was all really great. So why four stars? I didn't really like the soup so much, I think it is so lame that restaurants give egg drop soup (In my opinion, it is the worst, and what about people with egg allergies?), and also the sauce on the noodles could have been more flavorful. Overall though, this place was really good, and I wouldn't mind going back here again.
