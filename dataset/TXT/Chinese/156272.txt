trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ I'm really not that impressed... 
We ordered fish and chips, the chips are overcooked and the fish is extremely oily, which caused my stomachache right after a couple of bites. 
Also I have to say, the fish is not seasoned well. 
I expressed my feelings when the waitress asked how we liked our meal, and she said she would pass  it to the chef. We expected our food to be replaced at least, however, nothing happened in the end.
I truly wish there's improvement in food quality and customer service at Pearl Diver.
