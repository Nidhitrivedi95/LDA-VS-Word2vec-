3aUBEB206LBNLUY6rCW2sw I was a little skeptical at first, and if you are too, DON'T BE! Ashlee makes you feel comfortable and is really knowledgable about Chinese medicine. I was tired of my Medical doctor only prescribing pain medicine for my back pain and not looking for the underlying cause. My frustration led me to Ashlee when I was seeking some type of alternative medicine. After only a few treatments my back pain is gone and now I go just because it's relaxing and I feel more balanced. She's in an awesome location too! Give Ashlee a try..you won't regret it!
