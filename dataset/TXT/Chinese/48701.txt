C7i3HJH0nMyo2K7ZwHToQg I can not say enough good stuff about this studio and the owners! My 6 year old has been attending class, twice a week, over the past couple of years and he LOVES it! They teach the children not only martial arts skills but they enforce life lessons, such as respect for others, being responsible and taking accountability, being a team player and self confidence.  
We moved from out of town and I visited many studios before deciding on Las Vegas Kung Fu, it is a family owned and run studio and they truly care about their students and the families that attend. I am so impressed with all the staff and so grateful we found this awesome studio! 
If you are thinking of martial arts for your child, or even yourself, this is the place to go!
