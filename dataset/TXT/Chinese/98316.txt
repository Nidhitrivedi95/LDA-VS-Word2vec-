jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw I'm going to rate this five stars, because they serve dimsum all day every day. For anyone who works in the evening shift or for any one who is simply  craving for dimsum, this is the place to be.

Don't expect to get a fast service or quality of service. This place is always jam-packed, tourist buses usually stops over in this place for their lunch or dinner itinerary.
