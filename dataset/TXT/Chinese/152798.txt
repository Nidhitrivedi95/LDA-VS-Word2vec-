T5iVkzBXvG5cG6de_TMquw I would say this is your above average Chinese restaurant.  The food is the same as other Americanized Chinese restaurants.  

It is cozy inside, some booths and a few tables.  They do have beer and wine here.

Good size portions, fair prices, pretty fast service. 

This is your typical review for a typical restaurant.
