5z-kd3h50BnaE1Ee8GV5bg I used to love the food, the place itself is usually unclean and the service horrible every single time. I stopped going when my boyfriend and I went for lunch and he bit down on an egg roll and almost broke his tooth! There was a ROCK in his egg roll. Disgusting. We told the lady there that always drags her feet and she offered us $5 off.. Um no we did not pay for his meal. We shouldn't of even paid for mine. My appetite was completely gone. Never have gone back. Oh and they don't accept discover card but have the discover on the tab.
