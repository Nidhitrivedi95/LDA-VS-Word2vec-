HV3Q2JYwK9AvMHPYXcxzag The food tastes like authentic Chinese food. And the service is better than the usual authentic Chinese places. Prices are getting up there by a dollar, and the food portions are not as big as other places.

Maybe it's a "better service" at the expense of "big food portions." I don't know... I probably take more food over service. Just saying as an Asian person. haha.

This was during dinner and the place had a lot of people so that's always a good sign. The menu had some good varieties too. And like I said, it's authentic taste. Unless you get something that's specifically made for Americans. Then you get authentic American taste.
