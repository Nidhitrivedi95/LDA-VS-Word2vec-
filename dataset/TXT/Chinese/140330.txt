The strip mall this sits in is huge!  Best Buy, Joann's, Costco, Starbucks,  Bed Bath and Beyond are just a few stores that fills this mall.  The location has floor to ceiling windows which brings a lot of light into the restaurant during the day and allows onlookers to view the restaurant from the outside at night.  The location is clean.  In fact the employees were mopping and wiping tables when I arrived. 

I got the three entree plate for $8.08.  I was a little irritated that most of the food was gone by that time and they weren't looking to make anymore.  In fact, my favorite dish, the teriyaki chicken (I usually get it without sauce) was out of stock.  Buzz Kill!  Good thing my second dish was still there, the chicken and mushrooms.  I decided to get two orders of those and a 3rd order of the beef and broccoli.  My starch was the fried rice.  Chinese style rice with veggies and egg in it.  Super flavorful with the soy sauce, but I could tell it was made a while before I arrive.  Some rice grains were hard but still satisfied my palate.  The chicken and mushrooms are always a crowd pleaser!  Cut chicken thighs, button mushrooms and sliced zucchini. The sauce probably has a lot of ingredients.  I think  I taste oyster sauce and soy sauce.  Either way, it's delicious!  Packed with flavor and eat component offers delightful textures which makes the overall dish sing!

This is a place where you can get in, order and get out.  It's kind of like fast food but not really.  Plate lunch Chinese food is how I identify this place.  Panda is a place that I've always visited growing up and will continue to visit for years to come.  For those few people who have never tried it, get down and grab a plate.
