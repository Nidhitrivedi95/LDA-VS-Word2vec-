kzuQsq0KPWLeKFtnLXXyHg OMG! I cannot believe there are not more reviews for Tam's! This little hole in the wall (and by hole in the wall I mean literally) provides the best blackenese chinese soul food I have ever tasted! As black folk, it is not common for us to say we don't like fried chicken, but I was losing my taste for it! I have to say Tam's restored my love for chicken! 

It's the most flavorlicious chicken you will ever taste! They also have the best fried rice, chow mein noodles, egg foo young w/chicken gravy! I don't think there is anything bad on their menu! Now......

I will say that the location is not desirable, but like a crack head will do anything for a hit,  I will go where ever I have to for Tam's chicken and chinese food! I love it! I drive all the way from North Scottsdale when I need a fix! LOL! My family out town loves it too! Sometimes I get calls from family asking if I can ship some chicken to them all the way to Texas! 

Just remember they cook to order so make sure you call ahead to place your order. But if you are just 15 mins later than the time your order is ready be prepared to wait because your order has been served to someone else! They don't play! If they say it will be ready in 10 mins, be there in 10 mins!
