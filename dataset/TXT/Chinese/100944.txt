K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw I am writing this review as I am eating some Char Kway Teow from One2 Snacks. I first heard of this place in passing during a CBC's Metro Morning segment on Chris Nuttall-Smith, former Globe and Mail food critic. Believe it or not but I went that weekend even though it was on the other side of the GTA. One2 Snacks is more like a take out place than a restaurant - there is a small seating area with limited seats. Despite this, the place is always busy and this is indicative of how delicious the food is.

If this is your first time here, these three dishes are crowd-pleasers: 
CURRY LAKSA - Served in a large bowl with fish balls, shrimp, chicken, and bean sprouts. The curry broth is the highlight of the dish. This is a MUST-TRY item on their menu. I've tried the Singapore Laksa at Restoran Malaysia and it doesn't even compare. 

CHAR KWAY TEOW - Spicier, tastier version of Beef Chow Fun Noodles (Gon Chow Ngau Ho). 

MEE GORENG - This dish is a wet noodle with tofu, tomatoes, chilis, shrimp and meat. It keeps great for leftovers.

Each dish has a range of spiciness from mild to extra spicy to suit your tastes. I recommend getting the mixed noodles to try for each dish, whenever possible. They are cash only but the prices are very affordable. Do not come here hungry because you have to wait about 30 ridiculously long minutes - they only feel that way because you won't want to wait any longer to stuff your face. There is only one person running the front but he is accommodating and helps with recommendations.
