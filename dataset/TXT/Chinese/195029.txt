zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I see the mixed reviews and understand given the restaurant, people have high expectations of this place. But for myself, I knew nothing about Momofuku or all that celebrity restaurant crap so I came in here with zero expectations and the price seemed fair. Walking in we had the option to go for the Noodle Bar or the upstairs restaurant (significantly more expensive and dinner-like menu for sharing). We decided on Noodles since it was lunch. My first impression of the waitresses and host were a little chilly and cold because of stress maybe? Meh.

I like the interior design and open concept, communal set up. We sat at the bar which was surprisingly comfortable and we had some live entertainment (chefs preparing food in a very "assembly-line" sort of way). Hey, whatever's most efficient at rush hour lunch.

The lamb noodle was excellent. Waaaay beyond my expectations because I normally don't order dry noodles. I would come back just for this dish.  **On a side note, the only noodles with soup are the House Ramen and Tan Tan Noodles (sesame based). Everything else is dry, which I found slightly surprising since I assumed a noodle bar would have more soup based options.** My boyfriend ordered the ramen and said it was pretty good. We try places out in Vancouver and obviously there are more authentic places but this one made it decently. But then again, we don't dissect ramen down to the green onion strand.

We both enjoyed this place and would visit the upstairs restaurant next time we are in town.
