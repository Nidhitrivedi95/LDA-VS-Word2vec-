AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw I've been here several times and though I was impressed in the beginning, everything got progressively worse with each visit. I think a large part of it is that the more experienced waiter ladies are now nowhere to be seen and are replaced by younger waitstaff who despite their best efforts lack experience. But my last visit will be my final visit and here's why:

1)My mom ordered off the all day breakfast menu and specified she wanted the vermicelli option. The waitress replied "macaroni?", and my mom corrected her. And repeated herself to ensure that it was clear she wanted vermicelli. The words vermicelli was said clearly and distinctly 3 times. It came in macaroni. Usually my mom would be like w/e, but this is the first time I've seen her adamant about correcting the mistake just because she emphasized what she wanted so many times.

2) This is the large portion of why I will not be back. At this point both my parents dishes have arrived and I've been waiting a long time. When my dish finally arrived (curry beef with rice) I was really disturbed. I can clearly see stains from a previous dish on my plate. It was clear it's a different dish cause the sauce stains were an entirely different colour from the curry. At this point I didn't want to bother sending it back since my parents were basically done eating and since we've already sent one dish back I was concerned that if we sent another one we'd just piss off the kitchen staff and have something bad happen to my replacement dish anyways. So I just tried to eat the stuff that didn't touch the plate. I couldn't even enjoy that cause the curry was terribly salty and I really just couldn't finish the dish.

As cheap as cafe hollywood is, it's just not worth the aggravation.I wish they had maintained the quality of their early days but clearly something has went terribly wrong.
