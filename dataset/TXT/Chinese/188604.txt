yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I'm really disappointed honestly, I come here all the time and always get the Chicken Pho & pad Thai. Today I went after craving it for so long, as we got seated our waiter was extremely pushy and greeted us "what do you want" we told her we needed a couple minutes and got upset. As we ordered out food she let me finish my order and snatched out menu out our hand & didn't even let my friend tell her order so we had to wait till the waiter came back to finish the order. As  the food came out they literally threw out food on our table, and we were so shocked.. but we asked the guy who gave our food for extra lime & he just walked away as we were speaking to him. It just continued the entire time we were there, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ITS RIDICULOUS. As we paid the lady took the cash and didn't return the change expecting she was getting a tip! Sorry but tips shouldn't be expected, you need to earn & basically none of you guys had a good attitude. Horrible experience, never coming back & this is coming from a customer who goes all the time!
