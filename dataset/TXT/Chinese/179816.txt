I'm a fan. First time in Vegas, got the hook up via a friend for Steve Aoki. The venue is amazing in appearance, and I like the fact that it had multiple floors (granted that most clubs in Boston is one floor and not as large). However, because Mr.Aoki and probably every other notable DJ that graces their presence at these venues take their time to get on stage, we ventured to the Ling Ling Lounge (LOL like wtf kinda name is that for a lounge). I think L^3 was the highlight for us - it played mostly top40/hip hop, which is what me and my friends preferred. 

Around 1:30am-2ish, we ventured back up to the main floor and we lucked out so hard. Right as we past a certain point on the path to the main dance floor, the bouncer behind us blocked entry for everyone behind us. #blessed I think I'd be hella angry if I had paid x amount of money to a club and couldn't even get access to the general dance floor. Steve Aoki was cool, the effects were dope, the robot dudes blowing cold air into the audience was kind of pointless but whatever.

A couple of things I'd advise:
-Pregame hard - drinks are small, but expensive, and fighting through the crowd to get a drink isIa journey
-If you're bringing a jacket, expect to check it in. I was kind of pissed about this because I saw dudes walking in with a light jacket and I got called out by a bouncer to check my jacket in. Like bro, this jacket is a part of my swagger and you're forcing me to turn down the swag
-Come early! Forget people saying that it's uncool to arrive to the club early. Sure, you're uncool, but you're also unstupid, aka you smart. For a first timer, I think we would have been at the very back of the hotel waiting in line if we had not gone at around 10:30pm. 
-Ask around in your network for a promoter in Vegas. Going through a promoter offers the possibility of discounted cover, free cover, etc.

TL;DR: It's chill.
