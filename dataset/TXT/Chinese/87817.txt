hx-oJMNnweYqE5ybU8aiSg This is the most terrible buffet I have never seen it. First I went front pay for it , the lady she had horrible attitude and no smile. Second they called seafood buffet with snow crab legs but soon we sat down and they took out the crab legs , I went front asked the horrible lady where was crab lags and horrible lady said" I wasn't work in the kitchen,asked who work in the kitchen."
This is very bad experience,so we are not come back again.
