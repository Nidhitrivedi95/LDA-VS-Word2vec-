LRLc0c1pQwa9VSG7EpZRtg This is my favorite spot for Chinese in the Aurora/Chagrin Falls area. I've known the owner for years and their service and food is always up to par. I can't recall one bad experience.

I recommend the hot and sour soup and the general Tso's chicken. Sauce is real tasty and you can get it as hot as you want. Pot stickers are also very good. If your looking for a killer spot for Chinese definitely give this place a try.
