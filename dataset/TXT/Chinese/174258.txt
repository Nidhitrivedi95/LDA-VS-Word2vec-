wcFscp4-QH0PJeIW1EOQEQ Good sushi, very nice staff, amazing prices.  They give crunchy wonton strips while you wait and they are just really friendly.  The sushi is where it's at..we always order way too much and i just can't stop eating it...so good.  I'm sure there are other places with better choices, etc, but none match the overall joy i get from coming here.  Just a good place all around.
