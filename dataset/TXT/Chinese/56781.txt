d_oEgPEL7jaMVDBsRf2t-A I went in today just because it was close to 10 pm and I was almost positive that if they weren't open now, they'd never be open.  So I decided to give it a shot.  

Their desserts - same high quality and same great taste.  The boss - same attitude.  I really really wish I could give this place a higher rating - I really truly wished I could.  But that customer service was just not on par.  She presented to me with this stand-offish attitude, which got me started up being all stand-offish.  And finally, because of *my* attitude, she got a little bit nicer.  

Seriously?  I really don't enjoy being rude to someone to get customer satisfaction.  

I gave it another star because 1) it was finally open when I passed by and 2) the boss was nicer towards the end.
