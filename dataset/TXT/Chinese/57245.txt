D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Outstanding Thai Restaurant and we're visitors 
From the greater Seattle area. Very nice decor inside, comfortable tables. Servers friendly, helpful, dressed nicely! 

Food was so good! Our table ordered. Bacon wrapped scallops so delicious! Large & juicy!
Fried rice w/ pork & more all delicious. In fact we'll be going back for lunch before we head to airport
When we go home! 

Great atmosphere, there's a small bar inside. Totally
Recommend.
