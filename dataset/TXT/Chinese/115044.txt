n_fg4B1BPzcE2PK8qqnLhw Using Yelp, I trusted the ratings that customers posted for this restauant and am now enjoying real quality Chinese dishes.  I started with Crab wontons, BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Mongolian Beef and Beef and Broccoli.  All were perfect with extreme freshness and flavor.
Tam was very nice to talk to, I told her that Yelp led me to her business.
I have found my replacement, no more Panda.
