cjatara6LkXRu2BXD_jxlA Overall good food and not overly seasoned with cumin as most skewer places tend to be. They use charcoal to cook their food so it adds a hint of smokiness to the food. The atmosphere is nice and the establishment is clean. Minus one star because 1) they are cash only & no mention of it in English (apparently there is a sign written in Chinese) 2) when asked if it was cash only the server didn't make mention of an ATM next door 3) prices are a little steep ($4 for a can of herbal tea). I would come here again for the food. Come early as there is a wait later in the evening.

*edit after receiving bill: I found it especially rude that the waitress counted our money in front of us as if we were going to short change them. Secondly she noted that we hadn't left enough for tips. I am not one to be stingy when gratuity is due. Since when was gratuities (a way of saying thanks for the service) mandatory? If they had offered credit/ debit and we didn't have to run next door to the ATM in the middle of our meal AND we didn't have to get our own drinks from the fridge at the front, they would get what they felt was deserved
