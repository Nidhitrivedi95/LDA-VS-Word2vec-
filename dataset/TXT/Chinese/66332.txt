Personal favourites are the duck (comes in two servings - traditional, then stir-fried with vegetables) and dim sum. They often offer Groupons, which makes the $18 noodles a tad more justifiable. Overall, a comfortable dining experience, but expect to pay 20-40% more than restaurants in Chinatown which serve similar dishes.
