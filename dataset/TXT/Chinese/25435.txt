7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA I've been living in Pittsburgh for 4 years and Sichuan Gourmet is definitely most recommended place for authentic Sichuan style food in Pittsburgh Area. I personally recommend top 3 dishes which my friends and I often order. 

No.1 Chongqin Chicken: all my American, Chinese and even Indian Friends love it. I really like it but won't eat too much(they are fried and I know it is hard to stop eating once you started). I would only eat it on my cheat day during the long week of workouts.

No.2 Tea Smoke Duck: I've tried this dish in many Chinese restaurants and so far Sichuan Gourmet is among the best. I would recommend picking the date when the restaurant buy the fresh duck(you probably need some connections inside the restaurants, be friends with the manager:) ).

No.3 Pork Shoulder in hot source: when I was a kid, my mom often cook pork shoulder for me, I really enjoy the soft texture of the meat. After I came to US, it became my personal favorite dish in Sichuan Gourmet. However, I would not always be able to order it: sometimes my friends don't eat pork, sometimes this dish is too much for 2 people. I highly recommend order this dish when you have more than 3 people.
