JhEtJbGjAqKDHCZ11i3qoQ I gave this place 5 stars because it is as good as it gets for Mongolian BBQ. This place has lots of great items to choose from to put in your bowl. Great sauce/seasoning items, and a recipe board if you don't feel like winging it. You get steamed white or brown rice, wonton soup, and my favorite, fried crunchy noodles with sweet & sour sauce for dipping. And if you didn't stuff your face enough on noodles, rice, and soup, they have self serve ice cream too. The only thing that sucks is that if you don't finish your food, which you probably won't, they charge you $0.50 for a to-go box. Great leftovers though. You can throw it in a pan and it's almost better than the first time. 

My kids love it because they can put whatever they want or don't want in their food, and they eat it all up!
