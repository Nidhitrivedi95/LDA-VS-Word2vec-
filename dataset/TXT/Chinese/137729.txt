QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw Great little shop. The broth is insanely good. Doesnt matter which one you choose they're all good but you cant be wrong with the mushroom broth. If you never been to a hot pot, here's how this one works. You pay per person and you get a pot of broth  and your choice selection of raw meat, veggies and etc. you cook your ingredients on your table.You can get refills of broth but you don't really need another.  Great thing about this place is you can bring home your left overs and you can pay extra to share. About half the regular price! Great spot to go in Madison's cold weather
