5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ Ordered several dishes here and I got a lychee martini. The martini was awesome and our bartender was very nice. I ordered a combo pho here too. The pho tasted fine but portion was huge and they put way way too much noodle in the pho. It was a big lump of noodles and I would recommend them lowering the amount of noodle. Their portions are big so if you order something it's shareable. Sushi was fine. Food here is average. Definitely could improve in a lot of areas.
