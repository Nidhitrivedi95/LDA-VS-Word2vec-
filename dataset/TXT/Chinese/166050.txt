vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw I just had possibly the worst food ever. I am angry because it cost z$25.00, and it was inedible. I ordered seafood chow fun and fish in black bean sauce. I knew something was wrong when the sauce was in a separate container from the noodles. The sauce was some slimy almost clear sauce with the sea food ingredients in it. There was three shrimp total. There was about three pieces of bok choy  in the container.  I could not recognize the other ingredients. The taste was bland. I could not eat it. The fish was okay. Too salty but nothing special. Of course I will not be returning there.
