8FUzCm4Q13MJMX7N6ftmQw Tried this for the first time tonight... with trepidation, based on the scary meals we've had at other Chinese restaurants here in the northwest valley. Surprisingly, pretty good!

First, the reasons for not giving 5 stars:

The potsticker dough was too thick, made them chewy and a bit unpleasant. Also, everything was served on Styrofoam plates with a plastic fork and spoon each. As the potstickers were large, I had to cut them up using the edge of a plastic spoon. Finally, while the complimentary eggrolls were nice, no spicy mustard was served.

Now for the good, and there was a lot.... huge servings per entree, each was enough to feed two hungry people alone. They were made fresh, and the sauces were good & flavorful. Also, when they say spicy, it IS! 

We ordered Szechuan (Hot garlic) Pork and General Tso's Chicken (Hubby's favorite). Both were good and we're definitely eating there again. Though, based on the plasticware, we might go for delivery or carry-out next time. Dinner was under $30 with tons of leftovers, and I noted that they deliver within six miles for $2.00.

UPDATE:

We got take-out when we had company last weekend and it was horrible. They said it would be ready in 10 minutes, luckily we got there early as it was already done. Got it home (VERY short drive and in the desert heat) and the food was all cold.

Crab Rangoons.. very little filling, absolutely zero flavor
Beef Broccoli - okay, needed more sauce, nothing special
Pork with String Beans - same as the Beef
Orange Chicken - I don't know what that chicken did to piss them off but apparently it was nasty. They pounded chicken to thin oblivion and breaded/fried it, served it with sickly sweet orange sauce on the side. It was chewy and tasteless without the sauce; sweet, chewy and boring with the sauce. Definitely the most hated entree of the night.

All four of us tasted everything then tossed it all out. Sad follow-up to what had been a great intro!
