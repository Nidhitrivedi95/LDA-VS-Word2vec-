e9FftJq9v_porLZT7iSEhg Unfortunately I have not visited here in many years ( my loss) last time time I ate at Imperial it was at their old location. Well it is as good as I remember , very good ! Started with the PuPu platter not same presentation as in years past but just as good. Their made in house egg rolls are delicious ! ( mustard very hot and good!) for nostalgia reasons I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan and it was outstanding ( just as I remember. ) also ordered the Hunan Noodle - top notch !  The only gripe would be that they need more hot pepper seeds in their hot oil. Overall great dining experience with friendly staff and owner .

Will Be Back !!
