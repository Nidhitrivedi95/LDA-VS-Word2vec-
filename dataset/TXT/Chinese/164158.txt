uU8up3hGwW9qnzQD1HZsMQ I love this restaurant.  We have never been disappointed with any dish we have ordered.  The orange beef, boneless and bone in spare ribs, chop suey and curry chicken are our favorite dishes. Great customer service, friendly and prompt delivery.  One of the best Chinese food spots in Chandler!
