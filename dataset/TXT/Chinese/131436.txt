4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Support this place.  It's worth supporting.  It's a little out of the way and service can be uneven, but the food is well-executed and delicious.

Haven't had a lot of Malaysian food, only once before I moved to Arizona, so I can't say I'm comparing this to the best that may be out there.  Just going on taste and preparation.  On my first visit here I ordered the roti canai and the nasi lemak.  The roti was fine, maybe a tick above average.  I've had roti before many times and but never in this iteration and my only gripe was that the curry lacked a little flavor.  The nasi lemak was great.  Hot, crispy, and very filling.  Subtle in flavor, but with the sambal, kicked up the flavor and was quite tasty.

So tasty that I ordered it again on my next visit with my wife, who ordered the char kway teow.  Also good, reminiscent of chow fun.  Noodles could stand a little more chewiness but for a stir-fried noodle dish, it was pretty good.

Get the barley drink.  If you're familiar with Korean shik-ae, that's exactly what it tastes like and it's great.  

Hoping one day they serve rendang.
