pW-fOxuaWBkIhum5NANx2w Very helpful when I stopped in Tuesday night for some to go food.  I let them know that I was trying to stay on my diet and they have a lower calorie section on their menu.  They suggested the steamed rice but I really was in the mood for fried rice so they said they would use almost no oil and wow was it delicious.  They deliver and are almost always open on Sunday.  My entire meal beef & broccoli w fried rice & egg roll was only $7.  This was enough food for a few meals for me.  They have been here 22 years which is not a surprise to me.
