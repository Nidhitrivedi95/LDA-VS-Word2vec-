XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA This is the absolute best buffet in the Phoenix Valley.! It is like a Vegas Casino Buffet got transported here. Everything from dim sum to escargot. Crab legs and a huge sushi bar. Their fish quality is very good for a buffet. Exceptionally good food and a selection that can't be beat! Now where are the black jack tables? and bring me a single malt scotch!
