I had the lamb, chicken cartilage, pork, squid, chicken wings, baked oysters, okra, egg plant, rice cake...See how easy it was to pile it up?!  Skewers were well seasoned and packed with flavour. Usually it's cumin, like for the lamb.  It's a great atmosphere for hanging out with friends, having a beer and chatting it up.  They only accept cash which is inconvenient.  Beer is pretty much self serve.  You can order it on paper but you need to go to the fridge to get it yourself anyways.  I was with two other friends around 9pm on a Tuesday and there was still a 30 min or so wait.  Plus the seating is limited.  I'm already looking forward to coming back but not looking forward to waiting for a table.  The servers keep walking by with heaps of skewers from the kitchen and pass the line up. It just taunts me!
