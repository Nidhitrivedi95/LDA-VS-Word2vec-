A very nice, small, and very friendly Chinese restaurant.
They have good lunch deals and there pricing isn't too bad either also they offer delivery service. 

If you stop in I suggest you try there appetizers very good also ask for the home made spicy mustard its very sweet and tangy but has a good kick to it.
