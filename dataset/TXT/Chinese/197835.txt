zUHz-rUIR7FSvmP7bbemsA I saw the reviews thinking this place was good. I'm guessing it's because people can't really tell the difference in the quality of the ingredients. The prices aren't that cheap either. The taste is okay but didn't enjoy the seating there. 

Would only recommend if you are in a rush for a quick and cheap meal.
