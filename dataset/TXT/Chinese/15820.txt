3sdUVTMBHPiVN5zqZjb1zw I don't know WHY any bad/low reviews--the food selection is EXCELLENT! All FRESH!! Freshly GRILLED ANYTHING you want Hibatchi (Benihana) Style in the back. They also have SUSHI!! When we went, DINNER for Adults was JUST-ONLY $9.99 ...REALLY?!?? Move over Golden Coral--this place is giving you a major run for OUR $$$.  I will DEFINITELY be back! YOU...You.., the one reading this...GO! Go and try it out! Good Food and Super Cheap!
PS. I love the "no waiting" to eat. Go straight to get your food!! ENJOY<U+203C>
