S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A I just polished off a few things and I'm actually having a hard time figuring out what I liked most.  Ordered the #34 per another user's recommendation and it is pretty not bad - definitely spicy!  Enjoyed the pan fried dumplings - fat and flavorful!  Very tasty - definitely a re-do.  And ordered the #56 Salt and Pepper Shrimp.  Wasn't sure what to expect with that one, but it's basically tempura shrimp with sliced jalapenos on a bed of lettuce.  Good enough for me - I topped my noodles with the extra roughage from the shrimp and kept going.  I'd go on, but I really need another drink and something to keep my nose from running - it was nice and spicy, oh so worth it.  Will be going back to explore more options!
