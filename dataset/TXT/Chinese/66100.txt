EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw My coworkers love going here since it's close to the office. I've been here a few times & my experience has been pretty consistent. 

* Wait Time: They're not super busy during lunch. This can be a pro & a con, but since we go here during our quick lunch break from work, this is definitely a pro! 

* Dim Sum Style: They don't have carts going around the restaurant for dim sum. They bring out the items as you order

* Price: Same as other dim sum places. One major pro, their menu shows the items w/ their price!!!! Most dim sum places don't show this, which results in a surprisingly high bill..
That's not the case here! You know exactly how much your bill will be before you get your check.

* Customer service: Their servers & employees are a lot more nicer & polite compared to other Chinese restaurants, so that's a major pro!
