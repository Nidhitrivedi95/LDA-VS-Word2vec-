Q8-4uLtLJeXHJZZsr2Zexw Ate here on Feb. 10, 2016 and it's my second and last visit.  Food was mediocre...the sushi tasted bland compared to other AYCE restaurants although the portions were plentiful.  Miso soup was watered down.  Service was pretty much non existent other than taking your order and cleaning up after you're done.  For the price I paid for a 4:30pm ayce meal ($22plus taxes), I feel that at least a smile on your way in and out would at least be given...the store was empty, you'd think they'd be happy to see a customer.

Lastly, take this with a grain of salt, but I got sick after eating here with gastroenteritis.  Whether it was because of the employee in the food prep area coughing profusely on two occasions, contaminated food or somewhere else entirely outside of this restaurant...I'll never know, but I had no contact with a sick person after this restaurant and until I got sick.

Never again.
