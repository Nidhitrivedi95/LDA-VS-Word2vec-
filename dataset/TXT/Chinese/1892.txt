-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ My boyfriend and I decided to try this place on a whim. We walked in not knowing whether to seat ourselves or order at the counter. We asked the waitress/cashier/order runner and she seated us. We ordered drinks, veggie tempura and 3 rolls after reviewing their menu. I like that they have several shrimp tempura rolls which are my favorite. She brought our vegetable tempura and forgot the drinks. I had to remind her as she breezed past the table. Our rolls arrived shortly after. I wasn't really impressed with the presentation or the quality. Mind you, I am NOT a sushi snob. The rolls just seemed thrown together. Overall, I'd rather spend the same amount of money elsewhere that doesn't seem like fast-food sushi. Might be good for take-out orders. They seem fast paced and more concerned with answering phones and take-out orders than customers dining in.
