Then a longer wait for menus, a very long wait for drinks, etc. etc.  This was earlier in the evening & the restaurant wasn't busy.  We overhead several tables making the same comment.  

We were excited by the concept fo the food, but found it somewhat lacking and _way_ overpriced.  The drinks are good, but I'd skip this place in favor of some of the better choices nearby.
