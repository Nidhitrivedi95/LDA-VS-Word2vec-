bj6Km1RvgD6oyppCe5yDog First off - for those using the iphone maps, this place is on the corner of 24th St. and Indian School Road - EAST of Jack in the Box.  Not west of it like the map shows.

As I read some of the low reviews, I have to laugh.  Umm...if you want to complain about the atmosphere, service, and hot and sour soup - go to PF Changs for expensive Chinese food.  Places like this are what usually are good indicators of authentic - I am Chinese so yes, I think I know what I am talking about.  What I got a big kick out of was the fact that they have a menu for those looking for americanized chinese food and then a separate one with the real stuff on it.  Hilarious!

Madi D seems to be spot on.  I ordered the Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice) and Green Beans with XO sauce.  The rice is not your typical fried rice so don't expect anything else besides the salty fish (yum!) and chicken.  It was yummy and a comfort good.  The green beans were cooked with something that made them dif. so I suggest that again.  I spoke with the girl at the counter (mine was take-out) and she was really pleasant.

Overall, I'd need to try other things to be sure but so far, I am pretty sure this is the real deal.
