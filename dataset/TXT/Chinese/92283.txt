IPyrraIafBs8afeVMGmfCQ Defiantly better then all the normal take-out places in town. The fried rice is amazingly good. I'm only giving a 4 Star due to the fact that my Teriyaki Chicken was breaded popcorn chicken instead of the grilled chicken on the menu. Was still good, but not I was hoping for. And the seating isn't good. They have 3 pub tables with 2 stools each. Not a place to really sit down and eat with the family. 

We will be back, but will make sure we order ahead so the whole family doesn't have to travel for food.
