wwoOWTunPh4QnaKW11Zl7A I really like this store.  I feel every time I am shopping here I am eating healthy.  A lot of healthy choices and selections.  I go there for the specials.  sometimes they have boxes of mangoes for really cheap.  I also go there for the fresh noodles which I use in my stir fry. I also like their mushroom selection and fresh vegetables.  Their bakery is also very nice.  I always come out of this store with a smile.
