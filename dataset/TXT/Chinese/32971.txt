A2pHOVp0zh7grb1bbZxoBQ Stopped in for lunch. Nothing fancy about the dining room, but it was clean and the service was prompt and friendly.  Daughter had chicken fried rice and I had the kung pao chicken and shrimp. Very tasty, nice big shrimp, for a lunch portion, and not to much oil used in the prep. Very good flavor. No upcharge for white meat in either of our meals. The only thing I'd say was a wee bit of a disappointment, the fried rice didnt have the usual peas and carrots. Some maybe would like that, we would have preferred them to be included.

Overall a good meal and a reasonable price.
