BANH-MI: When I want a good Vietnamese sandwich, I'm going to Hue Thai. It's their specialty. They all start delicious bread. They add mild-medium jalapeno, pickled radish/carrot, cilantro, pate, mayo, and your choice of meat. For the non-adventurous, go with the charbroiled pork or beef (#19/#20). For those who don't mind jellied, cured, Vietnamese meat, go for #11: Banh Mi Dac Biet (House Special). 

VARIETY: Pho is ok. I prefer my pho elsewhere. However, this is the only place i know where to get Vietnamese Meatballs or Xiu Mai. Its in a deliciously flavorful tomato-y kind've sauce and served with a buttery soft baguette to dip. If you haven't had a Vietnamese Meatball, you need to eat this NAO.

CHEAP $$$$: Banh-mi is cheap! Each sandwich is just under a foot long and will probably run you around $3.50.

SERVICE: The service is absolutely horrendous here. Most employees barely speak English and the servers are oblivious to the world. Considering the place is usually empty, I have to wonder why they suck at waiting tables. Even ordering to-go at the register is an issue. Employees will be in the back leaving the register un-manned and getting their attention is a mission. Qutie annoying. 

WHY TO-GO?: Every time I go, the restaurant has an unpleasant smell. A blend of cleaning products and cooking pho broth.... Not pleasant to sit in.

CREDIT CARD MINIMUM: $20 ( i think )
