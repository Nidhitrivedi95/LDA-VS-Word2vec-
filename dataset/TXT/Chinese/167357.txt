VGKq16vCdPPHMoryy6XTHg I went here last Thursday while visiting the city of Madison with a group of friends, six to be exact.  We were thirsty so we bellied up to the bar right away.  The bartender was very friendly and looked like he was enjoying his job.  I was in search of strong drink so I ordered a whiskey sour which cost me a measly 5 bucks.  The drinks here are defiantly worth the price.  I ended up having to add two more people to our party last minute and our servers Jessica and Jamie were more than accommodating to help us out with the two additional guests.  I ordered a pizza which was relatively cheap and tasted amazing!  We finished our meal with more drinks and eventually left.  I will definitely be returning to the Natt Spil, on my next trip to Madison.
