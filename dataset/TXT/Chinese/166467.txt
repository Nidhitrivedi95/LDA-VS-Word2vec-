VC-S7T5aSOP9HTKu_TNHKA Visited for dinner today.

Service is average, price is average, food quality is OK.

Vegerables (mainly carrots) were all mushed in the borsche soup that came with my meal.

Servers don't pay great attention to the customers much at all.

Their signature hainan chicken rice was my order today.  Chicken had bones (the original ones should be boneless).  Rice did not have the chicken oil taste at all, was rather dry.  Ginger/onion sauce was not the best either.

My brother ordered tomato beef rice, which had enough sauce and was well cooked.

If youre just looking for a quick dinner, visiting here would be OK.
