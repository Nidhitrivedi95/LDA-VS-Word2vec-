T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ Not the best of places to dine at. Most of the food are just heated and waiting for someone to pick at it. I will admit the only appetizing dishes here are the sushi and crab legs, that's mostly because those items are popular and have to be restocked and served again. Other than that the food looks like left overs and not real exciting to eat. The servers are another thing. Not friendly and are mean. When asked for refills, the lady had an attitude like she was gonna DO something nasty to your drink. Another good side note for this place I guess is the oranges. They were fresh. I would suggest coming during the first opening hours of this place, by dinner time most of the food looks like a pack of hungry people ravaged the place and left you with what ever was left. The bathrooms are something else. It's not healthy for people to eat then use the restroom to find it all torn up and not maintained. That was disgusting! They need some reflection on this place.
