ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Mixed feelings about the Clever Koi.  My girlfriend and I ordered the following for dinner:

To start:
Black bean and celery root pancakes
Corn dumplings

Mains:
Kimchi fried rice w chicken
Vegetarian chow mein

I'll give Clever Koi props on their starters which were both fantastic.  Their house made sauces add an extra dimension to these dishes.  I love spicy so dipped my bites in their green sriracha.

Where the meal went sideways is with the kimchi fried rice.  Specifically, the kimchi.  

It tasted exceedingly of vinegar and undermined the whole dish.  Alone, the fried rice and chicken are pretty good.

Having lived in South Korea, I know what authentic (and quality) kimchi tastes like.  The kimchi at the Clever Koi does not taste like it has been properly fermented.  Rather, I imagine the ingredients were thrown together without respect for the process and true nature of the dish.  This is my best guess as to the source of such an overwhelming taste of vinegar that clashed with the other flavors.  Please note that I absolutely love kimchi and am not opposed to their concept.

My girlfriends vegetarian chow mein was fresh and executed well.  I am deducting two stars because whether the Clever Koi intentionally prepares their kimchi this way or if it was an off night - it tanked the meal for me.

I am open to giving the Clever Koi another chance, but would need to be thoroughly impressed to become a repeat customer.
