lmfyEVKm3CDGWg18LeRhgA My wife and I went here last night at about 7pm.  The place was eerily dead.  There were probably 4 other people in the entire place.  I know the saying, "nobody likes to eat in an empty restaurant", but we didn't care and decided to give this place a try.

For many reasons, I really really really do not enjoy giving sub-par reviews so I will try to be gentle and concentrate on what I liked sprinkled with a few things that could be improved upon.

If I had to rate a place only on decor, bathrooms and stickiness of my table; this place would not do very well.  Good thing I was here for the food.

Our waiter was very fast and friendly.  He was a very soft spoken gentlemen and it was difficult to understand him at times.  He was fast to refill waters and diet cokes so I really can't complain.  Here is what we ordered:

*Thai Spring Rolls - these were excellent as was the dipping sauce which had a nice kick to it.  I would order these again.

*Tom Yum Goong - this had a nice kick and a nice flavor.  However, I would have liked more "stuff" in it.  It came with some mushrooms and shrimp, but could have used a bit more.  I would order this again but some of their other soups looked good as well.

*Steak & Chicken with Spicy Thai Lemon Garlic Sauce - this was ok.  It was just some strips of cheap beef and chicken with some sauce.  The chicken was good but the beef was just eh.  I probably wouldn't order this again.

*Garlic and Peppers - this was just ok too.  My wife ordered it with tofu instead of chicken, but we got the chicken anyway.  We didn't send it back because I don't like doing that and maybe this was a "sign" to try the chicken because it is amazing.  Anyway, the dish had good flavor but it was eh.  My wife would probably order this again, but I wouldn't.

For the heath conscious, each of our entrees were not covered in tons of sauce so that's a plus.  However, the menu said they had brown rice, but we were told they didn't have any so that was a negative. 

I haven't had much Thai food in my day, but I think this place is more Chinese than Thai.  Perhaps we just didn't order the right things?  Judging by the reviews on here it looks like I should have done my homework before my visit to be sure I ordered properly.

I wouldn't rush back here but I won't cross it off my list just yet because I don't think I ordered what I should have.  However, as far as Thai food goes in my book, it is Thai Basil all the way.
