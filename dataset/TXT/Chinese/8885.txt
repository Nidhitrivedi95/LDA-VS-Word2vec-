1MrJJ9tyNyfFrxaNZ67xFg Great place hidden in Caste Village Shops. Nicely decorated and clean spaces throughout. Especially love the General Tso's Shrimp and Scallops-generous portions of LARGE scallops and shrimp with a great sauce and lots of steamed broccoli. My wife had the Walnut Shrimp which was delicious as well. In-laws had the Triple Delight (shrimp, chicken, beef) which was a huge serving and the General Tso's Chicken, both winners! Definitely give this place a try.
