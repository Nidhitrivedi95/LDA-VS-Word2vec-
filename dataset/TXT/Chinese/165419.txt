v-supbjeNBKNwomn3sLc8g This place is very good for Dim Sum ! Fair price and good quality food. Decor is not fancy but pretty clean comparable to many not expensive Chinese places. Was very surprised for quality of Xiao Long Bao, very thin skin and a lot of soup. My favorite dishes Har Go, Shu Mai, Tendon, Taro dumplings and probably about 20 more :))) Like this place and very recommend it.
