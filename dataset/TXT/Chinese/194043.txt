ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ As I've said in my other reviews of different Chatime locations, I find Chatime to serve very consistent drinks at all stores. Especially with all the bubble tea competition, it's very impressive that they have managed to build such a successful global brand. With that being said, I crave bubble tea all the time, but I can go months without having a Chatime craving in particular.

This is a very small store right by Bay and Dundas, so it's constantly busy. You'll be lucky if you can find a place to sit - there's only about 10-15 chairs and maybe 6 or so tables. Their free wifi is their telephone number I believe, but I never stay long enough to need to connect to it. This location is extremely narrow! If I wanted to use their washroom at the back and there's a line, I would definitely have rub against people to get to the back because there's no space to move around. Luckily, the lines go by quite quickly.

I used to always order their taro until I found out that it was just powder (I thought it was real taro this whole time). Their strawberry milk tea is very delicious and it's different from what you would expect (more subtle hints of the sourness of real strawberry). The last time I came with a group of 4, we all ended up getting the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. I ordered a regular size, but the employee punched in a large (whatever, I was thirsty anyways so I didn't mind just paying the extra $.50). The large is more than enough! Prices are quite steep at $4.20 for a regular for most of the bubble tea options, and then $.50 extra for toppings or an upsize. I usually get grass jelly from chatime and I make it less sweet. However, Chatime is one of the places that doesn't make their drinks excessively sweet.
