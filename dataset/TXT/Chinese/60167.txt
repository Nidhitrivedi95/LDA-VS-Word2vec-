DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ This place is me and my boyfriend's go-to restaurants when we want good Hawaiian food. We're guilty of always getting the same thing we usually get but it's hard to break away from our favorites like the Garlic Shrimp, Chicken Katsu, and the Gyozas. And I love me some Gyozas! The service is always friendly - never stuck up or make you feel stupid for not knowing what you want. The food is always hot and ready at a decent time. But I've had 2 instances where they've gotten my order wrong where they put mac and rice together when I specifically ordered it to be all rice. Other than, it's a great find & convenient location! Right next to Baskin Robbins too which is my fave!
