tEfvf1cznLZUIeTcKKpAIw Drove half an hour to try them out. It was relatively quiet when we came in and we ordered two items from the menu. I had the mini kookoo bites with rice and my husband had the chicken leg/thigh combo. Man, where do I start.. well, the side dish on my plate was questionable..the corn tasted funny as if it sat on the plate for awhile.. and the pickled "salad" thing looked unappetizing I just didn't even bother. However, I did like the chicken and sprinkled with the spicy powder they had on the table saved it..oh, and the original bubble tea that I chose with my meal was too bland for me. On another note, my husband liked his order overall, including his drink, so all isn't so bad I guess.

Honestly, its an okay type of chicken place. If your familiar with the taste of taiwanese chicken then you will sort of like this place depending on your taste buds. I personally wasn't blown away, but it isn't bad either. If I lived around the area I would order take out from them from time to time than go to a kfc since its cooked fresh and not over salted by some generated factory.

Overall, its an okay place for me.. not sure if its worth the drive in the future since other similar places are more accessible for me ..but see if you like it!
