BzZNKx6Des02RuAtT-uOPw Imagine this: over the course of 3 hours, you've imbibed about 6 Hobgoblins at The Lost Leaf. Your comrad - playing it safe, since driving - watched you down this UK tasty treat, while enjoying her own. Then you both decide to wander the block. That's when you make a stop at Fate. It being around midnight, the interior is decorated with only a few patrons, mostly at the bar. You two snatch a table inside, near the door, and begin to partake of the tempting apps - egg rolls, dumplings. One has another beer - part of the "sober up" process, he assures you. The Sober One munches contently, admiring the art on the walls, the low lighting, the discovery of a place for "after the bar," when she gets the munchies and the night is winding down, near ready for her lovely face to meet her pillow. 

So, next time you're in the area, make sure to go to Fate. They offer a good array of menu items, which makes this place a great spot to go before the bar(s), or after. 

They could invest in a better beer selection, but since they offered Kronenberg 1664, who am I to complain? (The Drunk One didn't.) Besides, I s'pose if you're looking for selection, you'll make the one-block trek to The Lost Leaf.
