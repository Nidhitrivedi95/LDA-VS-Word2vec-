h5pqhSb74UeLNkv534m5Hg Other than the lamb skewers that tasted good the other stuff was mediocre at best...the peanut noodle was all matted together hard to mix the sauce that they just scoop on too. The eggplant with meat hand chopped noodle also didn't have enough 'sauce' so it was dry and not flavoured all throughout...There was also a drunk person sleeping in another booth that they had to wake up to give us the seat which they were atleast good enough to move two tables together in a different area so we wouldn't have to be next to them....
