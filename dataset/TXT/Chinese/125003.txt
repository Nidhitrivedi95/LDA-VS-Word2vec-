OVVXpKIC0OGYKvvS9eJXjg Karen's Unicorn - first off, it's a brilliant name! One that you're not likely to forget - and we've been meaning to go there for ages. 

So, last night we toddled along after a couple of pints and had - a perfectly nice meal. Lovely staff, nice decor, everything very nice and ... you know, fine. It's basically a poshed up version of your bog standard British Chinese restaurant - sweet and sour, lemon chicken, spring rolls. All of them done to a higher standard than usual, but I'd have liked a few more interesting options. 

So - I don't want to be negative because everything was very pleasant, but a little unexciting.
