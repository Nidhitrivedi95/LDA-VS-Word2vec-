wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA Oh wow, this place is seriously overpriced.  In order to make me happy, they need to either lower the price, or increase the portion, just saying! 

The food & service are 4 stars and dollar sign should be $$$$ as well.  Two of us had a small house sake and costed $160, we left hungry btw.

All dish portions are baby food, teeny tiny, like tasting menu, strip mall location but hotel price. 

The happy hour menu is pretty weak.
