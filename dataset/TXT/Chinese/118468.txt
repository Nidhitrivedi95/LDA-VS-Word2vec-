nMo0ozHO7cqsPaxw_7N6ow I know this place is considered great by most, but we had a really really gross experience there.   So let me just say that the rating is more based on the experience then the actual quality of the food (I don't feel confident to judge the food since it was my first dim sum experience).  The menu and tables smelled strongly of dirty dish rags, and I think it was the patrons next to us that smelled like human excrement (not Dim Sum's fault, I know, but it makes it very difficult to maintain an appetite).  We ordered a variety of appetizers with the main courses to follow...  The appetizers were really mushy, and the combination of mushy food and the mix of dirty smells made both our stomachs upset, so we got the main courses boxed - we couldn't get out  of there fast enough.  I had a bite of the main courses at home but I threw out the food right after the first bite because I couldn't stop thinking about what just happened.  We will probably never return. The experience gets a two instead of a one because the waitress was very very nice.
