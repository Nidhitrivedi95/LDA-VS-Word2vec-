CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw We never eat Chinese or Japanese in Vegas.  Being from San Francisco there is no need to spend $19 on a chicken dish, when you know you can get it at home for $10.  With that said, I don't know why decided to give Noodles a try.  It's not a full on Chinese restaurant, but had a good offerings on the menu, so in we went.

It's a nicely decorated restaurant.  We ordered some noodles and dumplings - they were not that good.  Most of it was pretty salty.   We haven't been back since.

We did see Alice Cooper dining with his family at a nearby table - that was the highlight.
