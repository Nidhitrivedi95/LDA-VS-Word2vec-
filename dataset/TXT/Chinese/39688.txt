awZx3Y1PAwhCUpt3WGZhKg I came here to eat around midnight, seems like a typical HK restaurant.

I ordered curry beef on rice; it was very salty and was not what I have expected it to be, there were a lot of tendon on the beef, some were not too chewable. I would not recommend getting this dish. Their radio was very static-sounded. Maybe I would give it another try in the future and order something else. One thing I liked about the place was the speed of their service.
