Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA If this is the one in the Planet Hollywood I really loved this - they have a gluten free menu that rocks and people that really treat you right.  Yea, it's a chain but the food is consistently good here and for those who don't want a lot of crap in their food, it's nice the PFCs actually thought through a gluten free menu option. Kudos PFCs.

Try the lemon infused brussel sprouts and the pea pods sautee'd in garlic (not sauce).

3 stars because it's a chain...
