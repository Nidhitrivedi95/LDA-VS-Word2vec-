6TLIuls4SiG9VFf2U42p1A I am giving this place 3.5 stars, but am rounding it up to 4 because it's one of those places that has potential to be a lot better.  Anyone who goes here needs to know that it will have growing pains.  Here's the rundown:

1. Pho noodles are thick (fresh) -- I consider this to be a very very good thing.  If you want thin packaged dry noodles, you can ask for them (barf).

2. Noodles are nice but the broth is a bit bland.  This is very common for those pho broths that don't use MSG (see Ossington joints).  This broth could use more star anise and maybe more bones to give it a fuller flavor.  MSG haters will probably enjoy this a lot.  I like MSG in my soup, so it was slightly disappointing.

3. Staff was super nice and the decor is modern and ridiculously clean.  They even have a shower for their staff to use.  I got a peak at it and it's straight up ballah!

4. Fried rice.  What the hell?  Ok, my friend ordered this.  Was quite good actually for fried rice.  Not really my thing.

5. Spring rolls (fried) were nice.  Not overly greasy, extremely large or too small.  Good size and fresh.

6. Cold rolls (with shrimp) was ok.  The wrap had a bit of oil on it and it was a little firmer than I would have liked.  Another second in warm water would easily solve that problem.

7. Decent location for a pho joint.  There's not many options of this genre in the area.

8. As a side -- their main chef was not there that day, this may have affected the quality of the food slightly, and one menu item (banh xeo/Vietnamese crepe) wasn't available.

9. As another side -- the menu opens left to right!  I felt right at home.  It is also much more abbreviated than the menus you see at other Viet places, but I am sure they would accommodate you for items not on the menu.  As I recall, there was no Vietnamese language on the menu either.

Will definitely check it out again.
