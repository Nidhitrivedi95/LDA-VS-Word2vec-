Mca0HEKs8Xfa4VimLD1uGQ Having dinner with my brother and didnt want to drive anywhere. We order beef and chicken lo mien some crab angels and egg rolls. The beef was really good to much sauce though (so ask for lite sauce) The lo mien was ok needs something. the egg rolls tasted like they had pepper in them good with the sweet and sour sauce. crab angels tasted like they were just fried wontons no crab inside. But ok for a fast dinner.
