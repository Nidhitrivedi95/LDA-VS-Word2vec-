eu8jdbhsPfjNJqFL7Yn1SA Just a heads up to all military members, you have to specifically ask for a military discount even if in uniform. Apparently it's a "new rule" to deter the employees from just giving discounts to random people. Makes total sense...

Update: Now you have to show ID while in uniform after you ask for military discount. Cause apparently there are people who spend $200 on a uniform and get a fake CAC just to get a discount at this specific Panda Express. Sounds like some employees and managers need some training.
