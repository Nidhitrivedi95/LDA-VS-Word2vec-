CGgUHkAKU0QBsdGvXxfMuw Ok. So, I ordered from Mr. Wong's Chinese Food about 5 minutes ago; delivery style. I've had a strange relationship with this greasy spoon the few months I've hit them up for eats. Some days the food is insanely good and really cheap. Today was one of those days. 

Love Wong's. They go above and beyond with there delivery service. The sweet little old lady that served me, took 20 mins out of her day to find my apartment. I was running around looking for her, and she was doing the same for me.

She could have left. :) I tipped her well for being so sweet. Made my day.

I got 2 lunch specials. Pepper steak and Shrimp/Veggies Combo.
Delicious. And I have to put in my 2 cents for the egg rolls. Best I ever had. I always want more after I finished a little baggie of them. All in all; I love this place and even if they have off days, if I'm over by Metro and want cheap eats, this is the place to be.
