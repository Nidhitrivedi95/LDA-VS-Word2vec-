Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw Horrible service. We came here for a late dinner last night. When we walked in the waiter opened the menus and laid them on the counter and said to take our time and asked if we'd like some water. I told him we'd like to sit down, as this is a sit down restaurant and we had no intention of getting our food to go. We ordered and while we were waiting another elderly couple came in, and were immediately seated like normal. They received their food before us, and were offered drinks besides water, but that's not even my complaint. After about 40 minutes the waiter brought our food out in to go boxes! Never once did we say our meal was to go, and I think it was pretty obvious we wanted to sit and eat! It was absolutely obnoxious, and I really don't understand why we were treated that way. With that said, the food was very good. But we will never be returning here because of the poor service.
