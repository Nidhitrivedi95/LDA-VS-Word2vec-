1czIVv2iyOHc3WMgtUWXCQ I liked this place, the ambiance is clean and neat.  The waitstaff was distracted and needed a polish to etiquette in her verbal discourse with customers. 

The food was good and different in the presentation.  It was excellent!  I asked for shrimp fried rice.  The fried rice appeared toasted and the departure from my expectation was pleasing.  The shrimp and vegetables were perfectly prepared and I will return to order the meal again. 

All in all, it was a nice neighborhood lunch!
