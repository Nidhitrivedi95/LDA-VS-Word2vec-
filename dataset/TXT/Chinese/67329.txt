EMh5InDTEfGGCowRy_pJZA Hmmmmmmmm... Where to start with this one. As far as hot pot places go. I can't really say anything bad about this place. Its clean, service was good (but our waitress didn't speak an ounce of english), meat and veggies were fresh and the inclusion of seafood in the price is nice. But that's about all I can say. The biggest disappointment was the lack of sauces to create your marinade. All we got was soy and garlic. We had to ask for vinegar, and nothing else was really available. For that reason alone, I can't give it more than 3 stars. As fresh as the food was, having only soy to dip it in killed it for me. Pricing was average, but to me there are plenty of better places to have hot pot than here.
