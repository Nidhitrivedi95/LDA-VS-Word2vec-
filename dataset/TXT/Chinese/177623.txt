wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA If you are sick of the touristy Vegas food, Kashiyaki Inoyo is a great place for something different. The food is very unique, flavorable and has a wide range of tastes.  The staff is also very freindly and the atmoshpere is cool and cozy.  The bone marrow specialty is amazing at a very reasonable price and yakitori is top notch. My favorite were the scallops (no need for bacon) and squid tentacles.  Also, the snow crab fried rice is definitely a must. If your in Vegas and want something different, this is the place.
