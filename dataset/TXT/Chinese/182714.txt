xjlMlnxWqMd3FGODA_z1NA We were here during my daughter's marching band competition at Las Vegas High School and we wanted to get some fast, cook-to-order Chinese food. We ordered3 lunch special, 2-combination Kung Pao with chow mein and fried rice and Mongolian beef with fried rice. They all were good and we got a lot of food. I've been to a few China A Go Go location but this one seems to have better and more portion of food. We were surprised. The restaurant itself looked very inviting for a sit down place if you wanted to eat there. It was clean. I would definitely go back if we were near there.
