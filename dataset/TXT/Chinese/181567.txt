XE97VxjZoRxV6IM05grY0g Classic American-Chinese fare. We lived in the DeForest area for more than a dozen years, so Sizzling Hut is the hometown Chinese restaurant we measure all others by.  The owner is friendly and the menu offers a lot of variety.  Our favorites include standards like hot & sour soup, sesame chicken, Governor's chicken, and potstickers -- but you really can't go wrong.  Whenever we're in the Madison area, we go out of our way to have a meal here.
