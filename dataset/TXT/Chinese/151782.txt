t_SvwKRaMyNHj2NOMvMv1Q Delicious meal.  Great prices.  The shrimp tempura was amazing.  They were very kind to make a special roll for my daughter.       I had the dragon roll.  Delicious avocado roll, miso soup, low mein vegetables were huge.  

Friendly service! Super prices. Fast delivery. Very clean!  I would go there again and again and again.  Delicious!
