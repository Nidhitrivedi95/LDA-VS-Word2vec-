Yes I could have gone to Chinatown to fulfill this need but I wanted to venture out and see what else was around me. So I walked into to this cozy little joint with an open mind and taking into account what the rest of the Yelpers recommended. 

First off, lunch for $5.95 is a deal considering the portion size of their lunch plates! The owner and her son? were very nice and accommodating. She gave me a schpill about how they make their own soy sauce, garlic chili paste and chili oil. Wow this place sounded really authentic and made me look even more forward to trying their food! So on to the food..

First up, you get your choice of egg drop or hot & sour soup. I settled on egg drop. When the cup came out, I noticed how hearty the soup looked as it had peas and carrots, chunks of tofu and egg strands. This has to be good right? Wrong. The soup was flavorless and really thick. I thought adding their homemade soy sauce would help. Wrong again. Their soy sauce had no sodium. That's ok, there's nothing a little Sriracha won't fix.

Next, my General Chicken with Chicken Fried Rice plate appeared. Again pretty big portion size. Bite into the chicken..ouch I almost lost a tooth. These suckers were overcooked. I thought maybe the rice would redeem the meal. I do have to give the rice kudos because it was actually pretty decent. It was moist and fluffy. Actually had a good flavor to it. If you added soy sauce or chili, it would suck it right up. 

So overall the atmosphere and service were great. I was disappointed in the General chicken and soup. Maybe I came on a bad day? But I felt that the fried rice did redeem the meal. Perhaps on my next visit, I'll try a different dish to see if it changes my opinion.
