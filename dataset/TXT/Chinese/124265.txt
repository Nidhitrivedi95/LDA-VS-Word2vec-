oQwadWTYQWahuj9N-68yPA This restaurant does not get any credit probably for it's poor location, or lack of advertisement. I literally live across from mandarin express, and have always been skeptical about giving it a try. Parents were in town and suggested Chinese food for dinner. I was extremely lazy that day and figured I should try mandarin express since it was only seconds from my house.
  
The place is very small, and looked closed because they never have the doors open. Don't get discouraged, and try it! I was actually surprised at how good the food was. Since the place is not busy, they make everything fresh right after ordering. Along with great food, I found the lady there to be very nice (she's not too fluent in eng, however she was very nice).
  Will be going here from now on to get my Chinese food.
