CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I really like Noodles. I have always gotten good service, very polite and efficient. I have waited outside in line for almost an hour. They get very busy at peak dinner hours. 

The food is quite delicious and pretty authentic. I've had their beef noodle soup, which is excellent. Tender beef slices and soft noodles in a tasty beef broth with plenty of bok choy veggies. 

I also like their dan dan noodles, not too spicy (a shame) but well seasoned and flavorful. 

I love their chinese broccoli cooked garlic style. A true testament to the Cantonese dish's origins. Very very well done. Probably the best I've ever had anywhere. 

I also love that they have warm soy milk. Mmmm. 

A tad expensive, but what in Vegas isn't?
