Q_Iia5C2quTUVfE5_8jObw Wait time takes about 45 mins and this was for 3 dishes plus 2 rices. We ordered the Spare ribs with black bean sauce (6/10), the chow mein (5/10) and the curry chicken (3.5/10), and that took 45 mins wait time at around 1:30PM. If it is "busy hour" and they were slow with the staffs, informing us when we were at the front waiting to be seated, would've been appreciated - it was never mentioned to us.

When the spare ribs came out and we weren't sure it was ours, we asked if this was the item we ordered and the man who took the order got PISSED! He must've been hungry or something, but I really don't understand how "is this the xxx dish?" can get someone that mad. From his reaction, I bet the tables close-by thought I had called his mom a name!

Overall, thumbs down. WAY WAY DOWN!
