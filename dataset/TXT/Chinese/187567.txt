yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Went here on Christmas Day with my little brother and his girlfriend's family. Parking sucks, as this restaurant is in a strip mall, and some people just don't know how to park. Period. 

It was very packed for the time we went in, which was about 8 or so, so we had to wait a little while for an open table. I think we were seated first before a few other groups because we were a larger group. The menu isn't exactly anything to go ga-ga over, as their cuisine ranked about the same as most Pho restaurant's I've been to, but they do get major points for being open all night. 

The food came out quickly and was piping hot, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Worth a second trip? I think so.
