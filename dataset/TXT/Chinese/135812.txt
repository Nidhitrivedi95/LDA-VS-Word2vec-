QDJBn7I1EdtP9w4nYT24Pw As I'm rating this bear in mind there are Chinees restuants on every corner.  I am comparing it to these casual places.  That being said I'm sad I moved 2 miles away because I can't get it delivered anymore.  I miss their Teriyaki Chicken and Crab Puffs.  I miss the convenience and the friendly delivery guy. I only went to the actual restaurant once but I got delivery all the time.  I hope you like it too.
