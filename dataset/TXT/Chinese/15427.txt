3PsmvwxetLz1Tzb-6mNhgA When we first entered, we were seated immediately, but then had to wait ten minutes for water, let alone other drinks. When I ordered a soda, the waiter forgot it. The brown rice was spongy and had to be returned (wasn't just me; my wife agreed). The fruit they gave as a side order for my son's meal was supposed to be blueberries and raspberries, but they more resembled mush. The chef and/or waiter were obviously making no effort to impress. The ribs were great, the Lo Mein was good, and the Sesame Chicken and Wonton Soup were tiny servings and good (not great). We were also served the ribs without any plates, so we had to wait five minutes to eat them, which led to lukewarm ribs. After all this I anticipated some kind of credit, but to no avail. I don't care about the money. I just told myself that if they make an effort, I will return. If not, I won't. They didn't make an effort. I will not return, nor would I recommend this restaurant to anyone. The decor is excellent. Otherwise, you're overpaying for decent-to-good food (not great) and subpar service.
