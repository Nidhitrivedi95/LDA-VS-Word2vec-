X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg This club needs some women.  I felt really out of place...

Cons = biggest con is that its 95% men, its all just a bunch of mega drunk bachelor parties being wasted in their VIP booths, insane long line up, expensive drinks, nowhere to sit which is annoying when you're in heels

Pros = line up moves relatively fast (just under an hour), fantastic DJs, great light show, no line up in the women's washroom because there are no women in the club
