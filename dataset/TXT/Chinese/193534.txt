ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ I like to research a restaurant before trying it and I was super excited to eat here. I went there tonight with my bf and all in all, I found it disappointing.

They cram the people in like sardines, with tables literally having maybe a foot in between one another. It was also incredibly loud. So much so that we had to ask our server repeatedly to reiterate what he was saying while also hearing the conversations, word for word, of everyone in a ten foot perimeter. How romantic.

Now to the food. 

I got the Kung Pao Wings and what I received was...odd. Here I was thinking they'd be like every other chicken wing that I've had at a restaurant. Nope. They serve you the ENTIRE wing: tip, joints, and all. So you get this big, awkward, boney wing with sticky sauce all over. So as I'm trying to figure out how to eat this thing, the sauce gets everywhere; only part of the wing itself is crispy and the other part is fatty and mushy, and overall it was the biggest letdown of the night. I love chicken wings and this was a big disappointment. Staff of Clever Koi: warn people when ordering this dish! My server saw my struggles but clearly did not care or try to make things easier. Thanks man.

Next I got the Pork Belly ramen and my bf got the broccolini and beef. The ramen was okay. In my opinion there were too many flavors trying to vie for attention and not all of them were good. The broccolini and beef was delicious, although there were maybe only 3 pieces of beef in the entire bowl. Being a foodie, I hate expecting good things from a restaurant only to be severely let down and out a good chunk of change. Not sure if I'll be back.
