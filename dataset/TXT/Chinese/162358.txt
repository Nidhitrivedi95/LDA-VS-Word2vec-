I totally agree with you guys, this place is really good and they are VERY generous on their portions. I took the combo with the beef noodle soup. The soup was good with fresh noodles & ingredients. Served quickly. Definitely one of the best soup noodle places in Montreal.  The place is small so during peak hours it will be full. 

Until the next meal... salutation
