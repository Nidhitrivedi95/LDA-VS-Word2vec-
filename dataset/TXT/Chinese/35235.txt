Ae-eZJr2njTu9XOPOF8z2Q I love Spicy and I love Noodle.

Hei Xiao Mian just opens at Midland and McNicoll right next to Jim Chai Kee. 

The interior decor is nice and trendy. Clean as it is still new. 

Menu is simple with a choice of noodle or rice bowls. You can pick how spicy it is (or non spicy at all) plus the chewiness of noodle (soft or hard). And the best thing is Free additional noodles if you are a bigger eater.

Beef Sirloin Noodle Extra Numb ($10.95) 
The beef is of good quality and tender!! The noodles has a good bite. And yes it was spicy....... 

Since most of the spiciness is by adding chili oil so it can be quite oily. (Pro Tip: Don't play with your phone while eating!!)

During lunch hour, it took quite awhile for the food to be ready (+15 minute), I hope you have a long lunch break.
