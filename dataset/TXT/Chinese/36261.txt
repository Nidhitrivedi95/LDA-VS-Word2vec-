Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Solid 3 1/2 stars but I'm on a rounding down kick so giving this place 3 stars. I went mid-week at 6:30pm with two friends, and we had a myVegas deal where you get $50 off when you spend $100. We ordered the kale and quinoa dip for an appetizer, and it was surprisingly good. We shared two different sushi rolls, and the orange peel chicken. The chicken was so-so, too heavy on the batter, but a good portion size. The rolls were great, very pretty and tasty as well!

I had some sort of cocktail but can't remember now LOL. Must not have been too remarkable!

Overall the service was good and the food was good, but if we'd actually paid $100 for our meal I would have felt I'd been ripped off. For $50 it was a bargain though!

So a good place to go if you've got a coupon, or don't care about how much things cost. I'd stick with the sushi rolls though!
