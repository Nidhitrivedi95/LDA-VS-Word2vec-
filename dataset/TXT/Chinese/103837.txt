Kn57RIWAdnVfJHI1loLXOQ Honestly the food is delicious and the portions are huge. A plate of fried rice and a meat dish will be enough to feed 4 people easily. That being said, the service is horrific and leads a lot to be desired. 

The waiter me and my friends had was very rude to us when we requested to have our plain rice to go. He told us not to eat it in the restaurant and he said it in an angry way. I do not understand why this is even an issue to begin with. If we wanted to eat some of that in the restaurant, he should not make a big deal about it and let us be. 

Honestly when I think about it, I will just do takeout from this place from now on. The restaurant interior is nothing amazing and its too loud and crowded with so many families and big groups.
