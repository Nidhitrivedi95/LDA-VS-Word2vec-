5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ The combination of substandard food and high price warrant the one star rating. I should have checked Yelp before trying this place. The low rating would have kept us away.

We started with a spicey tuna hand roll and an order of snapper sushi.  They both tasted okay, but the price was really high.  We then had a noodle with shrimp dish and chinese broccoli.  Neither was very good.  

We did not order drinks or desert.  With the sushi and two entrees our bill was over $60.  For the quality of the food the price was way too high.
