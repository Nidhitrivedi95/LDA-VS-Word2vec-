bsjBLLHR4TMVR5eAeLAI9w Simply awesome place, good service, not great but friendly enough. Dim Sum crowds a plenty which means you know the food is yummy to the last bite, ofcourse according to personal taste. I love anything Chinese especially Dim Sum. Anyways it was my bff's birthday so I thought I take her to a Sunday brunch in Chinatown, can't go wrong taking a Chinese girl to Dim Sum , truth is was just as much for me as it was for her lol. Food was excellent , fresh, luke warm to hot, and plenty of choices. My Dim Sum go to restaurant for this local girl.
