Se63tFm5tLlO5wuUlyww8Q Tonight was so good. The sashimi was cut perfect again , last time it was frozen and cut bad. But the mgr made it right. 

I  get the rolls which are always consistently on point. 

They have so much delicious food I wish I could try it all. 

You won't be sorry if you give it a try.
