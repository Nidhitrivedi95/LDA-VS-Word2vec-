lkM72Y21bjBqUGaW7iL7tQ A very fair seafood restaurant that deserves a very fair rating on Yelp lol.

The food is good and tasty, and the service is pretty fast. Most of the dishes that I've had there come in generous portions, and they taste, as the Yelp review says, "A-OK"! Good for big groups! We used to come here for our family dinners every week, so iz guuud.
