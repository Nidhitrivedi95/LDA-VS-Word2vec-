MBirSnTW4pt2k7Ny6KC72w Szechuan Express is a solid place for cheap, quick, Chinese food. It looks exactly like the hole-in-the-wall places that line Clemente Street in San Francisco.  Just walk up to the counter, place your order, then take a seat or wait around to carry out. 

The food here is not gonna blow you away with high quality or uniqueness, but for $5 it will surely fill you up. The garlic sauce tastes very similar to the chili sauce, but again, for $5 don't bring in unrealistic expectations. Its a bit grungy inside, so if you need it to be super clean to eat somewhere then maybe you should choose another spot.

A couple good dishes are: beef noodle soup, double cooked pork, and chicken with garlic sauce. 

The staff is extremely friendly too. I usually stop in around 2 a couple days a week for lunch and the dude who works there is always laughing and having a good time with the customers.
