Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw My friend and I went and the food was delicious and service was great too! We ordered the Orange chicken, Mongolian beef and house fried rice..all so yummy! We also got the fried wontons but it wasn't all that great and the soda he ordered was flat but again the main course was delicious. The service was great. They serve you and plate your food. Our waitress was pleasant. We will definitely go back.
