AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA My fiance and I came here a few weeks back because our vegan friends rave about this place. Our experience was not that great unfortunately. We were greeted quickly and seated. Drink orders were taken, but after that it took forever to get the water and iced tea and even longer to get someone to take our order. We ordered the 4 Item Cold Dish Combo with
"BBQ Meat", Spring Roll, Seaweed Salad, & Fried Wonton. For $13.00 this was very tiny portions which were overall good but I was still hungry afterwords! He ordered the walnut "shrimp" and it was decent as well but again the portion was small. After we got our food, no one ever came back to check on us or even refill our drinks! We sat there trying to get someones attention for quite a long time. Our waitress finally came over and did not apologize she just asked us if we wanted desert, we declined and then asked for the check. After we gave her cash, we waited on our change for what seemed like another eternity. Needless to say, the food may have been worth going back since all of our friends like this place, but service like that makes me not want to ever come back.
