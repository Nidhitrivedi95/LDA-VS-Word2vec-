6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q When I'm in Vegas doing meetings I like to go here because it's fast, the menu is great and the food is solid. 

It's right off the casino, but you feel a world away because the decor is so nice. it's very authentic as well, with dishes like gai lan (chinese broccoli) and soup dumplings. 

the duck was excellent, but the pork belly was just over the top. not their fault, it's just that it was literally all fat. kind of gross after one bite.
