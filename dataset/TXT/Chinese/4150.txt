_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg They're under new ownership and the menu has completely changed. It's a small place and there isn't a lot of seating for parties of two. We had to share the table with another party which wasn't a big deal. The service isn't amazing but I don't go to Chinese restaurants expecting that. The Shanxi style handmade noodles are TRULY AMAZING. I can't stress how good they are. There is no noodle in all of Arizona as good as this dish. Also it's a bit spicy so beware. Definitely will be back! Also the only place in AZ that has <U+8089><U+5939><U+998D>.
