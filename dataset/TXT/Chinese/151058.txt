sYDc1TENwCKLHvprBa5rLw I have ordered delivery three times in the past few months, and they delivered before the estimated time.  The food was nice and hot.  Since I am from the East coast this is the best Chinese I have found since moving to Scottsdale.  My favorites are the Cheese Wontons, Chicken with Broccoli and Sweet & Sour Chicken.  Their sweet and sour sauce is really good so I always ask for extra.
