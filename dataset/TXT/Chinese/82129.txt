H75ud6IWd0lsbclqb_H0Aw The food was great and the owner was really nice! We had a pretty large group and they were able to accommodate our order and quickly replenish food when we ordered more. The owner also saved us from a potential scam. When we left the restaurant, some guy accused one my friends of hitting his car - we didn't - and he was pressuring him and wouldn't stop harassing him. Then the owner came and got involved and got the guy off our backs. Thank you!!! 

I recommend the chow mein - any of them - and the fried rice.
