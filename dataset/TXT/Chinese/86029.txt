hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q I'm always on the lookout for a good Sushi place, this one opened up close to home and I wasn't sure what to think.  My wife and I went in for a lunch on a day we didn't have the 2 year old, and boy am I glad we didn't have her.  It's more traditional seating, open back booths, I think we would have trouble keeping the 2 year out of everyone else's space.  But the food was great, lunch was ideal, few customers, lower prices and we opted to try several new things.  I did the 3 Rolls Lunch Special which includes Miso Soup and salad, both of which were very good.  The list of selectable rolls was pretty short, but still good, I went with the traditional Spicy California, Shrimp Tempura and Spicy Tuna, all of which were very good.  My wife selected a Mongolian Beef Lunch Special, which I honestly didn't like and would not order again, typical poor selection of beef that is used, but he spices didn't taste good to me at all, so we'll be on the look out for other Bento boxes to get the next time.  Service was good, the waiter warmed up to use as we asked questions and everything went over very well.
