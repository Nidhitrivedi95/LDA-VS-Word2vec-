JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A Just average korean food. Kalbi was too dry & overall not worth the money. Kalbi Tang was also not the best. Ddok boki was just alright. The banchan was the best part of our meals. Waitress didn't want to serve us dessert so we left to get dessert else. Service was below average.
