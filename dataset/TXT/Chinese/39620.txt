awQmoQI2TRAt7VdeRKOR1Q Keep going there and every time I wonder why.  Probably, the first few times, it was good.  But I can confidently say that it is not good anymore.  Went there for lunch today (for the last time) it was awful.  Not much to do withThai food, more cheap American Chinese.  
The place was also empty on a Friday noon...  Should tell you something.  

For three of us for the lunch menu: $140+ tip - one bottle of average wine.  It 10pm and I am still feeling the food.  Not a good feeling...
