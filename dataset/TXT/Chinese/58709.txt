dF-_fcrNyk4iZ5Pc1mr-wA Great service and really fresh delicious food! The egg rolls were amazing, chunks of pork and veggies instead of the normal mush. General Tsao and Walnut Chicken we're both really fresh chicken with terrific sauces. Plenty of food for the price and quiet atmosphere- very clean.
