CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw My friends and I ate here in April on a Friday night, after the "O" show ended.  We wanted some Asian food, saw the name "Noodles" and we were sold.  We went in expecting the food to taste Westernized, but it was actually pretty good.  The restaurant was pretty full, but we were seated within 15 mins.  

I saw "Laksa Curry Noodle" on the menu and my eyes lit up.  I still reminisce about the authentic and oh-so-good food I had while in Malaysia, so I was looking forward to trying the version here.  

The bowl was full of chunks of chicken breast, fish "cake" slices, an egg, a load of noodles, and creamy curry sauce.  Although it wasn't as authentic as the laksa noodle dishes I had in Malaysia, Noodles' version is pretty good.  Of course the price ($18) is a bit steep for a bowl of noodles, but it's to be expected since it's located inside the lovely Bellagio (see pic).

My friends ordered the Vietnamese Seafood Pho (just ok, not authentic enough) and the Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle (nice hearty flavor).  

I would eat here again if I was too lazy to catch a cab to the plethora of Asian restaurants located on Spring Mountain Road (off the strip).
