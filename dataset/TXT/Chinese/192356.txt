Z2xuK4BbrD0Qr9dAs7oTVw Newcomers to the area. We were looking for a Chinese restaurant that tasted better than the usual mall stops. We came to Yelp and found this place and boy were those reviews correct! It's definitely a small restaurant but it was nice and clean. The young lady working the counter was very friendly and helpful. We placed our order while we were there and just waited in the car so out food was hot when we got it and by the time we drove home to Indian Trail it was still hot by the time we got the kids out the car, hands cleaned, and seated to eat. We ordered beef and broccoli,R egg rolls, and egg drop soup. Everything was delicious !!!!
