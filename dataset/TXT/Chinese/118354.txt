-No other desert options besides the ice cream
-Flies

I was going to do 1 star but I gave it an extra one because they were so attentive when getting our beverages and clearing plates away.  I would not visit again or recommend anyone to go.

PS. for those who give it more then 2 stars you all are smoking way too much weed.
