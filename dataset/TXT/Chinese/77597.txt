Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA My go to place for authentic and delicious Thai food! This place is so good! I used to go to Archi's for thai food but after discovering Thai Style Noodle House, I have not stepped foot in the former. It's also a plus that this place is right next to my house. There is another Thai Style Noodle House location in chinatown but this one is about a 5-7 minute drive from my house. The portions are pretty generous for Thai food. If you eat a lot of Thai food, you'll know that the servings area always tiny. This place is the total opposite. The plates are always full and very affordable. ~$50 could feed my whole family (4) with left overs. Another reason I love this place is because it's very family oriented. Everyone here is really nice and they're always coming around to make sure everything is alright even though it's always packed when I go. It's nice to see how attentive they are, especially since their staff is very small.

My favorite dish here is the Pad See Eu with beef. MMM. I am salivating just thinking about it! A second favorite is the spicy eggplant with tofu. I usually get the spice level at a medium so it's not too overpowering. The duck fried rice is a good option too! Oh and don't forget the squid salad, potstickers, and last but not least... the mango sticky rice! It is absolutely AMAZING!! I could go on and on about the different food items that I love here. The only thing i wasn't a fan of here was their thai iced coffee and thai iced tea. They were good but a little too sweet for my taste. Not a big deal though. I can't wait to come back here for a feast!

Oh yeah, they also do delivery but I believe it's only within a 3 mile radius.
