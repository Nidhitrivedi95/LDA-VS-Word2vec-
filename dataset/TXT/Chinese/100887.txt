K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw Great authentic Malaysian food! Tried the curry laksa with vermicelli and it was really good! Will be back again! Be warned, you will have to wait a bit for your food sometimes, I called beforehand and waited 25 min for my 2 Laksa.... worth the wait! And a big portion of food!
