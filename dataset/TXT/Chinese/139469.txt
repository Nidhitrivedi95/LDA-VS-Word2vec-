qwt9fL28iSpaWyF5pgNd8w Well my wife just picked up some dinner for us since she was running late from work. Unfortunately it just went in the trash. This was the worst food I have had In my mouth in years. I have been eating Panda for many years and have never had any thing like this before. It is terrible.  I am a fan of Panda but will never eat at this one again.  This is my second bad experience at this location.
