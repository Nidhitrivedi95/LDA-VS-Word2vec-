dKOrxsz6ygqa-AatwzpKyQ It took an hour to get the table. We almost left; I mean, the prices are horrific for dim sum, and the service is just awful.

This restaurant/banquet hall isn't anything special; the atmosphere is nice I guess, it's probably what you're paying for anyway. 

The food is "okay." It isn't anything great or superb - the pork buns we had weren't even hot. Luke-warm at best... 

Overall, I don't recommend this restaurant - apart from if you want to go to somewhere with decent atmosphere. 2/5 stars rating.
