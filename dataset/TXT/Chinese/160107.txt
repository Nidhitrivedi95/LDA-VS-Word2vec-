U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q So far my experiences at this restaurant have been very good.  I can understand that the decor is a hit or miss situation.  Those fish I tend to focus more on the food though, and this place did very well in my book.   I love their Shiu-Mai and the Salt & Pepper Fried Chicken.  I have also tried a few of the Noodle dishes, braised beef, soya chicken, roast duck and a few of the fried rice dishes ( regular, beef, seafood).  Mostly good dishes, nothing really as pleasing to my palate as the Shiu-Mai and Fried Chicken that I favor.  

Service has been very good mostly.  I still have not had a bad experience with service so far.  Every now and then you get the emotionally closed off server who seems just a little too professional and exhibits little personality, but I find that in most cases a little bit of friendliness on my part goes a long way to fixing that problem.

Portions are a little on the small side.  The one thing I can't get over is that charge for a small bowl of steamed rice. /sadface  But if you're not a big rice eater like me then you should have no problem there.
