The owner, took our order and my mother ordered the baked pork chop spaghetti. They've mistaken and gave my mom baked pork chop over rice. They were wonderful to replace it. However it is not baked. It looks like they just cooked the noodles and dump the sauce & chicken over the noodles. That's it. It wasn't baked at all and you can tell. We even asked the server if it was baked.. it's really not and the way he answered was whatever too. The proper way is to have it baked in the oven. 

Other than that we ordered vegetable, salt & pepper fish fillet , and cubed beef rice plate.
