fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A I have had Chinese food all over the country and my mom's, this place is average.  Went there for dinner, food was okay but service was rude.  They ran out of chicken dumplings and the waiter was rude to us when we were trying to decide on something else to order.   He didn' t even give us a menu to look it over at least.  Rice is an extra charge. We ordered black bean scallops, pan fried noodles with chicken, deep fried shrimp balls, and the chicken/pork dumplings.  Scallop portion was very small, the noodles and dumplings were average.
