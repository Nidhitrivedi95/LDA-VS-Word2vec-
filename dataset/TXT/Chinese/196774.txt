zpaXQga1MIqPc5nAWZXtdQ Probably one of the worst places ever to eat! Service and food was awful. Food was cold there was lack of English within everyone there and our food was incorrect. After I explained to the waitress what I specially wanted several different times, it still was incorrect! Lack of English within everyone there! Just a plan bad experience. Not too say but the restroom has been my friend since I came home. Never again
