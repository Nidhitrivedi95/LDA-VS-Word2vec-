ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Last night my fiancé and I went in to try something new. We cannot brag enough about the atmosphere and kindness we experienced. Our server was Christina and she was so eager to give us advice and direction through the menu. We love food and we love to eat. We cannot wait to go back for some more amazing hospitality. As a fellow bartender and service industry person I am in love with their cocktail menu. So much art is put into the small touches. If you haven't been GO GO GO! Adventures menu with lots to try. Thanks Clever Koi for a memorable experience.
