UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ I'm always pleased with the service here. It's fast and the food is high quality and delicious. They do accommodate healthier options, you just have to ask for sauce on the side or no salt or oil for any of the dishes. The staff was so friendly and nice. I left my to go box on the table and the waitress actually ran out to the end of the parking lot after me to give it to me! I couldn't believe it but it was VERY appreciated! Definitely recommend this place for good family style Asian cuisine!
