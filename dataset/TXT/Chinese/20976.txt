68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw A 15 min walk from stratosphere hotel. We found something Asian to eat and it's very delicous keeping it within the Asian vibe. Ordered the hai nan chicken and roasted chicken and both was very delicous especially the sauces but their portion is small and came with water and drink was off though but okay. Coming back next month again for more. Wish portion can be bigger though.
