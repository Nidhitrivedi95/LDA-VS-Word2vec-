Cbvx1IxPniwo_Ybk4CdIBQ I rarely give 5 stars to anyone, but Tao Tea Leaf is by far my favourite tea shop in Canada. Tao, the owner, is one of the most knowledgeable and helpful person I know in the tea world.

The shop is the best in Canada for Chinese tea. A nice assortment of authentic yixing teapots are also offered.

This is the tea shop to which I compare all other tea shops.
