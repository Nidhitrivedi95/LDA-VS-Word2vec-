W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ Another 2 for 1 coupon from myVegas! So worth it, in my opinion. I looked at other Yelper's photos and knew to order the Poser Ramen. Such beautiful presentation! And there was so much flavor, and the crunchy pork was cooked perfectly, so delicious. The half egg was also nice and soft, as with most ramen places, and I was so in love. By far my favorite ramen place ever now! OH did I mention the loaded fries? It had prosciutto OMG so good. Thin and crispy and salty and flavorful. Yummmm. The sauces were not too spicy but still very tasty - my only complaint is there could have been more of it.

Service was a tad slow, but we had plenty of time at that point. 

My boyfriend wasn't quite as impressed with his ramen. But that doesn't change my opinion.
