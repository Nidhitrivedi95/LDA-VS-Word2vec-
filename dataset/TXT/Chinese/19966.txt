5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ We had a wonderful time at dinner here tonight. I had a really yummy mango flavored drink with jalapeños, my husband had a very smooth cold sake served in ice. I saw they had hamachi served as a roll and asked if they offer hamachi kama. The server informed us that it wasn't on the menu only to return with a generous offer that the chef had it and was willing to make it anyway. ^_^ It was grilled to perfection with crispy salty skin and moist tender meat! With such a great chef, it would make a great addition to the menu! The service was exceptional and we will come back on our next trip.
