Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g This place is excellent! I'm also not sure why people gave it low reviews! If you like authentic Shanghai style food, this place is amazing! 

There aren't even Shanghai style restaurants in LA with this selection! 

The restaurant is very nice inside, and the waiters were very polite to us too!

Regardless, if you pass this place up, you are definitely missing out! AND they DON't use poisonous MSG! 

You don't need MSG if the flavor tastes good in the first place! 

Best Chinese food I've had in Chinatown Las Vegas!
