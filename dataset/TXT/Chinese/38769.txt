AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I wanted to like this place but the service was abominable!! 

We arrived before 9pm and were told that they were closing at 9:30. Okay. We were then reminded every few minutes after that they were closing at 9:30. And I mean e v e r y few minutes! They tried clearing our plates while we were still eating...before 9:30. When it was all said and done they stacked all of our plates at the table and practically kicked us out. Not once did we complain about their behavior and we still left a decent tip. I mean, tbh, it was comical. 

I have worked in restaurants my whole life and I have never had a more unwelcome experience. Needless to say, we won't be back. For everyone else, be sure to get there an hour before closing because they have zero respect for their patrons and give no leeway.

The food was just okay and the decor was dated and well used. They seem to have a lot of 5 star ratings for the food, but, personally, I have had veggie dishes that far exceed the fried, salty, overly sauced dishes prepared here. YMMV.
