7Ry-hEfZwaDXe8u-n6v15A This place is inside the plaza of 330 Highway 7 East. There are big red signs of the restaurant both in English and in Chinese, so it's quite hard to miss.

My friends and I ordered several dishes, all of them are Shanghainese style (keeping to the tradition of eating what they make best).

We ordered two different sets of xiao long bao (You can Google how it looks like). One set is the traditional type with pork inside, and the other set is with crab meat inside. They are both made well, and I would say the one with crab meat is even better. However, the set with crab meat comes in six pieces, whereas the other more traditional set comes in eight pieces. The downside to the xiao long bao is that the skin is kind of weak, and the juice (or soup) from inside easily leak. I've had xiao long bao from other places where the skin remains strong, in-tact, thin and still keeps the juice inside from leaking. Customers need to be mindful about that.

We also ordered duck and beef noodle soup (or my friends like to refer them as "BNS"). The duck is very sweet and well cooked. The BNS is quite different from other BNS I've had in other shanghainese-style restaurant. This kind of BNS uses a more thin type of noodle, very close to a ramen-style noodle. I prefer it this way because it is chewy and thin. Most BNS uses the thick shanghainese noodle (just a tad thinner than udon). I know that some of my friends prefer the thicker kind.

On top of these dishes, we also ordered Guo Tie (again you can Google this) and spicy tofu. Guo Tie is a deep fried dumpling that has pork inside it. The Guo Tie served from this restaurant is massive and comes in four pieces. The spicy tofu isn't the kind of crispy type that I prefer. 

Last but not least, we ordered dessert and it is a big giant doughnut-like food with egg and red beans inside. I believe it is one of the only few desserts that they serve in their menu and it is worth a try.
