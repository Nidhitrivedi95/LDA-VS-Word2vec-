VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q This is the place to go whenever I want noodle soup :). I love their laksa soup! It's soo good, makes me regret it a little when I'm dying from the heat bit I love the flavor. 

When I'm not feeling spicy, I just have their original fish base. Honestly, I've never ate anything else here lol. 

Service is quick and food is always consistent. They're always busy! Even late at night. 

10% off sometime in the afternoon and after 9pm. Please double check, not sure if they'll change the policy in the future.
