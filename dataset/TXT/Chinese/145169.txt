rXVLgV4Og3l98OTy6N2dJw Best place for wonton noodle, and I love their beef brisket, it goes well with rice noodle and vermicelli.  If you like the HK style type of noodle, this is the place to go.  I really should give them 5 stars, but that 1 star get taken away is they always close on Wednesday, I believe it's a family tradition or something, and co-incident, I always work from home on the Wednesday, so when I have the craving of a bowl of wonton noodle on a Wednesday, I am out of luck.  Anyways, I probably visit this place at least 4~5 times a month, and their service is always consistent.
