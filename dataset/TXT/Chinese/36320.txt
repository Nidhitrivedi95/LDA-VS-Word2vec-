Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg This restaurant is located in the Luxor Hotel and Casino on the upper level. It is very "open" and not very secluded. The tables/seats were a bit unusual in the dining areas so I sat at the bar which was long and not busy (about three others were sitting at the bar all spaced out) for a Sunday afternoon. When I approached the hostess about seating at the bar she was a bit annoying about being 21. I understand that I look 12 but you do not be annoying about it. I ignored her and went straight to the bar. Why would I show the hostess my ID when I will just be bugged for it again at the bar? I don't understand people...

Anyways... The food here is overpriced and the portions in my opinion were a bit off. The bartender was unkempt and sniffling (gross) as well as complaining about other restaurants in the Casino, stating that the T&T Bar wouldn't last more than a year. Why do I care and why are you telling me about this? I already am in here paying for an overpriced miso soup (I have never paid over $3.00 for a relatively large portion of miso) and my boyfriend's sesame chicken was gross and COLD. His chicken was actually served COLD. He was too hungry for me to say anything so he ate all of it. But in the end we would tell everyone to go to PJ Changs or Pei Wei over this place.
