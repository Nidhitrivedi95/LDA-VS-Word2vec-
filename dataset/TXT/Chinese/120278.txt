O_Yi95nUeeqSudiMlUfttQ Stopped by for a late lunch...Was seated quickly, given a menu, a glass of water and was able to place my order within minutes of arriving as my waiter was attentive to his tables... This is quite a change from my other experience in Chinatown on this visit to Montreal... Ordered BBQ Pork on Rice and a large Mango Bubble Tea...The waiter put a plate on the table with fork and knife without any prompting.... Not that I need a fork and knife, I am very adept with chopsticks, but a nice touch just the same...Food was promptly served, excellent pork, with pickled onion and broccoli to go along with the rice... The pork was a little fatty compared to some of the places I eat at in Toronto but this is Montreal after all.... Clean restaurant with good service and reasonable pricing...
