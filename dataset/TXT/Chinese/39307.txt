Av5toUG7wweXfiX6FW4F0A This review is really only for the pho and customer service as that is all we had. By far one of the best bowls of pho that we have had. The flavor of the broth is on point which is key to a good pho. We showed up with about 30 min to close and they were super nice and very attentive to all of our needs. Great little hidden place, we will definitely be back many more times
