The restaurant is in a former mansion that housed a steakhouse. The tables are quite spread apart over a few floors, so it is much quieter than every other Chinese restaurant I've been to. I personally really enjoy the food and think it's quite high quality. I can't say that it is bang for your buck or worth every penny you pay, but you're kind of paying for the atmosphere and experience to. Want to really impress someone with Chinese food? Come here.
