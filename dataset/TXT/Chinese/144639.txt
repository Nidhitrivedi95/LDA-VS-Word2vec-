RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ Very good chinese food. My favorite dish is the tofu+shrimp. Also, the only place in Pittsburgh with pudding flavoured bubble tea (it might be off the menu at this point). It's fairly expensive, but I haven't found it anywhere else and it used to be a fav of mine in Mountain View...
