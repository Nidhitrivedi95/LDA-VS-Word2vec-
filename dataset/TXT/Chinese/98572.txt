JRYRAFTefNrqhjrT7dsWjQ Craig has been amazing!  I have been going to him for years for various things.  I would say that, more than anything else, I have benefited the most with the release of emotional baggage that I had built up.  I think acupuncture is better than massage and the results last much longer.  I always leave feeling relaxed and at peace.  Ask for Stacie's ear treatment.
