vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA We first visited this place in August 2009.  We had seen the billboards around town, but thought the name couldn't reflect an authentic chinese restaurant - but gave it a shot anyway.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was an authentic dim sum restaruant - and inside a casino no less!  The dim sum was not the best we've ever had, but it was above average; certainly better than other places we had tried in Vegas up to that point.  Price was reasonable, and we knew we would be back.  Gave it 4 stars.

UPDATE: 
We returned on 2011-04-16 for dim sum lunch.  Food was still reasonably good, but it seems to have lost a bit in the quality.  They were out of some items we wanted such as har gow (we got there a bit late), and the food overall seemed to lack some seasoning; some of the sauces seemed watered down.  We'll keep coming back to this place for dim sum until we find something better in Vegas, but have lowered the rating to 3 stars.  See my other reviews of other places in Vegas.
