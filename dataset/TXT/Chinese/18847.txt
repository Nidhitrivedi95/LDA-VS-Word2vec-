5GOrW-PkisP0eXlSxy4AFg Really good and cheap new york style chinese. My last favorite chinese place closed down, so for about 2 years I didn't have a chinese place I liked. I don't live near here, but I work nearby, so I tried it one day at lunch and I've been hooked ever since. Since I'm not aware of a good chinese place by my house, I'll sometimes stop here on the way home from work for takeout. 

I'm a seafood fan and so I mostly get their shrimp dishes since their shrimps are large and generously portioned. Veggies are varied, fresh and plentiful. 

The prices are so cheap that if you live in the area, you really should check them out.

PS - they have a website now!
