safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg Still looking for a GOOD ass chinese spot, but for now Golden dragon is the place ta be . The only thing I have had at this place is their afternoon lunch buffet for like 10 bucks, but it's all you can eat, so... ya. They have beef w/ brock, orange chicken, egg drop soup. All the usual chinese dishes. The husband and wife running it are very nice. She will even go around after something is made and say " You like walnut shrimp?" " you want?"... So if ur looking for a good, cheap Buffet.. Come on down, you wont be overly excited, but you also wont leave hungry or dissapointed:)
