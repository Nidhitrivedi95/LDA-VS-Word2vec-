a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg Went for breakfast today and the food was not so good,  ordered the ham steak and eggs came with hash browns and toast,  ordered the eggs sunny side first time they were not cooked one egg completely raw as if they just broken onto the plate while the other was somewhat cooked had to have them over and still under cooked ham steak was ok toast was marble rye coffee was week. Don't see myself eating there again.
