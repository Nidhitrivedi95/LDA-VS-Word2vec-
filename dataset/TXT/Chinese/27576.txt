8cjXEmuqgCbIRudb2D52qw We stopped in for dim sum lunch and to check out this place. I have had Nani on my list for awhile, so I was excited to give it a try. There were two of us and neither of us had been there before. We were seated away from other patrons, so I was unable to see portion size before ordering. The waiter instructed us to get 2 or 3 items each to sample as a table. This was way too much food for 2 people. We were hungry and still brought about 60% of our food home with us. I like leftovers, but some of the dim sum was definitely better to eat fresh (vs later on). The beef crepe was slimy and a weird texture. A lot of crepe and very little filling. The shrimp dumpling with green chive was really good. Lots of flavor from both the shrimp and the chives. The sticky rice in the lotus leaf was very dense and super filling. It was great flavor though! The BBQ pork buns were a little dry for my tastes. My companion gobbled them up though. The pan fried taro cakes were pretty good flavor. They did stagger the items to the table, but by the time that all five were there, I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of food that we had ordered. There definitely was no room left over for dessert.
