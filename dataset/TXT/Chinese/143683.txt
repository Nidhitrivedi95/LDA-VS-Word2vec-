rPshoySU7Xfafoi3S0KDfg Went in on Saturday Evening there were a few patrons already, The staff were extremely helpful but a little difficult in communicating due to an understanding of English,  I and my companion ordered an appetizer, I the seafood rangoon from the Asian menu and my companion from the Greek menu, both came to the table hot and were just o.k. For the main meal my companion ordered the gyro platter, but was disappointed as the gyro meat was        extremely bland and tough and lacking in the sauce. I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli. The flavor of the basil sauce overpowered the mushroom ravioli so mush so I had to remove the sauce to eat the ravioli. All in all the restaurant lacked the wow factor in the food and it was just mediocre   They should defiantly rethink there menu. I would not go there again.
