f0zHPEwKLf3Aguf_IDemRQ Orders: ALMOST EVERYTHING!! LOVED THE SHUHAN NOODLES THOUGH. 

Pros: 
- Zen Salad: cool and tangy/sour. It was a good palate cleanser with all of the spicy goodness! 
- Zhang Fei Chicken: I loved the story behind it (named after a bad tempered general & warrior). The peanut sauce/spicy chili combination made it delicious but deadly! 
- Street wonton: refreshing and fulfilling. Wasn't over seasoned at all 
- Shuhan (Sweaty Cold Noodle): BY FAR MY FAVORITE DISH. Has a little kick to it, but so worth it. 

Cons: 
- Rou-Jia Mo: homemade roast bun with chopped pork. I wasn't a big fan; it seemed like an 'oriental' egg mcmuffin (& I have a particular distaste for fast food).
- House Beef Pancake: came across as bland & lackluster to me. 
- Dandan: I wouldn't say that it was a bad dish, but I wasn't a particular fan of it. My friends seemed to like it though. 

I got the privilege of speaking to the owner of the store. He was very modest and spoke of the 'au naturale' of the store. He mentioned that the restaurant did not utilize any store-bought seasonings. How authentic! 

Thanks to the lovely Alice for planning this collaboration between Toronto Common & Noodle Face Co. If you haven't checked out Toronto Common & are the avid foodie, you're seriously missing out. Toronto Common is similar to 'Winterlicious' or 'Summerlicious'. Basically, you're given bite sized portions of a variety of menu items. This allows you to get a little taste of everything and figure out what you love about the restaurant. Those Shuhan noodles are calling my name...
