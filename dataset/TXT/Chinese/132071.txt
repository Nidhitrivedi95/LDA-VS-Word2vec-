PM5vkmr8FqOIWE0pe3C2Fw After having spent my entire life eating hot pot at home, this was the very first time for me at a hot pot restaurant.  We were there on a Sunday evening, the place was packed!  The servers were friendly and helpful, I had tons of questions seeing as it was my friend time.  My friend's been to a few before and mentioned that this is one of the pricier ones.  The food was fresh and were served promptly.  The sauce table was of good variety, although I feel like they've missed out on some traditional sauces.  Would recommend.
