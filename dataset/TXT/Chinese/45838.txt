BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ I have been wanting to try Plum for a while now and finally gave it a try this past Sunday. They have an adorable outdoor patio that I was hoping to sit at, but it was raining off and on. Upon entering I noticed how bright and modern the interior was. We were the only ones in the restaurant which was kinda cool. I am really loving this whole Asian Fusion style of restaurants lately. Options are key these days and Plum really gives you plenty off Asian options (Chinese, Japanese and Thai). My mom and I have a tradition that we always go out to eat together on Sundays. She was really craving noodles and decided to order Pork Pad Thai ($13). I was really wanting Chinese so I ordered the Kung Pao ($15) which came with chicken, bell peppers, peanuts, hot peppers and a brown spicy sauce. I also really love how their are different protein options to add to your dish (Tofu, Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, Pork or Scallops). If you are not in the mood for General Tso's Chicken, swapping it out with some Tofu is an option and like I said early, options are key! I was pleasantly surprised with how much food they give you, especially my moms Pork Pad Thai. I have been to plenty of Thai restaurants and Plum definitely gives you the most bang for your buck. Speaking of bucks, their prices are great and the quality of food is great. Win-Win!
