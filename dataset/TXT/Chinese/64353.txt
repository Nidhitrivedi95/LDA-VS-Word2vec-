e7M2GgkCfDYTxdPN1LL1sQ It was really good Chinese we have gotten take out form there three times so far. Parking is pretty easy to get. The only reason it doesn't get four stars they are not so good at getting the food into the bag. They forgot my dumplings one time and an eggroll the next time. Good food will go back but ck your bag for everything you order......
