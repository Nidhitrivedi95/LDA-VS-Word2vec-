dqeUvrlMxTAk0VL2n1ukaw I love Chinese food and I am well aware that Panda Express is not authentic.  But this place was a major let down.  I was really disappointed that this place was chosen to cater a banquet.  The food was cold, the chicken was hard, the noodles were soggy and the inside of the egg roll was over cooked.  I will not refer this place to anyone.  It makes me wonder if the person who chose this place has ever treated their pallet to real Chinese food.
