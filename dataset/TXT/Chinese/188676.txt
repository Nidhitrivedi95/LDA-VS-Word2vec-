yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I'm Vietnamese, so I think my review has even more credibility :) I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pho shop.  So much so that this place is my and my friends' go to spot for post-partying and random pho cravings.  The broth, meat, and veggies are always fresh and super delicious, and the staff is always courteous and fast.  My recommendations are the pho dac biet (special), spring rolls, any of the pork rice dinner dishes, and for those of you that have a more adventurous palate, the vermicelli noodles with roast pork, shrimp and egg rolls. YUMMY!!
