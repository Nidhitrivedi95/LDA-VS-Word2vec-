sVqV9lzvx98kWU39Fn4c6w My gf and I frequent Sky Sushi when we're passing through. I've tried several of the sushi restaurants closer to our home in Fort Mill, but haven't found anything that we like better than Sky. Azn used to be a favorite of ours when we were in South Park, but without better options closer to home, Sky has sneaked its way into our default place for asian cuisine. 

Pros: Fat noodles in the lo mien. Don't know why, but many asian restaurants have started using skinny noodles. Not a fan. 

Broccoli was awesome. Some of the best I've had. 

The sushi tasted fresh and has been consistent each time we've eaten there. Today I had the Sky roll, which i'll probably get 9/10 times I return. 

Cons:
Hasn't established itself. Usually kind of empty. Rice in the sushi could be a little better.
