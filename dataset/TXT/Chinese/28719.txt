8U9nnnInBAvQLaX5LHrJ0g My husband and I ate at Chen Wok every week for over a year, and I would have rated it 5 stars (more if I could) until they recently changed management, retooled their entire menu AND raised their prices (in December 2013).  We were thinking there wouldn't be much of a change in the menu - after all, why would you mess with a winning formula?  Boy, were we wrong.  What was the best Chinese food we've ever had is now just mediocre.  No more giant portions at great prices - the portions are 50% smaller, AND the prices are higher.  If you liked Chen Wok before, you'll probably find very little to like here - they've changed the way they breaded the chicken, the sauces, the veggies, the crab puffs, the egg rolls - literally nothing is the same.  Also, the new staff is incredibly rude.  We won't be eating here ever again, which is a shame because we were in love with the old Chen Wok.
