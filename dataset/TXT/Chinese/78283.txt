GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog While the overall decor of China Poblano is interesting (bumping Latin music; bicycle wheels decorating the ceiling; bright and punchy uses of color and art), there's much to be desired from this Jaleo stepsister. The concept of combining Mex and Chinese is an interesting one... but it is not reflected in the menu. I was hoping for something along the lines of Chifa (Chinese-Peruvian -- check out my review for Little Dumpling), which really blends the flavors of otherwise dissimilar foods... unfortunately, "never the twain shall meet" rings true at this resto. The menu was divided into several sections, making clear that Chinese was separate and distinct from the Mexican options. SIGH. Service was very good (it was a nice touch that the manager introduced herself to us; and our waitress was very enthusiastic), except for the server who, while squeezing orange on a lovely fruit salad we ordered, shot both my man and me with the orange juice and seeds (and didn't both to say sorry!) while squeezing the orange over the salad. The only delights were the fruit salad; the fried fish taco; and the shrimp mole. Disappointments were: the pomegranate salt-air margarita (WAY too tart); the tuna ceviche (again, WAY too much lemon); the lobster taco (lobster was entirely too tough); and the lemon-pepper shrimp (the lemon-pepper sauce made me gag). Good but nothing mind-blowing was the guac.... especially when you discover its price tag ($15!!).
