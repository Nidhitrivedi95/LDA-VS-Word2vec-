URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg Let me preface this review by stating that I've only ordered take out. With that, China Chili is my go to place for those days where I don't feel like cooking and want a quick meal. It's the best mom and pop Chinese restaurant I've ever been to.

I'm a strict vegetarian, and China Chili has been very accommodating. I'd recommend the Hunan Style Tofu with no chicken. 

I'm not a big holiday person, so I'm looking forward to spending Thanksgiving and Christmas here.
