nBwOIq5KI-zmxp061dTmgw Never will I ever return to this Restraint again!  I have had enough of it.. ive given Chen and Wok n. 7th st. 4 chances to purchase their food. Now for the 5th time I came in and ordered the same thing everytime and pick up and go home to eat.. however each time they mess my order up and I call they said they don't make mistakes! They are the most rudest people I've ever talked to. I don't need that in my Life! Even when they take your order and answer the phone they never ask how are you nothing.. nothing but a couple sourpusses!!!!! So I'm going to get the word out to my family friends a nd everyone I know!!!!
