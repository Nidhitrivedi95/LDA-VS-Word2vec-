bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg huge fan of Grit & Grace! their food reminded me of the asian food I grew up eating but elevated and with a twist which made my inner foodie very happy! we tried all of the dim sum except the kimchi and the pork belly bites were my favorite and actually the highlight of my meal. they were cooked perfectly, melts in your mouth, and had a delicious complimentary sauce. I'd also recommend the short ribs, so good!
