n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q We have been going to this establishment for quite some time and have been satisfied with the food. The portion are not the largest we have seems but the food is good. The place is not always busy so it is nice when you want to be able to have a conversation. I would recommend this restaurant if you are sick of the big chain restaurants. Shop local my friends and support the mom and pop places!
