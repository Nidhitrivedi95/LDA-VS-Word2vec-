JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw What type of Chinese person doesn't eat rice? Me! I can live without rice but I simply can't live without noodles. Hand-pulled and knife-shaved noodles are some of my favorites and I have been dying to try Shang Artisan Noodle.

It was only 11:15 (15 minutes after opening) and most of the tables were already full. Within 15 more minutes, the entire restaurant was packed. There was only one guy waiting tables at first and two people in the kitchen so service/food was a bit slow but they tried their best. I love that you could see the guy pull the noodles. It was very cool!

We started with spicy wontons. I'd give these 3 stars - they weren't spicy enough and the sauce was too liquid and did not have enough chili.

We also got two bowls of noodles to share: Shang Beef Hand-Pulled Noodles and Dan Dan Knife Cut Noodles. I'd give both of them 4 stars but for different reasons.

The Beef noodles had a good flavor (although my own beef noodle soup had more depth of flavor than this version). I wanted to love the hand-pulled noodles but upon closer inspection, they varied too much in size. I understand that they are handmade but the precision just isn't quite there.

The Knife Cut noodles had a more authentic texture. However, I'm not sure what part of the sauce mix makes it "Dan Dan" style. I was disappointed that it wasn't really Dan Dan noodles at all.

If you're looking for great tasting hand-made noodles, Shang meets that criteria. Authenticity is questionable.
