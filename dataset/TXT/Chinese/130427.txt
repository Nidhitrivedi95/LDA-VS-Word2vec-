pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA One of my favorite places in Vegas. My friend works at the ventian woot woot for employee discount. 

We ordered a table full of food. Everything from sushi to their paella all were delicious however my stomach did not appreciate me stuffing my self. 

They have pretty awesome atmosphere it's like you're at a club but it's a restaurant. Their sake list is a mini novel I did not expect that much sake in one place. I know nothing of sake so the waiter was helpful with his suggestions. 

I can't wait to be in Vegas just to come back here. 

I also got our anti sushi friend loving sushi. Therefore it is successful place to bring none sushi lovers to, converting to the dark side one person at a time.
