For the food itself, the Hainanese chicken with rice is a favourite - the chicken is silky smooth and flavourful, and it comes with 3 different dipping sauces. The rice is chicken-broth infused, so it's especially aromatic. But be warned - this does not come with a drink!

Their HK milk tea is STRONG, so I can't drink this stuff at night, unless I WANT to be up at all hours. By this virtue, my father is a huge fan of the tea, since it takes him way back to the HK homeland!

The desserts are quite impressive. I've tried the brick-style thick toast, and to say "sharing is caring" is an understatement. It's massive! The toast itself is covered in butter, so the mix of salty and sweet is quite appealing. AND it looks like a wrapped giftbox when it arrives! I've also tried the sesame ice cream pastry dessert, which comes in a tower of flakey pastry, sesame ice cream and more flakey pastry. Again, bring a friend to finish this one.

I've never noticed if the service was good or bad, but I would say prepare to have a certain amount of assertiveness if you want responsive service. It's just how it is at these establishments!
