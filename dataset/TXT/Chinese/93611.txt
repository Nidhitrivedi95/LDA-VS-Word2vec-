j3SHAiF8OIlY3kUPnAAlKw i tend to lean more for japanese food but if i do want something in this spectrum this is where i would go. Ive eaten here often and do enjoy there chicken fried rice as well as there lo meins and beef fried rice. My wife loves the orange chicken and no one ive ever taken here has not left happy. great place
