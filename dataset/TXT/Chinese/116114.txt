n5jTCFF6LqNIAz6Jx5-3tw Pei Wei was one of my favorites. Went online to order and pick up last night. The menu has changed and we were not impressed. Ordered 2 noodle bowls, spicy steak and chicken. Don't have the options for different portions anymore.  The food was hot but lack of steak and shrimp!  No vegetables, and only 3 shrimp per bowl. I was highly disappointed and have no plans to go back soon.
