Fu5rL-dPs-VNW0k315xMbw This location has had a lot of Chinese restaurants come and go but this one has to be the best one yet! It is pretty small so the place fills up quickly. The quality of the food is great and the portions for the price are reasonable. 

What surprised me was the amazing service that they had! The waitress asked us if everything was good and we mentioned that the friend rice was very dry and overly salted compared to the last time. She immediately offered to make us a new one with no questions asked. We told her she didn't have to and felt really bad but she did anyways and was still extremely friendly and pleasant. 

The ice bath sweet and sour pork is a must try. 

We will definitely be back!
