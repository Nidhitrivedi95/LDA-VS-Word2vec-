CXFARDJEpOreI9Xyxzl8Yw I think the only reason I am giving this buffet 3 stars is because their Mongolian style BBQ was pretty awesome and they have my beloved Chinese Donuts!!!  The food selection here is pretty impressive.  If you've ever been in a Hometown/Old Country Buffet, just imagine all of those food troughs covered in Asian food.  I tried a little bit of everything that looked good to me, and that amounted to about 15 different items.  I wasn't too impressed, but I quite enjoyed the honey chicken.  The rest of the food was just really flavorless and the chicken and broccoli left a really gross film in my mouth after I ate it.  Since I wasn't feeling the buffet I went over to the BBQ area.  They have lots of good stuff to choose from, including shrimp!, but I narrowed it down to a few items.  They have the create your own sauce thing, but none of it is labeled, so you have to guess and kind of stab away in the dark. I waited FOREVER to get someone over there to cook my food, but once it was done and i ate it, it was really good.  We won't be back for a few reasons and there are a ton of other Chinese buffets to demolish first.
