U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Bearing I am in Vegas, this place was perfect for someone looking to feed three young boys and have a skinny dinner.  The boys loved the fish tanks and watching cute Chinese videos. Surprisingly fight and complain free meal.  I ordered the broccoli and shrimp which was perfect. The boys shared vegetable fried rice, shrimp dumplings and spare ribs.  Everything was perfect except for ribs. Ribs are weird, look like carnitas with bone. No one liked it and my boys are not picky.  Out of here for $60 plus tip which is great for Vegas.
