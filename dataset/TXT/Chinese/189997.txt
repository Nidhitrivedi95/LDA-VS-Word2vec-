yhgOJXJd_XAU-8jIvcfq0g I threw a birthday party for my dad at cool bar private room.  It is very nice room.  Everybody like the food even children.  I was worry if guests doesn't like the food cus most of their food has cumin, Szechwan peppercorn and other spices. Food was delicious. I really like it.  Service is very good too.
