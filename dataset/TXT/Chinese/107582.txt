Make sure you get an eggroll and homemade plum sauce--they are the best in the entire world and I've never had anything like it anywhere else.  The chicken and broccoli, sesame chicken and garlic chicken are my go-to and are all extra delicious.  As others have said, lunch service is fast so you can get in and out on your lunch break.  We also get delivery quite often and it's always good and accurate and they are friendly on the phone.  Definitely give it a try!
