TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ Since when was chowmein considered an entree? Apparently at this place. Most eateries offer it as well fried or steamed rice and then I get to pick an entree. they do have lunch specials,  or you can go a buck more for another list of lunch specials

Decent portions , that's a plus.
