ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ We were recommended to this place by a couple of friends because my boyfriend and I were trying to find the best noodles in town... Safe to say we were not disappointed at all. We sat outside and ordered a round of drinks, I was in the mood for a piña colada but unfortunately they were out of an ingredient for it so the bartender said he could make me something else. The drink he brought had bourbon in it and I was not a fan, however I was going to try and drink it anyway. At the end of our dinner the server (I wish I could remember her name) noticed I didn't like the drink so she took it away and asked if she could try again and bring me something else I said sure! She came back with a drink I originally was thinking about getting and I was very happy with it. I really wish I could remember her name because she was very sweet and even offered to take a picture of my boyfriend and I. We'll definitely be back because everything was splendid!
