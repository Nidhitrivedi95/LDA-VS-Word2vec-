egxK8E9T6MWLxJyD_iCIVQ On my most recent visit my boyfriend and I ate dinner here and we shared the shrimp tempura roll and the spicy California roll and both were made perfectly and were delicious.  We also got the chicken egg fu yung and the Tender Blossoms Stir Fry.  I wasn't fond of the egg fu yung but I tend to like my food spicier, however my boyfriend said that he enjoyed it.  It's nice that they also have a full bar and they offer several decent wines by the glass, and their alcohol prices are very reasonable.

I probably go to China Palace in Sewickley about 6 times a year, and overall  I think that they do a really good job at offering a diverse menu filled with traditional Chinese offerings as well as the more standard "Americanized" offerings along with a nice selection of Thai food and a great/delicious offering of sushi/sashimi/rolls.  I've honestly never had a bad meal here - so for me, they have always been consistently good and the service continues to impress me - in fact the service has gotten even better in the last couple of years, and the remodeling has given the place a more modern, and expansive feel to it.  The only thing that I will say is that even when you ask for something to be spicy (like 10 out of 10) more likely than not you can expect the spiciness to only be about a 5 so be sure to ask for the hot pepper oil or for some hot sauce on the side.
