_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w We come here often for special occasions. The king crab is great and the lobster is also good. They're huge and come with tons of anchovies and fried garlic. I prefer the king crab to the lobsters though as the latter can get a bit boring after a while. I'm not sure what seasoning they use but sometimes I find the dry fried style a bit too salty. The oysters are delicious and so is the sweet and sour pork. Lastly the cashew sweet soup they give as dessert is yummy and a unique alternative to red bean soup. I'd recommend this place. They have set dinner times for reservations and it gets busy but it's worth it to try to the lobster/crab.
