rv9T1qGHbh9eXqFpKEPy_A i do like their moo shu but it's only served with 2 pancakes.    most restaurants give 4.   their prices are a bit high.   lunch specials runs around $9.50.   other chinese restaurants are less.    their wonton soup is really good.

the sesame inn also needs to be cleaner.     there's dust all over the ceilings and hanging lights which is so bad i'm afraid it's going to fall in my food.     

they're making a lot of money -- get someone in there to clean the place.
