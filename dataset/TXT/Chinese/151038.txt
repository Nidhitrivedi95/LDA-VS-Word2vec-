sYDc1TENwCKLHvprBa5rLw My fiance and I ordered takeout from here. The only good thing was our food arrived earlier than anticipated.  The hot and sour soup was very bland and room temperature. The egg foo young was horrible. It had no flavor and the oddest vegetables in it. The fried rice tasted like styrafoam and the general tso's chicken was more like general tastes like shit chicken. My boyfriend got very sick after eating the chicken (I luckily refrained). Qwik Chinese Bistro at 90th St and Via Linda is amazing. I cant believe China Jade has not been shut down. Will never eat there again!  We would rather eat a cat's sack than eat at this place again.
