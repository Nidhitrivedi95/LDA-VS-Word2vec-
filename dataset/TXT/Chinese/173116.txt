W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ The hubby and I decided to be adventurous so we dropped in without checking the yelp reviews (which ended up being a big mistake! ).   After eating and perusing through the other reviews, I agree that this place is sorely overpriced..  I definitely expected more quality and quantity for a $16 bowl of Ramen.  We left hungry and went to a burger joint afterwards. 

For charging such exorbitant prices, you'd think that they would atleast have decent furniture.  While the style was modern, the table kept flipping with even the slightest uneven distribution of weight... Which meant that placing an elbow down in the wrong spot would the flip the table and spill liquids... My husband had to move and sit across from me and we had to be really careful when eating the ramen.  This isn't the biggest deal but still annoying..  (we sat outside)
