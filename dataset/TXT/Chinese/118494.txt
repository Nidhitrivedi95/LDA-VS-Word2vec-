nMo0ozHO7cqsPaxw_7N6ow Even though Dim Sum is a 5 minute walk from our house we go across town to a different restaurant.  When we moved to Charlotte 6 years ago we tried Dim Sum & it was horribly greasy & unedible. A few years later we tried it again, still greasy.

We went last week and the food was totally different, possibly the best chicken fried rice I've ever had. It took forever for our food to come out since there were 4 or 5 huge (10+ people) & there was only cook.  

The only negative was a crazy fight that broke out behind us about a crying child.
