yDJhScdD8cCCYfO4WNb-CQ I have had the experience of both dining in and having my meal delivered to my home. The name of the place includes the word, "authentic." I don't think I've ever had authentic Chinese food prior to going to C'est Bon so I'll have to take their word for it. Mind you, on the menu you will find the American classics like 'Chicken Balls' and 'General Tao Chicken.' 

As mentioned by Joy S., the portions are quite big. I would recommend you eat at C'est Bon with an empty stomach. 

Service is excellent. Staff is friendly and efficient. If dining it, you want to call ahead of time as seating is quite limited. If you decide to order delivery or take-out, then seating shouldn't affect you in any way. 

The menu is quite extensive so you're overwhelmed with choices. Each section of the menu is divided up into categories [i.e. rice, poultry, vegetables] so make sure that you have an idea of what you're jonesing to eat. If not, you might take a very long time deciding what to eat... which may lead to you annoying your dining companions... which in turn might have you lose the privilege of dining with said companions. You can always take the easier route of ordering the 'Dinner for 2' or 'Dinner for 3' combinations.... that always works too. 

The food is pretty good and I recommend everything on the menu; you wont feel queasy after eating it. Definitely try the Fried Mars Bar as a dessert. I don't want to know the calorie count or the fat content, but... it's really good! You have a Mars Bar in a Spring Roll shell. 

For the last few times that we were patrons of C'est Bon, we have had delivery. The fastest time it took for our food to arrive was 30 minutes and the slowest was 45 minutes. Unfortunately if you don't live within their boundaries, delivery may not be an option. 

Yay, I am a fan.
