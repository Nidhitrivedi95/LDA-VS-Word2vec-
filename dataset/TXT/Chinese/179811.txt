X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Last minute decision to go clubbing on a saturday-monday trip, went to XS on saturday and didn't want to go back, so we decided to hit up Hakkasan for W&W after a friend said we would like that kind of music.  Bought tickets day of for $30 / guy while girls got in with a guest list.  The three of us showed up at around 10:30 and promptly got into the club.  Granted, at 10:30 it's literally only guys.  Seemed kind of sad at the time.. the DJ's doing his thing but the dance floor is empty.

This was the second time I've been to Hakkasan, and I didn't much like it the first time, mostly because there's no outdoor area in this club.  This past weekend however, that was exactly what I was looking for, after deadmau5 at XS.  The outdoor areas at XS during summer are ridiculously hot... so that pushed me towards Hakkasan personally.  If it's gonna be crowded and suffocating, at least let there be some A/C.

Anyway the whole thing turned out to be a lot of fun.  Though all the drops sounded similar, W&W turned out to be a pleasant surprise (much like Sultan and Ned Shepard were, if you read my other reviews.  Yelp is turning out to be a vegas blog for me..)

Didn't have to pay for a single drink (which I still feel pretty guilty about), so I can't comment on the price.  One thing I will say about Hakkasan though is that the girls they have dancing on the sides really make the experience a lot more fun.  No, not the ones with the crazy lights all over their bodies (those are cool too) but the ones I'm sure they put there next to the DJs at those tables.  Every single one of them was attractive, and there were no guys at those tables.  I mean yeah, MAYBE it could have happened that a group of girls get a table next to the DJ (for like what, 10k+?) but come on.  really, come on.
