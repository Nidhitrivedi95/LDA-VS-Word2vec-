hjDCsuzS_yU60FFffqpt-w We have been here for quite awhile now since we moved to Phoenix couple years ago. Their food quality is ok at times. And we have been getting the loyalty stamps every time we go to this place, except for today. As usual, I showed my military ID to receive my military discount as soon as we got our table. 

For the first time, we were told by the owner's daughter who is in charge today that we could not receive the loyalty stamp because I received my 10% discount on my part (but my spouse paid full price). We were not informed of the policy change when I showed my military ID. No one told us anything until after I paid for our check. 

My point is that an early notice will be appreciated. Besides, if my spouse came in by herself and paid full price for her own meal, she would still receive a loyalty stamp. Why wouldn't we receive a loyalty stamp when we both paid almost $30 together before adding tips to it? I personally do not appreciate how they handled it. Plus today's food was definitely more greasy than usual. Ice-cream was melting even before I opened the lid. Would I want to go back? I am not too sure anymore. I may just have to drive a little further out to Jasmine Tokyo in Scottsdale from now on or go to the Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler which is near my work. Those two buffet restaurants also offer military discounts, and their food quality is definitely better. Besides, I have just tried out an excellent "all you can eat sushi" restaurant (order as you go, not the buffet style) in Gilbert called Orient Sushi Grill. Their sushi and rolls were freshly made as you order them. You pay about $24 per person, but you definitely get more than what you pay for there.
