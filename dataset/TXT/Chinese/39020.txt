AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw This location is a lot better than the one at Pmall. It's more spacious and a lot cleaner. The decor looked great too.

I came here with a friend a few months back. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and received complementary soup and bread. I don't enjoy soup in general, so I passed on that, but the bread was good.
The spaghetti was very tasty and came in a huge portion. The only flaw is that because of its size, you can get bored of eating it very fast. I wasn't able to finish the food, and I don't believe I ended up taking the leftovers either. 

I would return here versus the location at Pmall just because I find it superior in quality and service. Prices are about the same, and so is the menu, so I'll be back to try new items eventually.
