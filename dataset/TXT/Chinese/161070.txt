UcIrRf2mWgqqlg-HNoDl0A Food was bland. Ordered chow fun and singapore noodle. The chow fun tasted like old boiled water and Singapore noodles tasted as if they just threw a little cayenne pepper on. Very disappointed with the flavor so called the restaurant to discuss. The woman who I spoke with argued with me, stating that no one in the restaurant had complained about the same food. In order to get the refund I requested, they sent the driver to come back and pick up the food. The worst part was when that the driver brought a plastic bag filled with a partial refund. Apparently, the delivery charge was not going to be refunded. Have been trying to get a hold of a manager for 24 hours with no luck. Will never order from here again!
