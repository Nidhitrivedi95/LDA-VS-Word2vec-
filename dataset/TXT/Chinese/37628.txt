aqszoKRB4Ol9bpemt0_-GQ I tried Soho Bistro for the first time and am pretty happy with what I got. The Buddha rolls (basically spring rolls with just veggies) are huge and good and you get 3 in one order.  They come with a sweet sauce, which is not peanutty.  The scallion pancake is really super fried so it's definitely a rare occasion treat.  The soups (hot and sour and veg tofu) were both excellent and I would get them again in a heartbeat.  The sesame tofu was to die for.  I was hoping it wasn't a super fried dish and it did seem fried, but it didn't make me sick at all, which fried food often does.  It is addictive and I ate way more than I planned to.  The only dish that disappointed me and that I wouldn't get again was the mongolian beef.  The beef was either fatty or tendon-y so there was very little meat that was edible in the dish.  Maybe I just lucked out with it?  Everything else was so great, though, that I won't hesitate to return.  One more criticism - where are the chopsticks?  Every Chinese restaurant should provide them!
