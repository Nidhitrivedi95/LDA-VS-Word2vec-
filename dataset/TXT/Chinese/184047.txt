XUDOc980cjB0PZvVS-T6Eg This restaurant was recommended from my co worker so I decide to have a company dinner at this location. First Of all I thought this restaurant was serving Chinese food but they also served a Japanese food as well and they called it a Asian fusion restaurant. I didn't see any fusion dishes but typical Chinese menus and sushi. Fusion ? Really ? Why ? 

"Asian fusion restaurant" , yes I get it but they should be focusing more of Chinese food because sushi wasn't good at all. But their cheese food was amazing.
