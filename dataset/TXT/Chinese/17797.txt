4WmI1fnjvfI5OyV1B6emAQ I came here on a Friday night with my family and this restaurant was packed. We didn't have a reservation but luckily just had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a large table that can seat 12 people.

We took a look at the menu and asked the waiter for recommendations to which he pointed at the dinner set (written in Chinese) of about 10 items for $198. I thought he took the easy way out and should've told us what is popular in this restaurant or the fresh catch of the day, ecetera. And what do you mean you don't have mayonnaise shrimp with walnuts?! As for the dinner set - is it bad that I don't remember what exactly the dishes were? Clearly not too memorable. Unfortunatly I cannot read Chinese so I do not know the exact name of the things we had. I just remember there were 2 lobsters, squabs, chicken, young chow fried rice, some noodles dish, veggies, and a fish. We added sweet and sour fried porkchops. Free "tong sui" dessert at the end. Everything was okay, nothing to write home about. 

The food is good enough that I would only come to this restaurant for convenience. I would not come here if it is out of the way.

CASH ONLY!
