EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ This is some of the best Thai food I've ever had and I live in a West coast city with great Thai food. Some dishes I've never had like the beef jerky were amazing and the atmosphere was so much fun. I  plan to be back here next time I'm in town absolutely. Staff was so dedicated and genuine. Give this place a try, you won't regret it.
