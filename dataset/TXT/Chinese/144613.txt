RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ I have stopped in Rose Tea Cafe a few times, all for takeout.  While the interior is fairly small, they do a mean takeout.  I don't think the wait time has ever been more than ten minutes for takeout, which is awesome.

The bubble tea is pretty good, although once I ordered the strawberry milkshake ($3.50), which is just strawberry milk.  It was too sweet and fake tasting for me.  The shrimp lo mein ($8.50) is pretty good and makes 1.5 meals.  They use the cute little shrimp too, which I like.  I am more inclined to head to Everyday Noodles for my noodle needs, though.  

My biggest complaint is that I have tried to get lunch here twice at 11:30, and the doors are locked but the staff is inside.  Their door says that they open at 11.  This issue has stopped me from returning recently.
