Pricey for what you are paying for 

There is only so much all you can eat stir fry one can eat

Good selection of fresh food for the stirfry you are creating

I think this place is more for the experience 
Getting to watch a teppan chef cook your food is essentially what you are paying for

Nothing special but would go again
