O0zyXuEw_aojAK5ILW6WJA Went here as directed by previous reviews for dumplings. ..we were not disappointed. Ordered lamb dumplings,  pork & leek, fried lean pork and a onion pancake.
The pancake was crispy outside but delightfully soft inside filled with just enough sweet sautéed green onions. I never tried this before and I enjoyed it very much.
The lamb dumplings were my favorite. Sometimes lamb is hard to get right, but it was tender, mild and soup filled! Love at first bite. The pork ones were ok...I think the lamb was so amazing everything else paled. But they still tasted fresh and we're cooked just right.
The fried lean pork was not my favorite. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy it more, I had a few bits and was unenthusiastic about it. 
We ate so much yet still had lots left to take home...all under $30 to boot! We'll be back again I'm sure of it!
