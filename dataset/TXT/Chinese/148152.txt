sePTDv1dGHPID7kwuNzXaA Had a craving for you-tiao and congee so my bf took me to this place as it is famous for its youtiao. It's really crowded and we had to wait for our turn.

It was my first time trying the youtiao here and i fell in love with it on the first bite! 
So soft and crunchy at the same time. We ordered the ordinary youtiao and the sweeter crueller. I love the sweet one the most. It reminds me of the youtiao i had when I was a child in Malaysia. The congee is really good as well, one of the best I've had.

I wish they have a bigger portion tho.
Would definitely come back for the youtiao!
