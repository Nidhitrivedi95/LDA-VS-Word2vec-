This place is what the doctor ordered. Post club, this place is the business. The service is fast and efficient and the food is AMAZING, HUGE portions, and a decent price. You really can't go wrong. 

I personally love the Chicken Noodles, they are huge and squishy and sooo good. It is a huge plate that you never think you can finish all of it until you realized you just NOMED all of it. 

I'm telling you, if you are shitty, this is going to save you from the worst hangover ever, just eat this on your way home from XS or wherever you go out - but take warning, they close before the clubs, so you have to make sure you get there on time!
