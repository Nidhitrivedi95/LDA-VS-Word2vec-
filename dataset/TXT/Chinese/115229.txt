n_rEQNgsCOLNfMzGqFhn1g After reading about some recent reviews, I decided to stop by to check out the lunch specials. Unfortunately I went on a Sunday, when they only offer the buffet. So, after reviewing the buffet options, and noticing it was $9.50, I figured why not. The Sunday buffet offers two soups, wings, two rices (brown & white) and 9 entrees, including beef with broccoli, sweet and sour chicken and shrimp, beef with peppers, seafood with cashews among a few. 
I started with the egg drop soup and wasn't thrilled, a little luke warm. However, the fried chicken wings were good. As for the entrees, I tried the beef with broccoli, which was the first to go, and the cashew seafood, general tso's chicken and sweet and sour chicken. All were good, but overall I prefer fresh meals, served hot and fresh. Although they seemed to fill the trays often, they seemed to go pretty quickly and those that remained definitely lacked in heat. 
Overall everything was good & servers seem to be all around to assist with anything. I am just not a buffet person, but will return on a weekday to check out a preferred dish only.
