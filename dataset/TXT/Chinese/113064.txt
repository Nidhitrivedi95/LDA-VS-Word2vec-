MLwVTDhM2DOESvKGcfKCsg My daughter and I took my 85 yr old parents here for dinner due to all the positive reviews online. The food was outstanding and the portions quite large--enough for another meal at home the next day. My parents thought the food was the best Chinese food they've had since moving to Madison. If I lived in Madison, I'd be eating here regularly! The positive reviews are correct--excellent food! The prices were reasonable and the service was great!
