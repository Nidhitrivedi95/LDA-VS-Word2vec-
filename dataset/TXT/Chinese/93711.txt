J5lgLvoKPzNqGCGPbznh-Q I went to this place based on other Yelp reviews.  The restaurant opens at 11AM according to sign posted on the door.  I arrived at 11AM and waited about 10 minutes for the gentleman to open up shop.  I was a little disappointed on that because I was meeting a friend there for lunch.  The service was great!  The lunch deals aren't bad either.  I ordered the orange chicken lunch combo.  It came with an egg roll and crab puff.  I enjoyed the crab puff but I didn't care so much for the egg roll.  I still ate the egg roll anyways.  You can't let food go to waste!  There were a lot of options for boba drinks too!  When you add boba to any place, I'm already a huge fan.  Lastly, the place is in Mesa.  I live in Phoenix.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to go to there.  Mainly because it's Mesa.
