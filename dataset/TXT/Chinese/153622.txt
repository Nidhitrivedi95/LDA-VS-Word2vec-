taXKuFldSoerm9SXrckh_w Probably the best Chinese food I've ever had here in Phoenix Arizona.

We drove 30 minutes to try this place and it surpassed my every expectation.

The staff was amazing and very attentive and the recommendations were spot on.

Each dish came out piping hot full of flavor and beyond deliciousness!!!

Not to mention that the portions were huge and on average $4-$6 dollars cheaper then PF Changs and superior quality.

The beef lo mein had amazing flavor an tender juicy beef that melted in your mouth.

The lemon chicken breast was so crispy on the outside and super moist inside. The lemon sauce was out of this world  

The orange chicken and sweet-and-sour pork are also a definite must and without doubt be, your favorites well fast as well.
