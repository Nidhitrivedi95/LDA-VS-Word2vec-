vHlF8VSkELv6nKz5W4GDnw Arrived for dinner on a Friday night at 7pm, we were the only customers. Ten minutes later another table arrived.  We were the only two tables our entire meal.  They were out of the first two drinks that we ordered.  Our order finally arrived 30 minutes after we ordered and 10 minutes after the other table (who ordered after us and had more food).  The Kung Pao chicken was flavorful but not spicy at all.  We also had the godzilla & salmon sushi which were average.  The empty restaurant should have been our first clue.  Our server did deduct $10 for the late meal, so cudos to her.
