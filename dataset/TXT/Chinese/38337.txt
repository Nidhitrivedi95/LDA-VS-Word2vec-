AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Please note this review is not based on the food as we couldn't get a table.

The restaurant has large tables around the perimeter for 5-6 people with smaller tables in the center for 2-4 people. My husband and I went here for lunch and all the smaller tables were full so we were told to wait. I noticed all 5 large tables were empty, but I thought whatever. I know sometimes restaurants leave tables empty because theyre short staffed. So we sit and wait. And wait. And wait. Then a party of 5 walks in and theyre seated RIGHT AWAY at one of the larger tables. I ask her why we cant sit at a larger table and she says "oh no, I cant put just 2 people at the big table."

Thats ridiculous! There were 4 more large tables empty. You really think 4 large parties are going to walk in?? You think a party of 5 will be quicker than a party of 2??? She told us we have to continue to wait til a smaller party left - so we just left instead. I wont even bother coming in next time... Bye.
