ltl1WFdxYcyKOCnV6llQjw This is one of the restaurants I must visit every time I come to las Vegas. Food and the service always been great ( always a plus) ! However, this visit ( October, 16th 2011) was such a disappointment and I probably won't be going there again anytime soon. We were there around noon time for dim sum. We picked all the items we would usually get at Cathy's house, the flavors were off and it looks like has been sitting out for a while and looks awful. One of our item was dry and cold, we ask one of the male server if we could exchange it to a fresher one, he just looked at us like we are crazy without saying a word and just walked away. After the meal, we went to the front desk to pay our bill. I ask the cashier lady if they have changed their chef( apparently, most of their old crew went to their new location in palms casino ) she seem wasn't very interested in talking to us, just want us hurry to pay and leave. We were just in shock and disappointed by the way we been treated and how awful their food was. How could one of the best Chinese restaurant in las Vegas become one of the worst in less then a year. What a shame!
