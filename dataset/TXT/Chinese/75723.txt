Took away stars because they did not bring one of our dishes, checked on it and still didn't arrive. Not a problem to cancel the order though. Then, ordered a large dish of vegetables which when we approached the bottom of the plate, found a piece of paper at the bottom soaked in the sauce. Possibly the paper was the order printed on it, I hope. Either way, manager called over and easily removed off bill without mention or hesitation.
