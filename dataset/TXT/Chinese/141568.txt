RGg86O5SmjhiVglYYpWkEQ First time at restaurant, 
Took my 80+ year old parents for dim sum, service was decently fast.  Although we had one of those 'wobbly' tables. It was not that busy in the restaurant.  It was a quarter full excluding the vip rooms.  We ordered the salty fish & chicken fried rice dish (very good), beef rice noodle dish (average), shanghai dumplings (average, a bit oily than normal), fried turnip w/perserved meat (too oily - had to absorb the oil with many servettes).  We did request less oil... wondered if they acknowledged or is more oily than normal? Idk.  My parents didn't like the dishes seem more oily than most other restarants in Toronto to Markham.  If you don't have a cholesterol problem, then go for it.  Other wise, I recommend to skip this one.  I don't have a cholesterol problem, but I rather taste the dishes not the oil.  They get 2 stars for service and ZERO for the food.
