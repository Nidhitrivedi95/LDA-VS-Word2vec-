fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A KJ Dim Sum & Seafood is my one and only choice in Vegas for dim sum...especially considering that some of my favorites have been closed down for some health concerns...while KJ on the other hand continues to pass inspections and stay open...which makes me feel well and think that something going on here is good for me and you.

I have only come here for lunch for Dim Sum cart services where they circle the restaurant with stacked carts of Dim Sum items for you to select from and satisfy your appetite.  I am fairly well educated on Chinese culture and food but not an expert who regularly enjoys lots of the selections they have to offer. Still what I can tell you is that the Dim Sum offered at KJ is fresh, warm, and simply showcases the ingredients. 

Almost all the time we wait for a while for the seating...even though they are fair, as I sit waiting, I sometimes feel inadequate for not speaking fluent Cantonese, but that all changes when we are seated and the Dim Sum carts start rolling our way. Don't be afraid of ordering...just point to the food that excites you and pair your food with some hot tea. They will even tell you what's inside each item if you ask. Do make a point to come here before noon on the weekends and you will have your table in no time.
