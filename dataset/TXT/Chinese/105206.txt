KvfaPsLlpOZAF276Lpvm4w I feel that everytime I go here, I get a different experience. 

I usually go here during happy hour (3pm-7pm) when its usually empty and aside from the crappy music they continuously repeat over and over again, it's a good place to study or hang out.    

Tealicious offers a variety of bubble tea, slushies, yogurt drinks, etc.. Their menu is quite extensive from cold and hot drinks on one side and food and desserts on the other. 

I really like the bubble tea here, the drink itself doesn't have powderly crap (or that much) and actually tastes sweet compare to Go for Tea just up north of Midland. To be honest, it's one of the best bubble teas in Scarborough.. 

However food wise, it's a mixed bag. The only good thing in the menu is the minced beef on rice (with kimchi and egg) and doesn't taste like its been thrown into a microwave like most of the items on the menu.
I guess since they don't really have a "kitchen" like their competitor, Tea A Break, or that none of the staff could actually cook. 

One thing that I like about this place is the free wifi which is high speed or at least faster than other cafes and coffee shops like Starbucks. 

Like other yelpers mention, the service here is terrible, especially the owner who constantly insults me behind my back even though i constantly leave a good 15% tip everytime. 

... I feel that if I did not tip them I would get the same exact crappy-ass service which befuddles me. I mean seriously, if I give them a bad tip they crap on me for it but when I don't give them anything, they don't.. whatever... /rant

Plus the place smells weird....
