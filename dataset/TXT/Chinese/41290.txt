b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag First of all, I'm Asian so my expectations for Chinese restaurants are quite high. This is a pretty good restaurant! I suggest it for people who like more Americanized Chinese Restaurants. But.... 3 stars because some dishes are sour. Also, like I said before, I like authentic Chinese foods. If you're living in the hotel NewYorkNewYork, I feel like you should try it out! Just a bit (not really) too much vinegar. DON'T GET THE PEANUT NOODLES, YOU WILL FEEL LIKE YOU ARE EATING NOODLES WITH VINEGAR ONLY!!! Otherwise, it's pretty good!
