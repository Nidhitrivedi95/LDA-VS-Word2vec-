tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg My wife and I ordered take-out from here for dinner while we were in town over the weekend. We ordered the general tso's chicken, kung pao chicken, and two orders of chicken lo mein. The food was awful. The wontons were just fried wonton wrapers with absolutely nothing inside of them. The chicken is tough and rubery. The lo mein had no flavor, and everything labled "spicy" had absolutely no spice. To be honest I would have enjoyed eating frozen chinese food rather than wasting the money on this place.
