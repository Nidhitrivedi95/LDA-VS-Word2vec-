I went to that place in Tokyo where you exit at the astro boy station, face the mural, turn right, look to your left until you see an alley with a black tarp, find the bone on the tarp, go inside, and have the best ramen ever.  I like that - I also like cheap ramen.  The thing is... this just wasn't for me. 

And that's why I'd probably not have ramen there again.

That being said - their BBQ pork buns?  They're $9.00 for two tiny little things - this is "rich people food" where the more you pay, the less you get...  but my lord were they good.  I'm notoriously, shall we say - frugal - but I would go pay those prices again for those delicious mouth fulls.

The non-BBQ pork buns?  Pass.  But those BBQ ones?!  All day, every day.

P.S. The okonomiyaki is some of the best I've had in Toronto - but options are still limited.
