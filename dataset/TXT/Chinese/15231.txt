3PhF188adiC8ZutKRP9gyQ Just got back to the hotel from this dessert place, very disappointed. Unacceptable!

Ordered Malaysian Cha Cha dessert (<U+55B3><U+548B>),there was no sago and no taro in it at all. It had a funny taste ... which is dried orange peel, why? No idea. We told the waitress, and apparently she had no idea what supposed to be in Cha Cha. So we didn't eat it at all. Later on, the manager told us Cha Cha is not supposed to have taro. I was like .. Really??? Alright just to prove that she was wrong, I googled it. The recipes I read on Google all have taro and sago. 
For example:

Guess what .. the manager made us pay for it. WTH!!

Also, ordered the ginger favor streamed milk. That was a total disaster!!! It didn't solidified at all. It was like milk with ginger favor. And the waitress said she can re-stream it for me, it would be OK. However, I know how to make this dessert and I know it won't work. I told her it doesn't matter.

Since both desserts failed completely, I ordered the sago with taro in coconut milk. It was a OK one. Ended up paying it plus the Cha Cha. 

What a ripe off and waste of time. I should have gone to Dessert Kitchen and ended my Toronto stay with a happy stomach. Now, all the dessert places are closed. I didn't get to eat dessert at all. 

100% not going back to this place, and I will tell all my friends about my horrible experience. 

Seriously the owner of this place, if you continue to serve people with this kind of dessert, I am sure you won't have any chance to survive until I visit Toronto next time. And if I could, I wanna give this place a negative star rating. So ridiculous!
