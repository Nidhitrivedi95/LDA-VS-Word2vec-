XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA I may slightly biased because I am less familiar with these type of noodles. Came here on a Wednesday evening and it wasn't busy, but there were still people in the restaurant. The menu is very straight forward, so we were able to order quickly. Me and my friend both got the spicy soup, he got thicker noodles and i got the medium flat ones. The soup was realyl flavourful and the stuff in the soup was good too, albeit limited (as the noodles are supposed to be the focus of the dish...or so I understand). The noodles themselves were not great. They tasted a little underdone (especially the fat ones). If you're looking for fast service, and standard food, then it's not bad. But I don't really think it's worth the line.
