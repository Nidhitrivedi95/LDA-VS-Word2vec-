Cdywb13_07M1_g3U85VKTA The lunch buffet was the reason this buffet fan made the rather long trip from central Phoenix. I came at 12:30 pm, the peak of the lunch rush, so I figured that the food should still be at its best. I found the buffet offerings to be quite limited - mainly popular items you would find in any standard Chinese restaurant.  Service was fine and the dishes tasted OK, not knock-your-socks-off great. I would not make another drive from CenPho just  for the buffet, but if I were already in the area and hungry, I'd give the buffet another try. Or I'd order from the regular menu and see what some other reviewers were raving about.
