u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ I've realized there just aren't any "hole in the wall" chinese restaurants here in Vegas with the same kind of raucous atmosphere and cheap eats back in NYC or SF.  But if I can get preferential treatment without having to speak in Cantonese I'm happy.  Based on first impression the attentiveness already seemed better than at HK Star.   How can I forget the smell the grease on the walls.  Agh!

This may not be a fair review since we didn't order any entrees.  Seafood dishes are usually how I measure great cantonese/hk style food.  Me and Andy T. had a late night snack and shared the Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice which was good.  I've had this served casserole style and the traditional way and some chinese restaurants don't even have this on their regular menu.  I suppose it's the in-n-out secret menu of fried rice at certain places.

Overall, 3 stars for now.  I would come back again because I think if you ordered the right things here, there's room for improvement.
