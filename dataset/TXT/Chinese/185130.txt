XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA The noodles were SO GOOD. Tiny place but seats turn quickly. Probably best for pairs, four at the most. Larger groups would be tough. 

No vegetarian options- either beef noodle soup or pork pan fried noodles. Pick your noodle thickness and spice level. These were some of the best noodles I've ever had outside of China. So yummy!!
