YmX3UDKy4CeFQ7guNlrw4w Despite all the other so-so reviews I must say it is my favorite Szechuan restaurant in Mississauga.

Seriously, if you wan to eat szechuan then you better be prepared for spicy. If you can't eat spicy don't bother, because that is how it is suppose to be eaten.

I haven't got the chance to try everything yet, but here are  few dishes I lovee!

- Cold trio dish in spicy peanut sauce (it has beef, tripe etc.)

- Spicy hot pot fish (white fish cooked in oil and lots of chillies with some numbing peppers and beansprouts)

-Cumin stir fried kidney

-Fried chicken with spices (forgot the name but its wrapped in a bamboo net contraption)

-Hot and sour cabbage ( sooo good, brings out the flavors and the spiceyness)

-Hot and Sour Soup ( it is pretty good here and the key is not to use red vinegar but black vinegar to pull out the real flavors)

Their noodles and dumplings are...meh so just stick to ordering dishes to share
