4KHo1LnkM69RtWTDBdG16g This place turned out to be quite a disappointment. I came in on a Saturday night, and it wasn't too packed which was good. Order: 
Taro snowflake- there is literally no difference between this and a slush. It was quite bland.

Chef recommended crepes- crepe was sandy and not smooth at all

Milk pudding- best thing ordered out of the three. Smooth and milky. 

Probably won't be back, I prefer dessert kitchen much better. There's nothing unique about this place .
