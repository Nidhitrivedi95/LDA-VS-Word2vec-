AbgNPAnuq8X90DUw5FQ2sQ Lots of selections. I would definitely like to come back to try a bit more items. 

We ordered K01 Fried Taiwanese vermicelli with dried scallop & chicken. The noodles were a bit dry. Fried shrimp was tasty. Service was extremely fast (food arrived in 5 mins) and the waiter was pleasant and helpful when it came to what to order. I would love to come back for the baked spaghetti bolognaise... my usual favourite at these hk cafe type restaurants.
