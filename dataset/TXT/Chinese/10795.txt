203Y0QZtgs0hYR1xV78qEA Hello friends, 

During a long day on the road one of my drivers wanted lunch and asked where to go. Since we were around the corner, i mentioned this place. 

%93 Sanitation Grade

It was pretty empty when we went and i almost told him to keep driving because even though i have never been here I've been in the area and noticed its usually busy. Ahh anyway. We both ordered fail proof safe option Shrimp Fried Rice with extra scallions. 

In short, i probably won't order that again. It was cooked pretty promptly which was great. Once we got back in the truck I cracked mine opened and BLAM, POW, BANG, POP a mouth full of nice shrimp, rice and the lack of any flavor. My driver said the same thing. Going further saying they could have added some MSG or something. I thought that was pretty funny. 

Anyway, would I go back? Sure. Now i just know to place my order and ask for them to add some type of seasoning to it or soy sauce. I won't let this experience deter me from trying them out ONE more time. 

TTFN
