HJ928N6c5Hh2KD3lYCuabA Don't be put off by dodgy bland mall. This is a good spot to eat prior to a movie. Also there is a huge restaurant within. The  front is glitter. There is more inside. Other Spring Rolls are better for sure but ok quality. Service was good. My friend tipped 20 percent. I thought service was ok.
