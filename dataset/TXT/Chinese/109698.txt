Lpp8IiUVEhJzF4Fb8DkScQ Not anything special but defiantly worth a try. After a visit I could definitely say that the food is worth buying but the seating arrangement is horrible. Very wobbly tables and cold wind just ruin it for me. 

Also our entire table was served room temperature soup which we had to send back to re-heat. 

All in all, it's just another Hakka spot.
