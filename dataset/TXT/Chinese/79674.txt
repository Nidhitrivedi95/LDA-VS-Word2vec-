GkY6UWWn0Fz2ehcuBp66pg This has got to be the best Vegetarian Dim Sum place I've ever had the pleasure to eat at.!! I've really only been there for their dim sum but I've heard from a hardcore meat eater, the fake meat there tastes better than the real deal. HA!

One dish that I completely fell in love with and can't get enough of is the Turnip Cake with XO sauce. It is cooked to perfection and generous amount of spice. Try it!
