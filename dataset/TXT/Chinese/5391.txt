079CV1EE5WLdQqVEVYFeHQ Came here with my fiancée a few nights ago and we were overjoyed to have finally found a decent Chinese food place with a good range of vegetarian dishes. Finding a decent place that serves any kind of vegetarian ethnic food is harder than you think, especially in this area. I'm honestly glad that this place exists, but at the same time the service and waiting times are a little disappointing. Servers seem to be absent-minded and the waiting times are longer than what you'd expect from a locale of this caliber.
