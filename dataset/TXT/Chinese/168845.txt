Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA A place we go on the regular was closed today so my friend and I decided to try another place out.  We Yelp'd!! around our area and found this place which came up first and had some great reviews.  We were super excited because we LOVE Thai food and curry is my favorite and the reviews for this place were awesome. 

It's kind of hard to see from the street - which is odd because it faces the street.  The sign is hard to read and doesn't really pop so for those driving by I can understand passing it on your first try.  We walked in and the place was cutely decorated, but kind of a divey place in my opinion.  There is no air conditioning running, so I couldn't imagine eating anything spicy there!! I'd probably die.  The owner, David, was very sweet.  He was excited to have customers and wanted to make sure he made our food the way we wanted - he warned us of the spice levels as well!  I got a 6 and it was just perfect.  My friend is a spice FREAk and wanted an 8, but he warned her to try a 6 - she regrets not getting the 8! 

I ordered the Massaman curry because of a review that said "curry lovers must try this" and my friend got the Panang curry (my usual fave) The plan was to half both of them and share.  To my dismay the curry was scarce.  It had great flavor, but when I poured it over the rice there were a ton of vegetables and barely any curry.  I was surprised because for $10 I feel like the container should be at least half way full.  I pay $8 at some places that give me 5 times what I got here.  It was very disapppointing.  I did enjoy the flavor, but I won't pay $20 for a full size curry.  Also, I love avocados so I was intrigued, but I don't think they belong in a curry.  Just an odd texture and flavor to mix...

We brought another plate of pad thai to go for my friends roommate and he says it was mediocre, nothing special.  Not to hate on this place, but just bein' honest :) It was A-ok.
