RI-E3WWC_KMm27EShF3O8Q Yesterday we placed an order with King Chef.  On our notes we had mentioned that there is a "shrimp allergy". 

First our order took an 1.5 hours to reach us.  When the driver showed up he only had 1/2 our food order.  He contacted the restaurant and they stated yelling at each other.  He said he would be right back with our order.  

We opened the bag and noted what was missing and we called the store to ensure the correct food would be coming our way and also to raise our discontent with the time delay and now on top of it...our food has been sitting around and will be cold.  The individual we spoke to yelled at us and told us that be cause we made a large order it is our fault and we should have ordered earlier.  Not sure what the timing has to do with our food being cold and 1/2 of it not showing up.  

Once the rest of our food arrived we opened up one of the dishes...which had 4 pieces of shrimp in the bottom of the container.  Not sure if they tried picking them out and missed a few; nevertheless we could not eat that order. 

We contacted the store again and once again we were told that they couldn't make any promises or orders being accurate and that it was our fault for order so much.
