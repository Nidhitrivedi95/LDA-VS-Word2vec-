B4ZuEVKHnr2blYg-QiGOkw This location shows "Test Kitchen"... Not exactly sure what they are testing, but if I order something off the regular menu at this location the ingredients are poorer quality compared to the other locations. I ordered an Ahi Avocado Salad- which I've had multiple times in the past at many other locations. 

First of all, I placed my order online. When I went to the restaurant to pick it up, the younger guy behind the register was pretty rude and not at all welcoming. He asked for the name the order is under, when I provided it he couldn't find it and asked me again... Still couldn't find it. He rudely asked if it's under a different name, I checked my email confirmation and replied no. He implied I must have ordered from a different location... I did not... So then he decides to check by phone number, then states the name the phone number pulls up like it's a big giant confusing mystery when in actuality it's the same name I gave him twice before... It's a common name... Learn to spell. 

My order is not ready yet, but he doesn't give an estimated timeframe, he just processes my payment and walks away without saying anything and without giving me a cup for the drink I purchased.. 

Once my order is finally ready, I take it to go and then realized my $7.99 plus tax salad is a great big bowl of iceberg lettuce... It's never been iceberg in the past when I've order the same exact thing from other locations... But not only is it the cheapest lettuce available, it's also wilted. Nothing else was fresh either. Not using the "Test Kitchen" location again.
