1lnIoAIB6U5ywPTC2LG8aQ My family discovered this place because of its cheap price for dim sum, $2.8 per dish is quite a good deal these days. 

The food was good, I like that all dishes were always hot making everything tasted much better! However, their dim sum menu needs more variety, it's always the same steamed dishes every time we visit. 

Service was ok, as it's with all Chinese restaurants, one male server was particularly lazy trying to avoid refilling our water pots or taking orders. 

Overall a good place for cheap dim sum!
