UmsRsglkyspIfrqmuP0uEw Carol Contant is a wonderful person, amazing professional and I recommend her with the utmost conviction. She is my skincare saviour. Located in my favourite neighbourhood in Toronto, the physical space is relaxing and inviting. 

Skincare can be very difficult for guys and Carol takes any uneasiness out of the process - just lay down & learn, you will sit up with better feeling skin and an on-going day-to-day regiment. I often pass out and am difficult to wake, as it is one of my favourite places & I hate to leave.

If you are in need of some skincare assistance -  Check her out.
