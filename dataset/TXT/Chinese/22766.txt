6PdHFAW72p0sSrMCX0mmbw Been there twice now... not more than my sister... 5 times I think!

The noodle cutting robot is cool but wish it was more visible or interacted with the kids. 

That is the star of the show, the hand sliced noodles, whether you have it with soup or stir fry it is all delicious, chewy and soft.  Get the veggie spicy stirfry sliced noodles if you love garlic and red vinegar!

I hope their quality doesn't slow down. The garlic in their sauces is strong and how I like it!

Their appetizer lists and skewers list is good and plentiful of veggie options. 

I didn't like any of their onion pancakes or beef rolls which is unfortunate... oily, no flavor and super thick bread...

Their seating system needs to be worked through and the fact that they have 2 doors. Last time they forgot my veggie noodle stirfry and I had to remind them after my whole party has finished eating. My dad was expecting an apology or a discount, we got the apology but no discount lol 

Will go back again :)
