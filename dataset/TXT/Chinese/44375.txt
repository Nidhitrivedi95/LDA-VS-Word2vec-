BJ9GwNMo8vIgSuKc6B_mOw My overall experience was tarnished by the lack of attention and slow servers.  Drinks took forever to arrive and we had to ask multiple times for glasses of water.  Now that, that is out of the way, the food was good.  Expect to pay a bit more because of it's location, but there are few alternatives in the Yorkville area.  The Dim Sum was good.  All of the standard items were standard.  I feel that most were fresh made so that is a bonus.  The duck was very good and served as two courses.  I also really liked the Shanghai noodles.  if it were not for the service, I would have given this place 4 stars.
