ePCa7c2zvroyiwECOek5wA I love this place!! My boyfriend and I have ordered from them 3 times, each time getting something different, and we've liked everything we've gotten! The Sesame Chicken is kinda my favorite but I really like the Cashew Chicken too! Their Lo Mein is super yummy. I always get that as a side since the entree already comes with rice. Oh, and the chicken egg rolls are delicious too! Crispy on the outside but never over cooked inside. We get delivery and every time they say 45-60mins but it's always gotten to us within 30mins! It's so fast! I can't speak highly enough of this place. The only thing I'm sad about is the entrees don't come in typical Chinese take out boxes you see in TV shows. The rice does! But the entrees come in more modern plastic snap on lid box things. Oh well haha.
