QI0PGXbGkIdInOOBeq6ieQ I was excited to see a Chinese buffet in the area, but was disappointed in this one. The building is nice and the place is really clean, but it's brand new so that's to be expected. I was there just after 11am so the food was fresh. Selection is typical Chinese buffet fare, nothing special. "Sushi" is again, typical Chinese buffet type sushi and not worth wasting valuable stomach space on. My biggest complaint is that the food is probably the most bland and absolutely tasteless that I've ever had. Seriously. It's as if they're catering to the taste buds of toddlers and senior citizens. Just very, very bland and blah. I wouldn't recommend TJ's, nor would I go back.
