jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg The food quality was pretty authentic and price point reasonable; however, there was no "Joyfulness" in their service.  There was no greeting upon our entry.  What was uttered represented a grunt at best.  And like with too many Chinese restaurants, do not expect the server to return to check after serving your dishes.  The only person who communicated and provided some positive attention was the non-Asian bus boy, or maybe he was a waiter-in-training.  

It was a quiet night so several waiters stood a few feet from our table surveying the empty tables.  Guess they had nothing else to do; they stared at times and never said a word or cracked a smile.  

They should remove the "Joyful" name from their business and replace with "Me-No-Smile Chinese Restaurant."  If hungry for Chinese food in Las Vegas, give them a try; just do not expect a "Joyful" atmosphere, because that's false advertising!  Will I go back again if in LV?  Maybe.......food was tasty.
