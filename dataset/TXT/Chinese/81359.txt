GxzEsd-81hVP6C2h6wMvBw A very small restaurant with just a few seating that's very cramped. But their soup base is pretty on point. Had the spicy braised beef noodles and the broth was very flavourful. The pulled noodles are pretty good also - it has a good texture. I like that you can choose between different sizes of noodles. I've been here twice already and will come back again if I'm ever craving for Chinese soup noodles (:
