d_jxInosU_3cAYI0qi34UA Congee Time is our favorite place for Chinese food in the city. I have had the opportunity to travel to China more than once and although the food here cannot compare with the dishes I had in China the chow at congee time is the best Chinese cuisine I've had in Toronto. It's also quite affordable (just wish it were closer to the downtown core!) Generous portions; we always go home with leftovers. Over the years, we've visited for lunch and dinner - it's a bit quieter during lunch or early dinner hours.

Top dishes: Hot and Sour Soup (and any of the Congees), Salt and Pepper Squid, Crispy Roasted Chicken, Eggplant and Pork Hot Pot, Olive and Pork Green Beans, and Oyster Hot Pot. 

Cons: The atmosphere isn't pleasant for two reasons: First, it is cold. Very cold,almost as if they keep the front door open. Second, it's extremely noisy, made worse by the busboy staff who smash and bang the plates together with fervor (irksome when you're sitting two feet away); these detract from the dining experience.
