vraKC3CB9KSDCxYX0q3gWA First, let me say I love me some Pei Wei. I highly recommend the Dan Dan Noodles and Boyfriend likes the Teriyaki Rice Bowl. Technically, I believe each container has two servings in it, so you're getting a good amount of food, which is excellent, since it's pretty darn cheap. Also, online ordering is my favorite.

Now, I had never been to this particular location before (I frequent the one on Eastern, which is awesome), but we had an errand to run in the area, so I ordered online to pick up at this location. I arrived 5 minutes early and gave the girl at the counter my name. She said it would be just a minute. I ended up waiting 20 minutes, watched not one, but two walk-in customers order and RECEIVE their food and saw another person pick up their online order. Apparently, since I was sitting down next to the door, the counter girl thought I left. I stood up and see my food sitting behind the register. I saw her make the connection and asked her how long the food had been sitting there. She apologized, kinda, and sent me on my way. Who knows how long I'd have been waiting had I not gotten her attention.

Seems to me that a restaurant should be committed to getting customers their food when they say they will. I'll be sure to avoid this location in the future and I recommend you do the same.
