uBCRRQJ4ukFaE_UyY6T1uQ China Grill is a rather enjoyable place.  They have well styled decor and their meals are rather enjoyable if not spectacular.  One thing that is very important to do is remove the idea of chinese food from your head.  Most people have so many preconcieved notions that it will ruin the experience (and may make you confused when the bill arrives).
I was pleased by the balance of their meals and they put great care into blending the tastes.  
The straight-asian style modern cuisine
What's good-decor, non "chinese" menu, fresh clean linen mmmm
The slap-not really worth going out of your way for.
