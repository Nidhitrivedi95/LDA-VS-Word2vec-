cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Finally made my way to Dragon Pearl Buffet.....

Lunch for $12.99 is A-OK, as I just could not come here to dinner to pay double the price!

It was quite neat watching the lady making the hand made noodle fresh, though I found the broth itself a little boring.

Skip the Sushi section, as mostly maki and sushi of 2 kinds: surf clams and tofu....

Most of the cooked food I found them a little too salty. I did enjoy the fish: Teriyaki Salmon and Steam Fish Fillet. 

Most of the salad are mayonnaise based, I did enjoy the mango salad and seaweed salad which were more refreshing.

The best part of the meal at Dragon Pearl I think is the dessert. Great selections of cakes, Chinese sweets, fresh fruits and ice cream (no sesame ice cream though!)

The services were attentive. Our water glasses got filled constantly and dirty plates got removed promptly. But strangely, the waiter brought me the bill and the hot towels when I was still eating my watermelon and ice cream?! He also kept asking if I need the credit card terminal.... Can't he tell I was still eating and I was planning to go back for another round?!

Decor here is fun and funky... Worth coming once at least for the experience!
