4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA We absolutely love this restaurant!  We have never had anything but fast and friendly service.  The menu is varied and very reasonably priced.  The Chinese Sausage Fried Rice is to die for.  All of the food is fresh and always delicious.  I am a huge fan of egg drop soup and this places egg drop soup is the best I've had.  We highly recommend going and taking the whole family!  We are a family of 5 and it never breaks the bank.
