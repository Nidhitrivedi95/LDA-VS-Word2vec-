Review:
Inchin offers a wide variety of fusion Indian/Chinese food, with the focus leaning more towards Chinese cuisine.  I tried a few vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, and all were appetizing. My group particularly liked the Crispy Lamb Peking! The ambiance was very appealing, modern Asian decor, great for a date when you're tired of the same old food/restaurant choices.

The "burnt garlic chili fried rice" sounded like it would be amazing, but there wasn't really much substance to it - just lightly flavored rice with a hint of chili spice.  Also some of the entrees, though they were different sauce choices, tasted almost identical if not for the different meats selected.  However, the tables come equipped with a variety of sauces, so you can customize your meal to your taste.  

Definitely give this place a try, you'll be happy you did!
