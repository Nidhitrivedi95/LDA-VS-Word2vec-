The sauce bar was kind of sad and everything was out in the open (sauces were not covered), and honest-to-god, if you're going to have a sauce bar, don't put it near the entrance. It's hot, flies are coming in, bowls are uncovered, and servers aren't gonna know if the bowls are empty if it's that far out (when there's no more satay sauce :c). 

Decent selection of meats, veggies, and misc - and I actually loved the broth! Got a standard spicy broth, and if you're a spice-junkie like me, I'd still recommend sticking with mild at first - you can always add more spice later. Service was quick and standard for a Chinese hot pot place. But they should relocate the sauce bar and put a cover on them.
