phTLTkqSvylLkmz5wAwhTw So I was hungry went on grubhub and stumbled on this place paid $20 for 3 entrees shrimp fried rice, orange chicken & beef and broccoli.  The orange chicken was ehhh maybe 3/10 but my daughter loved it ! Way to sweet and little hard. But the other two were pretty tasty not the best chiness food I've ever tasted but hit the spot for a really cheap price. From order to delivery was about 35 minutes they came fast! A huge plus for some starving people and the guy was nice that brought the food and was literally so hot like it was from the kitchen at that second. I did like the chow mein and fried rice alot. All in all if I need fast, hot and cheap meal which is very decent taste wise I'll definitely be ordering here again.
