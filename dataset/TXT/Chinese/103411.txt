KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ I decided that we needed to try this place after reading Yelp reviews. Who doesn't love yummy, but cheap Chinese food? This place hit the spot! The food was really good, we had plenty of leftovers, the prices were stellar. This is probably the best Chinese food place we have found living out here so far, and we will be back.
