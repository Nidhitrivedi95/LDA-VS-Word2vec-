JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A This is yet another restaurant that my grandmother and I visited. I had extolled about the virtues of Korean for the past year since returning from there in September 2K11, and eventually we decided to go here. The restaurant has a real cozy atmosphere and the people who run this restaurant do an excellent job of waiting on you as well as being very friendly. 

We both had the bulgogi bi bim bap and the man du guk w/ sliced rice cake and they were just as good as I remembered. This restaurant does everything right and it makes me glad that I am able to find a restaurant here in Phoenix that serves excellent authentic Korean cuisine.

I have only two minor complaints. 1. The side dishes are a little skimpy even for two people and if you want extra you have to pay more, as opposed to most restaurants in South Korea which mostly gave you unlimited side dishes, and 2. they don't let you do the grilling. You order it and they cook it like most American restaurants do, which is disappointing if that's what you are looking for. Don't let this deter you from trying this restaurant as you'll miss out on some of the best food ever.
