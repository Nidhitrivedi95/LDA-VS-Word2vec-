liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA We've been here a few times now and found it quite enjoyable. We've mostly just had a variety of dim sum and everything was quite tasty. Service was not the best we've had but really no complaints. If you don't like their prices, try their happy hour menu from 4-6 PM on weekdays...
