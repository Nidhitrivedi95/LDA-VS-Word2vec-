sVqV9lzvx98kWU39Fn4c6w We ate there on Friday for dinner, correctly thinking that being a new place it might not be crowded. Very nice decor, they've really changed it from the Tony Roma's that used to be there. Bang bang shrimp was excellent, fried pork pot stickers were very flavorful, although could have been cooked more.Lots of food on the entree dishes, I had Dragon and Phoenix, very nice (not exceptional), Deb was not impressed with her chicken dish. We don't do sushi, but the menu was extensive. A solid addition to the dining scene.
