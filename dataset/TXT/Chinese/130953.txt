pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA First it was sensory overload with the lights, video and overly loud music.    Second, the food was too hyped up for me, so the 45 min wait was not worth it on a Tuesday.  

- Sea Bass skewers - good but nothing extra special.  
- Bobo Brazil roll - couldn't really taste the ingredients, the sauce took over
-  Yamato roll - sounded way better on paper.  again, couldn't taste the ingredients as it was sauced up.  
-  the sushi came with its own wasabi, which is perfectly fine, except they put way too much.  The taste of the fish was masked by it.  

Overall, I wouldn't go back.
