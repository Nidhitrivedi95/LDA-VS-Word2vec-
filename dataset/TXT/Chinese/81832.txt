h0kDxnRpBXyJ1v17uSDnzw I am very picky when it comes to my Chinese food. China Garden meets all my needs. They use Chicken broth for their Wonton soup. The Wontons are filled with pork, which some places don't do.
I used to get Sweet & Sour Pork, but they make the BEST Sweet & Sour Shrimp! The breading is delicious & the sauce doesn't have pineapple floating in there. 
The fried rice has ton of pork in it, some places don't put anything but cheap veggies in their fried rice. 
The only downside is that they used to have stale Shrimp Chips. I brought this to their attention & since the chips changed & got much better!!
I love Chinese food & tried several places in the area - this one wins hands down. They deliver, are always speedy & friendly when delivering the food.
