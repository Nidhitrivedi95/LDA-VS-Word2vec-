TxNeo206T0jMvRRQ4nKSIg The food is good here.  Sushi selections are better than other AYE places.  The fresh selections to choose from to have cooked for you is a treat.  Cindy the server is amazing and I love when I am seated in her section.  
Dinner selections are the best.  Was not impressed with their lunch the 1 time I went.
