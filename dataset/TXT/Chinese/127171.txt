The bad: I've been here twice now and both times was disappointed with the service. I wrote out the numbers corresponding to the items I wanted to order but the server refused to write the orders down and made me go through the menu again to tell her the names of the dishes I wanted to order. Despite this, she got two of our orders wrong, and one of our orders never came so we eventually asked her to cancel that order.

The ugly: When I asked about the shrimp and mango bird nest that I had ordered, she said they don't make that dish anymore (yet it remains on the menu). Then she asked if we still wanted mango and dished out some mango from a dish from a nearby shelf  that we had sent back because it was wrong. When clearing the plates she noticed the mango was not all eaten then ate from the mango dish on the shelf.

Needless to say, despite the servers' attempts to make up for the initial mistakes in service, I would not advocate coming to this place. 1.5 stars.
