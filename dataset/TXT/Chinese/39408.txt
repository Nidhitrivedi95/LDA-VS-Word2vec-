avl8sqAPq0hdOGyC6WXctQ Tasteless wonton soup in which the wontons were not cooked correctly(hard),  and it was way too hot. Ouch! 
The girl at the counter had them remake the soup, but it was still tasteless, so I tasted and left it on the table. Rice was good, not sticky or too greasy. Egg roll was of the pre packaged variety and was unremarkable to  that kind of product.
I got the terriaki  chicken sticks that were unlike any id ever experienced in a negative way. Yellowish  in color, not sure how they were seasoned, but they are overcooked and had a mystery about them.
Cannot recommend this place.
