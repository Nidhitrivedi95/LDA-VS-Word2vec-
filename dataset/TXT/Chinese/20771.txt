64ZPMllrqdrVNXMEQIvXhw I stopped by the Malaysian place a few shops down but they were closed. Disappointed and hit by a craving for Chinese food, I decided to give them a try by ordering a black pepper beef dish and twice cooked pork. HUGE MISTAKE. 

The dishes had almost no meat at all. There were only bits of "beef" (the largest was about the size of a dime, no kidding) in the black pepper steak. Same story with the "pork". The sauces in both weren't even tasty and was just plain salty. I have never been so angry with myself for wasting $20 on a takeout dinner. 

Should have checked out the consistent bad reviews about this place before even walking in. They are a disgrace to the other Chinese takeouts/restaurants in the area.
