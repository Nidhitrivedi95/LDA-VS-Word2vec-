EbgUkmDxPUa2fr0rc8EFJQ Authentic-NO, Very good- YES! 
We LOVE PF Changs! It's a great value for flavorful food! 
Our favorite starter is the chicken lettuce wraps. (They have a great gluten free selection!) I also love the hot and sour soup. It is very hearty and tasty! Our favorite entree is the Chengdu Spiced Lamb! WOW! The smokey cumin makes this dish very savory! We get it every time! I also like the Hot Fish and the Singapore Street Noodles! Also, the brown rice is excellent, very nutty and cooked perfect every time. 
 The Great Wall of Chocolate is superb, especially because of the fresh berries! For a gluten free dessert you must try the chocoloate dome (also with berries)!
