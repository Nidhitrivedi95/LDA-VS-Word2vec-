Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w Yelp won't leave me alone until I write this review. (Back up off me, Yelp!)

First, I'll say this. The only reason we went to Siam Cafe was because Wonton BBQ was closed. Sorry, truth. BUT!!!!!.... I'm not sad about it. Siam was very good.

My family and I were the only non-Asians in the whole place. Very good sign. 

The menu is overwhelming. One of the only things I didn't like, but that's to be expected at a place that offers so many different types of authentic Asian noms. 

Everything was supremely fresh. They even have fish in tanks that you'll later see on your plate! Tons of fish. Lobsters and frogs, too. Oh, I'm sorry. Did that make you squeamish? Muahahaha! Too bad. 

Portions are out of control huge. I went with four family members and we all ordered an entree and had boxes and boxes of leftovers to take home. Plus, we got a few appetizers and soups, too. We're all fat but that was way too much even for us chubbies. 

Service was wonderful. They really catered to my bratty child and brought out his pho almost right away. And they didn't mind that he insisted on standing by the fish tanks for a big chunk of the time we were there. 

I'm trying to get back soon to try more of their rotund menu.
