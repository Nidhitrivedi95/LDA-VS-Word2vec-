iUFwE4oFs_JRVdqA3G7ICg I love eating here, its always DEAD and its a nice place to just go to lunch and be alone. Server doesn't come around very often but I like when they're not always up my ass. When I can't decide where to eat, I just choose Grand China because they've never disappointed me, lots of food for a good price. Don't count on delivery though, sometimes they don't have a driver because they share one between all stores!
