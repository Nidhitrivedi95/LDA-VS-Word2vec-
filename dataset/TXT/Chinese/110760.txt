lXZvgVmIz-ko1OiCG-VDTw Soup for the soul for the winter is a must. Decided to choose the $9.50 option in which you select the soup base, then noodle, then 2 toppings or more for an additional $1.25 and then a drink. 

Today I chose the pickled cabbage fish soup (which is a bit more on the pungent side and vinegary) with thick rice noodles, with Hong Kong style dumplings (yellow thin skin with mushroom and meat fillings) and hot milk tea (which you'll have to add some sugar for some taste).  There is a wide selection of each options so have fun mixing and matching to your liking! 

If you're not too adventurous, they have a few staple selections such as the Hong Kong dumpling noodle soup for $7.50 or the spicy Dan Dan noodles with minced pork with a cup of fish soup for $5.75! Give it a go!

There are a couple TVs to watch sports or the Chinese channel. Seating can be one or up to 8-10. I've got the rest of the year to try out many of the others that I haven't tried yet. Who's game to create different soups?
