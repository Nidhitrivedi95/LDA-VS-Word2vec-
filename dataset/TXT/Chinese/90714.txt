iIFcMHXGNDz8jbx_4H-xVQ Love this place!   Can't say enough about how good the food is.   Let's start by saying that the chicken pakoras are life changing.   The Manchurian chicken soup is amazing,  the Bombay fish is out of bounds great and if you go please try the tandoori chicken fried rice.  I'm hungry now,  hopefully I'll see you there!
