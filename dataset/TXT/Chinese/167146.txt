vgc-XO64Uw7otc3sxmns1A I took my wife and two little boys to Tsuki last night to give it a try (and to avoid the traffic getting to our usual hibachi favorite). I doubt we'll be back. 

First the good: as others have noted, it is clean and modern inside, giving the place a nice atmosphere. The portions are generous, and the staff was friendly and service was prompt.

Now for the problems. We sit down at the hibachi area. The chairs are about 3 inches too low for the table so you feel like you are reaching up the entire time. We had to get a booster for my youngest (who never otherwise needs one). Then they start cranking out pulsing techno full blast; this is at 5:30pm on a weeknight. Soup and salad is served. The salad was decent, the "miso soup" was basically broth with what looked and tasted like a few crumbles of French's fried onions in it. Not good. The hibachi chef arrives and greets us and confirms our orders. I notice he seems to be slurring a little bit. My suspicions are confirmed when he misses many of his tricks and other erratic behavior--the guy is pretty clearly loaded. Not a good idea when you are dealing with flames, knives, and young children. The food gets finished and served; nice sized portions as I noted. Quality wise, it is decidedly average compared to some other Japanese steakhouses in the area. Then the bill arrives. 2 adult hibachi chicken dishes, 1 kid's hibachi, some crab nigiri for my youngest, and a couple of drinks comes to $90 + tip. There are much better places in the area for quality and value...and chefs that aren't tanked.
