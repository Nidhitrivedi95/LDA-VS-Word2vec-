u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ Came in for a table for two knowing the other party would be delayed. Waited for 15 minutes without anyone even approaching to offer a water, a drink or appetizers. Keep in mind the restaurant was only a third full... disappointed
Might as well run around the corner to any other restaurant on spring mountain
