2BuiyGL0JbNjnc88fYH39Q Yay, review #50!

With my recent lack of hotpot visits recently, my girlfriend and I decided to try Hot Pot on Yonge - though this review is fairly late, since we went multiple months ago.

They function in the same way many other All You Can Eat (AYCE) places do: you write down on the piece of paper what you want and they bring you your food.  They also have regular order-type food, but we didn't have that.  Most of the food we had tasted fresh and, with the strange assortment of food I usually eat at hotpot, this place was pretty good.  I had the pork bone base and the pork bone meat itself was actually really good.

Holy geez, I've never seen a pair of waitresses work as hard as the two that we had.  They were constantly moving around making sure people were happy, refilling pots / water, cleaning... you name it.  The restaurant was in very good condition, likely in part because of those two.  They always brought food when we ordered it and were pretty quick in doing so.  The service was easily the best part about this place.

The place is a little small and was starting to fill up when we were leaving so going early / making a reservation might be an idea here.  I believe if you pay cash, you save 10%, even if the place is a little more expensive than i would have liked (I think it was roughly $27).
