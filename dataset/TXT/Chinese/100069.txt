JX1_mKHN38bjgQP0JB3fkg My fellow Yelpers friend Joyce P. and Rachael N. and I decided to try Tink Holl since we were all excited about trying a new restaurant together. 

I do like a feel of the restaurant. It has a homely Asian feel to it and there were a lot of space in the restaurant. The other good thing i like about this place is how many dish selections they have and the price of the food was very well priced. 

The 3 of us ordered a seafood tofu casserole, garlic eggplant, and beef pan fried noodle. 

Garlic eggplant: I'm not a huge eggplant fan but I heard garlic eggplants are really delicious so I gave it a shot. I didn't taste a lot of the garlic flavors to it. The texture of eggplant wasn't bad but the flavors just wasn't there for me.

Seafood Tofu Casserole:This was one of the better dishes we got. The flavors were there and there was a great amount of portion of it. But as much as I like it, they just don't make it the way Wonton Gourmet does (still my favorite yet). 

Beef pan fried noodle: the noodles were delicious! The veggies were delicious, but I thought the beef had a bit of a weird texture to it and i didn't know it was the amount of corn starch or what. 

Overall pros: good price, big portions, lots of varieties
Overall cons: scary neighborhood, flavors don't stand out enough

Either way, I think Tink Holl is a decent authentic Chinese restaurant. It does beat those crappy Chinese restaurants with americanized names but Tink Holl cannot compare to some of the best chinese restaurants here (wonton gourmet, pacific east, hunan east, etc...).
