trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ Very nice place. I like the decor, very unique. The food was excellent. The platter of oysters was delicious and fresh. Fried oysters were amazing. The pearly chowder was great and so was the fish n chips except for the fries, way too salty and we has to replace them. Customers service not the best. Not very friendly and slow.
