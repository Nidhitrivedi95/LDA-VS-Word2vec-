x-H-2BYL2XoDDLiub950Ag Was craving Chinese food so headed out to China town and found this place with good reviews. Upon seating down we where given two menus one was practically all Chinese and I couldn't understand and the other menu had some more items in English. We where about to leave since I couldn't understand what was on the menu and then our server finally comes around and asks us for our order. We told her what we where hoping to eat and she said that was no issue. She brought us out our food and the food itself was lacking flavor and tasted nothing like chicken, took the leftovers home and not even our dog ate the leftovers. Hate to say but wont be coming back to this place.
