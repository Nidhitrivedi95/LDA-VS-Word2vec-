rv9T1qGHbh9eXqFpKEPy_A I visited here with my dad for lunch.  Frankly, I thought it was terrible.  However, the beer was nice and cold - so gotta love that.  My dad seemed to kind-of enjoy his meal, which makes me wonder if I ordered poorly.  But the thing is....I can't even remember what I ordered.  I know the egg drop soup was just god awful.  I tried pouring in about a gallon of soy sauce, but no dice.  It was a meal that I hardly ate and 30 minutes that I will never get back.  I don't think I'll go here again when I am down visiting my dad.

But, they get two stars because my dad said his meal was, "fine."  And, again, cold beer.
