Had the coconut chicken and it was fantastic. Way better than any other hole in the wall Chinese place in Mesa that I have had. If there are bad reviews it is due to the fact that they are pissed about the long wait times, and you know how pissy people get when one thing goes wrong (I mean I don't blame them, I think grandma is in the kitchen making all the food, which may be why it tastes so good) Call at least an hour ahead an place an order, I mean this, I happened to walk into this place and it took more than an hour because of all the orders they had to fulfill, but definitely well worth the wait! It loses two stars for me because of the wait time, and that it kindof looks run down, but again, taste of food brings redemption with me, so four stars!
