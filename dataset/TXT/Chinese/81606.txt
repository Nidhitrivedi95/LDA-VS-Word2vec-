H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag Wow, this place is cheap and good, the two criteria for being a Yelp favorite. Throw in friendly and efficient service and you got yourself a winner.  Stopped in for a quick lunch of Moo Goo Gai Pan, which was fresh and delicious.  Drank about six glasses of water too.  I'll be back for sure.
