When craving for pho, Pho Kim Long is the place to go to. Just a few miles off the strip, this place is not at all hard to get too. 

We were seated pretty quickly. I ordered the #18 chicken pho. And my god, if I had a glimpse of heaven, this would be it. The chicken pho was on point like a freshly opened exacto knife. The chicken was good. The broth was perfect. I usually order the beef pho with the special tendons and tripe but this time my cousin and I were really feelin the chicken pho. I'm glad we made this decision. Service was as expected. Just like other pho places. They serve you, you eat, and your group leaves. The pho bowls range from $8-$10. Not bad at all if this is what will revive you from the dead. Or put you on the right tracks of bringing life back to your body. 

In conclusion, I was very happy with my meal. I felt like a zombie from the walking dead, eating like there was no tomorrow.
