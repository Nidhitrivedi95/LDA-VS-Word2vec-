vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q I have eaten here several times the food is ok, but recently I called and ordered takeout for my wife. I was quoted $9.95/ pound  for a 2# lobster.. When I got there after driving 30 minutes I was told that it was $62.50 for a 2.5# lobster or $25. per pound.They said I had to eat it there to get the $9.95/pound price.  I was told to pay the price of order something else.

Not a good way to run a business.  I will not be back
