Se63tFm5tLlO5wuUlyww8Q Chicken feet prepared 2 ways, frog legs, escargot......Pacific Seafood Buffet does it all.   I did not try them.  Huge variety of Asian and Asian-inspired food from Japan, China, Korea, and other cultures.  Hits: Chinese spare ribs, sesame balls, orange chicken, steamed pot stickers.  Misses: shrimp on a stick (very odd taste - I suppose they are supposed to taste that way but it's not for me!,) Korean short ribs (too dry/chewy, baked salmon (overdone/dry), maguro sashimi (cut thick and maybe not from the best grade tuna),   I give it 4 stars for the wide variety of food choices - there is something for everyone!  I give it 2.5 stars for the food.   The sushi/sashimi table (not the food) rates 5 stars - it's an amazing carved giant boat.  So overall 3 stars. Lots of people but wait staff handled them very well.  There is also a teppan room to the side.
