O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw We went to this Toronto chinatown dim sum restaurant on a Saturday. It was busy but we were promptly seated.

Unfortunately, this restaurant's dim sum are very expensive. A serving of "har gow" (shrimp dumplings) were $4.88. For lunch for two, the total with tax (not including gratuity) was more than $26, which is unacceptably expensive for restaurants in the area.

On a more positive note, the quality of the food was very good. Service was reasonable, and interior decor was acceptable as well.

Too expensive for my tastes, but if you want quality dim sum (at a price), this restaurant will fit the bill.
