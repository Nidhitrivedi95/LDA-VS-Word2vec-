Qzq-m_TKJ-Iv1BmYLcjlVA last weekend I ordered their noodle and beef stir fry and shrimp dish.. 
their spicy shrimp was awesome as always but the beef stir fry was blant... and was not cooked fresh... and same goes with their noodle...

they used to be good about a year ago but for some reason, their food doesn't have that taste anymore.
