DIxgItsSI9QwX9H8lVptYg It was a great experience! Food was delicious and came hot! We waited a little over an hour for delivery so I went with 4 stars but it totally hit the spot for my Chinese food craving!

Fried rice was amazing, orange chicken was great and my husband enjoyed his beef and broccoli and hot and sour soup. We will probably skip the chow mein next time, though.
