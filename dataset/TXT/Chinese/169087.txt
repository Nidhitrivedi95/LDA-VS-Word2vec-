Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Excellent place to get a variety of Asian cuisine! Went here for the first time for dinner and had quite the time. 

The service is excellent here. They were very attentive and friendly. 

We started off with the Fried Calamari and Wonton Soup. The calamari was cooked perfectly and was breaded with panko. I had never seen that done before but added a great crisp to the dish. The Wonton soup was amazing. The broth is well developed and delicious. The dumplings were juicy and tasted great!

For entree my fiance got the Rad Nah Noodles and I got the Drunken Noodles. I tried her dish and it was awesome. The vegetables were cook well and not soggy like you find in some restaurants. It was a play on Beef and Broccoli but way better. With the Drunken Noodles I got them with Shrimp. The server let me know their restaurant is the hottest when it comes to spice level. I got 5/10 since it was my first time there. OMG SPICY! The noodles were perfect, shrimp great flavor, but it was incredibly SPICY. The server was awesome though, he saw how I was struggling so was diligent about filling my water. I jokingly said to him to just leave the pitcher and he did! Which worked out well for me because I never had to worry about waiting. Great service!

My only issue with this restaurant is they don't serve any alcohol. Perhaps that was a good thing since I was chugging the water!
