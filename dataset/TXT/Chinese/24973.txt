74wRr6PP6lbaL1YzUcYGAA an excellent no-frills Chinese buffet.
$8.25+ tax for lunch & re-fillable soda pop , 7 days a week, last I knew .  (most buffets upcharge for weekend meals...)
Go on Saturday/Sunday when they put the fried chicken out - some of the best fried chicken i've ever had ... they only do it on the weekends, however ...
You will see doctors, nurses, Lifeflight pilots, professors, college kids and every other ilk of humanity chowing away on a given day for lunch ... and a LOT of Chinese/Asian people that seem to have given it their stamp of approval - always a good sign ...
One of my favorite / go-to chow spots in town even if I have to deal with the ugly Oakland traffic / parking situation ...negatives are the (sometimes)rude & dismissive hostess lady that you pay as you enter. Ive gotten some snappy you go away now-type attitude from her , throughout the years that i've been patronizing this place and the overly-salty MSG-laden food that has me worried that i'm gonna have a stroke after I walk out of there. Guess it depends on which cook is making the food, that day.
