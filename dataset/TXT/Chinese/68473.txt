eS8OuIk6_fMNNslFnj8noA Just mediocre. We stopped in here for a bite to eat while we were in town, we got the appetizer platter for two, which was priced higher than it should have. The quality was lacking, the beef skewers had literally no flavor, the egg rolls were decent, the shrimp was good but cold, and the wantons were severely lacking. The staff was nice. Honestly, I have had better Chinese food at fast food joints for half the cost. Unlikely to return.
