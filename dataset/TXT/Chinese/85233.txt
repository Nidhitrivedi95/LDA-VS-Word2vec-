HJ928N6c5Hh2KD3lYCuabA Love the decor but can`t say the same for the food. It caters more to the western market. The chinese food is not that great, overly greasy and salty. 

The house pad thai (on the ketchupy side) and chicken mango salad are the only two items I enjoy. The chinese food is tolerable if it comes with enough rice to absorb the extra grease and the saltiness of the stir fry, 

Chic place to hang out with friends. Not a destination place for the food.
