6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag This restaurant used to be one of my favorites in Las Vegas for good Chinese food.  But no more. After the change of ownership, the quality of the food has gone down rapidly.  My most recent, and very last, experience with China Mama was a delivery through uberEATS.  One, and the only one, good aspect was that the food arrived on time as promised.  However, ALL dishes we ordered were terrible.  The shrimp with cashew smelled of bad seafood, which went right into the trash.  We ordered chicken with broccoli, beef with broccoli was sent instead.  The dish was oily and the vegetable tasted stale.  Their five spices beef shank, which was usually delicious, was extremely dry and bland, without any sauce.  Mouth watering chicken was anything but mouth watering, with tiny bits and pieces of bones scattered all within the dish that were almost impossible to pick out. The only thing edible, to a certain degree, was the pork chow mein, which was really nothing special.  What a shame that a once superb restaurant has gone downhill so much.  We will not be returning.
