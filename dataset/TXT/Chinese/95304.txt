JhEtJbGjAqKDHCZ11i3qoQ Today I was greeted by a nice young lady, who took my first time experience to new heights. I was told exactly what to do in a calm manner, and I even had someone come help me make my bowl, because I had no idea what was happening. After choosing my meats and veggies, one worker explained his favorite sauces, and even helped me make the sauce just right. The cook prepared the food with a smile, and it looked very professional. Not the mention, having your food cooked on a huge hot plate is amazing! Thank you so much for my experience today! Will visit again soon!
