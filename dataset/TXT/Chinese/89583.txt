I7eqTdTmRTWYwF9HNZAHxw Came here for a Happy Hour after some work meetings in town. This place is nice, but I will say my time was ruined..as there were about 4 families, all with loud kids screaming.

Not to be rude, but I do to happy hour to unwind..and I am not sure this place did the trick. It is nice atmosphere  and very fancy, which drives the price, but  hard to enjoy fancy with babies around.
