QmNrHxN7UahtdliH_kAuUg This place is awful. Bland food, rubbery meat, atmosphere is disgusting (everything is incredibly dirty and definitely turns you off from eating), service is lousy, and prices are outrageous. I seriously cannot name a single thing that I liked about my experience.

There's really no reason to come here, given the wide selection of authentic Chinese food in the area. Listen to the quick tips and skip this place entirely.
