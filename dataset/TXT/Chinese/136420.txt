qGLEE1yA1bK0YdlGI-S39A Still great as ever! They added the fish skin! It is AMAZING. For $6 the portion was massive, the skin was crispy (for days), pairing it with the broth was more than memorable. The lightly salted skin tasted fresh; very much like chips! I want some right now as I think about it. Come for a piece of cheap goodness! Drooolls....
