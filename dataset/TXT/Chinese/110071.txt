ltl1WFdxYcyKOCnV6llQjw It's kinda standard that tea is charged per person at a dim sum place regardless of how many people drink the tea. It is just standard practice. If the entire table doesn't drink tea then that's fine, but if even ONE person drinks tea, then the whole table is charged -- that's how it is in Asia, that's how it is in dim sum places all over. I think it's unfair to give a restaurant a bad rating because you don't understand the way things are in these types of restaurants.

Having said that, I was skeptical at first when I was in Vegas for a reunion, however, my classmates and I attended school in Hong Kong and everyone was well-versed in how REAL dim sum is supposed to be. Some of the non-Chinese people even spoke Chinese so we got seriously good service. They even went to get freshly steamed/prepared items for us.

They have a good selection of dim sum, not terribly extensive, but good enough with har gow, cha siu bao, chicken's feet, tripe, pork spareribs, seen juk guen, cheung fun etc. They also offer a menu of a la carte items on top of the dim sum.

I just didn't expect to find decent dim sum at the Palms, that's all. If you are staying at the Palms this is as good as any a place to get your dim sum on. If you're having to drive anyway then go to Chinatown.
