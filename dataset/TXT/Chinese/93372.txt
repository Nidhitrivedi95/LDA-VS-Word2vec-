J_btDyZbIv0hZNjrw56zlA Delicious seafood fried noodles ! I tried the razor clams they were a bit spicy and good. I love how they give you free soup and dessert soup as well. Service is good. They come when you wave. Definitely decently priced for good food. It would be nice if they gave us a bigger table so I can have a chair to put my bags on ...since there was only one other party there since it was late ..like 9 pm.
