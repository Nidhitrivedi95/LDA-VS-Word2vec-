e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg To start off, the service was horrendous. We had a reservation for 8 guests and we had one extra person show up. We asked the server for our table if she could bring another chair and but instead of providing any solutions - she merely told us that we had a set reservation, there were no extra chairs and we could not block the aisle. That was our mistake, having an extra person so we let that go and squished into the spot. Then, when she asked us what drinks we wanted, we asked for some water whilst we looked at the drink menu and she merely gestured to a water jug at the center of the table and said "the water is right in front of you." Even though we had no glasses in which you pour said water into. The entire night, our multiple servers were either curt or rude. 

We thought that the food would redeem the restaurant as it was started by some celebrity masterchef. We were quite mistaken. The food was mediocre at best - overpriced and all the "fusion" dishes were just covered in hoisin sauce and were much too salty. We tried the following dishes (ordered for 3 of us at the table).

-Crispy Pork Belly Bao (so-so, very fatty and didn't have much flavour, but at least wasn't salty)
-Grandpa's Fun Gao (tasted bland but we were glad it wasn't overpowered by any sauces as it was steamed)
-Beef Tataki (probably the best thing we had all night though the meat quality was tough but the flavours were good)
-Kalbi Pork Short Ribs (the sauce that was used to glaze the meat wasn't thoroughly cooked and had a weird mushy consistency. The rice cakes and apple sauce on the bottom however was very good)
-Stone Bowl Bimbimbap (worst dish of the night - I have absolutely nothing good to say about this dish)

Would not recommend to anyone.
