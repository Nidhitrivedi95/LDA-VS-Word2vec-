EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q Food is delicious! By far probably my favorite asian cuisine spot in AZ. We just moved here from LA where they have a million great options, so can safe to say say this gave me my "fix". Portion size is amazing. The orange chicken is probably one of the best I've ever tried! Must must MUST try! You will not be disappointed;)
