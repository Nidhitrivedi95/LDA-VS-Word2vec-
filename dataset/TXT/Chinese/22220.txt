6I4twTs8oFMuDsuTwS7IgQ Lian Pu has been a frequent visit for me whenever I have urges for some "Chinese" cuisine. The food, at reasonable prices, offers a semi-nostalgic taste of Cantonese-with-an-attempt-of-Taiwanese flavours. There are surprisingly many choices on the menu, albeit most are just combinations of rice/topping or noodle (soup-based or wok-fried)/topping. The service, on the other hand, is quite astounding. An incident with my meal today has put Lian Pu on a blacklist for any visits in the near future. As usual, I went with a friend for a quick lunch after classes. After ordering our food (noodle dish, rice dish), we were given a peculiar egg and shrimp dish. Upon asking a staff member, he hurriedly dismissed the incorrect dish and went off serving another customer. A few moments later, we heard the manager yelling/cussing at the staff member who gave us the dish. (They didn't think I could understand Mandarin) That dish was supposed to be made for the manager and staff to eat, and because it contained "expensive" ingredients, they took away the dish with a, "sorry there's something wrong with the dish" remark. The overall meal experience was ruined after that point. Very poor service/professionalism of staff members (especially the manager). Would only recommend for take-out.
