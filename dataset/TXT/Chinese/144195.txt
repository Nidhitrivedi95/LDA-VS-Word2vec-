Rtl6MbWZABlf5sU-Ni72xQ At first glance this does appear to be your typical honest food spot, which it essentially is. I came in for the lunch special and this place isn't terrible, just sub par. The rice tasted like it had been sitting around for awhile, the beef was extremely chewy. The service was A-OK. it's the kind of place that is as advertised, but if I'm in the area and hungry there certainly are better options for the same price point
