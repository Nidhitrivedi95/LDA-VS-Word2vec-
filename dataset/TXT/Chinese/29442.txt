9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw This is a MUST VISIT when in Vegas. All you can eat Chinese hot pot with the finest ingredients. There are so many soup options to choose from and you can have multiple flavors at once.. which is nice for a group of people who want different things.The seating is perfect and comfortable for large parties. Also the meat and vegetables are all self serve so you can easily help yourself to whatever you please.  Definitely coming back every time I'm in Vegas!
