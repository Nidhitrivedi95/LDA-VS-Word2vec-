I was greeted as soon as I walked in and after being seated I was immediately brought a cup of hot tea and a plate of peanuts. Nice! Off to a good start already.

I really couldn't decide what to get after looking through the menu twice since too many things sounded good. I decided to go with BBQ pork w/ rice which was delicious! It's probably the most tender BBQ pork I've had since most other places seem to overcook it or leave it sitting too long. I even like that they drizzled sauce on the meat/rice as well. There was a decent crowd while I was there, but it never got crowded inside. Once my food arrived I really never saw my waitress again until I needed a refill...but sometimes you just need to be left alone when you're eating alone. Waitresses were constantly walking around the dining area taking care of tables or waiting to be flagged down. There were also photos of food items posted on various walls, which I presume are specials. Some of them looked good, so I'll have to try some next time around!
