UEY70uNV3BxMbxjNmg0apg I had high expectations for this new neighborhood Asian restaurant (offering Chinese/Thai/Sushi dishes), but after my third order I decided to not explore the menu any further.  The bad experience came with over-sweetening the entrees (vegetarian dishes); although tasting fresh with good ingredients, the preparation was just not delectable.  Luckily we have several good options nearby, if not just down the street.
