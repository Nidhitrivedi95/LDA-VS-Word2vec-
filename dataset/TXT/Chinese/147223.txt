SaTA8vxwlX-IYKRRRQbxFw I phoned in the order for pick up, he quoted 10 mins.  I got there and told him I was here for a pick up.  Ok, he took off to the back.  I heard plastic bags wrestling and he came out with my order.  It was nice he put it in a box so the soup does not spill.  Not the service was totally lacking, no hello, double checking if the order was correct, or even saying a word to me.  

House Special Chicken Bowl - It did not come in a bowl, small portion of chicken, huge portion of the garlic sauce, and a small amount of rice.  It was ok.

Egg Flower Soup - It was bland, so bummed.
