vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw This is a must visit for my parents whenever they visit me in Vegas and I have started to go there quite a bit myself even though its quite a drive for me.  The food is authentic and tasty and they don't put their thumbs on the scale.  We always order a pound and a half of live shrimp and its often larger than other chinese restaurants' two pound orders.  The crab in salt and pepper is always exceptional.  I personally really enjoy the hong kong crispy noodles and the salt and pepper pork chops.  

Yeah, its not in a great area (near the swap meet), but its well worth the drive.  

Oh yeah, the prices are exceptional.  I have had some of the best chinese in the world and for the price, this is one of the best.
