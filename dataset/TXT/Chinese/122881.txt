OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I have dim sum here at least once a year. I try to eat here every time I come to Vegas, which is usually 3 times a year...

The trick is not to come too late if you're having Dim Sum...As long as it's early enough, there are plenty of carts making their way around...

As for the quality of the food...it's usually pretty good. Since my GF doesn't eat beef, we steer clear of those dishes and eat a lot of pork, chicken, and seafood. 

Service is generally typical of Chinese restaurants where I eat dim sum....Not attentive, but not lacking. If you need something, flag anyone down and they get right on it usually.

All in all, i try to make it out here on a regular basis, so they gotta be doing something right!
