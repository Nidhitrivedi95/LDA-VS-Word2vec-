5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Absolutely hands down the best service I have had in a restaurant in a very long time. Multiple people besides our waiter stopped by our table to see what we needed and serve our food, and each person knew EXACTLY what to ask, with excellent timing.  Even the high end "Chef on TV" restaurants in Las Vegas could learn from these guys.  

I had the Szechuan Shrimp, Vegetable Fried Rice, and  Crisp-Fried Beef Roll for an appetizer.  All were excellent and good portion size.  I really wanted to try a dessert but had no room left.

I also like the fact that between the booths is a piece of glass.  I didn't have to hear the conversations on either side of me.  Nice touch.
