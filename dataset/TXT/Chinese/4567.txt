The best thing to get is the bifengtang flavor. It is their specialty and makes for a nice garlicky flavor with a little heat. 

I personally like the lobster more, but the crab is the one to get. It is miles better than any crab I've ever eaten. The lobster is also the best, but it is not miles better like the crab. 

The weakest part are the sides. Those kind of are bland, large portion and generally are a waste of stomach space. 

Service is fast. You order and they show you a live sea creature and bring it cooked within 20 minutes. 

If you like lobster/crab this is a must place to go. Definitely make reservations or you'll wait till 10pm.
