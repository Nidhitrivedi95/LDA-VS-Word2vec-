I have to admit, I was a little worried because I'm a bit of a pansy when it comes to the idea of getting poked with needles... but I was soooo wrong! Danit for starters is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable when it comes to her craft and Chinese medicine. She talked to me for a good while, trying to get to know me and understand what's happening in my life before she actually started her treatment. She was gentle (as gentle as one can be when they are poking you with needles, LOL!), the treatment was fairly painless and I did not bruise! Which is a clear sign of a master acupuncturist. After my first treatment, I felt rested and I learned a thing or two about Chinese medicine. I would highly recommend Danit as she has many years of experience and is very passionate about helping people feel better.
