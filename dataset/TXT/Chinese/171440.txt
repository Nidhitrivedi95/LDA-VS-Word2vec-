vYbpodi9utup_njMK5PAfw To be honest, we were very happy with the food at first. The dry noodles were very tasty and it was great to see the chef make the noodles from scratch. 

But unfortunately, our experience ended on a horrible note or lets just say rat noise running above our heads. As I know it may be common to have rats in Chinatown, hearing them so close and seeing the ceiling moving did cut my appetite for probably a few days.
