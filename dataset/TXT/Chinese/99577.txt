Definitely not the best when compared to the kick ass dim sum places in Cali but I find myself somewhat satisfied when I come here, it's a quick fix when those pesky cravings kick in.

They have your dim sum staples: BBQ pork buns, shumai, spare ribs, shrimp har gow, chicken feet, desserts etc. I love their Baked cream bun here though, I can eat them for days! They have a pretty good selection if you come earlier, as the day goes the variety dwindles down to just a few unappetizing plates. I find it to my advantage to call ahead of time to make sure they have my Baked buns and a few other choice items. They also have a sizeable menu to order ala carte from.

Prices are reasonable and in line with the quality. Coming here is entertaining for me as well, I crack up when the ladies pushing the carts practically shove food in your faces and are very assertive with pushy high pressure selling tactics hahaha. I get a kick out of it, my husband, not so much.
