Not only did we get that, but it was right next to an AA clinic. There was a guy passed out on the sidewalk next door! The Chinese lady taking our order was very old school. And who I'm guessing was her husband was counting money at a table nearby. Yup, very ghetto, but we were starving so we stayed. Next time, we'll probably go somewhere else.
