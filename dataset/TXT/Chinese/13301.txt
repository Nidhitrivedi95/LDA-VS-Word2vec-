2UFl9gLOQrSGY2sPu6U-kA i love hotpot but a bit inconvenient to prepare if only making for two people, so this is where i go when i get the cravings.

pretty authentic sauces. lots of items to choose from. but like all buffets like this, not all that clean.... so you boil everything and make sure everything's cooked thru! i wont eat anything raw here.

once it was dissapointing that the softdrink maker didn't work... the other drinks were kinda odd. i missed my coke
