3-HFGxmbzSax-NySJ_LzDg Probably the best spicy yellowtail roll I have had in Madison. And for only $5.95, a steal! 

Their sushi rolls are top notch, and right in line (if not a little cheaper) price-wise with the Muramoto's of the world. Great, fast service, cool ambiance, this place definitely has a lot going for it. 

The first time we came here we ordered the kung pao chicken and it was the best I have had in Madison. Crispy, spicy, tender...it was overall fantastic. Went here again last weekend and ordered it, and was very disappointed. Either they changed their recipe or we got the wrong dish one of the two times. This time it came with a lot more vegetables, non-crispy chicken, no hint of spice. It was like they ordered it from Chang Jiang and put it on a plate to serve to us. This is the only reason they don't get 5 stars from me. The sushi is fantastic, menu is huge, but I can't give it 5 stars given the odd experience with the Kung Pao Chicken. 

Also to note, they have all-you-can-eat sushi on Sundays for $26! Will definitely check that out in the future.
