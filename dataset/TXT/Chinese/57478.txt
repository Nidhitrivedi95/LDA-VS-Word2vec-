D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Once again yelpers steer me in the right direction. Have only been in town one day but already knew wehad to get off the strip. The Buddha spring rolls are fabulous,  as is the satay with peanut sauce and cucumber salad. We had the garlic chicken, yellow curry, drunken noodles, and Pad Thai. All were well prepared, not too huge, very flavorful, and reasonably priced. Will definitely be back.
