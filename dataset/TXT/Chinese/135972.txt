QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA I was in Phoenix for work and convinced my local colleagues to come to this restaurant. In summary, for Sichuanese food, this place is top notch. We have a handful of good Sichuanese places in the San Francsico area, and this place would fit right in.

One tip: Order from the "Chinese menu". If you're looking at the menu that has "Mongolian Beef" or Egg Foo Yung, that's the wrong menu. 

I can only comment on the dishes I ordered from the one outing, but they all shined:

-Water Boiled Fish (Shui Zhu Yu). There are different versions with beef, pork, or lamb, but the cooking preparation is the same. Spicy with red chili peppers and a healthy dose of Sichuan peppercorns which give a pleasant numbing/tingling sensation to the spice.

-Cumin Lamb: Healthy dose of cumin. Good rendition.

-Chongqing Spicy Chicken (Chongqing lazi ji): Ask for "with  bones". The meat comes from the chicken wing and drumette portion.  Comes covered with red chili peppers, but push those aside and just chowdown on the chicken wings and spit out the bones.

-Green beans (gan bian si ji dou). A good rendition with some pungent garlic. 

big thumbs up and I'll stop by here again when I'm in the area for work.
