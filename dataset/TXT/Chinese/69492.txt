eZQbDYQTZk0_cBroVxnPWg I ate lunch here with my friend John, and I have to agree with him that 4 stars is a good rating for them. I like the fact that they are very accommodating to vegetarians. You can order anything from the menu, and they will replace the meat with either crispy or boiled tofu. The portions are also huge! I could not finish my dish. It was totally worth the money,  it is a clean restaurant,  and very inexpensive too. 
Not the most authentic Chinese food out there, but for the price and the amount of food that you get it is excellent. 
It is also close to the light rail, so that is a big plus.
