fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw I came here a Sunday morning for dimsum. I get the Vegas up charge but 50 bucks for  two dishes of hargow, 2 dishes of shu Mai, one sticky rice, and 2 sodas is just stupid. The food was prefrozen, oversteamed and nothing special. Next time, I'll stick to Rowland heights and Alhambra when I'm craving dim sum.
