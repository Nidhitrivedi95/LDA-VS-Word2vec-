e88VWa9xdHmSFdMZne9eLQ I don't live in Champaign anymore but I come back to eat here.  It's of course, a no frills, plastic fork kind of place, but if you order off their Chinese menu, you will not be disappointed. Their Spicy Pig Intestine stew is probably the best dish I have ever eaten. Every time I go, I take an order with me.  When I am eating it in Chicago, it is so good it makes me want to move back.  C-U has always had better asian food than Chicago, but this dish, and it's always a little different, sends me to the moon.  I can't speak for their Sesame Chicken or their Egg Foo Young, and if I was as talented as the person in that kitchen, I would be insulted seeing that kind of order come up.  That being said, they should probably alter the ambience, but hell, they are mainly existing to serve Chinese students who want authentic chinese food,  not people who want a fine dining experience. As long as that dish stays good, I will always come back.  They have wonderful food and I like that the prices are lower because there are no waiters or flatware.  I would pay 30 dollars for the Intestine dish.  I am glad I can still get it for 12.
