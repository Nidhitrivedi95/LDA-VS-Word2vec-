I thoroughly enjoyed my sliced beef dish, but it was a bit slim on meat portion, not a bad deal given the price.Their bun needed a little more roasted garlic flourish but its almost there. The nuoc mam could stand to be a bit stronger but I guess they want to maximize their potential customer base; personally I have no problems passing for a fish market after some excellent Vietnamese. Have yet to try the Chinese dishes on the menu but they do look mighty appetizing. Service is still getting sorted out but its not bad, just a work in progress. Later hours on weekends as well as offering broken rice would be nice.
