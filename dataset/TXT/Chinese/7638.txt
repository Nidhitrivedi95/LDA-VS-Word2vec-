0VjHFdczi6Nln_nn8bucJQ I like this place, it's a small mom and pop with decent food. I've tried the beef pho, beef stew with egg noodles, beef fried rice, and Korean short ribs with rice. All have been tasty, but I feel that you get more food when dining in than to go. 

I often judge Asian restaurants on their beef quality, and this place is good. The broth is decent, better than some, not as good as others, but the way I eat pho it probably doesn't matter that much since I add a lot of condiments. The portion sizes are right for me (when dining in, a little noodle skimpy when not). 

The owner is very nice and friendly. The water is cold and has lime in it to mask the Vegas flavor. Cleanliness, the tables are sticky and I don't know about the restrooms. 

I like this place, it's not too far from home and I don't have to fight people for parking, which is a huge plus.
