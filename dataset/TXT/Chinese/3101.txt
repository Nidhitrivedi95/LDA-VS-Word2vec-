_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Sigh.... Another disappointment with the service within The hotel. Strangely why are all Chinese resturant service that bad? Waiters are impatient!! 

Food is average, no frills. Ordered the spicy beef noodles, dan dan noodles which tasted traditional. If not for food, it would be 1 Srar.
