GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog OH SOOOO GOOD!!!! Just for the record I don't give 5  EVVVER!

   Start with a Salted Margarita ~ it's not the usual for sure. I usually prefer mine WITHOUT salt however Jose prefers a Salted foam which is lovely surprise and makes it extra tasty. You must TRY ATLEAST UNO or ONE (for us Anglos )
    
     I only ordered Mexican food, 1 Shrimp taco with cabbage so deeelissh I ordered another on recommendation of my server it was savory....mushroom & guacamole simply Wonderful  street size 

     Don't pass up the Mango Ice Dessert now this my friends is beyond satisfying ~ cool, delicious, fruity & tasty. This will be the most FAB ending to your meal
