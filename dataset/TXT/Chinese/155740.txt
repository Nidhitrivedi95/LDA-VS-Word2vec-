Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w Expected this place to be great based on the reviews. It is very possible that I ordered the wrong thing. The waiter I had was very aloof. He was looking over my head while I ordered. 
I asked for Thai hot and what I got was fairly bland. I would of asked for some chili oil but I didn't see him again until I got the check a half hour later.
I guess someone dining alone is ignored if you aren't a regular.
