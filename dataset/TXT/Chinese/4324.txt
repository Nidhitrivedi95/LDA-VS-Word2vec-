_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w I always go here when I'm craving Hong Kong style lobster. I love how when you walk in there are tanks of lobster and king crabs tanks all around the restaurant. 

The menu is very long and has a lot of set price to choose from. I believe they only take cash and debit. 
I love how they show you the lobster before they cook it so you can take photos with it and see what your actually getting. 
My friends and I ended up getting one of the set menu which had 16lbs lobster cook Hong Kong style, fried rice, and dessert. The bill came up to $300 but this could feed about 5-6 people. We had a lot of left overs to take home. 

Overall it's a very good experience, I would highly recommend it for groups of people and it was very tasty.
