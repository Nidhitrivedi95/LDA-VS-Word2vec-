n62dcL1e8BQA1_kUEYrldQ Ordered the crab puffs before our dinner and they were over cooked and way too much fried stuff and little cream cheese.  Told the server and she just looked at me crazy and didn't even try to make it right and took it away. Then she didn't even take it off the bill.  you could clearly see from the plate  that I picked off all the fried things that were all on them so you could see that there was a problem with it.  But their was no attempt to make it right. And as she came up to the table she just stood there and stared at me picking off all the fried stuff off of them and setting on the plate and looked at me like I was nuts.  I have ordered those there before and they were like that They have gone downhill. Customer service here stinks. They all have attitudes.
