f8R1qFYugdhQRR-ym8SUxg Three stars for amazing food but less a couple of stars for 1) Chinese waitress who takes a while to hand us an iPad menu to order all our food (very nice - very hi tech) and the language is all in Chinese - we are quite obviously a family of Caucasians. Then laughed at us when we asked for the English version 2) all lunch prices we paid were $11 to $13 per item, certainly none of the great reasonable cheaper prices I saw mentioned on previous Yelp reviews - I wouldn't be at all surprised if they gave a special menu for the Round Eyes with much higher prices.
