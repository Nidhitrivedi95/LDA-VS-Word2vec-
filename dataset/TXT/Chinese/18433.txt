5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A I just ordered food from here no less than 10 mins ago and the food was disgusting. First, upon the arrival of my food the deliver driver was careless with my order so that all the sauce that my food was cooked in spilled out of the container and was all in the bottom of the bag soaking my rice and soup in it's juice. So i ordered the Chinese's broccoli with salty fish and it was disgusting. The broccoli was extremely greasy and the fish was over cooked and hard and still had PLENTY of bones left in it. Then i order the egg flower soup which . . . "sigh" . . . was so sad it can't even be called soup. It had absolutely no flavor and was EXTREMELY thick and gooey. I just smh and pushed it to the side, giving up on tonights dinner. Most disgusting and unsatisfying thai food I have ever had in my life. The best thing that came out of my order was my thai tea .
