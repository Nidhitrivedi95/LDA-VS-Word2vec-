AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Omg. Seriously the best Chinese food I've ever had! I am a carnivore, and a Chinese-food-addict, but my girlfriend is a vegan. This entire restaurant is vegan and it is to die for. Go eat there! The sweet and sour chicken is amazing and I would have not known it wasn't real chicken! The spring rolls were also scrumptious!

Things overheard here:
"But the cooler is already full. How are we taking this home?......we are sacrificing everything in the cooler!"

"This is only four hours from LA.... we could come back."

"Let's go watch the Bellagio fountains and then come eat here again!"
