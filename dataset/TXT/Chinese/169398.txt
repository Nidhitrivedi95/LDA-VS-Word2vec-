vtj3lt38T9Icu_RXHAQ__w I was sick for 2 days after eating from this restaurant. Never again. The food was delivered about an hour after I ordered it and it was barely warm.  I ordered a chicken entree, a noodle entree and egg rolls. The egg rolls were good. The rest of the food was average and they use a lot of large pieces of garlic in their dishes. Not even an hour later I was very sick with stomach problems. It took me 2 days to feel better after I ate from here. I'll stick with my usual Chinese spot from now on.
