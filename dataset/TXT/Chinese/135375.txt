QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ Been to Yummy Yummy Dumplings today for the first time.

The service was nice and fast. However, the food was not that Yummy. The beef roll was hot on the outside and cold on the inside. We also had a soup that I really didn't care for...may be because of my personal taste. However, one would expect the dumplings to be good, but they were disappointing. Chicken or pork it doesn't matter...tastes the same.

At least it was cheap.
