VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q Always a go to spot when I'm in the mood for noodles and broth.  I always get the original fish soup because it has no msg in them.  There is a great variety of choices from noodles, soup base,  and toppings. Specialty soups and after two toppings you will need to add additional money.  It also comes with a drink which is a typical HK style cafe drink such as milk tea.
