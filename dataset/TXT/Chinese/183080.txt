XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw This review is for rude service and their noodle bowls. We went in around 12:30am, we were the only customers. Two of my friends ordered the beef stew, one ordered the beef tender noodle bowl, and I ordered the lamb noodle bowl. We had asked what size it was, she replied that it was "regular size". We asked if two people could share, she said "I don't know how hungry you are" in a very disdainful way.

When our orders came out, the beef tender bowl looked like beef tendons, there was no actual red meat, all of it were tendons. My friend then asked if that was the beef tender bowl, she replied with "yes that's how beef tendon is" and just walked away. The broth was far from appetizing and the noodles in my order were still raw and chewy. We left the restaurant with our food unfinished and still hungry, it was that terrible. Sorry Dumpling King, if it wasn't for the very rude service, I would have given you a second chance to actually try your dumplings, no bueno!
