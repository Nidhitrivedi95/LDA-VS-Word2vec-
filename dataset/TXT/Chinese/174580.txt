WF0I9AwErfaqkPPXM98ywQ Went for the first time today after eating at South Street Burger.  For a buns bakery, very impressed with interior.  Very modern and roomy.  Great for chilling and surfing the internet.  I would now make this my first choice over Panera Bread.
However, dim sum looked pricey.  Not sure if I would pay Lucullus pricing - higher than a dim sum restaurant.
Had the mango mochi and chestnut tarte.  OK and good for price.
Nice place to sit and talk but would not be my first choice for a meal with so many other places in the area e.g. Peachtree plaza and Thai Express.
