YNjW13ls0enqM2Lep2cCsQ Was around this area and saw some good reviews for this place so I decided to try it out with my boyfriend. Went around 5pm and it was pretty empty. 5pm is a good time to go because they have like a tea time menu (i think it ends at 5:30) but their dinner menu also starts (at 5pm). I was craving noodles in soup but they mostly had fried noodles and rice. I ordered a beef friend spaghetti. It was big portions and the noodles were pretty regular. Some of the beef was very undercooked. My boyfriend ordered a wonton noodle soup which he said was pretty plain. The wontons were pretty regular. This place is pretty regular like any other chinese cafe. I guess the price for the portion its good for people on a budget.
