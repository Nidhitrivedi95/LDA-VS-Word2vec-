dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw After having had lunch at Chengdu Taste (its neighbor), I found myself slightly disappointed with dinner at Yunnan Garden. We got the cumin lamb and spicy/sour rice noodles - both were oily and the meat was quite fatty, so we found ourselves overwhelmed by the grease very quickly. However, the Yunnan noodles (first item on the menu) were delicious. The broth is delicate enough to really let the texture of noodles come through, and is definitely still flavorful without flooding your mouth with MSG. The 3 cold dishes for $6 were also a hit.
