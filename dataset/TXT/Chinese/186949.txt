YE4aLF0374U61cfUkSvqfw My favourite cantonese resturant in Edinburgh, fantastic business lunch on offer with full menu an option. Best to book in advance for Friday lunches and weekend dining as the restaurant is busy at these times and the seating is limited. A good variety of seating arrangements and can cater from couples to large(ish) groups
