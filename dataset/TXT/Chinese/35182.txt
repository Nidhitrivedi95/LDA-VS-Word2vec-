adI5BlJCtvWq2uAwmyndXA Hmm. I'm really conflicted about this place. I had my first trip to Chop Chop Haymarket on Monday with a group of friends for the unlimited banquet meal. I've had dim sum before in Chinatown in London that was incredible, given the amount of hype I've heard; I was expecting Chop Chop to be just as good. To be honest it didn't really meet my expectations but I'm not sure what I was really expecting in Edinburgh. 

Being at the far end of the table I didn't hear what anything was and just accepted anything as it was passed around so I have no idea what my favourite dish would be. (I think it would be one of the dumplings but I have no idea what its filling was except that it was spicy.)  

Whilst I enjoyed the company I didn't really enjoy the meal and felt it was a bit over priced. It was nice to try new things but I probably would have enjoyed it more if I'd had more choice in the dishes I was eating. The drawback of the unlimited banquet seems to be that the entire table needs to be having it. 

On the whole the place was alright, but it wasn't the all signing all dancing restaurant that everyone made it out to be...just an ok restaurant. I'd be willing to go back and give it another try but I'm not doing the unlimited banquet again.
