NYMUlUYYEb3H0nKsauj-yw Run of the mill Chinese place. My girl would give this place 5 stars due to the buffalo chicken roll. I've tried it, really no big deal! Atmosphere and cs are horrible, they don't really understand English, which I hate! I could accept it if they knew how to cook, but its the same as any Chinese take out! Don't expect anything anything
Special, like speaking English! If English was spoken, id give 3 stars at most.
