W_nU2qtu1AEDDCgkCo0gJg I've been here many times and it is always pretty good. 

I usually get the Hainan chicken rice for around $9. It is a huge portion with a bowl of  soup included. My dad got the beef brisket curry. The curry is an orange ish colour, it is more sweet, and a little bit spicy. So delicious with the rice. 

We also got dessert. They were out of crepes which was upsetting but we still got the sesame ice cream waffle. It came with 4 toaster size waffles with a giant scoop of sesame ice cream topped with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. The waffle was crispy and fresh. It went really well with the ice cream! 

Service was pretty attentive and friendly. We got a 15% off coupon for the next time we dine; valid at any of the 3 locations. Overall, this place is worth a try as it has an extensive menu of good quality dishes.
