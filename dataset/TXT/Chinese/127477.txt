pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og Best sushi I ever had!  We took the entire family for my birthday.  Since it was a party of 6, we had a lot of different sushi!  We left stuffed. 

The decor is really neat as well.

I think the key is not to go at peak time.  We arrived at opening, I think 11 a.m.  Everything was fresh and everyone was well satisfied.  My husband had a bento box.

The gelato was great... we were divided between green tea and mango flavor!
