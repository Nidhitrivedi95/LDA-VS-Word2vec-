CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA Coming here I see a lot of people waiting in line which oddly enough is a good sign. Food must be good! 

I ordered the Japanese Pan Noodles, Large size, when I got it I was kind of confused weather or not they gave me a Large size? The bowl was definetly Large, but the portion was a Reg for sure.. It was literally a huge bowl with less than half the portion to fill it? I feel like I paid for the bowl haha..

Now the food was great, I enjoyed the taste of it.. Wish there was more hence why I bought the Large, as good as the food was, $10 for a drink and 5 bites of noodles with 3 pieces of broccoli is just not worth it. Kind of bummed and still hungry, should have gone across the street to chipotle :(
