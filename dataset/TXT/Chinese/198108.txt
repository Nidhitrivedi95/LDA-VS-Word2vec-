The general tso chicken was awful, it was served a bit cold and was dried out. The lobster with the black bean sauce was  tasty, but I've had better. I ended up coming here because it wasn't busy and I was looking for a quick in and out. It started to get busy after 1:30am (all the clubbers).  Not sure if I would make it a regular place to eat.
