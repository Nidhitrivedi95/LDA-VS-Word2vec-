For vegetarians and for those who like spicy food, ask for the traditional Schezuan vegetable and tofu dish. Amazing flavor. 
Enjoyed everything we ordered. Generous portions and very courteous service
Negatives: in an empty restaurant, with just one other family, we were kept waiting for a long before someone came to our table. I guess takeout orders take precedence.
