AbQMlXCfWvMnNXADMaiMIw The decor is a fine attempt at being trendy and cool and to food itself wasn't half bad  edible. 

The service on the other hand was abysmal. Everything was acceptable until the server informed my friend that she was not permitted to eat the fish on top and leave the rice behind on her 'all you can eat' meal. 

What nerve is it that empowers a restaurant to dictate how a person should eat their food?! That was shocking and ridiculous to hear! To top it off, the manners of the person bussing the table were equally atrocious as she reached her arm across my friend's face, barely 2 inches away from her nose, and pulled the plates back to her with nary an 'excuse me' or apology. 

Though the location of this restaurant is quite convenient, I seriously doubt I'll be back and I WILL NOT recommend it to friends.
