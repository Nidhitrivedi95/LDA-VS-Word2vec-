zDQZZZhb8VOk8EaoN3HeTA Ordered "Inn" last night. Pun intended.
Orange Chicken, Pu Pu Platter and House Chow Mein (I freeze most of it so I can have dinner when needed.)

Everything was perfect!

Orange Chicken was not a thick breading like most other places. It was very thin and flavorful. 

Everything in the platter was not overcooked.

Chow mein...no clue. Froze it.

Will be my number one Chinese delivery...as long as they keep up the good product.
