X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Hakkasan Nightclub is my house! Haha JK. This place is my go-to spot whenever my friends and I wanna go out to see our favorite DJ's perform!

Being a Vegas local has its perks when visiting a nightclub is right around the corner! My promoter Dustyn always takes care of my group when I request for a table. He's always provides excellent customer service! The VIP reservations line gets crowded but my group and I never had to wait more than 20 min to get in. The way we were escorted to our table was very professional and fast. The waitress and staff are friendly and accommodating when it came down to bottle service. It includes a bottle of Absolut Vodka with the mixers (Cranberry juice, Orange juice & Soda Water). 

The club itself does get packed almost every weekend which is why I try to avoid the dance floor as much as possible. It is normal that Hakkasan gets crazy crowded before or during the time the DJ is playing. So having a table is so useful when you want to spend time with your friends without trying to suffer bumping into people. 

Overall, I always walk out of Hakkasan feeling satisfied with my experience plus enjoying my night with friends! I highly recommend this nightclub to anyone visiting Las Vegas!!
