CGgUHkAKU0QBsdGvXxfMuw This place is my favorite Chinese food. I ordered one night after finding them on a delivery website and was immediately hooked. They have THE BEST teriyaki chicken in town. I've eaten at the teriyaki places like Kyoto bowl and Japan express and this place surpasses all. The portion size is HUGE and it's cheaper than most. 
The hot and sour soup is incredible as well. You Wont find better in the state I assure you.
