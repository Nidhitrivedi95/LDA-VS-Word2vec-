wh44YZa9OCXjV-ziZ6gjNA Ichiban All You Can Eat was such a good experience! Food was amazing, service was fast and servers were nice. There was a HUGE variety in the menu, none like I've ever seen before. There was also torched sushi, which is uncommon at most places. Not only did they have Japanese cuisine, they had curry, fried rice, lamb chops and so much more. Soda was also included so t was nice not having to pay extra for fountain drinks. Appetizers and some dessert were placed in an area where you can just go to get if you were hungry and didn't want to wait. Overall, a very good AYCE sushi place.
