With respect to the food it is good, even though I am not particularly fan of this type of cuisine but nevertheless it was very well prepared and tasty.  I got the brisket sandwich, which was great while my company enjoyed their plates as well (hanger steak and scallops).  The fritters dim sum was also great and highly recommended.  One more plus of the venue is the large selection of beers, wines and cocktails! I will be definitely going back! 

ps Since parking can be an issue downtown do not circle around looking for a street spot, but there is a parking garage just behind the restaurant on Penn avenue (2 mins walk).
