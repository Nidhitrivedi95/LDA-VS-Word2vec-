rv9T1qGHbh9eXqFpKEPy_A Ordered takeout for 4 and was told our bill was $84.00.  When hubby went to pick up order they said they made a "mistake" adding the order the first time and now the bill was $110.00!  A $26.00 mistake adding!  Just said they were sorry.  Had we not had out of town guests we would have left the whole order.  HOW can they not add correctly as we were on hold for 5 minutes waiting for the total.  Never order from here again.
