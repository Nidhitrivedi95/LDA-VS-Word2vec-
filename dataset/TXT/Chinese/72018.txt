FeigEbRVs3d_WoMVUhIT7g A serious mistake. I split the spicy tuna roll and ordered the Crop Pho. First the roll--it had way too much rice for being advertised as a spicy tuna roll.  The description says its tuna tartare, sriracha and chili flake.  What I received was a ton of rice and in the middle was a little bit of red looking paste. It was so finely ground (food processor) that it was a pate that looked like it was coloring the rice.  Could I tell that it was tuna? no. Was it spicy? no. The sushi rice wasn't right either and the roll itself was rolled way too big.  This would be great if you want some fish flavored sushi rice. 

The Pho was worse.  The broth color immediately threw me off.  Someone asked me if I was having blood soup and they were being serious. I knew it was not going to be traditional clearish broth because it is marketed as a cinnamon beef broth but this was seriously brown-black.  The flavor was strange.  The noodles weren't traditional vermicelli but more like a flat linguini noodle. It was a big bowl of broth and a tiny bit of noodles--way too few. I asked what cut of beef was used in the soup--it claims to be rare beef.  I got grey slices of beef and the waiter had no idea if it was brisket, round or flank. Never again. I hate three bites before giving up.
