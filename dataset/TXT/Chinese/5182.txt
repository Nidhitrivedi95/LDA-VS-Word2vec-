01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ Ask for the garlic spinach.  Its not on the menu but so tasty!  Oh but make sure you ask about the price-we found out later it was $13!  It was really great tasting, but seems to me that the price should be $7 or $8.  So for that price shock I am only giving it a three star rating.  We did inquire about the price of the spinach with the waitress but we didn't get anywhere.

The other things we ordered was salt and pepper chicken wings, seafood, tofu and pork hot pot,.  They brought out the soup with beef bone, vegetables and chicken pieces as an appetizer while we were waiting for out food.  It had a lot of depth of flavor which I assume was from the beef bones and warming to the body.  The waitress slopped it on the table when she served us, creating big wet spots on the nice table linen.  They also brought out the desert soup that I believe is made with red mung beans and I very much liked the taste of that.

I did enjoy very much the food we had and of course we had plenty to take home to eat later.  

I am rating three stars because of the waitress spilling our soup on the table in both bowls and for the high priced $13 garlic spinach.

I did very much enjoy the taste and quality of the food itself, so I definitely will be back for another try.
