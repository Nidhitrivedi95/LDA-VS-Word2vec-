QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ Has anyone ever told you this place is yummy? No? Well, let me be the first one...

Yummy Yummy Dumplings is a lovely, clean-tasting cheap Chinese option with an adorable name. Seriously, say it out loud and try to keep a straight face. If you did that  successfully, I'm sorry to be the first to tell you: You're a robot. Shitty. 

Things that aren't shitty? Their delightful dumplings. I really enjoyed my pork and chive dumplings and my pork bun, as well as their hot and sour soup and beef noodle soupy dish (I'm so bad with names:/). 

Their menu is extensive and not the norm in Chinatown, and if you heart dumplings and hate MSG you will surely be a fan.
