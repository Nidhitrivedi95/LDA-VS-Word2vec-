zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Momofuku is a great place to grab a quick quality lunch. The service is really efficient, and the host/hostesses at the front are helpful and friendly and actually try hard to get you seated fast.  They were even accommodating of my group of five and although we had to wait, they looked into options like splitting us into two groups to get us seated faster.

I ordered the ramen ($15) and while I found the noodles bland at first, I actually ended up really liking the ramen because I could eat the whole bowl, including drinking all the broth (don't judge me!), without it tasting too salty.  I really liked the addition of kimchi into the ramen, which you can order an entire jar of for $7 as a side dish. So while it wasn't super traditional Japanese ramen as far as I can tell, it was a really good interpretation of it.  I also tried a bit of my friend's kimchi stew ($16), and the flavour was amazing.

I wouldn't really describe Momofuku as good value, but I would call it dependable, high quality Asian comfort food.
