mmt2tfx6HkMPVJs2Ecr-Sw Chinatown, Montreal needs an upgrade (think of this song as you read this, "Upgrade you" by Beyonce). Only if I could post an mp3 file w/my yelp reviews. :p

Nevertheless, its the quality of the food that matters. Hence, the crab was delish. Not more delish than the crab in Cali, or in NY, but I'm a crab eating diva, as WInny would put it, so I will be nice and yelp good things about this restaurant. 

Eggplant dish was spicy to the max, just as my bff requested for it to be. She also picked out jalapeno slices and lined them along the rim of her plate. :p
