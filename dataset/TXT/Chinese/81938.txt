H2ljOK6pDHJ-iQzHkijW0w Pros:
Large seating area
Specials for any time of the day

Cons:
Not as much variety as other HK style cafes
Portions could be bigger

Seen this place many times as I have a friend who lives in the condos near by.  Finally decided to give it a try for lunch.  

When we first walked in I thought the place was a decent size. Little did I know that I was only seeing half the place.  They had a whole other seating section on the other side I missed at first.  Needless to say there is a bunch of seating here.  There is also a huge soccer motif going on here.  The placed is lined with soccer decorations and the TVs have soccer playing as well.  If you love soccer, this is your kinda place.

This place has menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They have specials for every part of the day.  Having said that, I found the menus a little limited compared to other HK style cafes.  They have say 20-25 items per menu so you're really limited to what they offer at that time of day.  I don't know if you can ask for other menus for different times but we were only given the menu for the time of day we came.  There wasn't a regular menu that we could order from at any time of the day.  We came at 1030 and were given the breakfast menu.  I had to wait until after 1100 to grab a lunch menu and order from there.

The food was very well done in my opinion here.  The presentation was nice, even for the bowl of noodles which was nice considering no one really takes the time to make a bowl of noodles look that good.  My rice dish looked better than most places. Taste-wise everything is on par as far as HK cafes go.

All in all, a fairly decent HK style cafe.  I think the soccer motif is a different take on things as well.  They are pretty decent where it counts though, the food.
