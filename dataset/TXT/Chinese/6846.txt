0NgePUfXd2TG0kWgsQRq0A This location has a problem with raising the price and I don't see anything new being offered at all since I've been going here! Child size is now called small and only $1 less and the bowl size is exactly the same they even throw away anything that falls out of your bowl now. Anyways I wasn't very hungry and the orange haired skinny girl said I couldn't share my bowl with my bf and my dad was getting his own bowl. I've been going here forever this is the only time I ever wanted to share
