vsoEZauF4lrADIqCYXySFQ I am a fan of Chopstix delivery service! Chopstix is a new Chinese restaurant on Green and 2nd.  My roommate has been ordering food there a couple of times and encouraged me to try it. The menu is like any other chinese restaurant: soup, appetizer, poultry, fried rice, etc. 

The girl who picked up the phone was very nice. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken entree which included a side of whtie rice and was priced $9.05. A lot of the entrees are p riced between $8-9 which isn't too bad. It's on the border of pricey, however, I don't mind paying this much from Chopstix. They have a combo platter which I wouldn't recommend ordering. The combo platter is priced between $7-$7.50 and is a smaller portion than the entree. It is served with steamed white rice or fried rice with a choice of either egg roll or spring roll. The portion is too small and they don't give you enough meat in the combo platter. In addition, the egg roll isn't that great. However, my General Tso Chicken entree came in a timely manner. It was hot and fresh. The delivery guy was very polite and I gave him a $2 tip. On the side note, I just found out that they will charge a $1.50 delivery fee if your order is $15.00... oh well. I'm excited that they're open till 3AM which I need to take advantage of in the future. 

Anyways, I would recommend ordering at Chopstix again. Thank you, roomie for this awesome recommendation.
