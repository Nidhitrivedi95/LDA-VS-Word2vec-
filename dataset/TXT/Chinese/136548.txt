QhmxJJxzpEOleqU2E598TQ We've been going here regularly since it first opened in the summer.  Awesome food, great service!  Really generous portions!  We usually order the spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken, dry garlic shrimp (mmm spicy!) and mixed fried rice.  Haven't had a bad dish yet!  Support your local restaurant and eat here!
