I've been in mourning for the past three months, since they discontinued the popular Tuesday night offering.  Not to worry, they still have tasty happy hour specials and their food really is worth the full price.  

House of Hunan caters to larger groups (if you call ahead), and if you come with someone celebrating a birthday, they will bring a scoop of ice cream with a sparkler out after the meal.

Now that it's summertime, I suspect they will start opening their front windows during the day.  Those are the seats you want, and sushi really is a nice meal on a warm day.  Be sure to ask about their specialty rolls.. the ones not listed on the menu.

Service with a smile, and still walking distance from our home.
