emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw Have not been here in quite some time, at one time was one of the better places for dim sum and banquets. The food is still good, but went to dim sum a couple weeks ago and the service was terrible. We had 3 tables and the dim sum carts would not go to all the tables. I don't know why they would not want to go to each table and get rid of their items, are ashamed of the food or do they think they are in a race for how fast they can make a lap around the restaurant. There are too many other good dim sum places to go to rather than this one. Don't go here!
