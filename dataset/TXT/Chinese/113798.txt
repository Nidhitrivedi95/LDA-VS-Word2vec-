mRubgo8WfjraJkE5Bvbf6w I have eaten here several times now and the food is really tasty. They have good quantity of veggies and protein to make a healthy meal. The service was a little messed up when i went to dine in but they fixed it for me. 
Price is extremely reasonable and this is a good place to dine in.
