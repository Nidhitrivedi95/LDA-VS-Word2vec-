uP2-0N59oW5lggIyvdfWkQ Definitely the best Peking duck in Toronto!  Lean, tasty duck, sliced just right.  We also ordered Singapore vermicelli, which was really flavourful, and fresh mixed vegetables.  There was a lot of food, so we got to take some home. Good service, which is very important to note as we plan to return another time. The only drawback was the grotty washroom, which doesn't go well with the delicious food.  Try not to go to the washroom as that may give you an awful last impression.
