hlDcfzRGfmSmL5LpYcRqKA Awful service order egg foo yong got some kinda shrimp slop.We ordered two orders of dumplings got one.Hair in my egg drop soup.They did not want to give us credit or money back when we called.I think it is disrespectful not to honor costumers. I think this restaurant is run by cheaply and cant admit when they are wrong.Not coming back here .I suggest you stay far away from this nasty place...
