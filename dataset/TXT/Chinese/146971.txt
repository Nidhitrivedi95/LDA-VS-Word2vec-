S9CrHJJnns3cqdGca7mQWQ I go here all the time! The food is always amazing and cooked fresh when you order. I have had pretty much everything on the menu, and love it all! They beef and broccoli for some reason is out of this world! My only complaint is sometimes the lady that takes the order doesn't understand what you say, I have had a few mixups with egg rolls and asking for extra sesame sauce, but that's really not a biggie since it doesn't happen too often. 
*tip, if you order the combo plates, you get about as much food as a 2 entree panda meal with egg roll for like 3 bucks less than at panda.
