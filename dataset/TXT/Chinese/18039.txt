5_4cm4QVHn86EsiVZ46MhQ The buffet is good if you really know what to eat. They have the deep fried shrimp, korean bbq, clams, juicy salmon, and duck. I don't like their sushi. Don't eat their general tao chicken or sesame chicken. One had rancid chicken and the other had rancid sauce all of the times I went. 

They offer hot pot buffet and it's a huge deal if you're a fan. You order your unlimited ingredients plate by plate. You can choose from a long list including blue crab, snow crab, shrimp with head, mussels, shrimp paste, lamb, beef, squid, water cress, napa, spinach, etc. I can eat a lot so it's a great deal for me. The soup base can be either spicy or clear. I like the dipping sauce as well.

This is my economic version of tin tin!
