uiShreF9oKvzuqxWWxECAw Shanghai steamed buns is my favourite dish from my hometown. I want to find a place in Toronto/GTA that's as close as it gets, and surprising, this place makes amazing steamed buns. 

Food first, must try their crab and pork steamed buns. Then there's the braised lamb in casserole. No chinese restaurants has topped this lamb dish yet!! It's heavenly. Their hand pulled chicken is delicious as well.

Elegant decor, and surprising pleasing service from the servers. You can also call for takeout, which I've done many times for their steamed buns; although they taste a billion times better fresh at the restaurant.
