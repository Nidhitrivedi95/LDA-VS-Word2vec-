Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg Came here for breakfast  on our last day of the trip. Nice decoration. Everything on the picture menu looks so good!!

Pumpkin shark fin soup - bit bland, not too impressed

Shredded chicken/duck with egg super bowl congee - looks simple, but the flavor was a WOW!!

Pan fried shrimp steam rice noodle - Can't beat $3.50 for a large plate of delicious tasty rice noodle with peanut/oyster sauce

Salt and pepper fish filet - Portion was way too big for three ppl, but the flavor was good. 

Overall, love the chinese breakfast style food. Large portion and reasonably priced.
