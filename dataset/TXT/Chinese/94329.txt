jDehhKtVZa62k32WHbnc2A I heard that China Star catered the Chinese delegates when G20 was here and I could totally believe it! 

The hubby and I were in the mood for Chinese, but real Chinese not that fake American take out stuff that people pretend is Chinese. So we hit up China Star. That was 7 visits ago. We are in love. We always order the Tan Tan noodles and Mapo Tofu because it's amazing. We also like to rotate the second dish around and have tried a variety of different dishes. All of which have been amazing. 

If you are in the mood for real Chinese check this place out and make sure you order from the correct menu (there are 3!)
