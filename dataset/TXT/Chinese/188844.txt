yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA My boyfriend made me realize the name of the restaurant can be pronounced into something else if said really fast so that's one of the memorable moments I associate with this place.

All jokes aside,my family and I are Vietnamese and we always have to get some comfort food whenever we go to Vegas and this is our go-to place. It's a very crowded place and is open for 24 hours. We came here on december 29th around lunchtime to grab a hot bowl of pho . before heading to the mountains for a snow day. My boyfriend, who is Filipino, decided to be the outcast and got himself a rice dish with bbq meat and an egg cake. Food took pretty long even though the orders were simple, but it was fine because the whole restaurant was packed. 

I got the usual pho tai because I'm basic like that. The broth was really hot and wholesome just the way I like it. My family finished within 30 minutes and the bill came quick. I don't remember the total, but it was inexpensive.

Thank you for a hot bowl of yummy pho! Pretty sure I will be back again haha.
