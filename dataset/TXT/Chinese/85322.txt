hjDCsuzS_yU60FFffqpt-w I came here tonight because I was hungry and wanted a variety of food to choose from.  The prices here are fair, and the food selections pretty darn good.  The salad bar is awesome, with tons of fresh fruit, toppings, dressings and a bunch of other stuff.

The first time I came here I ate like it was going out of style and really liked the food. They have a sushi bar, but the selection's limited.  They also have a grill where they cook stuff like it's a Mongolian grill, and its not half bad.

Sometimes the drink refills are slow, and I will admit, even though the food is good, some dishes are better then others.  Definitely a good place to go eat at with a good selection and great prices.
