xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I LOVE Lulu's Pan Fried Noodles! The prices are just fine for the amount of food that you get. My friend and I go here all the time and she gets the pan fried noodles and I get the Pad Thai. We split the two plates into two dishes and it is to. die. for. Strangely enough the pan fried noodles taste a little reminiscent of Mexican food... sounds weird, but don't knock it until you try it!! :)
