yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A I've been here on multiple occasions and the service has been great. Our waiter was friendly. We were offered water which was nice. 

The food is good and flavorful. The skewers are my favorite along with the lettuce wraps. If you are looking for something that is tasty and easy Flo's is the way to go.
