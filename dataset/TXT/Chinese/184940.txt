xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw I have been here quite a few times over the past 5 years and never had issues. Although the last 3 times the service has continued to get worse and worse leading to the one today.

My fiancé and I thought we would go out for an early dinner. We had three different servers before our food came out, then our food arrives and my bowl is burnt to a crisp. A fourth server comes over and asks how everything is, we tell them that my food os burnt (were not rude as these things happen). She goes to get the manager and one manager comes over and tells me I can go make another bowl and with an attitude tells me he wont charge me for the bowl they burned. As I am getting up another manager comes over and tries blaming me for my food being burned as if it was my fault.

After I re-ordered my bowl, we were then given a 5th server who was actually quite nice and said when he asked management if they were going to do anything for us since they burned my food and my fiancé and I had to eat separately, they said no.

We were not expecting a free meal, discount or anything of the sorts, but the fact that management was so rude and never apologized but rather tried to blame me for my food being burned is beyond me. How management can be so careless and ignorant towards a paying customer and try blaming them for burning their own food is beyond me. 

Because of this, we will no longer be eating here.
