Maybe reserve a few spots out front for take-out customers? But, the food is so good here, I'd park down the street! Again, Chinese take-out is VERY hit or miss in AZ. This place reminds me of home (NY). I have tried a lot of asian restaurants in the Valley, and Dragon Palace posts up at the top spot! Fast, friendly, and reasonably priced. Try the Peking Fried Rice or Chow Mein, so good. The Orange Peel Beef, and Sesame Chicken are to die for. Beef/Shrimp with Snow Peas, and the House Special Chicken/Shrimp is great. The War Wonton is the best I've ever had. And honestly, I would never have tried this place if not for the other reviewers. The fact that this place has been around this long, and customers have been coming here for years and years and always satisfied; I had to try it out. So glad I did, thank you! This IS my place for Chinese now and later. Really happy to have found this little gem. :)
