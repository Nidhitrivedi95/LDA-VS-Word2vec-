qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA Most of PF Chang's food dishes are very good. We've been going here since Chang's was created, maybe for the past 24 years. 

Normally my favorite is Chang's Spicy Chicken, and my husband's is Orange Peel Chicken. Our daughter loves the kid's lo mein. 

Once in a while I deviate, but sometimes I'm disappointed. Tonight I ordered the Lobster Sushi roll. It was the blandest sushi roll I've ever eaten in my life. Just no flavor at all. It was like eating chunks of rice. Even their wasabi and ginger are bland. I guess an Americanized Chinese food place doesn't know how to make Japanese sushi. 

Another disappointing meal I've had here in recent months was the filet mignon dish - I think it was a stir fry. The meat wasn't good. It may as well have been flank steak. 

There are other wonderful mainstay dishes on their menu, such as buddha's feast, fried rice, all the chicken dishes, pan fried pork dumplings and Dan Dan Noodles.
