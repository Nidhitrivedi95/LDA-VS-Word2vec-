X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Have to agree with many of the other reviews. Went this past weekend on a Fri and Sat for Tiesto and Calvin. Fri no table and tried to hang out upstairs. There is absolutely nowhere to stand upstairs that allows you to see the DJ. Unless you have a balcony front table, there is NO view. We eventually found an abandoned balcony table and hung there for a couple of hours, but otherwise would have been a wasted night.

For Sat we had a great table. We were on a nice little elevated area of the floor so we could see the DJ perfectly. However, all the tables below us were looking through all of the people standing up on their tables ahead of them. Not a great set up for them. I would have been furious if I had been sat there.

Table service was good, but at $5-7k, I would expect so, and not a reason to rate anyone very highly.

The layout left a lot to be desired. The hallways in and out of the club were tiny, and fit only 1-2 people wide. Why?? The walkway to the bathroom from our table required us to walk through an area between the bar and a railing which was about 6 feet wide, and had no security to keep people moving. So, that entire half of the club was stuck walking through a congested little walkway. Why??  

Plus, no outdoor access from the club.  Having been to Marque and XS I would recommend those over HK by a moderate margin. Worth seeing, but without any outdoor space to break up the evening, you're stuck inside what feels like a cramped space.

The downstairs hip hop room (3rd floor) was just OK.  Went to the Ling Ling Lounge also on the 3rd floor, but it was pretty small feeling, again with no outdoor spaces.

We used Red Carpet VIP to get into club on Sat and would recommend them highly.
