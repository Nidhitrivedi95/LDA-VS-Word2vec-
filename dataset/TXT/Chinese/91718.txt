ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w As a Chinese restaurant catering to the affluent multicultural midtown clientele, this place has ALMOST nailed everything except for the service. 

The waiters are always in a rush, talk rudely and dictatively, make minimal eye contact and deliver (more like dump) dishes to the wrong table (especially during busy weekends).

Also be careful to check your bill before you pay.
