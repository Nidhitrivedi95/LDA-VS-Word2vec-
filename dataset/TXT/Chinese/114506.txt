mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w I like this place mainly because of its location, the best dim sum place probably still is in gold coast, but you can never get in there during weekends, it is always packed, the quality of  east ocean dim sum is close to the one in palms , but palms is too far from where I live . anyway I tried chicken feet last time , (the must try dim sum dish), but it was not good , tasted staled, like being heated many time. I love the barbecue pork , string beans, spare ribs, tasted very authentic. this probably is the only authentic chinese restaurant in henderson.
