MHjhR_znpBr9S437VOmXKQ I went few months ago with my friends and sister we were very excited to try bbq hotpot for the first time OH BOI how i regret going to that place.. 1st the table they gave us was sticky and dirty.. second the portable stove was also sticky and dirty... 3rd My sister found a "PLASTIC" in her eggroll (The man whom we complained to takes it and puts it in his pocket and says that "It's Normal" WTF? ) . Then when we payed for everything they still wanted tip from my sister O_o... and yes the man who took the plastic was no where to be found.

 I would never ever recomend this place to anyone or to even give it another chance this is the worst restaurant i ever and i mean ever went to.
