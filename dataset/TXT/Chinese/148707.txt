SlQNMsVEOSxN-ciIn93LOw The food here is like bad Chinese takeout except you get it on a plate instead of in a white box.  Super greasy and stale tasting.    The restaurant was busy and people were being shuffled in and out like cattle.  Waiter was more interested in getting our order fast and getting us out.

Large portions though if you are into greasy Chinese food.

There is a better Chinese buffet across Harris Blvd.  Same greasy Chinese type food but fresh and buffet style.
