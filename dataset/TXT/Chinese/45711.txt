Their menu has a sampling of the more popular Chinese, Japanese and Thai dishes, but doesn't contain a lot of exotic Asian dishes or items from more exotic places like Malaysia, Vietnam or Laos.  The sushi is solid, and the bar is small but the bartenders are skilled.  It's a particularly solid place to go if you're with a group that has a varied palate range.
