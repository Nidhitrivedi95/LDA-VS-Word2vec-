qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ When i heard a Korean Chinese restaurant opened close to home, i got chicken skin, two of my fave foods under one roof! The decor is Asian, pretty with strong chinese influence. most serve tets are Korean and very hospitable staff, always asking how we are doing, extra star awarded* 
Unfortunately I found the food lacked flavor and was quite bland.  We had the Jamppong and Jajaemyeung, and barely ate it before we lost our appetite. menu is extensive and perhaps the chinese food may be of better cooking, but don't go if you are expecting bibimbap or soondubu.
