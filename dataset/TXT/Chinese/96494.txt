jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow Ight check it, I'm about to put 90% of the female workers who work on the floor into check.  Just because you are pretty ,cute, instagram famous,facebook famous,get 100+ views on snapchat doesn't mean that you have to talk to customers/approach them with a stuck up attitude. Not everyone who walks in is there for you and to admire your beauty because the world revolves around you. Some people,like me, just want to enjoy a nice dinner ight.
 I walked in
Cashier:just one? 
Me:high good evening, how are you doing today?

Why do I have more manners then the employees? 

I paid my fee to get in and was asked to stand on the side and wait to be seated by a bus girl, so I stand and wait and I see some bus girl approaching me, I say "hi how is it going?" And the girl  grabes a fork but no knife and just nods her head to follow her ...tf?

I guarantee you that if I was in need of a job and I applied here I will end up taking both of those females job. There are just up in the front for being pretty,I rather have an ugly girl or a guy attend me who will do an awesome job vs a stuck up young pretty female who will do a horrible job.

The only reason I am giving this place a 2 star instead of 1 is because the other bus girl who kept picking up my plates and refilling my drink was actually very kind. I wish I would've gotten her name but she was covering the center front tables on Friday night around 8pm sept 9. She looks Hispanic and had highlights or light brown hair I believe.  I asked her if she shares tips with everyone or is he keeps them and she said she keeps them. I said good. I don't want anyone else getting my money as a gratitude for their hard work.
