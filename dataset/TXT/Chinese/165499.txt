v_YaNPJbP1XKGG-R_vUZ1Q By far the worst food I've ever had in Lakewood. Kung Pao Chicken? Unseasoned chicken with undercooked vegetables and red glop... 
Lakewood is known for it's good restaurants, this is not one of them. It almost seems like they were trying to make it mediocre.
I can't imagine this place will be around much longer with this kind of quality.
