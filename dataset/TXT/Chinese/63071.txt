DwmAsemahJywywhuqv5J1Q After getting into Pittsburgh on Sunday night around 7pm, I was looking for a Chinese place to deliver downtown. Surprise surprise a lot of 4 star Chinese places don't deliver, not on a Sunday night anyway. I was lucky to come across this place. I ordered a shrimp fried rice, and since it's Sichuan food, I had to get cumin lamb. I judge a lot Sichuan places by the quality of their cumin lamb. 

Once I received the food, I knew I'd gotten a bit more than one person can eat. There was one bowl full of shrimp fried rice that was enough for two meals, and then there was the cumin lamb that came with a separate container of regular steamed rice. The shrimp fried rice was OK. I probably shouldn't have eaten it together with the cumin lamb. 

I loved the amount of lamb in the cumin lamb. A lot of Sichuan places give you a plate with about half dried peppers and half lamb, but not in this case. There was actually about 90% lamb vs peppers. Plus, under the doughcrust there is actually a good amount of lamb, instead of just fried dough. It was very strong in a sweet and sour kind of way, with the cumin added in. Also quite spicy in that numbing way Sichuan food has. I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, because the cumin lamb was so strong, the shrimp fried rice was bland in comparison. It had a bit of salty and fried rice taste to it, but the shrimp didn't really have a shrimp taste. 

Great takeout Chinese place if you're in Downtown Pittsburgh on business or something, and it's pretty reasonably priced. I got the two dishes for about $33 bucks and it lasted me three meals.
