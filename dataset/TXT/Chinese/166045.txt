1st Review
Only because I have had better Chinese in LA. The food was good, service was kind of slow today. Took 10 mins to get our Check. Also Orange Chicken was brought to our table sitting  for 15 mins with the Spring Rolls. Finally after 15 mins they brought us our Pork Rice, Beef and Broccoli. I will be going back hopefully next time it wont be as busy. Definitely the best Chinese in Vegas. Mos def check it at yall...lol
