DQMaUSbKsRtB5lJD3egqxQ Wah Kee's specialty is their homemade wonton noodle. So if you want to be safe and have a good dining experience, go with their specialty noodle menu. Whenever I get a chance to go there, I always order their wonton noodle.  And it never disappoint me.  They make the best wonton with thin wrap (the key for a good authentic wonton).  

I also like their fried rice with salted-fish and chicken. It taste similar to the one I had in Hong Kong.  And if you like green vegetables cooked authentic Chinese-style, they are the only one in town (I think) who offer stir-fry green vegetables (with garlic) on the menu.

Service could take longer sometime, especially when the restaurant is busy.  But if you know what you want, just order it immediately as soon as you are seated.  This will safe you a lot of time to get your foods served.
