tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw While eating in the restaurant is always good take out and delivery is a different story.  Just ordered using door dash portions are so tiny it's a joke.  I called talked to a manager and was told everything is weighed and that's that!  Not an answer very disappointed feel like we have no food and portions are half the size.
