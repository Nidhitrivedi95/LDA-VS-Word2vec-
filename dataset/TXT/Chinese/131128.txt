PhNdyQTtZjOQ1bqoT4S3oA Great Chinese food and pleasant service, that's what I have had every time I've eaten at China Bay restaurant. Their food is delicious and reasonably priced. If you stop by to place an order, expect a little bit of a wait, because they are pretty busy. I take that as a good sign. The owners are great people and the food is great. Well worth it if you are in the neighborhood.
