a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg Was craving for chinese food , so I found this place on yelp. Here I am. Not gonna lie the food was good, but still though its American-Chinese food. If you wanna have the real kungpao chicken ,pls reconsider it before you order their's, Im not saying their's are bad or something. It jus will blow your chinese mind. Lmao. And one more thing, the light is way too dim for me, I can barely see my food,JK.
