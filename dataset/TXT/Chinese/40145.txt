AyOLu1vg-CZtVVhYRKJYAA The name says it all... BEST CHINA RESTAURANT I have ever been too!! My favorite dish is their orange chicken.. Not the typical orange chicken we are all used to.. No, this is hands down the BEST orange chicken ever. Sesame chicken and singapore noodles are also delish!! I 100% recommend this place! The service has improved tremendously since the first time we went a year ago... I hope you all enjoy it as much as my family and I do!!
