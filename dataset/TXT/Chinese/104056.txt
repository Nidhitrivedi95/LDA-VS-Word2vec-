Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg We sat outside on a nice evening.  Service was friendly, but a little slow.  The server seemed to disappear for long periods of time.

Food was good and serving sizes good for the price, which is typical for PF Changs.

Beer selection was good with some interesting craft brews.  

Overall a good dining experience for the strip.
