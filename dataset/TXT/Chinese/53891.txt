cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ I have been to this buffet four times in the last few years, and my recent experience was the best. Good selection. Good food. Quick replenishing. Quick service. I went on a Sunday for lunch so it was busy, but everything was consistent. Most of the items I had were delicious. Try their specialties! The noodles!! The dessert section was probably the most disappointing in taste, but that's why I usually stick to ice cream at buffets.
