I have gone to this location on Valle Verde for years and have loved this place. It's a great VERY FAST Chinese Food restaurant that serves very good food. Plus they deliver!

Last week I got my favorite dish. Not only did it come out in minutes, but they brought it to my table... they don't have waitstaff!

There is a large menu with lots of combinations but I've found that you can pretty much MAKE UP WHATEVER YOU WANT. For example, instead of the CHICKEN AND EGGPLANT or TOFU AND EGGPLANT I just get CHINESE VEGETABLES AND EGGPLANT. It is by far my favorite dish of theirs.  You can get HALF ORDERS (Most Whole Orders are $9, half orders are $6). Most lunches come with a combo setup including EGG DROP SOUP.

VERY FAST and VERY, VERY HOT!!!
