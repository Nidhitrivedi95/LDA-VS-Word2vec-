sIKuBMvUCqqjN0uqI70btA I love eating Noodle Soup so I can be quite bias to a place that have over 10 different kind of noodle soup with tea/coffee starting from $5.25 for lunch!

Oriental Cafe is a lot cleaner than the 2 other restaurants beside and across from it. The seats are all heavily cushioned and are quite comfy.

The lunch special starts at 11 AM to 6:00 PM so you can really have an early lunch or a late late late lunch. There are 3 different pages of special that they offer.. includes both Shanghai, Cantonese and some Western Chinese Cuisine.

I order the chef's special beef noodle soup. The beef is quite good and the size is just perfect!

Now I want to try every single soup noodles on the menu!

CASH only!
