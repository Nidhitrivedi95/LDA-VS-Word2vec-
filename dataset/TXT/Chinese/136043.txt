QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA This was the worst food and the worst service I've ever experienced! The food came out exactly 4 minutes after ordering. Was hard as a rock as they had over cooked what was already made. When we asked about other options the waiter told us maybe next time we just shouldn't order the chicken and walked away. It was only after we returned the dishes uneaten that the manager came and asked what we wanted. Additionally, upon receiving the check, the waiter yelled at us to not touch it as we tried to point out how to split the check. Would never step foot in that place again.
