c4-w_6Xv4i2qRE3c4Qas7w Just got dim sum from here and i just found it OK. I think it might be im just not a fan of steamed rubbery foods like steamed dim sum. I did like the pan fried dumpling a lot mmmmm.  I just thought i would give the steamed ones a shot since i wanted to look for something healthier. WELL steamed dim sum is just not for me. I guess ima keep eating sushi for my healthy asian takeout needs and splurge on some fried dim sum when i dont feel so fat.
