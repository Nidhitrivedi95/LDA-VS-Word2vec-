fJCsDc353UC6eUn-kCBrGw Okay, so I finally went to P.F. Chang's and I'd have to say it was alright.  We went there for a work function so the bill was not something I had to worry about!  Which was uber nice because I tried a few things that I normally wouldn't buy myself. So here is a run down of what I had:

Appetizer: Tuna Tataki Crisp $9.95 *****
~ This was very good! I am a sushi fanatic, so I really enjoyed this dish. It was Ahi tuna rare on a crispy wonton-topped with ahi, cucumber, and scallions in a citrus sesame soy sauce. It was very fresh! I feel it could have used a tad more on the citrus sesame soy sauce but other than that, fabulous!

Appetizer: Lettuce Wraps $7.95 *
~  I can honestly say that these wraps were not what I expected.  With all the hype I thought these were gonna blow my taste buds to smithereens! They did no such thing.  They were "okay" at best.  Not a lot of flavor in the meat filling at all. Will not be getting these again.

Dinner: Oolong Marinated Chilean Sea Bass $24.95 ****
~  This FISH was amazing! It was served in a ginger soy type broth with spinach.  While the fish was extraordinary, I felt there was way too much broth and it just made my spinach way to soggy and a bit on the salty side.  It would have been a 5 star dish with less of the broth.

Desert: Mudslide Cocktail $9.00 *****
~ This deserved 5 stars! It was very yummy and it's alcohol! Win win! 

While I enjoy the food, I felt it to be a bit over priced.  The wait staff was super nice and you never had to "search" for anyone.  Would I go here again? If it were another work function, yes.  Otherwise, probably not.
