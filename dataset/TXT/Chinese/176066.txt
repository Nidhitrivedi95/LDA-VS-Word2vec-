WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg I've had my share of Hakka Chinese, but tried Yueh Tung b/c my girlfriend HIGHLY recommended it. The food was really good and the price was very affordable. The wait staff could have been a bit more friendly, but all in all it was a good evening. 

If you like Hakka, try this place
