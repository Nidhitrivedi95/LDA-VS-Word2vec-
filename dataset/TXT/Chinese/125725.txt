oYAAc-KvuUqqFlwTuGx_hw We came her me for lunch and were the only ones in the place. I ordered the orange chicken my boyfriend ordered the mango chicken. The taste itself was not bad. The orange chicken had way to much breading and very little chicken. The sweat and sour soup was good. The egg rolls were disgusting, they were very hot on the outside and frozen in the inside.
