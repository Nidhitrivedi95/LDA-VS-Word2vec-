fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A Usually have decent luck with this place, today 7/14/17 is probably he worse food I've ever eaten at a Chinese restaurant. The food came out cold when we were the only 3 tables here. Never again will I eat here, we came here with a party of 37 and no one was happy with their food.
