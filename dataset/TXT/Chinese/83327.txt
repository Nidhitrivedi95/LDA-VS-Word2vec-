hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA We loved this place. For a cheap Asian all you can eat it was wonderful.the food was very good. The selection was comparable to other Asian buffets as far as the number of items but at this place they have snow crab legs and other dried crab. They have mussels and clams. The food was all hot and great. We didn't see any steam trays that had cold or old looking food. The place for a Friday night was decently busy but we did get seated right away. The atmosphere was nice for an Asian buffet. It was pretty clean and very well lit. It felt very inviting. The service was good as they kept the plates cleared and kept our waters filled. Overall a very good experience and we will be returning.
