cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Honestly the best way i could describe it is a slight upgrade over mandarin. The environment is really nice and big i didn't expect the sitting area to be that large. The selection of the food is good too. The lunch prices are pretty decent as well. The food was not quality but not horrible either. Overall it was decent
