K4-J1A_ZIzG2yNkee0KOaA This is probably the best take out restaurant ever! I always order their won ton mein for a late night snack...or second dinner. What ever it is, it opens super late so it's a place that I will go back for sure. Being a night owl, restaurants that open late is key. There are many booths around the restaurant and in the middle there is plenty of room for seating. They also have another section in the back where it's all booths. This section is good if you want to escape the noise or would enjoy someone more private. Service is fast and quick and accurate. I never had any issues with an order. They seen to know what you want! Very attentive to the table. The other great dish I love is the rice noodle with peanut sauce, it's so delicious and yummy!
