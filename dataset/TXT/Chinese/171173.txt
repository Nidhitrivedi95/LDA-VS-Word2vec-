vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Usually a place me and my family go on our trips to Vegas. They usually have good food and good service. Notice I am saying USUALLY a lot. We first got in for dim sum and had one or two carts serve us then it was like we were infected people because no one would serve us. It took us about half an hour to get water and when we asked them to leave a pitcher of water so we wouldn't have to bother asking for refills, the waitress brought us 3 more glasses.  So we had plenty of water. We did however see a lot of dim sum carts pass us, but they seemed to be going to every other table but ours. You would think a table of 12 people would be easier to spot. Especially with half of use waving for service. We still are waiting as I am typing this. But I can take comfort in knowing that I will never go thirsty coming to Ping Pang Pong. Hungry maybe but never thirsty. Full of water sitting here looking at all the water glasses. I would love to give them 5 stars if I were rating their water service but cannot give them any stars based on their overall service. They get one only because Yelp will not let me post this with no stars.
