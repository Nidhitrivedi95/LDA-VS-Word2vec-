oNZgQTBzazjS6JQBvmE_HA Went there at lunch today (friday) with a colleague. As you may know, yonge/st. clair is quite a busy office spot during the day. Sat down and ordered. 45 min (!?) later, my colleague's food came (without the extra spring roll he asked for). 10min later i am forced to flag the waiter down to tell him i have to go back to work so i need my lunch to go and the bill. Other folks got served some of their meals before us, but only 1 of 3 diners at a table for example. Place was half empty. When i finally scarfed my food back at the office it was meh. Quite greasy-- chinese food truck quality, not worth the $9. Avoid this place and let it die its rightful natural death.
