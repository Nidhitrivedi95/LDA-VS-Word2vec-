3rHMaoarZ13Qrafr2DeFcA I'm just so sad. I've tried every approximation of Thai food in Whitby and have come to a conclusion.

Thai food is dead in Whitby. 

Melodramatic? Yes. 
True? Sadly, yes.

Good Thai food doesn't exist here. Heck, I'll even settle for average. Mediocre! Alas, they're all terrible.

My recent craving for Thai made me desperate. After my last debacle with iThai, I ordered from The Zen. Nothing adventurous. Just regular old Pad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp and Red Curry Chicken.

Upon opening the containers, the Pad Thai was O.R.A.N.G.E. WTF. It was sweet. It was mushy. I couldn't tell whether they were sliced onions or rice noodles. The chicken and shrimp were non-existent. 

The Red Curry Chicken wasn't red or curry. It was an off-white watery sauce with tiny and chewy pieces of chicken and a lot of veggies thrown in for volume.

You know what else gets me? How are you charging extra for rice when most Asian restaurants give the rice for free. This slop wasn't cheap! The two dishes came up to $26. 

Seriously, I give up. No more Thai food ordering in Whitby. I don't think I can handle another disappointment.
