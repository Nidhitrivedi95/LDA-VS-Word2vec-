aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg super good food!!! this is trul the best HK style bbq food in Las Vegas. They are famous for their belly roasted pork, make sure you try that!!! or the combo bbq items on rice or make your own noodle soup!!! i'm drooling just writing the review! the staff was super nice and friendly, we came in almost closing time, and they were still willing to served us!!! highly recommended!!!
