BrORoLCE5zVY6ekUb6omNA Came here tonight with a group of five. Sampled the Singapore noodles, pad Thai, flat noodles, fried rice, and steamed dumplings. Everything was delicious. Service was quick, server was friendly and helpful, and portions were generous. 

You can adjust the heat/spiciness on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the mildest and 5 the hottest. Usually restaurants err on the side of caution with the heat ratings, but our "3" entrees carried quite a kick, and even the "2" entrees had more heat than we expected. We could handle the heat, but that's definitely something to keep in mind while ordering. 

We were all very pleased with Mad Noodles and look forward to eating there again soon.
