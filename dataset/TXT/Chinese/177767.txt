WzrMNz9eUF78RgZGDTS8xg OMG! What happened to this place. Used to go here quite a bit but it's been a few years. Stopped in for dinner about 8pm tonight. The dining room was filthy, floors greasy, chairs and benches covered in food debris. The whole place felt and smelled like it was covered with a layer of grease. The utensil containers were basically empty, however, there were a few forks but the bottom of the container was so disgusting and the fork tines were sitting in it so I opted for chopsticks. These containers obviously don't get washed.  On the way back from the bathroom I looked into the kitchen.  I've never seen a kitchen so bad. And the cooking area had so much grease on the floor, you could see footsteps as the cooks moved around. Not to mention all the food on the floor. The food was more disgusting than the restaurant. The orange beef was so over cooked that it was more like potato chips but yet it was cold. The rice was cold and had a peculiar smell, like it had been scorched. The extra veggies we added to one dish were raw and cold, like they were thrown on top at the last minute. I will never go back. A complete disaster!
