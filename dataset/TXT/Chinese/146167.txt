S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A Two separate visits, outrageously good fresh hand-pulled noodles and amazingly low prices.  

Aileen (from review dated 11/14/2010) these aren't gyoza.  Gyoza are Japanese.  These are Chinese 'pot-stickers'.  These are the remotely the same dough or preparation.  

These pot-stickers are very, very good.  Pan fried - for once they are not too crispy or dried out, like most valley restaurant prepare them.  The dipping sauce that accompanies them is good, but add a bit of red chile oil to your plate, a splash of black vinegar.  Now you've got the real Chinatown pot sticker good stuff.  

5 different kinds of noodles -ask the waiter which one goes best with your choices.  The beef with shaved noodles was terrific - beef just melted in your mouth.  How do they do that with beef?  We also ordered the curry with thin pulled noodles.  The shrimp were large, sweet and perfectly cooked.  The curry sauce was not all that great, and I wouldn't order it again - but I'd order another dish with those shrimp without hesitation.

Chicken fried rice, no usually one of my favorites, was a shining star in this place.  Again, the meat was tender, moist - and all white meat chicken.  

Beef soup with noodles.  Again, that superb tender beef.  Broth was deep flavored, with a distinct tinge of anise.  Just wonderful.  

Service is friendly, helpful and anxious to please.  Excellent service from Charles, and nice guy to chat with.
