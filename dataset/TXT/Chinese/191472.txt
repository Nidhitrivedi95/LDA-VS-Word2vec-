Unfortunately Flo's menu has had a drastic change. They removed a lot of the options. I was so disappointed to see that the Singapore chicken satay is no longer available. Not sure we'll be back due to the menu change. It's basically Pei Wei now. 

Oh wow!  I hope that tonight wasn't a fluke because our first dinner at Flo's was fantastic!

Be sure you take advantage of the happy hour specials, half off appetizers!  We thought about making our entire meal out of appetizers but decided to get one entree as well. 

We ordered Chinese lettuce cups, Singapore chicken satay, shu Mai dumplings and black pepper chicken. Everything was delicious!  The portion sizes were generous. My favorites were the Singapore chicken satay and the lettuce cups.  The ingredients were really fresh, the veggies crisp and beautiful...... Couldn't have asked for a better meal. 

Lately we've noticed that a lot of the Asian places we have been eating at have overly salty and sometimes goopy sauces. We were so happy to find a place that reminded us that Asian food shouldn't be so salty and sauce heavy. What a nice change!  

We definitely could have ordered a couple more appetizers and not ordered the main entree. We will probably go that route next time if we are there for happy hour. I will also order one of the huge bowls of soup that I immediately regretted not ordering when I saw it brought out to a nearby table.

Service was great, restaurant clean and nice environment. We will definitely be going back sooner rather than later. This place is awesome. I might have to go back for the soup this week!
