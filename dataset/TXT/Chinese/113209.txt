MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ **Summary**
       - Hong Kong Style Cafe - It seems like a Hong Kong Style Cafe you'd find in LA. Even down to the spaghetti or rice option for their meat dishes and their 
       - Cultural barrier - Half the staff speaks English. The service will be your typical Asian service where you'll have to flag down someone.
       - Price - You really can't beat their prices on their lunch specials. The pho prices are also on the low side. Overall, it seems like a good deal.
abundance of clay pot options.
**Ordered**
       - $6.95 Twice Cooked Sliced Pork - The pork, due to its twice pan-fried cooking style, really holds onto its flavor. A tad spicy with a little bit of black bean sauce flavor, I'd definitely get this dish again (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ?select=YD1w8NlraCYmIrObmDQmaQ).
       - $5.95 Stir-Fried Beef w/ Rice Noodle - Your typical Beef Chow Fun. On the lunch menu, it comes with your choice of black or green bubble tea. The noodles were a little bland for my taste, but the beef was good. Overall, it's really good for the price (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ?select=OxDW1MyPFlAf5KE1tyubOg) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ?select=7jvT-yl-oZdC8h1dKYAC6A).
       - $12.95 House Special Stir-Fried - A stir-fry with dried shrimp, dried sardines, squid, mushroom, some kind of bean curd cake thing, and pork. I really didn't like this dish. My girlfriend tells me I'm not Asian enough to enjoy it. It had all the wrong flavors and just not enough meat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ?select=Ici9lZ-F64J4wZQcVaM9NQ).
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place for a cheap meal. However, if you're not accustomed to Chinese food, some of your choices might be a hit or miss.
