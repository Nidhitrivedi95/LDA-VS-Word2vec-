GilIp96ZEsF4prlDPducog I was craving Chinese hot dogs buns, so I went and got some here.. and 
now I hate my life. But I love me some Chinese hot dog buns!

They have a good variety of Chinese pastries that are baked fresh every day. The coconut buns, red bean buns, and ham & cheese buns are among my favourite and they're reasonably priced.

Cash only.
