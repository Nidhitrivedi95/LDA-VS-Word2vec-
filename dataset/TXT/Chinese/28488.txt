8MXjK1lhVRhU3yGCUv9qsA I will start by saying that I have not sampled their Bao (buns).
A seasoned dim sum eater, I went straight for the shrimp dumplings and siumai (pork dumplings). Both were with what can only be described as lackluster. The siumai had no discernable shrimp on top, and the shrimp dumpling wrap was extremely thin. Their sauces tasted bottled.. cheap soy sauce, and no hot sauce or mustard sauces were available. Calling themselves mean Bao and not offering cha Siu Bao (sweet pork buns) seems strange.
Overall, they use cheap ingredients, and it tasted as such. Will return to try curry chicken Bao, but will manage my expectations accordingly. If you crave authentic dimsum or northern Chinese cuisine, this will not sate your hunger.
