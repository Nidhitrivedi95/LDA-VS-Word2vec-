MpT8KheTjs7TSDWIoMUFxg This place has probably one of the lowest delivery fee among all the restaurants that deliver to my place and one of the lowest minimum order, but the food is definitely very good for the price. So far I've ordered the moo goo chicken (if you like things on the light side), the Singapore noodle (if you like curry), the chow fun, and Kong Pao chicken. For chow fun, I hate it when all the rice noodles are clumped together and when you eat it, one side has seasoning and the other side is just plain white. The rice noodles in chow fun does not do that here. This is when I can tell the chef is skilled. Kong Pao chicken is just what I expected also. I'll definitely be coming back if I'm craving some Chinese take outs!

P.S. I'm not sure about the non-typical Chinese dishes that's on the menu and I don't think I will ever try it. If you want pad Thai, go to a Thai restaurant, if you want sushi or raw fish, go to a Japanese restaurant. Why would you want to eat non-Chinese dishes at a Chinese restaurant is out of my concern, but I can guarantee that you will be disappointed. Don't let the menu fool you. Hope this helps :)
