NyGlEmuYcpZSKfk6IwJeSw So.... went into tavernakaya know as TK from the madisonians on a Sunday because my homie said he had a lit Friday night there with a fly ass house Dj and it was a big dance party. I went in and went right to the bar to get a mimosa because I love cherub but I tell you what the mimosas selection was mind blowing I can't even pronounce the options. The bartender that was this spicy 100 pound smoke show that her voice reminded me of Fran Drescher which made my knees weak because I love the nanny. She recommended the biscuits n gravy and it was amazing! After trying 5 mimosas I worked up a appetite and got the bacon fried rice it was what wet dreams are made of I also got one of their specialty drinks I can't remember what it was I think it was called some Japanese name like anime. The little honey dip of a bartender kept calling me babe so I stayed because I felt she was feeling me  but two dudes sat at the bar one with Jesus wild hair and the other looking like he didn't sleep the night before and she called them babe as well so womp womp. I'm giving this place 5 stars because it has a very nice ambiance, bomb food, boss playas and hot modern goth waitresses  everywhere.
