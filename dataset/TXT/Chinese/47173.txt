BzgeGVOPetKDcgv9FCbpkw Came at 9:04pm (again) ... Only one person was working the counter (again) ... Everyone else was blatantly ignoring the line & doing closing duties (again) .... The bum ass shift manager came up (again) .... Went on & on about how they have a right to ignore guests & close .... (again) .... They gave me a hard time about cooking fresh food, even though there was ZERO chowmein, ZERO orange chicken, ZERO sweet fire.... (Again).... So I should pay 25.00 for food I don't want??? .... Oh, and the iced tea was all gone (again)

Maybe this location should consider a 9pm closing time because after 9pm, NO ONE HERE is interested in customer service. Horrible.
