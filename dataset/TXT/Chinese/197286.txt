ZQqiZAC4H4SI82W3RmaTKA Searching for for Chinese take-out, I decided to try China Lite.  We enjoyed the food.  It's set up like a sandwich shop (vs. a typical Chinese restaurant), so dining in is possible, but it will not be elegant in any way.  The food tasted fresh, was not greasy and the several dishes we sampled had different tastes and sauces.  That's a terrific starting point for Chinese restaurant goodness, and China Lite passed our test.  We're going to try some of the other places in the vicinity, but will likely return to China Lite.
