xmeEyBVC5zN-FCX5qZviIQ CHOPSTIX EPRESS "NEW YORK STYLE", hmmm...

So this is what "New York Style" chinese food taste like.  Umm no, not impressed at all, i would say this is the equivalent to CHINA STAR BUFFET.  If this is what New Yorker's are calling chinese food i feel sorry for them.  They are really missing out on some good eats, so sad.

Ok, .so i ordered GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN w/ fried rice and eggroll...never again

- GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN: the chicken in this dish should be so tender that you can cut it w/ a plastic fork. u need a STEAK KNIFE, super tough and chewy. Total buffet style chicken (a CHEAP buffet)  And where was my spice, usually i get a red pepper or two in the dish...nothing. i should of asked for the sarrachi to spice up the meal.  (is that the correct spelling? sar-ra-chi...you know what i'm talking about)

- FRIED RICE: nothing special, bland, flavorless, loaded w/ chunks of brown onion

- EGGROLL: "Costco's Quality" frozen eggrolls deep fried to order/

QUANTITY: you get what you pay for, huge portion

QUALITY: WAY overpriced for buffet style chinese food (cheap buffet)...oops i meant NEW YORK style chinese food.

Back in the late 90's in San Diego all the express chinese food places started popping up all over the city.  no restaurant name, all it said on the store front was $0.99 Chinese Food....i've had better quality food at the $0.99 chinese restaurant than this place.

i can't go back, wasted a cheat day on this...that morning run is going to hurt
