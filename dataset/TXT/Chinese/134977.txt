qAbXHsddBhmfQFegGiV7Dg We tried this place for the first time last night for take out. We ordered the lemon chicken and the orange chicken with egg rolls and crab puffs and a bowl of noodles that are like lo mein.  The lemon chicken is two deep fried breaded chicken breasts with a thick lemon sauce poured over it, like an orange chicken sauce, but lemon. It was over a bed of white rice. It's pretty sweet tasting, no spice to it. The orange chicken was really good too. The egg rolls were really greasy. But I liked it that way. They were still fresh tasting even though it was pick up. The young lady working the front counter is very nice and gave us a punch card. For every $7 you spend, you get a punch. After 15 punches, you get a free $7 meal. I spend $40. We will order from here again most definitely.
