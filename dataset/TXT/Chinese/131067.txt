pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA The meal was absolutely fabulous!  Our waitress Vanessa G knew the menu well and was able to help us order the unfamiliar cuisine.  Really, one of the best meals we have had in years...
We ordered yellowtail taquitos, Wagu Gyoza, Ishiyaki (5) and Anti sea bass... I would highly recommend! Might have to spend a little more but it's definitely worth it!
I also liked that the manager Allen came and talked to us and was interested in how the patrons felt.
