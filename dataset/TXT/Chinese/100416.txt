Jzz-ZLXsd2ClSn6UyFcbpw I love it! The diviest piece of crap hole in the wall, but they make the best food! The sweet and sour pork is actually chopped pork, with a heavy breading and cooked just right. So much better than the standard deep fried pork balls at other places. The egg rolls aren't actually wrapped, but they dip them batter and fry them without any wrapping. The soups are great, and the family dinners which come with soup, egg roll, and entree are a great value. The servers are pretty old chinese women that will not bend for anything... at all. We orderd a meal for two, and then asked to order a third one and she refused, saying they already started cooking it, and we would have to order another meal for two... odd. Also odd, is they have a birdcage with a fake cardinal in the center of the dining room. This is so far the best chinese I have found in Phoenix, a city that should be known for having no good chinese restaurants.
