HVpwpXneaCWMeEBF7H8jpQ Is it possible to get quantity and quality? If we're talking about the fried chicken at Taiwan Little Eats, then my answer is definitely yes!! Just look at the size of this thing! Before we got our order (which was out fairly quickly), I told my friend about the fried chicken at a night market I attended in Taiwan that boasted "chicken larger than your face". Well, I was pleased to discover that this chicken measured up. The seasoning was good and very authentic, but I did find it to be a little dry and would have loved the option of a wet seasoning or a dipping sauce on the side. I also ordered the Tainan Braised Pork. The flavor was delicious, but it was also a little dry and maybe over cooked. The pork cutlet, however was very juicy and lightly coated in a mild, sweet and tangy sauce. I would have loved to have the option of this coating on my fried chicken. As for the tea eggs I tried, what can I say? I love me a good Taiwanese convenience store staple. You can't go wrong here, and these eggs were done very right! I will definitely be coming back!
