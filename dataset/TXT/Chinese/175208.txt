WghhtS-tqDWMh_W2O13CYA YICK! WELCOME TO NASTYVILLE, South Euclid.  EXTREMELY hard rice.  When I brought my bowl back up to the counter a line worker lightweight yelled at me and loudly informed me that "IT'S STEAMED RICE! THAT'S HOW IT IS!" Ummmmm...nope, been eating STEAMED RICE since BEFORE I had TEETH! This tasted like y'all just poured this "steamed rice" straight out of the bag Ms. Attitude! OYE!! In comes the manager...much more pleasant!...but SUPER OVERWHELMED, He changed my order from rice to noodles...NOODLES WERE HARDER THAN THE RICE! UGGGGH! Never fear! Never coming back HERE again! C'MON Panda Express, get it together!   #BOOOOO
