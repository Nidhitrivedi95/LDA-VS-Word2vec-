EhGPj8iJDIdaHnWg9d5BgA Okay so my friends are in love with this place because of the hockey pucks - they are seriously soooo good and perfectly pan-fried! All their dim sum is high quality and delicious. The only downfall is the price - yikes. I get that this is a nice area with beautiful views but since I am used to cheap dim sum in Markham this is a burn to my wallet. Still - I will give them 4 stars for the food and service - they're really quick with refills and are friendly compared to usual dim sum restaurants. Definitely don't expect it to be cheap though.
