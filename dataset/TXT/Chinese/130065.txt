pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I celebrated my 25th birthday at Sushi Samba and it was incredible. We were able to catch happy hour at the bar before we were seated did the Omakase. I would recommend doing so, the happy hour drinks were tasty and just $6! The Omakase was incredible, we did a $60 tasting and received everything from nigiri, cod (my favorite), poke tacos, Peruvian corn, scallops, and a birthday treat. Great environment, staff, and amazing food. You won't be disappointed!
