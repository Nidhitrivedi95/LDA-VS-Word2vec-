PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ I love this place. I went here for lunch and it was only $15.99 that includes dessert. My server was extra nice and attentive so I gave her an extra tip while she was serving me. It was delicious and they had different choices of hot pot ingredients. I definitely will come back and recommend this place.
