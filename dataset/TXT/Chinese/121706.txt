oAngC9V69vyzBVYwKEJQaw We have ordered from here a few times now.  The food has been consistently good and the delivery service very fast.  The sweet & sour pork was really tasty.  My spouse loved the Pad Thai Spicy Noodle.  They paid attention to the notes I added to my order and were happy to change the Pad Thai to be vegetarian, no problem.  Always a great experience with China Tango, our new go-to Chinese food restaurant!
