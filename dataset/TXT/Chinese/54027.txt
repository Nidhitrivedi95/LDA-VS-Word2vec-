cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Honestly, the best damn Chinese buffet I have ever been to. Bar none. Also, live show!

The food selection was large, the service was crazy good. Plates disappeared quickly, new napkins dropped off, and water always refilled quickly.

The five stars are relative and in comparison to Chinese buffets. It is obviously not a high end culinary restaurant, its a Chinese buffet with all the usual buffet caveats. The important thing is, it is the best Chinese buffet I have ever eat at. 

I don't understand people that review buffets as if they are a la carte restaurants. Haters will be haters I guess.
