g-Q3rLkyGT-TtiRgE-PvgA We were in the area and I was skeptical of stopping here because of the low stars. I was in the mood for a dine in chinese lunch so deciced to give it a try. The interior was a lot different than the dated photos on file so now I wish I would have taken a picture of that. The lighting was low and inviting; and the ceiling fans are different, too. The ambiance was quite laid back and divey.
Lunch specials start with a soup: egg drop or hot & sour; it was quite a lovely little soup served with a side of wontons and some sauce. But I really fell in love with my green bean lunch special, I chose to add soft noodles for $2 (they were seasoned and thick like udon noodles). You would think that cooking green beans isn't rocket science but you cannot imgine how many places I've gone to that have hard, barely cooked beans and others have have them cooked so long they barely hold onto the fork before the become smooshy and barely edible.
It was a very lovely and cozy experience and if in this area again, I will surely stop by without a second thought!
