-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ hubby and i were losing money at red rock so decided to grab a bite.  
it was past midnight and our options were few; cafe or noodle place.
noodle place it is!

this is what we ordered:

one each of the bao buns; crispy duck, pork belly, and short rib.
my favorite was the duck.  i really enjoyed the plum sauce, the duck was crispy yet tender, and the scallions were really fresh and flavorful.
the other 2 were also very tasty and paired well with their accoutrements.
i enjoyed the bao itself too as it was very fluffy, not at all dry.

agedashi tofu
flavored well but the breading was way too thick to be called agedashi.
it should just be called fried tofu.
still good though.

spring rolls
pretty standard here.
i like that they're made to order and not just sitting in a cooler so that's a plus.

special pork fried rice
this was yummy cuz it was dirty.
what i mean by dirty is that it was flavored with all the yummies from the wok.
that is my kind of fried rice!

all in all, it was a good meal and the service was good as well.
yes, it was a little pricey but it's in a casino so that should come as no surprise.
i would definitely eat here again.
they close at 2am so when it's late and you're deciding between the cafe and this place, i'd choose this place every time.
