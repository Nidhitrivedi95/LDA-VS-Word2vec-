7SemopLjhDc3IQkI-JUYdQ Ordered take-out from here to be delivered to my hotel while I was in Phoenix. It came to my room in a timely manner and didn't have problem with delivery. There was more than enough food as I thought the soup was expensive but it was because it was a whole pint. Even though the hot and sour soup tasted good there was way too much liquid for the amount of vegetables and tofu in that pint container.

When I got to my main dish it lacked a lot of flavor and unfortunately I only pretty much ate the chicken out of it to fill me up. The 3 chicken egg rolls were decent but they were fried a little too long and the dough was pretty crunchy and tasted like used oil.

For the most part I ended up dumping the majority of the meal down the garbage disposal in my hotel room as it just really didn't taste that great. 

As I said there was a lot of food and I was full when I stopped forcing myself to eat some of this $30 meal but overall I was unimpressed and wont get an order from here again when I come back to Phoenix.
