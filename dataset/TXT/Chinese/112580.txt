MhnihE0alud0ereVInSt8Q My partner and I have came here a few times for food as it's the closest to where we live. The first time we came the young lady behind the register was rather unpleasant, however I understand that that day may not have been her best.

Do not come here. Today, to put it best, they'll ignore certain patrons, however they'll be quick to respond to others. We've waited at their register for a few minutes without being acknowledged by the three people near us. It almost seemed like we were inconveniencing them, yet another young lady comes in and they greet her immediately. I don't want to say it's based on any prejudice, but that they're food is not that great and their service is deplorable. Don't even think about ordering take out. Their delivery driver will condemn you if the tips isn't enough for his liking.
