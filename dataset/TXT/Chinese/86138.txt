HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA This was definitely an interesting experience. I had read a lot about this joint from LV Weekly and Seven so I decided to jive it a try with an Asian friend. 

I was surprised at just how American the menu was with really small Asian "twists" added. They also have a few daily specials on the menu, one of which was a duck French toast which is what my friend had. 

I had the spare rib grilled cheese. There was nothing amazing about the sandwich, but for $8 or so it was a good value. I did have a hard time picking from other items on the menu, always a good sign. 

The big WOW for me was the service, our server who was the only front of house employee on this Sunday was really friendly and knowledgable. She really plugged the restaurant well and offered to give my guest a to-go cup of her beverage. I was really blown away at how friendly she was, she most likely could provide this same service in a fine dining restaurant!

Ill be back for the service, cheap food on the menu and close location to the strip and downtown.
