The place is small but efficient, and the tea is strangely fragrant. It's always a toss-up between the  pan-fried buns but the fennel buns for me. The dumplings are well made, even the regular ones have plenty of juice packed inside each one. 

The menu has English on it, so it's easy to navigate the choices. All the pictures on yelp and the steaming hot dishes arriving at neighboring tables will help with your choices also. A solid lunch place if you can get a seat.
