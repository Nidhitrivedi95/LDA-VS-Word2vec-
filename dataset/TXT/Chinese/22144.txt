6H78unzSy1z4AafKHIsmTQ I love this place. Fast, excellent food, great counter staff. As good as any regular Chinese place. Zack (I think that's his name) who works the front counter is friendly and helpful. Wish they had a tip-jar for him, as he's pretty hard working. Whenever I'm in the area (maybe 1-2 times a month) in late afternoon I always stop by and get the Family Feast to take home for dinner. Wife and kids love it.
