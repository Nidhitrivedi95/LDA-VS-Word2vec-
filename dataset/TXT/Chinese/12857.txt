2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg Always fantastic food with great prices. I went every weekend for a month in the summer. The owners are always friendly. If you are going later in the evening or late, don't order the tea (milk tea) or coffee. They boil it all day and by then its completely gross. But other wise, I've never had a bad experience here.
