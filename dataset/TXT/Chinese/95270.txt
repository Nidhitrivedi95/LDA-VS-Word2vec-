JhEtJbGjAqKDHCZ11i3qoQ You all know what to expect from Mongolian right?  I mean there are a million reviews below me carefully articulating how you can load up your bowls like it's the Cove of Corruption for shameless gluttoners or gluttonees ...so why this review?

Well...while every other Mongolian grill out there is looking to compete via different sauces, meat over ice instead of frozen, or who's grill stick is longer, YC's decided to take it old school with some good ol' customer service.

This isn't just a customer service experience, these people have it down.  They offer what they can instead of wasting time explaining what they can't, they make an effort to say hello and goodbye, and the best part? It's not overbearing either. Let's just say even if you hypothetically brought someone from the complain capital of the world (Boston) the complaint box would be empty.  /rant

YC ftw!

Btw, isn't Mongolia a starving nation whose citizens can't  even afford the luxury of a grill, much less a tower of meat and uncooked noodles? Irony...at least we know it tastes sweet.
