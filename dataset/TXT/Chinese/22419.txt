Hot and sour soup is my favorite soup and I have a forgiving tongue for the varieties that chinese restaurants offer, but this was the worst. Downright horrendous. Just tasted like a TON of vinegar without any quality or flavor. I forced five spoonfuls and then could not continue... the fried rice was also the worst I have had. You really can't afford to have bad rice as a Chinese restaurant, but without a doubt, this was the worst. I want to say some nice things, but all I can really say is avoid at all costs. :(
