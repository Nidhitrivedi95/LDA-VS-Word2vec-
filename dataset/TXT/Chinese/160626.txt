ubC3XvGLxDi3QHlW2J1Q7w I purchased a Groupon for this a few months ago. Did not read reviews prior, which was a BIG mistake. I became frustrated the most when I kept calling for a couple of days  with no response. I finally received a phone call and scheduled an appointment for the following Sunday. The next Sunday comes and I am there. Well guess what? No one was there to do my massage I called and luckily Jessica answered and said she was sorry and didn't know what happened. Any way, I had to schedule another appointment because I could not let this Groupon go to waste. And may I let you know I drove from Rock Hill! Anyway I scheduled it for the following Sunday. I tried called the Friday before to Confirm my appointment with not much success. Finally after several attempts I did finally get someone. She told me yes, I asked who would be doing the Reflexology massage and she said Steve. My appointment time finally arrives! A lady pulls up and motions for me. I follow her in, she apologized saying Steve could not come so she would be doing it. Her name was Jessica. I was so relieved! I was hesitant about a man and me being alone . Jessica did a wonderful job! So even after all the scheduling aggravation I'm glad I stuck in there.
