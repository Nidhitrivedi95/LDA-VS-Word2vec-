bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg I've been 4 times and the highlights food-wise have been the pork belly bites, the short rib biscuit, the kim chi, the eggplant (outstanding!!), and the hanger steak.  I was not as blown away by the ramen.  Since my vegetarian diet adoption, I tried some truly kick-butt General Tso's cauliflower.  At the risk of being a broken record, they could use more vegetarian and vegan options, especially for brunch.

The atmosphere is great. The curved wooden, flowing bar and backdrop are lovely and soothing.
