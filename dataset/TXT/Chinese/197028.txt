ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg Dined here last week with wife and 2 friends. We all thought the food and service and ambiance was excellent. While the price was a bit steep, we found each food item very tasty and memorable. I asked for a spicy prawn dish which they did not have on the menu. The server graciously said the kitchen would make one for me and it was wonderful. Others ordered mostly seafood and the food was excellent. The service staff was always there to assist us and make suggestions to help us have a good time. I recommend this wonderful restaurant in Bellagio for the food, service , and great view of the dancing waters.
