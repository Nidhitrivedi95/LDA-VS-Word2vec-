The driver couldn't find our apartment, so we had to go down to the office and wait on him. When we opened up the food, it was cold, and didn't contain the correct order. It was also missing the vegetable chow mein we'd ordered. We called back, and explained that we'd gotten the wrong order, and were missing items, and they tried saying that the orange chicken we'd received was, in fact, the kung pao pork that we had ordered. Not true. They're two completely different dishes. They did offer to bring the chow mein, which arrived about 40 minutes after we'd finished eating what was probably someone else's order.
