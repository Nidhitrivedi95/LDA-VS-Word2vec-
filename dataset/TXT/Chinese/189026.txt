yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA This morning I took my son who is 3 years old to have breakfast so we order the pork chop dish, fresh spring rolls and Thai tea.  The food came it was pretty fast.  We finish spring rolls. I cut up the pork chop and begin to feed my son we probably take about four bites and my son want to go m use the restroom. When we came from the bathroom (it's takes no more than five minutes) i'll table was cleaned up. I was so hungry and my son I'm pretty sure he was hungrier. I'm just curious if the waiter or the waitress are so anxious to clean the table... shouldn't they look because the receipt is on the table and The food was barely touch but it was chopped up due to my son he could not to a bigger piece of the pork chops on top of that the water cup was and Thai tea was still full. That should ring the bell. One of the server team and apologize and hand me the receipt so me being a good citizen walked to the register and proceed paying for our breakfast. I could have told them that I want a table in my foods back but the fear of them preparing my food and spitting in it (not saying that they would do that). This matter was very very poor handle. For the record my family has been going to "Pho Kim Long"restaurant for 20 years normally we dine there 3 times a month. You will no longer earn our business!!
