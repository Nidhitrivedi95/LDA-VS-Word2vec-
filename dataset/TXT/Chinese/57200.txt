D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw My favorite Thai place to go to during lunch.  The Nasi Goreng fried rice is amazing!  I've never had a bad dish here.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the wait during lunch can be long sometimes.  If you are going during your lunch break at work, expect to be there from 1 hour to 2 hours if they are really busy.
