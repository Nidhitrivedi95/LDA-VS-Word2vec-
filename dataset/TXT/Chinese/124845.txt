ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ The main attraction here is definitely the decor. From the ruffles cascading down the waitresses' uniforms to the rococo-esque grand ballroom that is the actual restaurant (waterfall paintings, corinthian columns, faux victorian teapots, louis XV chandeliers, you name it), nothing here is underdone. The great news is that this place is more than just a gimmick as the food really is very tasty. They carry certain dim sum that I'm fairly sure you wouldn't necessarily find anywhere else, such as the foie gras & caviar siu mai. They also have the more standard dim sum items, which are all clearly done with a lot of care. It is worth mentioning that the price is a tad higher than other dim sum places and you can easily expect to wait 30 minutes on the weekend.
