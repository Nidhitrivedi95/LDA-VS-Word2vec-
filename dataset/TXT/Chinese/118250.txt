nl_gkvVXtsIlhGE0sP0qFw I went here today for dinner, and I was quite disappointed. The shrimp and sashimi both left much to be desired. I'm used to eating seafood, and these were just strange. I've never tasted shrimp that were so flavorless. They were soaking in ice, which was rather odd. You literally had to fish out ice cubes to get the shrimp. I do not think it is worth the 13.99 dinner price. The service was great though. My waiter was very attentive and helpful. 

I went here before for lunch and it seemed like a much better deal. I just cant justify paying $5 extra for dinner for seafood that seems highly lacking.
