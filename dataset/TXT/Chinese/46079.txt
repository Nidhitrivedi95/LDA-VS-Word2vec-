BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA Who you callin' a mutha? Oh - sorry.  I was born in Brooklyn.  

The dumplings here are fresh and plentiful...but I just didn't find them as rave-worthy as other reviewers have.  They're tasty, reasonably authentic and whenever anyone asks to catch up here I don't automatically steer them to another place.  They are not the dumplings of legend.  Not the dumplings that make you order a few dozen to go after you've snarfed the third one.  Not the dumplings you crave in the soup you wish you'd made the night before on a caustically cold Toronto night.  Sorry fans - These are not THOSE dumplings.

The boiled dumplings have an overly water sloshy quality to them - in my opinion in excess of the generally accepted parameters established by the IDDI (International Dumpling and Dim Sum Institute).  

The veggie dumplings are really good, but every time I've been there they only have one type available.  

The steamed pork and chive are very nice - the juicy pork bun was excellent.

There are some decent picks on the menu; I've found flashes of flair in some of the other food items.  The sweet apple salad is tasty - my dining companions have loved it - although i felt it could benefit from a bit of heat (easily fixed table side) and that it got a bit cloying at the halfway mark.  I liked the green onion pancake, but others were put off by the fact that it was a bit crunchier than they were used to.  Everyone agreed that they hit a winner with the cold tofu noodle salad - just the right notes of sesame oil and the perfect sense of chewiness - actually, we ALL took one of those to go...

Worth a shot? Yes.  Worth your undying loyalty? Not at this time.
