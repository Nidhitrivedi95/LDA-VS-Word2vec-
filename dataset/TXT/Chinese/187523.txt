yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA My favorite Pho spot in Vegas. It's always worth the 20 min drive across town. The serve is fast and efficient, clean dining room and the Pho is BOMB DOT COM. I love bringing my peeps from Cali here too when they visit. They also love it. The other dishes are great as well but any Pho bowl is great! Yum!
