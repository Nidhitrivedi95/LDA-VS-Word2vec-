EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw 20 years in Hong Kong and dim sum was a way of life.  This rivals the best dim sum my husband and I have eaten in Hong Kong and at this one place in San Fran. We were in town for 6 days.  3 visits were warranted.  This is order dim sum so everything is piping hot.  The holy trinity of har gaw, shui mai, and cha siu bao more than passed the test.  The cha siu so (baked  bbq pork pastry), the stuffed eggplant, and the pan seared chive dumpling had to be repeated at each visit.  We managed to crow bar Singapore  Noodles in, too.  Like being home.   Friendly staff (we ordered a type of tea not on the menu and they didn't blink). Clean place.  You can spend hours there sipping tea and ordering as the fancy strikes.  Our son lives in Vegas.  We now have 2 reasons to make the trip.
