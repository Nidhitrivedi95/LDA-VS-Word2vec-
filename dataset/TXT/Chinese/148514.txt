SktLID5_ywSlgVE-h3NB3Q Ordered "New York style chow mein" 
Have they been to New York ?! 
The description of the dish says it is on top of crispy noodles. 
What I got. 
Cheep veggies in a white sauce. No flavor at all! 
A bag of fried won ton strips. (They call that noodles) 

Worst Chinese food I've ever had.
