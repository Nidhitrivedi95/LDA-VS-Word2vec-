t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA Best authentic Chinese food in the area hands down.  From the top of my head, I've had the fried tofu, sliced beef juk/congee, pork xiao long bao, crispy basil chicken, and lamb stir fry. Most of the dishes I've had were pretty good with a pleasant flavor.  Golden Harbor is the only place around Chambana that I know that has congee, which is something I crave for when I'm too lazy to make it for myself haha.  

One tip: besides getting the food and plates, everything is self serve in terms of ordering, drinks, getting utensils, etc.  

My only complaints would be that ordering at first is a bit overwhelming and that the pork xiao long bao wasn't well developed in flavor.  Besides that, however, Golden Harbor is definitely a favorite of mine.
