qJ18IGaDsQtzJ6v2UzkdcQ Tried this place on a referral from a family member and it was absolutely disgusting. We ordered the sweet and sour chicken combo and Crab Rangoon. The egg flower soup was sweet,  lukewarm and nasty. The chicken was rubbery and soggy because it had obviously been sitting in sauce for a long time. It tasted like a bad frozen dinner and was also lukewarm. The fried rice had no flavor and we only found a few chunks of what looked like really dried out pork and a few onions in it, also lukewarm. The Crab Rangoon were the smallest I have ever seen and tasted like cream cheese wontons. No crab tasted or seen and also cold. They came with a side of cold sweet and sour sauce (about 2 tablespoons) for 6. Our normal restaurant sends approximately half a cup of sweet and sour sauce with the Rangoons and never puts the sweet and sour sauce on the chicken when it is to go. The sauce comes separately in a soup container. We also get twice the amount of food, it's hot and fresh and tastes exactly like it should. We will never eat at this restaurant again, nor will we recommend it to anyone. EVER.
