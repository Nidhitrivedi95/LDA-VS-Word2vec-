VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng Came here for lunch with my boyfriend today. It was around 10 each, not bad pricing at all compared to other buffets I've been to. A decent selection of food and sushi. I took a star off because food could have been warmer and there was no crab legs. I added a star back because there was the station where they had raw meat/vegetables and they cook it right there for you. Drinks stay filled which I'm happy with because that place was packed. Decent place and will be back in the future.
