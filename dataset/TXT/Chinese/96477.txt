jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow Beyond disgusting. Food was cold. And old. If you like eating bad leftovers that have been reheated time and time again, you will love this place. Restaurant was filthy. And while we were there the manager actually turned away a party of 5 because they wanted to sit at an 8 top. The restaurant was 3/4 empty and this was Friday night at 6:30. Save yourself and never come here. Can I give it less than 1 star?
