S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A It's good to finally see a food place making hand pulled noodles. That is definitely one of the more artistic things around in cooking, using their hands to make different noodle thickness in less than 20secs.

This place is not that big, but decent size enough for a casual restaurant. I like their variety of soup noodles, stir fry and appetizers. For appetizers, they have my favorite marinated beef tendons. That's a nice dish, as it has some spice to it and nice and chewy. They also have some classic HK dishes like the mantou gok.

As for the soup noodle, their bowl size is not the biggest, but the flavoring was pretty good. I liked the ox-tail soup with the hand pulled noodle.

Overall nice change to the chinese food scenery in Phoenix. Glad to see we are getting more LA style variety and not the cookie cutter dim sum places and chop suey.
