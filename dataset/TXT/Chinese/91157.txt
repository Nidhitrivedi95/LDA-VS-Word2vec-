Located INSIDE Mandalay Bay. 
Service was good, but food was not. 

Booo..we were hungry, desperate, and thought this place would be a good idea. It definitely was NOT a good idea. Why?
1) Super salty
2) Expensive
3) Peking duck was HORRIBLE

Ordered:
1) Peking duck: 1/5 HIGHLY DO NOT recommend this dish. This was the worst dish on the table. It tasted like peking duck you would pick up at a fast food joint. 
2) Spicy garlic beef: 1/5 way, way salty
3) Beef Chow fun: 3/5 this was the only dish on the table that was edible.
