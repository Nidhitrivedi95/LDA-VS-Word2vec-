IIVGlLVf1oggMOOtbblrYQ Wicked hot and sour soup and general tao chicken. Nobody cares about the ambiance and atmosphere of places like this. Don't waste my time, reviews of places like this are strictly about the food. Of course this place is a dive, it's down right dirty but who cares! The food is great and they've been serving it up for 30 years.
