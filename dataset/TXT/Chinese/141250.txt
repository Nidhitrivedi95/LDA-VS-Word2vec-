re-KZo5dPJPZdK-Abqoifg Yummy, standard North American Thai food (i.e. your favorites will likely be there) in a nice ambiance with good service. I will eat here again, though I may do take-out instead of dining in.

The details: We came in on a Saturday night for a simple, low-key meal. The place was nearly empty. We were seated immediately, and our server asked us if we had brought wine. Resto is  BYOB, which I hadn't known (my fault for not doing my due diligence), which is a major plus in my book, so I will remember that for next time. We didn't want drinks so we just ordered water, which tasted plasticky, like it had been in a plastic pitcher for a while...This detail is important for later. Our food came out ridiculously quickly--under 10 minutes for 4 main dishes. But considering what we ordered (pad thai=most popular dish; curry=prepared sauce; fried rice= quick), the speed wasn't alarming. Everything was cooked properly and was fresh. We didn't order dessert or coffee. Total bill was reasonable for the dishes. 

Attention: Take the chili pepper symbols (spiciness) on the menu seriously! If you do not like spicy food, be sure to ask what 1/2/3/4 peppers means; otherwise you may find yourself with your mouth on fire, in need of lots water to cool your mouth...and plasticky-tasting water is not ideal for that.
