QS7_BPmaBNvznOMhcVBemg Came here for lunch because Babygirl , like all millennials, has an inexplicable liking for sushi. As a far more sensible baby boomer, I do not. (I believe we may have inherited a suspicion of Japanese cuisine from our fathers who served in the Pacific in WWII and considered it all "fish heads", but that is neither here nor there). 

We came once before when it first opened , meaning when they "remodeled" the old Benihana lounge by throwing in some tables and hanging red lanterns from the ceiling. The space definitely has an awkward feel, but not enough to ruin your meal. The fact that the menu used to have two sides so you could order Chinese or sushi from the place 10 feet down the little stairs but now you can't anymore definitely threw a wrench in things. Since Babygirl was willing to cave and I was not, we stayed.

We had a friend with us, so we ordered a few things to share. None were memorable, all were overcooked and mushy, and portion sizes were approximately half of what most neighborhood Chinese places give you. I understand that in a hotel, most customers are not going to keep leftovers anyway, but it rubs salt in the wound that they made in your wallet by charging two or three times the average price.

I wouldn't bother returning. Almost made raw fish wrapped in seaweed sound like a good idea. Almost.
