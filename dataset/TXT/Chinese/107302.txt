l9B72QwKjUhEA-pLumCa5w I tried this place because it is close to the office. The food was good and fresh. Not too geasy either. I had sweet and sour pork with fried rice and of course the egg roll. It didn't take long to get my carryout and the staff was very friendly. It is reasonably priced. I will definitely go back. Thanks golden eggroll!
