v9RUMrIlWzjs08qQITnS9Q We have gone twice to this restaurant but will not be going back.  While I am accustomed to eating mediocre Chinese food in this town, the main entrees were quite poor. 

I am not sure how you screw up chicken fried rice but they did- the rice did not taste fried and the chicken was barely cooked.   The first time we had it, we figured they just made a mistake.  But when we ordered it again on the second visit, we realized they just don't know how to cook

If this place survives for another 6 months, I will be shocked.
