9ad0-8h-DRUheY9dF9rYjQ We couldn't even get seated! 

Came here in a group of 3 and waited over half-an-hour for a table, but the staff continued to seat other groups who arrived after us. We complained to one of the staff members who attempted to speak to a group who was mistakenly seated before us, but of course they did not want to get up after having already been seated. We left before we could waste any more time here.

Very disorganized - they should have had some kind of system to assign numbers to those waiting in line, to keep track of the customers' order of arrival.
