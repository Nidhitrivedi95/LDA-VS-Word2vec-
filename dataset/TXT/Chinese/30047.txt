966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA I love this place! The prices are amazing and they always take such good care of me. I'm not very picky but I always seem to bring friends that are. They always accommodate by preparing all of our dishes per request. The restaurant is always very clean and I love that they bring hot tea to your table as soon as you sit down. The staff is very educated on the menu and they always give great recommendations. I will be back and I will recommend to all of my friends.
