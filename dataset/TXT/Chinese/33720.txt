A6lKCuTrDSJ_eFKyumZCJQ Was super excited to eat here as I was craving some pad thai... After waiting for over 10 minutes to place my order (when there was less than 5 ppl ahead of me), I finally ordered at 12:58pm... Waited along with at least five other people who placed their orders either right before or after me to get my food. After witnessing tables not getting the things they asked for, and not one to-go order being processed in about 20 minutes, I decided to give them a few more minutes and allow 30 minutes before I cancelled my order. At 1:35 I asked for my order to be cancelled and refunded. I will say, some of the food orders looked pretty decent that were being delivered to the tables, over 30 minutes for a to-go order of some noodles is excessive. No apology from the staff for having multiple guests waiting that long for what should have been an easy order.
