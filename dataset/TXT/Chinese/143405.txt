rntKF4Dm9JIJoSNi5XqRsQ My new go-to place when I'm craving dumplings! Love the beef wrap and steamed dumplings. The shanghai noodles are good too and everything is extremely reasonably priced. One order of beef wraps, 12 steamed dumplings and shanghai noodles is enough for two people and under $20! This is not the greatest place for soup dumplings though, there are better places.
