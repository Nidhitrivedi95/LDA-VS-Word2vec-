4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA Been a customer of this restaurant for the 8 years I have been in Arizona.  They have consistently provided me with very stellar customer service and excellent food.  One of the dishes I prefer eating is the steamed chicken and broccoli (no sauce) and find it quite tasty to the point that it is my "norm".  

I also like ordering the Pu Pu Platter, combination fried rice, and egg drop soup.
