FIs33y1BVzzcfrDDHh8O5g My mom was in town and we wanted Thai food.. This was by my house and the theater so we decided to give it a try. We got their pad Thai lunch specials, and neither of us even ate half of it. I thought it was "ok" my mom thought it was pretty bad. I wouldn't come back for Thai food. The pad Thai didn't have that distinct flavor, it lacked flavor. There weren't even peanuts in it, which isn't a huge deal but I was just surprised.
