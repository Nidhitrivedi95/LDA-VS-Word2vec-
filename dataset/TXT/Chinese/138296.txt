qO6CWdRFfbOqDJ2UOulpaA I've had great meals here and so so meals too. it depends on the day of the week I guess. We get the hunan chicken-its not on the menu but its always good. their lo-mein is always good and the portions are huge. We always split their dinner specials. its reasonably priced, close by and quick. There are definitely better Chinese restaurants in the valley, but it is surprise and not exactly the height of food in the valley
