pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA We come here every time we are in Vegas. Amazing food and good service.  A couple of my favorites off the menu are the yellowtail ceviche and the mushroom red miso soup.

We've come both for lunch and for dinner.  The vibe at dinner time is like a club...maybe people come here before they hit the clubs or something.  It's dark and the music is crazy loud.  But my 80 year old grandma still enjoys it even with the loud music so it's not too big of a deal.  

If you're ever in Vegas I definitely recommend coming here.  Everything is good.
