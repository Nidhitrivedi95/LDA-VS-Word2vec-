qaJ-HewyVAQCQ8C_KveZ4g I lived in the University area during my 2 years in grad school and this was my go-to for quick, easy, delicious Chinese food. I always ordered the Sweet & Sour or General Tso's chicken and occasionally would treat myself to some Crab Rangoon. Always tasted great and was ready in 5-7 minutes (which was perfect for call-in, since I lived about 5 minutes away).

I usually picked up on my way to or from campus, but there there also are a number of places to sit inside for table service. Again, don't expect anything fancy with the decor on the inside but the quality (and quantity) of the food more than makes up for it!

As long as you aren't expecting a super trendy, super gourmet Chinese food experience, you won't be disappointed. Give it a try!
