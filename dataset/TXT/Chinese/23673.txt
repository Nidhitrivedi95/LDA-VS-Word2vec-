6W20fKnjqPTSU2irnSVmSQ I had just left the  masjid where I attend for both Friday prayer and daily prayers and met with some friends on the way to Changs and I decided to tag along . I loved it. The dynamite shrimp was perfectly cooked and Matt our server was attentive but not intrusive  and was really respectful of my religious situation  . A diverse crowd and some great brotherhood. Thank you Changs and thank you Matt enjoyable nice time .
