DM8j5g9k28vEOTM0kz4KVA This place is a little gem located in Anthem. Our family loves this place. Food is always fresh and portions are generous. We decided to take our extended family here for Christmas Eve dinner and they have been raving about it ever since. Everyone from the kids to the adults found something they loved. The sweet and sour chicken is always a family favorite, chicken is white meat, light and not greasy. The wonton soup is delicious filled with meat and veggies. Crab ragoons are my favorite appetizer, they are light and flavorful.
