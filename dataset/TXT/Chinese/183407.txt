XpgtXP2e1nWslXW6-YZWuQ Pretty horrible congee...idk how you can screw that up but they managed to. Got the clam and salted yolk congee and the clams were barely opened and there were barely any ingredients in it except for the hard stalks of this bitter vegetable. The steamed cheung fun that came with it was soggy and they didn't bother cleaning the sides of the plate before presenting it. This place used to be better but is going downhill and you can tell with the lack of care in the food and service.
