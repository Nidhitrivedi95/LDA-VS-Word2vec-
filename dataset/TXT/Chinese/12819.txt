2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg HK style diner in Chinatown with cheap food and one of the few places open late. They have $4 breakfast combos, lunch combos and certain items on the menu are only $4 (like the congees or the BBQ pork on rice). I usually get the beef tendon in rice noodle soup which is a pretty generous portion that comes out to about $5.
