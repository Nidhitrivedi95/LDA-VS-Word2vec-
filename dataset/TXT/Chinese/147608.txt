SbWqeztXrCTsYMsf6KGYvg They have a nice array of Chinese food, won ton soup is always spot on. I usually order pepper steak with fried rice. Since I prefer things on the spicy side, I ask them for extra spices in the steak, and they always remember the spices even on a pick-up order. One of the best local Chinese restaurants.
