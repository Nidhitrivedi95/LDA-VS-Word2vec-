beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw I'm a tough critic, so often go off the strip for the gems of Vegas.  This place just opened and doesn't disappoint.  The novelty is fantastic, but the food is equally a small impressive.  What is great is as you add items to your soup base the flavor of the broth changes making the meal evolve.  And you can continually experimenting adding items and eating them.  The meats are amazingly fresh as are the conveyor items.  This place is not a fad and will be around for a while.  Maybe they will franchise
