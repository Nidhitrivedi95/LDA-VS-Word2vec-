NdpvGGF4cLrdnA6ydSZz3g Went here with 3 friends on a Sunday. We got there around 12pm - I would say this was just before the rush. Very nice looking environment.

Lots of different options on the menu. I got the 10-year special soup base, really flavorful and spicy. I'm not a huge fan of the individual personal pots because hot pot is always a big group activity kind of thing for me. All the meats were really fresh. Menu pretty much has everything you ever need for hot pot. Service was a little slow, but nothing crazy. I would definitely come back.
