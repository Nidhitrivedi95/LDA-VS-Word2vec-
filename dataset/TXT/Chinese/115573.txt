N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ Great brunch hangin out w my daughter in the hood I grew up in. Awesome to witness the gentrification of dundas and great eclectic mix of new eateries .

The food was awesome;  patois eggs Benny and quinoa breakfast. Amazing added bonus when waiter messed up and brought us the French toast by mistake and threw it Into mix no charge .
Hailey inhaled it .. Lol
