The place is tiny but there are always empty tables whenever I go but then again I don't go during peak hours. The menu is pretty extensive, I just wish they had more options for their version of dim sum. The ingredients they use don't seem that fresh and for many of their dishes, at least the 10 or so I have ordered,  they usually overload it with lots of water chestnuts and green onions and add very little meat.. I do love their noodle soups, but I'm such a huge fan of noodle soup that it's hard for me to not like one. They also have this chili oil that is super yummy so don't forget that when you get takeout. The place is convenient and decent enough for me to go back multiple times but then again I don't expect much from this place.
