3-HFGxmbzSax-NySJ_LzDg Came here with a bunch of fellow Yelpers on a Tuesday night, and must say that I was fairly impressed with their food.

I definitely came in here with some reservations, not really expecting authenticity and taste to be VIP's strong points given their extremely modern ambiance. I was expecting more along the lines of high quality American-Chinese food that's served at PF Chang's.

Their huge menu, separated into a Sushi menu and Chinese menu, also threw a warning flag for me as I feel like they might be spread too thin. 

Thus, given my aforementioned hesitations, I was extremely surprised and impressed to find not only high quality food, but also the authentic taste that comes along with traditional Chinese dishes. 

While everyone ordered their own dishes, we passed everything around and sampled most things.

Some of my personal favorites were:
Roast duck hand-pulled noodles (highly recommend getting one of their hand-pulled noodles)
Sliced beef maw in chili sauce (traditional Szechuan cold appetizer) 
Pork dumplings in chili sauce (can't go wrong with dumplings right?)
House special pork spare ribs
Stir fried string beans 
Fried ice cream

Honestly, everything was pretty delicious, from their sushi to their Chinese dishes. They also make a killer mojito that's light and refreshing. 

My biggest surprise, however, was how affordable everything was. The hand-pulled noodles ran from $8-9 for a huge bowl. Most entrees were within $10-12. For such a modern and sleek interior, I definitely expected some jacked up prices. 

Everything being said, I can comfortably say that VIP is one of the better Chinese restaurants in town :)
