qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w Best Chinese take out anywhere. I have lived all over the  US and if you want great Chinese delivery this is it!  Always great quality, and the BEST hot and sour soup anywhere. The delivery is wicked fast!! The staff is awesome and very friendly!  I highly recommend the cold noodles on the appetizer menu.  OMG...I love it!  It has peanuts so anyone with allergies shouldn't order it.  It's even better the second day!! You get a lot!!  I really can't say anything bad about this place.  They are the best!
