f1iTkj320DVn4TyWcvsUjA We used to be regulars way back... must have been 5-6 years ago. They were famous for their sweet and sour pork, which is still pretty good! 

My family and I came here for lunch on Saturday, and boy was this restaurant, not busy... there was only another table with us. This restaurant hasn't changed since the last time we were here... this was many years ago. 

The restaurant is very old looking, you will see with my pictures. A lot of construction workers come here. 

My family and I ordered, sweet and sour pork side of rice, garlic pork chop with fried rice, beef and Chinese broccoli fried rice noodle, and Cantonese fried noodle. I believe two were lunch specials, which are around $9.00. Not sure how much the fried noodles were - it was not on the menu. Their menu is very, very limited for lunch. It is literally two pages. 

The food was typical, nothing special, and very small dishes. Probably will not be back, maybe for dinner just to try it out.
