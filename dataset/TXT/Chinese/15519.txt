3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug I saw a lot of great looking food being served at this restaurant. The problem is, none of it appeared on the menu I was given. No lobster, no crab, no geoduck, even though there were tanks of those items clearly visible. Purely because I am Caucasian, I was given a menu of standard Chinese - Canadian items. I ordered a seabass hotpot, and my wife ordered the tiger prawns. What I got was a stirfried fish filet with onions and mushrooms - how exactly is that supposed to be hot and spicy? I ordered a spicy broccoli, expecting the kai lan I saw other guests eating. Instead, I got something that had a vaguely sweet sour sauce on it.

I lived in the Argyle (primarily Vietnamese) neighborhood of Chicago for 15 years. I have spent about five years of my life in relationships with Asian women. I understand Asian foods. I love Asian cuisines. What I was served was not what I ordered, but a blatantly racist interpretation of what the ownership and servers felt someone who "looked like me" would want.

Shame on you Omei.
