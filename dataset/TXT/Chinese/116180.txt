n62dcL1e8BQA1_kUEYrldQ We love this place!  We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here some 28 years ago and are so glad it's still here. We drive about 10 miles here every time we want Chinese food.  My wife always gets Mongolian beef and I usually get the garlic shrimp.  The Hunan shrimp & scallops are very good too.  The waitress here is as fun as they come!
