Parking lot is pretty much full!! You have to drive around and get lucky.

Restaurant is packed.

We had a table for 15.

I have to say that the service is good.  The waitresses are busy, but efficient!

I ask for water.... i get water!
I ask for a fork.... i get a fork.

4 stars for service!

The soup dumplings are not just good, they're great!! The pan fried dumplings are good too.

The other dishes are meh...

So i'm giving an overall 3 stars
