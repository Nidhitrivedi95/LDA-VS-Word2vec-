trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ The seasoning on their calamari was one of the best I've ever had. I had the Mussel Monday special and received a lot of food for a very good price (Mussels, salad, and focaccia bread for under $20). They also had an extensive drink menu with a great variety of beers. The service was great, I would definitely go back!
