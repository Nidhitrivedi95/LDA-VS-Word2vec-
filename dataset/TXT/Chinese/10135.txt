1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA My boyfriend and I were visiting Vegas, and as we were driving up there he was telling me about this great restaurant called Big Wong he's been hearing about from a friend. We decided we would give it a shot due to all the great reviews we read about.. 
When we got there, there was a hostess/waitress who looked really irritated to see us. She promptly sat us down and we said thanks and she doesn't even acknowledge it, just walks off. I was a little put off by the service but I just shrugged it off. We looked at the menu and we ordered a plate of the chicken wings to share between us, the beef ramen for my boyfriend, the double
Fish ball noodle soup for me, and two Thai teas. 
We got our drinks in a styrofoam cup. It was weird but I guess that's their norm. I drank it pretty quickly since it was small, and had to ask for a water within 5 minutes. Also a styrofoam cup. 
We then got our food. My boyfriend thought his ramen was okay, nothing special. I thought my noodle soup was bland beyond words. The soup tasted really watered down, I had to put in a ton of sriracha to give it any flavor at all. The wings were really good though, that was worth every penny. 

Some things bugged me a little during our visit there though. The kitchen is within full view to the restaurant which means I can hear the staff in there talking. At one point, I heard one of the guys in there raise his voice to another guy about not working hard enough? It was pretty loud and was a little unprofessional. 
Also, the waitress who was unfriendly the whole time, was on the verge of unpleasant. She seemed like she didn't want to be there serving us the whole time and I felt the negative vibe. 

Overall, this restaurant is cool if you're looking for acceptable quality in the food and cheap prices. Our total bill came out to only $20 so it wasn't bad. Make sure if you do go, try the wings. It'll make the trip worthwhile
