X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Really small club, tiny dance floor, the tables for bottle service take up all of the room. The music playing is over rated, the lines are ridiculously long. The drinks are extremely expensive and not even good. $40 for a beer and a malibu pineapple is absurd! Even if you're on the list from a promoter you are tricked into paying until you have the promoter fix the issue and then going back to the club is an ordeal. Go elsewhere, it's not worth it.
