cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ Han Chinese has been open just a short time, but they are light years ahead of most Chinese in Cleveland, and slightly better than the others. I typically go for lunch.

Pros:
-Clean (but also new)
-A good value
-Decent music
-Visually striking plating
-Extremely firm grasp of how to build flavor
-Good portion size without being ridiculous
-The food is well above average even for my favorite Chinese restos elsewhere

Cons:
-Not the best grasp of English (don't expect the blow-by-blow on each dish), but effective enough to take your order.
-Menu would greatly benefit from a list of ingredients in each dish in English (or a picture).
