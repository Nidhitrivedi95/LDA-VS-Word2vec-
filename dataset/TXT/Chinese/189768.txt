yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I'd give this place a 3.5 if yelp would let me. Food was good. I had the pork chop and rice. The ac was broken that night, so it was really warm and a little uncomfortable. The boba was decent. I had the honey dew boba. It was alright. I've had better though. The service was very good though.
