H94fBucKEuNKsjbSy7WODg Some of the best Chinese food I have ever had the pleasure of eating! Dumplings, beef and broccoli, and hot and sour soup were all fantastic. Swani, the owner, is one of the nicest ladies I have ever met. She took the time to accommodate us with everything (including free oranges upon request). She clearly is the mom figure to a lot of ASU students. Go here, support her, and get some awesome food!
