vHJlN629vOqgI40noEOdlw Let's just say that there's better Asian restaurants out there... The food looks standard but the taste makes me wonder what the quality of their meats actually is. It's quite salty so it's hard to say if it tastes good. I went here on a Monday night (what I assume after a busy weekend) so there should have been good turnover.  It's busy enough with most tables filled but for myself it wasn't the best in Cantonese-styled dining. A previous experience here was better, probably a different day, a different chef, a different set of dishes altogether. Most people liked the lamb, the lobster rice, and a couple other speciality dishes, but who knows, maybe their chef's changed. This time, I had more typical dishes like sweet n sour pork, beef and mixed vegetables, lotus root and pork, etc. I suppose one redeeming quality is the BYOW/BYOB policy. Don't expect too much in terms of decor either, it's functional more than fine dining.  If you come here with *** expectations you won't be disappointed, perhaps pleasantly surprised.
