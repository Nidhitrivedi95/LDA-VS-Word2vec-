MDInVOKvIetk_OIpKd2Ofw Finally some legit Chinese noodle place in Mississauga! I ordered the Spicy Hand-Made Beef Noodle. The noodle is very chewy and it's cut in short pieces, so you won't splash your noodles all over the place. The broth is numbing spicy, at first it tastes great, but after a while it does get a bit salty. It also comes with a complimentary Chinese kimchi. Service is great, the waitresses are very friendly. I would definitely go there again!
