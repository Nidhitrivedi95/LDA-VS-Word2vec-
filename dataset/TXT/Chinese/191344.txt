YTfXZ9tbTBJkWsDI7cMDWQ Good food at steeper prices than other Chinese restaurants. Not super expensive but enough to arch an eyebrow for a casual environment such as this one. Hubby loved the model airplanes and Taiwan memorabilia, this restaurant does feel like a personal labor of love. Service was ok, but minimal, and while the waitress peered over a couple of times never really came to check in on us and we had to go to the cashier to ask for the check. A lot of their dishes seem to favor vinegar and sweetness which I had to get used to, such as the seaweed appetizer. Would love to come back to try the soupy buns. Entrance of restaurant is the right door as hubby almost inattentively walked into the center door which is actually a real estate company.
