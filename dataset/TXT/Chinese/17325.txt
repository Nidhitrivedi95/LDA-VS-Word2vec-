4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA Honestly, it's usually great food. But, there was a bent metal nail-like thing in my food 5 minutes ago. Hurt my tooth, almost swallowed. Will attach photo. We order from them a lot - and it's usually good. But the fact that they said they wouldn't refund the order, (they did say credit next time) but, it's really a black mark on a business to not step up and do the right thing. I'm not a complainer - seriously. But I almost ate metal and they said no refund. Cmon now, that sucks... end of rant. Had to tell someone.
