8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ Came here on a Tuesday night for granny's bday.  This place was recently closed for kitchen reno.  Booked for 730 didn't get a table until 750.  Menu selections were limited.  We ordered a $298 combo with duck, lobster and fish.  Portions were small.  Service was ultra slow.  Neighboring tables were drunkards and they were so loud the it gave me ringing in my ears.  The roasted dock  was skinned on a pole to be a showpiece but  I can't bear the sight of that.  Not enough pieces for everyone.  Lettuce wraps were not enough for everyone and pieces were too small for wrapping. Live seafood tanks looked clean.  Decor was good. Birthday buns we whole wheat--a pleasant surprise. The food quality was no better than normal places but they were served on elaborate utensils. In some cases where the dish was served on a raised dish,  the  candles weren't lit up. The famous Concluding Chicken of Chinese Cuisine, I call it the 4C,  was  pleasantlt not dry.
