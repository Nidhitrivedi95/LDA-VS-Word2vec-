great. Food - it hit the spot but I won't wake up in the
middle of the night screaming Noodles Asia! like she was
some long lost hot lover I wish I had married. No. This
is the type of place you just go to because you're starving 
and just tired of walking and hey - open till 3AM. Almost
like New York! This place is right off the casino floor in 
a little corner within The Venetian. I had the Dan Dan 
Noodles. Very filling but a little dry and not as flavorful 
as I was hoping for. The service was very attentive and decent
though.
