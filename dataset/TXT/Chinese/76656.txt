gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw Do yourself a favor and come here. This sushi may not knock your socks off but this is easily the best value anywhere in Phoenix.  I don't bend to say much here other than I'm interrupting my meal to write this review. Been here about 10 times and never been disappointed. If u show up with a crew of 4 or more you are likely to enjoy some sake on the house or at least a free desert. And did I mention everything is 50% off. Enough said, this is your next sushi stop.
