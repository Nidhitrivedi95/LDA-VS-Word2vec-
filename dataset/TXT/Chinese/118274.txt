nl_gkvVXtsIlhGE0sP0qFw Really gross, the food is not very good everything is sitting in about an inch of oil and is dripping with oil as well. Everything is soggy and the broccoli was brown, the sushi is hot and not fresh at all. As far as the awesome ice cream everybody is talking about? Let me tell ya. I was waiting behind this really big Hairy guy for ice cream and it's the type you scoop yourself out of this big tub, and I swear this guys Hairy arm scraped the side of the tub of ice cream. I said no thanks after seeing that I can only imagine who else's arms have touched that ice cream. Also the place is so filthy they do not clean what so ever the floors and baseboard are black the ceiling has dirt on it and I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. Sorry crazy buffet I really am because I hope the health department takes my call seriously. 
Stay away at all costs
