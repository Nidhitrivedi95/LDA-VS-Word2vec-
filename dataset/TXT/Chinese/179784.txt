X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Went here on Memorial Day weekend.... It was CROWDED. That was to be expected though, we were on the guest list and we waited in line for over an hour. It was around 11pm so maybe the line thinned out later in the night. I was super excited to go here because it was so anticipated by everyone in Vegas. I feel like I would have had a lot more fun if there wasn't a million people there... The dance floor was smaller than I imagined it to be, being the largest club in Vegas but I only was in the room Tiesto was dj-ing in. The other rooms might be bigger/less crowded. So I would say that my first impression is that it was okay, but ill probably wait a while to again so it's less crowded and I can actually get to the dance floor and actually make it to the bar without getting trampled. I also do want to come back to see Calvin Harris. The club is also a really far walk from the parking structure so be prepared to walk.
