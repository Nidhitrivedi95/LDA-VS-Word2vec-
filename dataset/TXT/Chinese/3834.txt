_ONkRPvpIYdCuj9u6cIPeA A few of my friends have been raving about Miu Garden for dim sum, but I only just had the chance to experience it this past Saturday.  My only regret - not having discovered it sooner!

We got there around 1:30 p.m. which means each dim sum plate is only $2.30 (it's even cheaper on weekdays).  The restaurant was bustling with activity by the push-cart ladies.  Starving, and with much anticipation, we ordered our usual dim sum fare, and all the dishes indeed were delicious. 

Particularly exceptional dishes were:

the tripe (possibly the best tripe I've had in a dim sum place)
chicken feet
tofu dessert
congee
curry cuttle fish

We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here and were astonished (in a good way) by the bill.

thumbs up by our group of 5.
