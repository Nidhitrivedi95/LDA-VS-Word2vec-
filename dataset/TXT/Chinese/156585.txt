trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ My girlfriends and I were looking for a brunch spot this Sunday and stumbled upon the Pearl Diver. As luck would have it, they recently started serving brunch! I took a chance and ordered the Oyster Benny. The oyster was a Panko crusted BC Oyster. I've never had oysters and eggs together and the combination was fantastic! I really, really enjoyed it. My friends had the stuffed french toast which I had a bite of. It was also very delicious. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to have brunch in and around the downtown core!
