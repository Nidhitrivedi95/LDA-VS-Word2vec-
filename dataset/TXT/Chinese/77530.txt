Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA We love eating here as it is one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas!  The food is very tasty and the prices are reasonable.  The place is small but has a relaxing atmosphere.  The service is very good.  Our food was brought out fairly quickly and it was nice and hot!  Give it a try because you won't be disappointed.
