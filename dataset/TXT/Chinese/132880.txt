PRUhSfe7ihf3nLcihudsuQ I remember the days when D&R Wing's used to be in the Buttonfield Plaza, the same place as where Hai Tang Cafe is now. Those were the glory days of this place, but several years ago they moved to the Bamburgh plaza and I haven't visited here until a few days ago.

Decorations were...well there isn't much, it's a HK style cafe focusing on bang for your buck. It's a family restaurant, take it or leave it.

What I like about this place is that they have all day breakfast. I ordered a breakfast meal for my dinner...love it! For $5.50 you can get two eggs, bread, and a decent size of satay beef instant noodle (as an example). The quality is on par for the price you pay, hence the 4 stars.

If you're a frugal person looking for something to fill you up...this is definitely the place for you. This and Yogi Noodle are both excellent choices in the plaza to be honest.
