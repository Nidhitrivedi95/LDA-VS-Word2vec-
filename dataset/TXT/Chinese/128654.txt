PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ The dim sum was amazing, came here for the hot pot but since it's the summer time they aren't serving it. The server told us they only had one order of hot pot this whole summer. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant can accommodate large parties. 
Their sesame balls are a must-try!!! They got them just right. 5/5
