OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA Do not understand the relatively high praise this place receives. While service was very good, the food was mediocre, and partly actually unappetizing. Might be because it was a busy night , but the dishes were sloppy, the flavoring was off, and on one noodle dish the sauce was slathered on to a excessive degree making it almost inedible. Attention to detail is greatly required ,would not go back.
