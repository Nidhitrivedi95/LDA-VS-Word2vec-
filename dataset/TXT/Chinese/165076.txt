UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw The seafood here is fresh and the serving is generous. I had the scallops marinated in their Saigon sauce. It was a little spicy and full of flavor. My husband had the teriyaki salmon served with spinach. We had the sampler as a starter, it was large enough for 4 people. Our waiter John was friendly and very knowledgable about the ingredients in every dish. It was such a pleasure to have him wait on us. He made great suggestions and explained that the dishes are made to order to accommodate our preferences. Prices are reasonable for the portion sizes. Our dessert choice was a freshly baked to order macadamia nut cookie, it was so yummy! Big enough to share with others.
