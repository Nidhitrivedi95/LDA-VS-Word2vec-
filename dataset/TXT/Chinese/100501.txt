K0FtmxCgqJEbDNCyXyMX_w This is my first time at this particular location and I have to say all in all very satisfied. Service was good. Food was very fresh and very tasteful. There was some trash on the floor between the bathroom and condiment station and by the front door but all in all pretty clean place. I would recommend to all my friends and family.
