2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q With all the Asian gamblers around (they changed the MGM mouth of the lion entrance for Chinese feng shui) there are some great authentic dishes being offered here. Actual Chinese cooks cranking out the food at Noodle Exchange....I was very hopeful. Their special hot pot was just like the kind you find on the streets in Taipei. Only offered from 5-9 It was a great deal for $12 for lamb or beef, and $14 for seafood. The rest of the dishes looked great ... Chinese comfort food for sure! I cant say that the Gold Coast would be a destination, or that the restaurant was that amazing to visit. However if you need your Taiwan/ Hong Kong  fix.....this is your place!!
