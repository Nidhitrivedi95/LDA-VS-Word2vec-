BbPVtY7hzBPnpRrZMBElIg Greasy, salty, over-seasoned and wilting in the steam tables...that says it all. This is a sad imitation of a Chinese buffet, with little to eat that delights the senses. Instead, my tongue was quickly overwhelmed by the cook's heavy use of salt to disguise the food's low quality. 

A single star for service, because our waitress was quite sweet and friendly. 

Other than that, yuck.
