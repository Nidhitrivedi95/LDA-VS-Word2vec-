YjlCXwWr9xx6TnHmTFCKGQ One of your hostess said in a rude tone that there were no booths available when I asked if we could have one. As me and my girlfriend walked to our seats that the hostess seated us at we saw 4 open booths and at 5 of the occupied booths there were 2 people seating in them. As my girlfriend and I were waiting for our food we witnessed the same hostess sit a party of 2 in a booth. It was not that long ago that we asked for a booth so I was surprised to see that. The hostess pretty much ruined my experience here. The pan-fried pork dumplings were good but there's a tastier and cheaper option at a Chinese restaurant called Golden Valley. I also ordered then lo mien which was just as good as the lo mien I had at Golden Valley which is just as good and you get more for a lesser price. I came here around 8pm. If it wasn't for the waitress this place would probably be given a 4.
