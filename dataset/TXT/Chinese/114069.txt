MSYpFcm5FAkQYLcY6tkOgw I like their food. The servings are HUGE and the prices are very affordable. They have lunch and dinner specials which is usually when I go. They also deliver if you live within a certain mile radius, which I do! Lol I have never had any problems with this resturant. Check them out!
