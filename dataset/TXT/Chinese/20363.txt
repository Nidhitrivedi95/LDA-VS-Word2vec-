5z-kd3h50BnaE1Ee8GV5bg This is probably the worst place I have ever been to. The $8.50 (9.23 with tax) that I paid for was not worth it, there was a small buffet line with limited choices and mostly breaded and fried. I tried the egg drop soup and could taste plastic. Same goes for the fried rice and chow mein. The chicken were too sour. The fried fish was greasy and the chicken, too. The two types of sushi that were there weren't even tasty. The deserts (cookie and donut-type) were horrible because they weren't even sweet or appetizing. I'm never coming back to this place and neither should you. They call it an all you can eat with bad food and there's no shrimp and NO SEAFOOD AT ALL. Sucks.
