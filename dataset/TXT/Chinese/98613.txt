JS8MpdVJ8-grSVNObYXnbA This chain has consistent fast fresh food in all locations I've visited throughout the years. 

It isn't suppose to be authentic Chinese food, so I don't rate or compare based on that. 

It's a Canadian Chinese restaurant concept and it's execution is superb.  . 

All locations have an extensive salad bar, soup, BBQ, hot foods, drink menu and desert section. This makes it popular place to please a wide variety of patrons palettes.

As for service, I've never had a complaint here. They are very friendly (sometimes so much is feel fake :p ), everybody including the chef, hostesss, and most especially your table servers. 

From Barrie, Newmarket, North York, Scarborough, Markham Brampton, and this location I'm reviewing in Woodbridge I would say they are all consistently good. 

I just choose based on location not because one place does the food better.

Really I don't know why all the hate for it. Ah haters will be haters.
