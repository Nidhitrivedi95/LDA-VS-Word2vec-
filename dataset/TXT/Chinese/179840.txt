X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Came here during edc week. Well... Where do I begin? Bought three drinks for $57 WTF!?? Never again! But that's because I got to Vegas super late and had no time pre-game. Anywho, I enjoyed the bottom floor. Just my vibe with hip hop music. The second floor played edm and goodness, super crowded. Good thing was getting free drinks of course, getting access to a free vip table from a bunch of fine ass Australian men and dancing on that extended table. Just having a great time overall. Met cool people and had fun. Can't say I hated it but can't complain that I didn't enjoy it either.
