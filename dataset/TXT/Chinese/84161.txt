hfeu3UZ-OrCgf5mp6RBjvA Disclaimer: I usually dine at Southern Chinese restaurants, as in Chiu Chow, Shanghainese, and Cantonese food, so this review is from the perspective of such diner.

We ordered 2 non spicy dishes and 1 spicy dish that was at one chili spiciness level.  We didn't ask the kitchen to alter the spiciness.  The one chili level tasted hot to me.  The spice was quite easy at first few bites, then it accumulated to hot.  At this heat level, I could not tell if it was salty or not.  It could be, because my BF was thirsty afterwards.  

The non spicy dish tasted decent,  The barrel rice was a rice with meat served in a wood barrel.  The presentation was cute.  The variety that we chose had very little pork slices.  You could regard it as a rice with bamboo.  The smoked fish didn't tasted smoky.  It appeared to me that the chef cut the smoking time short, then he added the sauce.  I wouldn't order it again.

Note that while there are a member price and a non-member price for dining in, I notice that the take out menu only has the member pricing.  I assume it may mean that, for taking out, you don't need a membership to get the lower price.
