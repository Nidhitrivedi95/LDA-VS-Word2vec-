YBIhTjmEH3IEZW4Dr5ReRA I reeeally want to love Wong's as much as my boyfriend does. I just can't. 

Before I started eating chicken again, I'd always ordered the sweet & sour tofu or the broccoli & oyster sauce. They weren't exciting, but they had flavor. I recently ordered their chicken and (soft noodle) chow mein dish. The entire dish was kind of plain tasting, but there was a light brown/yellow-ish goo covering all of it. I tried to like it, I really did. I just couldn't get past the Chicken from a Can taste to it. 

Also, we had a waitress who was apparently new. She was extremely sweet and tried really hard to get everything right. I didn't mind so much that she forgot our rice (she's new it happens). I was bothered by the normal wait staff who all just stood there and watched her as she struggled to help four or five tables (the only groups in the place on a Sunday afternoon) instead of helping her out. They also kept yelling at her in Chinese, which I thought was very rude for them to do in front of the people she's trying to help. The lady who fills water glasses after so much as a sip doesn't count-- she was on her game, haha.

I don't plan on going back for some time. 
As usual, I had a stomach ache after eating here and I just couldn't get the awful chicken taste out of my mouth.
