4STzP1q1uM8ONkKookifsw First of all I was not impressed with the serving of beverage. I ordered hot tea and they gave me tea in a plastic cold drink cup. I was expecting tea cups or at least coffee cups with a handle to enjoy sipping while its still hot. But I used napkins to wrap around the drinking cup so I can sip and worst of all they gave me a straw! Who uses straw to sip hot tea??
Noodles was suppose to be the main attraction here but the one I got was overcooked, the taste was unpleasant and chewy. So in my opinion from my experience I give this restaurant a 1 star.
