x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ Absolutely, Meh, I've experienced better. I don't know what happened to them but they seem to get worse and worse recently. At our last visit, the Mongolian beef was under cook and very slimy. The water always taste weird and this time the rice was also so bad. I really liked this place before and it was our go to restaurant but my last two experience was just very bad in comparison to what you pay them. I'm still enjoying their noodle and chicken 65 but I don't think a restaurant has to be gone for only two menu items.
