yDJhScdD8cCCYfO4WNb-CQ I can't believe I forgot to review C'est Bon! Familiarity means forgetting how special something is.

Everyone's laughing at the 'authentic' part of the title. So am I. It's authentic Chinese-Canadian food, complete with egg rolls and fortune cookies and fried rice. It is not what you'd get in Chinatown. That said, if you grew up with Chinese-Canadian takeout C'est Bon is miles and miles above the rest. It's less greasy and less salty, and more diverse -- not every Chinese takeout will have rice vermicelli or glorious black bean sauce or big boxes of perfectly prepared green vegetables. Or piles and piles of tofu on the menu. Vegetarians, this is where to get your tofu fix. The black bean sauce is absolutely to die for. I keep meaning to order other things but I keep going back to the black bean tofu. Everything they do is done well.

I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, although the storefront and patio look pretty nice for the class of restaurant. I always get delivery and it's super fast -- if they say 40 minutes it'll probably be under 30. They've never gotten an order wrong (despite the weird poor quality of the phone in a very loud kitchen) and everything is always hot and fresh. The free-delivery area is huge and there are two locations depending on whether you're north or south of Eg -- the 2680 Yonge store is the southern one, so if you're north call the other number.

I'll miss these guys when I make the inevitable move to a less expensive neighbourhood.
