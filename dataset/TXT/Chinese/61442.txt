drIFrAyZnyismS1ArZlmAg Love love love this place. I found it through Yelp and have been going there ever since. I love the PHO and the Heaven rolls with Avocado. The Padi Thai and BBQ noodles are yummy too. I also enjoy the lentil soup they serve free at lunch. It's delicious!! I am a customer for life..
