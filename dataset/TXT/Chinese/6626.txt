Since my order was over $20 they threw in some free crab puffs. It ended up being around $23 before tip which was a little more than I had originally planned, but oh well. It took about 50 minutes to be delivered, which was a bit longer than I expected, but the food was great. The crab puffs were delicious and the Mongolian Beef was great with the crispy rice that came underneath. I saved the Sweet and Sour Chicken for the next day, which was still good, but probably not as good as it would have been sans microwave. I will definitely be ordering from China Gate next time I need my Chinese food kick.
