The eggdrop soup was a big sharing portion and was delicious!!! I went because I seen their menu had walnut shrimp and I have been looking for it since I moved here last month. It was excellent and I really recommend it if you like shrimp and don't have a nut allergy. Everything we ordered was great. I will definitely be a regular for the walnut shrimp.
