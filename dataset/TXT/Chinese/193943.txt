ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ Chatime is sooooo good. My favorite is the Brown Rice Green Milk Tea with Grass Jelly (regular sugar). It has a really distinct and unique taste that I seem to always crave now. They also accommodate for people that don't like as sugary drinks or too much ice so you can order your drinks with 50% sugar or 0 sugar added. The taste is really authentic. It typically costs about $4 - $6 for a drink which is pretty normal for bubbletea. I've also had the Passion Fruit QQ (I think it had lychee jelly and tapioca in it) which I think would be great for the summer because it's really fruity and also the Matcha Red Bean one, which was also really good! 

It also has Wifi and is open pretty late (I believe until midnight).
