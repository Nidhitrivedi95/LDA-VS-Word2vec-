bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg Ramen done right! My son is loves ramen and talked me into a to-go pork ramen! It's so damn yummy! The egg was perfect, the meat was tender and the mushrooms were meaty. The price is right for a hearty lunch. I was surprised and impressed! Good job y'all! I will be back for date night.
