tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw I have eaten here more times than I can remember and each time has been delicious and satisfying. I stick with my favorites a big bowl of wonton soup-no wontons with sizzling rice, occasional eggroll and the perfectly brewed hot tea. Perfect anytime day or night. There are many other items I've had but none are as good as their soup. 1 star off due to outdated decor, but the service, food and wait times are always great. Note to motorists, getting out of the parking lot to head west on Indian School borders on suicide.
