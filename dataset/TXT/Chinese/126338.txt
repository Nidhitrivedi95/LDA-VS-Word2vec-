oZfNL6ZFdITqfwJzcE-LyA I was desperate for Chinese today and I found a spot that delivered,  so I was super amped. I have never tried this spot before, so I was a little apprehensive,  but nonetheless,  I went for it. The lady who took my order was pleasant and the food came to us very fast, but as soon as I opened the door to receive my food,  I got a whiff of a strange smell. Not the wonderful smell of good quality Chinese,   but some straight gutter,  low quality ish. I opened the bag and the smell of old grease and burnt food hit my nostrils. I order veggie fried rice,  veggie egg rolls and fried chicken wings.  And all of it smelled old af.  I made sure I said a prayer before I ate the food.  The egg rolls tasted like cinnamon fried something, so pretty much... I was eating everything that they fried the the food in,  so basically I got a  Chinese food bonus,  everything I ordered plus the free taste of old fried desert... It's my lucky day!  The Rice had the same fried,  sweet,  dirty taste.  I threw all of it away, and the  chicken was greasy af... So greasy I could use it on the creaky  door hinges in my house, enough to shine your shoes,my shoes and even  enough grease to use on my face so I can prepare for battle and give them a straight up ass whopping for serving this disgusting food. 
 I abhor this place,  and so should you.
