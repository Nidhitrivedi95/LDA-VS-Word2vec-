tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw Used to enjoy getting take out here regularly. Our last three orders have all had problems - 2 orders had food that was burned and inedible, and 1 order was missing 2 items and was 30 minutes late in being prepared.

Also, on two of those orders, they had no white rice OR brown rice available to go with our dishes... how can PF Changs not have rice?!?
