o5t33JVLpZWf269AEPB95Q Pretty decent vegetarian restaurant! I ordered the mock sweet and sour chicken, which was amazing! Split the mock duck noodles with my friend, which was good (but I've never had duck so I guess I can't really compare it to the real thing). I've seen past reviews mention that the service was slow but I didn't find that to be an issue at all - they were super helpful and attentive. The portions are big for what you pay, so overall I think it's worth it if you like vegetarian food and know what to order (i.e.: the mock sweet and sour chicken).
