SLH_6FIjptg5BEJbYNld6w Pretty standard. Had the Kimchi Chigae and a drink and it totalled under $12. 

The food was pretty average. The washrooms were a little bizarre, and might be completely inaccessible for some people, with a low sloping ceiling and a trek to be made up some very narrow, creaky stairs. The service, however, was top-notch. Friendly, helpful, and smiling. And I never felt rushed.
