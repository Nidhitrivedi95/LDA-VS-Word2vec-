jenDHueIvOhpB-0ivdiRoQ My mom taught me if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all. But, I never listened very well.
Icky sweet and glutinous sauces. Poor quality meats. Breading that is inedible and over cooked veggies that were limp and tasteless. Even the won tons were terrible. If this is what passes for 4star Chinese fare, I would rather go without.
I have tried this place 5 times since moving here in January and have yet to enjoy their food. Never again.
