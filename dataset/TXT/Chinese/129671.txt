pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Reservations for 830 got there 815 seated immediately food was out by 830 and we were paid and out by 900. Amazing quality food... worth the pay to treat yourself here if you enjoy this style menu or quality sushi. Speedy service as well. Would highly recommend. Vanessa and Jason made the experience great.
