7U73RqIg6JA0WThxWUV3uA This is a very unique Chinese Restaurant for this area.  They offer authentic Chinese food that is unlike anything offered by other restaurants in the South Hills.  I had the Sichuan Spicy Fish Fillet Pot and it was exactly what I hoped it would be.  It was super spicy(in a good way), had great texture, and was addictive to eat.  It's one of those dishes that burned, but you had to keep eating it.  I'm really happy this place is here now and that my wife and I tried it out.  We live 1 block away and we're thrilled to have something like this so close.  Try it out!
