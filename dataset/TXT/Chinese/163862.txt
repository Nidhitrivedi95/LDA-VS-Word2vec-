UslSiDSUTCaq62FMpWK6Lw This place was absolutely terrible. I would recommend to never go there. They give the good Chinese food out as samples and then give you terrible food when you go buy some. Way overpriced me and my fiancé literally took two bites and had to throw it away it and go somewhere else it was so disgusting. Save your time and go somewhere worth eating.
