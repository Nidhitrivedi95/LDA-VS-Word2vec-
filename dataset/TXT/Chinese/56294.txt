CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw Service was fantastic, greeted me right when I walked in, was a nice touch.  Very clean, food was spectacular!  Wow!  And I'm from NJ so you know I take my Chinese food seriously!  Couldn't believe the price!  Very reasonable for made to order.  No MSG too.  They have the coke machine so have every selection imaginable!!!!  I strongly recommend!
