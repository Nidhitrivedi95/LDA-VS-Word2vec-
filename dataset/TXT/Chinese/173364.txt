W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g About to order it now. My wife gets the pho. I get the vermicelli noodles with pork and egg rolls. And an egg drop soup (egg flower soup). We also like the summer rolls and chicken lettuce wraps. The food is served fresh with excellent service and nice people. We typically get takeout but it is a nice place to eat in as well. I hope for many years of success for them as they are a terrific local establishment with excellent Chinese cuisine!
