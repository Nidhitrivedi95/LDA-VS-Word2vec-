trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ We first came here when it was only opened for 5 weeks (probably close to 2 years ago now). I booked this place for my husband's birthday. They gave us the private room in the back. I didn't even ask for it! :) The food was fairly priced as it was fresh, flavourful and well portioned. They also had a sound system for us to plug in our own music. The ambiance, decor and vibe of this place is cool and relaxed. We've eaten here a few times. Their $100 for 100 oysters is the best deal, especially if you are going with a group of oyster-loving friends.
