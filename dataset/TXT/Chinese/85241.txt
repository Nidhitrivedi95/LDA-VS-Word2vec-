HJ928N6c5Hh2KD3lYCuabA Took my group here for a couple of birthdays this past week.  I tried the curry pad-thai and it was okay... I've had better, but it was okay... the Tom Yong Goon soup (I probably bastardized the spelling LOL) and it is pretty good (I tend to get this soup when I go to a Spring Rolls)... the actual Spring Rolls are my favorite and I order it usually as an appetizer... As far as chains go it's not a bad place...
