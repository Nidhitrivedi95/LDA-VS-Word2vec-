Whzg5Koaz9yJ6mwIl7QkqQ Food is very good and price is quite reasonable. They offer delivery through just-eat. Their deep fried banana desert is very delicious. People working there are polite and the delivery is fast. It has quickly become my main go to Chinese / Asian restaurant for delivery in my area.
