_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA After a disastrous poker session at the poker room I decided to get some of my losses back in noodle form. It was 11 PM and I needed something to keep me full until I decide to quit my dreams of becoming a professional poker player and go to sleep. 

I decided on the Si Jiu Beef Noodles. It had marinated beef, pan fried noodles, and veggies. The waiter said it was normally very spicy so I decided to order it mild since I sweat like crazy with spicy food. Unfortunately it was so mild that I didn't taste any of the spiciness at all. What I did taste was pain from the fresh pan fried noodle center. This was a dish to be eaten slowly! I ended up burning my mouth a little but I needed to get back in to the action.

Pro-tip: If you play poker, talk to the poker room boss for a food voucher.
