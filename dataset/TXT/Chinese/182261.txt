xI4IId1ZXfSflFvfbAtTVQ Placed an order on the phone and they told is to pick up in 25 minutes. We went to the restaurant and the food was not ready as promised. We were told to come back in another 15 minutes to pick up. We went back to be told that the food will take another 15 minutes. I would not go near this place again for take out as they cannot deliver on their promise.

One of the worst experience I've had with any restaurants in the area.
