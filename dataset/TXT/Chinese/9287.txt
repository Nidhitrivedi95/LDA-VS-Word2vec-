While the food is generally fresh, the selection isn't that large. It's a bit of a trek, but you're better of heading to Matthews for the Hibachi Grill for their selection - and if you have the time, go all the way to the new China Buffet in the converted Olive Garden at Albemarle Road (though that one is a real drive from here).

But if you're in the area, and don't mind the funky parking lot, they work out just fine - fairly standard buffet eats, fried and non-fried, as well as some dessert selections and they do a decent job of taking care of the items that you work through during your meal, and friendly to boot.
