DQMaUSbKsRtB5lJD3egqxQ Another one of the places I desperately miss from Madison.  After a year and a half in Madison, I'd still only worked my way through about half the menu.  Everything is good, though my favorite would have to be the ma po tofu.  Some of my favorite memories of Madison are sitting in a booth on a cold Wisconsin night with a bowl of ma po, a plate of fried dumplings, a pot of tea, and a book, a friend, or a girl.
