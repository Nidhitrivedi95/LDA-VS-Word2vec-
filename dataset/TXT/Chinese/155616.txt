Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w Nice selection on vegan options and for a self posed temporary vegan like myself you can try the tofu pot (c4) with shrimp stuffing, shitake mushroom, Chinese sausage and the sweet broth of chicken. I ate all the veg part and had my friends ate all the non-veg. Worked out great! The chicken soup can sure warm you up. My friends also mentioned the claypot #1 with beef brisket is one of the best they've had and trust me they r both picky eaters who've had meals in Chinatown everywhere.
