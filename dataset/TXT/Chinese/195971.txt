ZKBUoCqTpwMtmImz64DGyQ Literally the WORST Chinese food/take out food in general that I have ever had. I ordered sesame chicken with pork fried rice and the rice was inedible and burnt....yes, burnt! I have never before had burnt rice from a Chinese restaurant but Hong Kong managed to do it. Typically pork fried rice is a white or yellowish color depending on the type of rice they use....well mine was white with what looked like black dust on it. DISGUSTING! My chicken looked edible at first until I took my first bite and had to pull a huge piece of some type of black residue from my mouth. After examining the rest of my chicken I noticed that these large black pieces of grill or deep fryer residue were floating throughout the sauce covering my chicken. I paid $9.90 to literally take one bite of my meal and throw the rest in the garbage. Please take my advice and do not go by the other semi-positive reviews on this page. Stay away, save yourself some money, and go to another restaurant.
