vTFp_0wvobpUgS5RSde13w Came here last weekend and it's pretty good dim sum. The har gow, siu mai, and chicken feet are all really plump and juicy. The turnip cakes are huge with tons of shredded turnip rather than mostly dough at some other places. They have the "goon tong gow" big seafood dumpling in soup which is great since not a lot of places have it. They also have xiao long baos (listed as Northern style dumplings on the menu) - they're good when they first come out, but after a few minutes they started to get deflated. 

Service is a step-up from your typical Chinese restaurant - the ladies are actually quite friendly.
