fgm7DKVy1wuod6FTPvZqRw I crave Chinese food at least once a week and wanted to try something different from the usual place I always go to. Ordered for pick up, price is decent and food was nice. I ordered orange chicken combo which includes plain fried rice, a cream cheese puff and a veggie egg roll. The lady said I would be getting soup with my order also but I never got it. I didn't really care about the soup honestly though.The portions are filling, this isn't my favorite Chinese place but it would be my second choice. Definitely will be back
