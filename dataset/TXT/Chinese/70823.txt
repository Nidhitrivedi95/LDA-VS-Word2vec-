fACUiSmM2sq1VTYVFUagRg Cute cat themed bubble tea place. This place is conviently located near UTM. I usually come by with my friends after class. I love their peach green tea and their strawberry green tea bubble tea. The kitea milk tea is also pretty good. They have an okay variety of bubble tea you can choose from. They also have some herbal jelly desserts and If you're hungry they have some dim sum and snacks you can order. 

The place is usually pretty empty, the drinks and food are reasonably price and is slightly cheaper than other bubble tea places. Collect their stamp card, buy 10 get 1 free!
