XCUXCTHvY8QVR4xU0DF__w We lived in China and are always looking for and jonesing for good authentic Chinese food. This place is the bomb for good dumplings, Ma Po tofu, noodles and other great Chinese dishes. While it mainly has northern Chinese fair, they have a fair amount of Sichuan dishes. Best part...They offer frozen dumplings to steam at home. Highly recommend the dumpling house!
