5aGYZbjkXpCecz4QH2ZKFg Still consistent and still decent, but I would say that I've experienced better. If you have a formula that works, stick to it. Since I started stopping by Dragon, the layout of the restaurant and the steam tables haven't changed. And more importantly, the food items haven't changed. They still offer a Black Pepper Pork and there are Barbecue Spare Ribs at dinner and the steamed dimsum and fried dumplings are there all day. Chicken & Broccoli and Lo Mein and such, too.

They've had a few platters of sushi - nothing more than California Rolls - occasionally.

With all of that said, there's a new player in town. Not even a mile further south is Jasmine Buffet which has more tables, better sushi and a cook-to-order hibachi grill with fresh veggies. Though it is a little more expensive there.
