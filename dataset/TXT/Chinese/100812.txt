k2c7nIIDgY-FD6Yk-I_3Ww I went today for Lunch with some co-workers. We all greatly enjoyed what we had.  the lunch special was a good price.  I had the Caramelized Mongolian Chicken it was sweet with good flavor.. added a little chili and was really happy.  Noodles were better than the fired rice... as a tip.  Can't wait to go back.
