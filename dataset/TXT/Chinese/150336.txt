SUhBnQdG8MWkmjM6wsnVdw We visited China,and my daughter in law is from Beijing and craves authentic schezuen food.....this restaurant serves authentic food. The flavor of the lamb skewers was delicious as the ones we purchased from a street vendor in China.....the noodle dish flavorful.....spicy tofu dish was seasoned just right. The only reason for 4 not 5 stars...the restroom was dirty (resembled ones I used in China). I would definately return and try more of their authentic recipes...if you like schezuen but not overloaded spicy, you must try Tang Dynasty.
