My disappointment with Hakkasan is not due to my clubbing experience, the layout, price, or drinks. Nope, I had an all-around amazing time at Hakkasan during my recent Vegas trip. The 1-star rating is due to being misled by one of the bottle service "Marketing" professionals who I will refer to as "Z."

Our group paid a total of about $150.00 for advance tickets to Hakkasan on Sunday, January 29. Upon arrival we met Z who tried to persuade us into buying upgraded bottle service. We were a small group but didn't mind paying the premium for a better experience. It was Chinese New Years and we all had some extra cash, it's Vegas so whynot? But since we had already paid the $150 we asked if that amount could go towards our table service bill (see text). Z said no, but suggested, definitively, that we could get a refund on the tickets. Based on that information we chose bottle service.

The following week I contacted Hakkasan customer service to ask for a refund. My request was denied even after showing the representative the text from Z. After some back and forth, the agent finally offered to provide me with comp tickets for my next visit but I insisted on the refund. The agent reminded me of their non-refundable policy and was adamant in not giving me a refund despite the evidence that I was intentionally misled....And because of how this story ended I am giving Hakkasan 1-star and will never patronize this business again.

I don't want to sound petty but I am writing my review based on principal. $150 was really just a drop in the bucket considering the fact that we spent about $2k that evening and we would have selected upgraded bottle service even if Z did not suggest the refund. This message is for Hakkasan management = we understand that Vegas nightlife is competitive but your agents should not resort to unethical and misleading practices to hit their quota.
