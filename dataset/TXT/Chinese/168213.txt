vMpJzMFst_9GP4boeqWIRg Reliable spot for Chinese food in North York. Doesn't hurt that they're located in Centerpoint Mall. We usually come here before or after visiting Fit4Less (lol). Their vegetable fried rice, turnip, duck, chow mein, congee, vegetable dishes are our go to. Love their hot sauce...the employees claim it's regular sriracha but it tastes different
