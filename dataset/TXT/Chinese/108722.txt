LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ The services always good, i guess we been here so many times the owner/manager know who we're. Always brought out the condiments the way we like it even before we asked. The food, sometime it's really really good, and then there are time it's too greasy! i guess it's depending on which chef was cooking when we're there? that's explained why i took back a star. But overall, it's a pretty good Cantonese restaurant, you can't get anymore Cantonese than Cantonese DVD Kareoke playing on all 4 flat screens!
