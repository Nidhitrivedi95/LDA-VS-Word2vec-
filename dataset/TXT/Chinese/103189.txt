kKCJvvktaKxZ5iFKv3lxuA I think for what they offer, the food is at a perfect price. I can easily eat here with a drink, for less than $10.

Some people may not like the fact that you have to fill up your own drinks and also get your own eating utensils. But the way I see it, that's a couple more dollars I save on a tip.

And that's the theme you'll notice when eating here, is their mission is to give you the best looking, high quality good at an affordable price. Keep doing what your doing Pei Wei!

Also, they just added sushi to their menu. I got 4 pieces the other week, and it was awesome!
