zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I had the chickpeas noodles, and it was quite expensive for what I was paying. The soup was a little too oily for my liking, although the crispy chickpeas did offer a refreshing crunch to the dish. The noodles were also cooked well, but the portion and overall experience did not justify the higher-than-usual-ramen price tag.

It's also quite busy here, but I would recommend trying to get a seat by the noodle bar since you are able to watch the chefs make the noodles!
