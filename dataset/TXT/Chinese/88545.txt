I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Every Asian I know has posted pics of this place...yes in Phoenix Arizona you can find some Asian delishness!  I've tried the green tea and the original flavor but love my strawberry shaved ice! I've stuck with my favorite Strawberry with Chocolate and Coconut Mochi Balls. Not two sweet and just the right amount of sauce and toppings.  All of my friends have gone at least twice, it's an addiction!  The staff has always been friendly.  I've been there during a weekday mid morning and at night, people kept coming in to try Snoh.   Some who know about this type of shaved ice or just curious foodies!
