AB6xAAxRRVS8tJgbW1aphw I've been coming here since they were connected to the Cedars and have always left satisfied.  China lobster is quality over quantity.  Great choices,  friendly service,  clean, just a solid Chinese restaurant experience whether you're buying the buffet or ordering.  Delivery is always quick enough and hot which is another great perk.  It's the best Chinese buffet in Lower Burrell easily.  

Edit: I always see people complaining about  the price,  but stop for one second and realize that there aren't many places that offer unlimited shrimp,  and large shrimp at that,  all combined in the price on a daily basis. They just added fried fantail shrimp and it is incredible.  Add in the salt and pepper shrimp which is again,  incredible, the chili shrimp etc.... And you have one awesome buffet for a really good price considering what you get.
