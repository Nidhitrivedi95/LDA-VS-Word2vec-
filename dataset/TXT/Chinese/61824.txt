DtVj3Onon58OKjjsLTCByQ Can't say much bad about my "goto" place for Chinese food. This food reminded me of my childhood days, and will probably keep me coming back. Fast service, hot, and tasty. 
My only tip is, don't order the lemon shrimp! It's 90% batter, with a measly piece of shrimp inside. Also, their 1 wedge of lemon for that entire selection was a joke.
