2UdoeXzcFg87O1VMCc3WGQ A good AYCE Asian restaurant has to have a few things going for it. There must be a very good selection of items from which to choose.  The service must be quick, the surroundings comfortable, and of course the pricing is key. 

Cynthia's Paradise has all of the elements down to an art. There is a pretty good sushi selection with a fair balance of protein to rice. Add a couple of dim sum treats, and finish off with a selection of mini deserts, and the range is great. 

Order off of the iPad without worrying about getting another order sheet or a working pen. The food arrives hot and relatively quickly. 

I liked pretty much everything I ordered. Items like the Chicken Wings were a bit drier and less tender than my reference joint, but not objectionable unless you're a total wing snob. 

I finished off with only one desert-a smooth custard that was so light and subtle that I immediately ordered 2 more. 

The only weird thing is the pricing model. It is a couple of dollars higher than the competition, but on the weekends (which apparently includes Friday) the lunch price is higher, and I don't know why.
