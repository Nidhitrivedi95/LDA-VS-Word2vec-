DcVdJBjHumhDI1AoSbmoNA Don't want to pay for parking or go all the way to Chinatown? I usually stop by Fu Kam Wah right next to Cote Vertu Metro station when I have a Chinese food craving.

My friend and I were in the mood for lobster. Surprising they had fresh lobster in the live tank. Was good sized and reasonable for off season at 27$.  Was very fresh as it came off the shell very easily (that's why they have a tank of live lobster).

We also ordered my fav, Cantonese Chow Mien.  Could had used a few more shrimp,  but great taste overall. Good amount of chicken, veggies and noodles.

The waiters also speak English well enough, but just make sure if you want a BIG portion of something (like shrimp that comes 6 an order for example).  Ask them how many shrimps it comes with, then just say "2 orders" instead of just saying "big order", which just confuses them.
