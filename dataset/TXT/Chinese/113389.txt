moMLPfZhhhmJpJYZHeManw I am trying to think of something positive to start my review off with, so I'll say it was super cheap, but that's all I can put in the "plus" column. This was hands-down the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I stopped for lunch, and had the lunch special of chicken with vegetables combo, which came with fried rice, egg drop soup, and an eggroll. First the soup came, and while it had lots of vegetables in it, it really tasted mostly like the can it came out of. The fried rice was fairly flavorless, but what little flavor there was wasn't pleasant. The chicken with mixed vegetables wasn't that bad, except that the brown sauce was extremely salty. My server was plenty attentive, filling my iced tea a couple of times, but she seemed very surly and I don't think she smiled once the whole time I was there. I gave her a big tip because the total of my bill was only $7.35, and I felt like a 20% tip would be such a pittance it would embarrass me. When I went to use the restroom, I saw what I thought were mouse droppings on the floor, but a closer look revealed them to be small dead bugs of some sort. Better, in my opinion, than mouse droppings for sure, but still not a welcome sight in a restaurant where I just ate. I'm sorry to say I won't be back, not because of the service but because of the poor quality of the food.
