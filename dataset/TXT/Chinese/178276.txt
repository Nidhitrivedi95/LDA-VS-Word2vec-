x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ This place is getting repetitive on my list for my husband. This is because the items here taste like Indo-Asian fusion and more importantly their sauces are awesome. On this visit, I noticed a rack full of sauces and noodles for sale with pretty ok price 3$.

However am not a fan for Indo Asian but yes their chilli chicken and fried rice are unbeatable. And for the crowd who feels this is a pricey place - try their HAPPY HOUR.
