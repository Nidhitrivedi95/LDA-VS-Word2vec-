9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw Ladies bathroom disgusting. Utensils and dishes given to us were pulled out from the dishwasher in midwash still covered in a film of oil and some food particles.  Asked the server to exchange them and came back with "new" utensils that were in the same condition.  Found a hair in my food.  Ok I'm Chinese and I know all the really good Chinese food places are not always the best in sanitation.  At least keep your damn dishes clean!  Customers notice this stuff and they'll start looking for more flaws.  So gross.  Never coming back.
