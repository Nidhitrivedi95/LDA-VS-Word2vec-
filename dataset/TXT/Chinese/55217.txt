What makes World Buffet special? For me, the Pho section. I am not an expert in Pho, but I was very proud of the soup I was able to create. The broth was tasteful and the combination of vegetables and herbs I was able to add made it even more flavorful and aromatic. The best thing is that you can add any vegetable or meat: chicken, seafood or beef, cook it in the grill and add it to your wonderful personalized soup.
