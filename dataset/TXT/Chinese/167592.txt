vHlF8VSkELv6nKz5W4GDnw So amazing! We haven't had an experience dining yet because we've done delivery.  Twice so far, and both times it's been so great!  The sushi is very good! I'm used to the sushi in the north east, so was very surprised how good it was!  Also had the hibachi and that too was great! Wish they had side sauces for the hibachi like other hibachi places. 

My one gripe is with our first delivery.... The delivery driver (lady) that delivered had her son in the car with her. Who appeared to be 3 maybe 4....   The kid hopped out of the car and came to the door with her.  It was definitely weird!!!!   Probably the owner and her son, if not that's a huge liability!!!    This is the reasoning why I didn't rate it 5 stars. 

However we will totally order again as this blows away other locations in the Cornelius, Huntersville area!
