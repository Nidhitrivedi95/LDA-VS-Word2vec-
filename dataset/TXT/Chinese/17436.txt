4sn2a0QzxTmAO3-mxi1s7g Went here this past weekend while visiting sun lakes.  Worst idea we had all trip.   The family that owns and runs it must work hard because they were all there and the place was busy.  The food is just not good.  We got Coconut Shrimp, Orange Chicken, Pork Fried Rice, and egg rolls.

Orange chicken is soggy and pork fried rice was gamy...  The pork was super overcooked and gross.  My brother and I both had half of a plate and called it good...  We were rummaging the cabinets an hour later but neither of us could stomach the idea of more of this gross food.
