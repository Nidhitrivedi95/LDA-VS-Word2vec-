_XmJ3Y-yGxG2BENWBnYWVQ The best chinese restaurant in AZ. The egg dropped soup remind me of my mom's soup when I was a child and sick. Waitress was attentive and friendly. A guy came in an ordered a complicated meal and the staff was very friendly and accommodating! I am coming back. You guys set up the bar high.
