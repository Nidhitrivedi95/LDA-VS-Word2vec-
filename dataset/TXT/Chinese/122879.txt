OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw (3.4 star) In Las Vegas when you think about dim sum you think about Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine, well Chang's and maybe 2 or 3 other places. It is a popular place for dim sum and has been around for years. Chang's was actually my first real dim sum experience, sure I've had the various dim sum items before but I never eaten in the "dim sum" environment where an old little Asian lady goes around pushing her cart offering food served from steamer containers until Chang's.

Nothing I've had wowed me to point of shouting "OH THIS IS THIS BEST THING EVER!" but majority of what I've had were delicious with some meh items. They have all of my favorites. You have to either like or dislike dim sum to eat at a dim sum place and I'm in the middle. I like eating dim sum items but don't like eating at time dim sum places. I'll eat or try almost everything they have to offer except the weird stuff. It's kind of hard to keep track of what you've eaten until the end because they'll come around fast with multiple carts and containers, they'll show you various items, and you just say that you want it or not. It's easy to get carried away. There will be containers on the table and you won't remember what they are, surprise.

Overall I don't think it's the best "dim sum" experience you can have in Vegas but I'll probably be back just for the food. It's spacious but can fill up, reasonably priced but can really add up if you want to eat a lot, clean but not so clean, it's old and does look like it needs work. They're friendly and fast but nothing out of the ordinary.
