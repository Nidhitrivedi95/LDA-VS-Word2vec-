On5sceeptZSlLeGWDDGiwQ This place is close to my office which is convenient.  I have eaten take out from here at least 10 times and have yet to be disappointing.  I don't expect a whole lot from a Asian take out place.  Consistent food quality, clean, and most important to me for judging Chinese food is a fresh cooked egg roll.  There is no reason to precook them and let them stew in their own grease.  I have yet to have an experience to not come back here.
