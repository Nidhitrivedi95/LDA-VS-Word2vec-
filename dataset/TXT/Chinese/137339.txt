This place is such a gimmick - hearts on the ceiling, hearts on the sushi, iPad menu, the whole sha-bang, but it doesn't deliver. Also costs an extra dollar or two compared to other places. And you pay another dollar for drinks and pop (not bottomless, either). You have to pay for the gimmicks, of course!

The desserts - don't be fooled by the nice images. They come in a shot glass and taste nasty.

I went for AYCE lunch. The salmon tasted off. Everything else tasted the same. Definitely not the best sushi I've had. The service isn't great either. We waited for 30 minutes to pay the bill. Could've just walked out and I doubt a soul would've noticed. 

Don't think I am coming back anytime soon.
