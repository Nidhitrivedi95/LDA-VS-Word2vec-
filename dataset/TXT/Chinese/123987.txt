ooFlFjIuGW8Lx0bxmvEZJg Very nice buffet. Huge assortment of dishes to choose from, with Sushi as well Hibachi. Waitress was great at keeping our glasses filled and removing finished plates. The price was very reasonable  (we went for lunch) and we will definitely return when we are back in this area.
