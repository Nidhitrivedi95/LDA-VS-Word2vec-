aqszoKRB4Ol9bpemt0_-GQ Soho Bistro is great Chinese food at a great price. I used to get take-out from here every couple of weeks when I worked uptown. I make it by there less frequently now, but I have been back a few times. It's worth the trip!

My favorite lunch special is the Cantonese rice noodles without the chicken and shrimp. It's spicy, and it seems healthy. I'm sure it's cooked in a lot of oil, but it's a healthier option that a lot of the quick lunch alternatives.

It can get crowded at Soho for lunch, so we usually ordered online or called in and went to pick it up. Parking can be kind of a pain in this area of uptown, so we usually took two people in the car and left one to wait while the other ran inside.

Another great reason for going to Soho if you're ordering with an office is that it's located pretty close to the PIta Pit and the uptown Fuel. We'd sometimes stop at all three to get something for everybody.

The prices are good, and the service is quick and friendly. I've never been let down by Soho.
