The dumplings were very tasty-- plenty of filling inside and a crispy exterior. My favorite were the pork and shrimp. They had a different flavor than the standard pork and chive, while the pork didn't overwhelm the shrimp. 

The buns were probably the highlight of our meal. We had the pork belly, bulgogi, and pulled pork buns. All had great flavors, sauces, and balance of tastes. The buns were perfectly soft but still held up well beneath the fillings. 

The worst part of the meal was the service. It seemed everyone in the restaurant had to wait at least an hour for their meal. I'd recommend this place for the merit of the food, but if you need a quicker meal, you probably want to go elsewhere until you have a long time to commit.
