YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g Honestly, unimpressed. Was looking forward to my first SuSur lee experience but it ended in a flop. I came here with a large group of co-workers so we had a set meal organized for us.

The dishes I tried were Lobster wonton, har gow, siu mai, mixed beans, fried scallop, fried mushrooms, beef short ribs, passionfruit mousse.

Dim sum wise, it was pretty bad. I get that it's an attempt to be fusion but it didn't fuse very well. Just the execution of the har gow and siu mai is worst than the standard dim sum restaurant in richmond hill. I don't blame it since I doubt they have an actually dim sum chef there and is probably a side item on their menu (i hope at least). Lobster wonton is good though so that is worth trying.

The rest was supposed to be family style. It's super small dishes. It's been 2 weeks since I was there and truthfully I don't remember anything special about them. I think the main theme that it's slightly different than the standard Canton dish but not in a way that improves it. 

The best was the passionfruit mousse (probably because it isn't a fusion attempt). Strong hit of the flavor with a really soft texture. Best part of the meal.

For people who don't eat Cantonese food (like daily), I can see the appeal, especially with the celebrity brand name. I would likely not go back and give the other restaurants a second thought.

P.S. the shirts that say "Great Food, Taste Food" or whatever is sorta cheesy for the restaurant like this.
