FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ Have been here for dim sum and it was good.  So we thought we would try dinner for a change.

Ordered the dinner for 2 which came with wonton soup, crab claws, lobster, lemon chicken, veggie noodle dish and dessert.  

The wonton soup was tasty with plump round shrimp and pork dumplings floating in a  clear broth with tiny bits of roast pork and fine slices of green onion.  

The crab claws were crispy and typical Chinese style crab claws often served at weddings.  

Lemon chicken was a nice sweet yet tart lemony sauce on lightly battered and fried breast meat.

Vegetable noodles was a fancy presentation of crispy noodles with an assortment of vegetables in a gloopy sauce that didn't taste like much of anything.  This was my least favourite dish.

The lobster was nicely steamed with garlic and green onion oil on top.  It came in two separate plates so we could each fight with it to our hearts content.

Dessert soup was a white fungus, red date, almonds, and lychee in a sweet broth.  It tastes vaguely Chinese herbal flavour so I assume it's good for you too....

We enjoyed ourselves and the service was attentive.  Absolutely no complaints and will be back!
