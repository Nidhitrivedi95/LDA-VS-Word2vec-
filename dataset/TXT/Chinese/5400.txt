0A4wL1DwQILnrRHE2Vd4xA Went there for the first time last night - Similar to other buffets in the area, but there's a wider selection of asian inspired foods like sushi and noodles. There is a wok/grill station where you can pick your own noodles, veggies, meat and sauce and have a chef cook it up for you on the spot.
In terms of desserts, I particularly liked their lemon pie and blue bubble gum flavored ice cream - 2 items I haven't encountered at other buffets in Montreal.

If you can fill up on sashimi, you may get your money's worth. It was 18.50$ on a Monday night, I believe the weekend prices go up to 25$ and children below a certain age eat free.
Watch out for coupons if you live on the south shore, I've often seen promotions like "2 can dine" for a set price in local flyers.
They no longer have a website so I would suggest calling them for prices or just walk in to see the food selection.
