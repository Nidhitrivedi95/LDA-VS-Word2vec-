EKnbQlntPX0FsgAC94XniA We ordered the original dagu rice noodle, it was a little bit pricey for the portion. Waited around 30 mins to get the noodle during not busy time, which was too long. 
Ordered the Watermelon juice and it was very good, refreshing and not over sweet at all. 

Will be back to try more flavors.
