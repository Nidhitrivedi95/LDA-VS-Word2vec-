mF2EW3twSrFPmT_RVV1-Qg Have been a long time happy customer of Hunan in Medina. In past they've been simply incredible but the new management team need some massive improvement to get them back to where they used to be.  There's a new guy that's supposedly the manager that follows the staff around looking for areas to correct their weaknesses instead of pitching in to help. I'm now waiting for my take out order placed over 40 minutes ago on way back from airport that was supposed to be ready in 15-20 minutes.  

I observed the manager reprimanding the very courteous hostess at the front counter saying she should quote at least 30 minutes for take out orders making it look like it was her fault.    They have a decent crowd but sushi bar was empty.   I'm really hoping the get back to where they were on the management team since they have usually been very good on putting together small orders in 15-20 minutes regardless of how busy they were. 


Edited portion - Once I arrived home and opened the sushi container, wasabi was nowhere to be found so adding to disappointment.
