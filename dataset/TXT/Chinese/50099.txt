Cdywb13_07M1_g3U85VKTA It's a near hour drive to Hong Kong Asian Diner, but after Chow Bella listed the deep fried duck with taro as one of the 100 Favorite Dishes I knew I had to give it a try.

WOW, just WOW. The duck is wrapped in mashed taro and the whole thing gets deep-fried. The duck is moist and savory, the taro is smooth and creamy, and the exterior that holds the whole thing together provides a satisfying crunch that is music to my ears and a textural experience for my palate. I ate it all. I could not resist.

I can't wait to go back. It is definitely worth the long drive. I will try new dishes, but those will be in addition to my deep fried duck with taro!
