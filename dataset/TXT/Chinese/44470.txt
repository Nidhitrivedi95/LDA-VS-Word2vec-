BJLjRP7HvIbdQOZc9UoVNA The food served at this chain is pretty consistent and has become standard to what I expect in chinese food. It is simply seasoned so the taste is comforting. Each main dish has a lot of value for the price. The only pricy items would be the small side dishes.
The fried rice is nicely coated with oil and not clumpy.
