1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I'll admit I'm biased since I'm walking distance to Seoul Plaza where this restaurant is located.

5-stars because the food's good with a wide variety of Chinese dishes, the prices cheap, the service friendly, and place clean (dining room, kitchen which is visible to diners, men's bathroom but I can't attest to the women's bathroom cleanliness).
