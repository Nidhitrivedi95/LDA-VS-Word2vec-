0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ I love this place and visit at least once a month for lunch or dinner with friends as its less than ten mins away from UTM. This place is the best for Hakka food. The owners are not Indian which means the food isn't filled with tandoori masala and actually tastes like a good fusion between Indian and Asian ingredients. If you wanna try it out I'd suggest trying their Lunch Special as its very reasonably priced and fulfilling. We usually order the chilli chicken, Bombay chicken, garlic chicken, and manchurian rice while specifying that the chicken be cooked extra crispy. That way the chicken isn't mushy by the end of the dinner and is still edible. Food is always piping hot and fresh and really hits the spot. Service is amazing. We go there so often the owner knows us by name and is such a sweet man. The other servers that are much younger are super nice as well and are very attentive. Highly recommend this over Eddies Wok n Roll considering you never have to wait ridiculous amounts of time and experience rushed service. For appetizers I'd highly recommend their chicken pakoras, taste amazing and it's not something you'll find at alot of restaurants.
