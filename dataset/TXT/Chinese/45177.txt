BPepHGskISjKJz4hfnumCw Dr. Peter Pavolotsky gets 4 stars, b/c he's so genuinely nice.

Wanted to update: If you feel antsy at not starting exactly at the scheduled time, you may want to approach your appt differently here.

Some sessions will take longer, b/c of the nature of the treatment.  It *may* go a bit overtime.  Nothing personal.  Just make sure that he knows that you're there (often we can't tell when someone's entered into the vicinity), so that he can begin to wrap things up.
