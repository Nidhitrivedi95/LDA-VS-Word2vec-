OVVXpKIC0OGYKvvS9eJXjg I went there mostly because it's ranked #2 on TripAdvisor's Edinburgh Restaurant list.  It's hard to believe for a Chinese restaurant to be that popular.  First, the ambiance with purple recess lighting is excellent.  It's definitely different from the red and gold decoration typical of a Chinese restaurant.

For starter, I had the delicious salty and spicy soft shell crab.  This is better than the usual salt and pepper prawns.  Its crunchiness is just right and the scallions complement the chilli nicely.  For the main course, I chose the beef filet cantonese style.  I prefer it drier, but the flavor is just right... not too sweet, not too tangy.

One star less for being on the pricey side.  I still can't consider it being fine dining even with the great ambiance and all.  And the service feels just average.  All and all, it's definitely on my list of favorites.
