dblGQtHAzNy1ACis1m2shw We went here and order: general tso chicken nice balance of sweet and spicy, Hunan beef spicy and full of flavor, beef lo mein plenty of beef and noodles, egg rolls were crispy and not dried out cabbage like most places, fried shrimp perfectly cooked not dried out, mushu pork most authentic ones I've had since leave California over 20 years ago! So far this has been our big favorite of all the Chinese food places we've been to! Yes its americanized but no disrespect to other who like real Chinese food out of China but I've been to those places and wasn't impressed or like it much so I'll keep my americanized versions!!!
