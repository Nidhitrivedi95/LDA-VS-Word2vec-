MeEvtL0DA11Vla25vix_0A I would have, at least, given this restaurant a 3 stars if the woman (the manager) who is serving us tonight a little more friendly.   When your customer is asking you for an advice on the portion size of a dessert item, please be kind enough to let your customer know even though you have no idea.  Responding something like "how can I count how many pieces for you" is absolutely mean and unhelpful.  Besides, who asked her to count???

The food here is ok.  I tried this place the first time during lunch hour, I like the food.  We come back a group of 8 persons for dinner tonight.  I wonder if I wanna come back again because of this manager's attitude.  There are so many better places in the area in terms of food and service.
