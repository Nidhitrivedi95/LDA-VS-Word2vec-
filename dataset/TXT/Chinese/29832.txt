Good range from authentic Chinese food to fusion style, so there is wide selection. Wait time is a bit on the long side, and like most Chinese restaurant, they will bring out your order one by one as soon as they are done rather than all at once. If a group is ok with sharing/waiting then it's not a big deal. 

TV always plays some sort of Hong Kong pop, annoying if that's not your thing.
