_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Sooooo good. To quote my husband, "I think I've eaten and gone to heaven" 

Seems a little dramatic. This place is great for families. Every table is round. Bring your mom, dad, kids, sister, brother, cousins, aunt and uncle. Bring your friends. Tell your friends. 

Ok now enough of my ranting.. onto me telling you all about the good food. We did the set 4 lobster and crab with the other fixings. So good. Canto style with good wok hey? Check. Fresh seafood with plenty of meat? Check. Did we see the raw moving creatures pre-cooking? Check. Did the kids enjoy eating the food even though they aren't adventurous? Check. 

I'll let the picture tell the story.
