CY3N_T_35gqOXkwQbSeSTA Decent cheap eat.  This joint has been around the neighbourhood since forever, and I'm glad they never opt for "trendy look" and jack up the price like many other places.  Although the price has increased gradually but it's still cheap as hell comparing to restaurants nearby.  It's definitively a good place for Cantonese comfort food.  I always buy 2 items with rice to go on my way home, generous portion costs only $6+ tax.  I particularly love roasted pork here, always crispy and tender.  Roasted duck is good but tends to be leaner and smaller than other places.  They also offer roasted goose during the summer but I wouldn't recommend it because they tend to be on the dry side.  Also a free soup if dining there.  I think they are cash only place which is fine with me.
