UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ Today was my first visit. I needed a quick lunch to go, and Thai food always hits the spot! I ordered the tofu pad Thai lunch special. It came with soup and an egg roll. Very generous portion especially for the price! It was piping hot and worth the 10 minute wait. Call ahead if you're in a hurry!
