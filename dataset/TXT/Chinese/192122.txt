yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw Pretty average food. We ordered pick up and the prices are great. The lunch specials offer a lot of food and the main menu dishes are large as well. I had the Mongolian beef and the sesame chicken. Both were fine but I would be more likely to order the chicken again. We warned. The lunch special comes with rice and noodles and they are just that. Noodles. They were fine but really, nothing special.
