The interior design is Asian inspired with the wooden chairs and tables. Be sure to make reservations for a big group because it's packed during lunch. The service was mediocre, good thing the standard for the food was much higher.

Ordered noodles both times because noodles are definitely preferred over rice dishes. The first time there was definitely leftovers that had to be brought home. Even the family agreed that the crystal pork was amazing. The noodles on the other hand were plain with a lot of bean sprouts. The pork was the star and saved the noodles. The spicy beef noodle was great. The beef was tender, the soup had just enough spice and the noodles had the perfect texture, just the right amount of bite. Combined together it's something definitely worth ordering again. The portions are on the bigger side but that matches the cost.

Don't forget the fortune cookie on the way out. Overall, will definitely be back again for lunch.
