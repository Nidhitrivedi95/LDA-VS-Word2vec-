IHt79wxZHkD7QSzlDRDivw This is our go-to place for Roast pork & roast duck, both are soooo delicious! We patronize this place every few months or so, because the roast pork is so good, it's like an addiction we can't get rid of! 

I have tried many many Chinese BBQ all over Asia, some were sold in incredibly cheap stalls, and others in very expensive hotels, and I can definitely say that the chef here is a real master at roasting whole pig. The skin is so delicious & crispy, while the meat is juicy and tender. 

However don't just take my word for it, you can even read it directly from the experts because Mr. Wong was featured in a gourmet magazine article by Francis Lam back in 2009 entitled "The Last Chinese BBQ"

Additionally, the proprietress who is handling the cashier is always so friendly with us every time we come - she remembers everybody's faces! She is always so cheery when we drop by. 

Lastly, this place has such a steady following that even we are starting to remember a few of their regular clients- something which has never happened to us before. So if you're a fan of roast pork, this is definitely the place to be!
