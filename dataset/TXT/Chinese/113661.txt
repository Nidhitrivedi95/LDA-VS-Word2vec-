mQCT1psNh2pJT38ohSQDHA The wait was long and there were about 6 families total in the restaurant. The food was just ok. The egg roll taste as if it was frozen from the box. So did the General Tso chicken.  Fried rice taste like brown rice with green onions in it. We will go back on more time to try the hibachi grill to see if that will be better
