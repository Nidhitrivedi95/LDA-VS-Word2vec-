IdVoDto0eqtzzH5B4bpvsA 3.5 Not bad. Came on a weekday so there was only a few people in the restaurant. I liked the modern decor of this quaint HK cafe. 
  
- High tea menu portions are smaller but are a bit cheaper. The original menu is quite limited to begin with
- Pork chop with fries - Pork chop was a tad dry but I got over it because i loved how crispy the pork chop and fries was. 
- Club sandwich - Good but average. Decent portion for this 
- Cubed toast - also good but average tasting. It was little bit too oily for me 

Each dish came with a drink and we got one hot and one cold HK milk tea which was standard tasting. No wow factor.

Service was great as it was not busy. Poor location and little parking available.
