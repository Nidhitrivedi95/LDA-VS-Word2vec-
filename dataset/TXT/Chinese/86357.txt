HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA From what I had heard, Fat Chow had some of the best Chinese food in Vegas. So, of course, it was here that I had one of the better cheeseburgers I have ever had. Only makes sense, right?

We ordered the pot stickers as an appetizer and they were delicious. I thought my wife and I were going to have to arm wrestle for the last one. Being the saint she is, she cut it in half. 

It was the Fat Choy burger that held me in suspended animation. This is just one really sublime burger! The meat was of primo quality. It was cooked to perfection. And all of the ingredients (fried egg, bacon, special sauce, cheese, lettuce) just flat worked. 

The atmosphere, while spartan and small, was really cool. It is like a diamond in the rough. The casino was not much to look at. I think you would need to fall in the degenerate class of slot player to call this place home. No offense, I consider myself a degenerate in most categories. I'm just saying I would not have been surprised to see Nicolas Cage drinking vodka by the gallon at the bar.

The service was excellent.

Smiley face (star for the burger).
