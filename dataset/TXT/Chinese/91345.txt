IjNwvrCE3RWpI4bllEcJWA We went for dinner.  A chop stick had leftover food from the last customer, we exchanged one from the next table.

Ordered soup for first course.  The bowl was full so we did not see inside the bowl.  After we drank some, we discovered the whole edge of the bowl had dried seaweed from the last serving.  DISGUSTING.

We read the dine safe for the Toronto web site before we went.  The restaurant had been given a conditional pass before, but recently had passed.  Even so they are still dirty.

Never eat there again.
