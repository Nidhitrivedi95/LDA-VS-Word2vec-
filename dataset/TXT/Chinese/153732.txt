We were actually the only people dining in here, so you'd think the service would have been top notch, but take out orders were all over the place. It's obvious the area likes this place for Chinese takeout, but there aren't a lot of options. The potstickers were really good, but the entrees were a little lackluster. I expected more flavor. It's good for a quick fix, but I'll drive the 20 minutes to our favorite place next time.
