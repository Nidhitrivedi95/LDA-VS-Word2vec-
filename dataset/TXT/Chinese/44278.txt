BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg Me and my two other friends went in for a quick lunch and I was pleasantly surprised by the food there. I am a spicy food fanatic. We ordered pig intestine casserole, stir fried kang choy, and fish with tofu. The pig intestines were covered with dried pepper and chili oil, and it was just the right amount of spicy. Yum... The fish was very tender and tasty. One complaint is that the dishes overall were on the greasy and salty side. Aside from that I'd recommend it to spicy food lovers! We each spent 15 bucks or so for three dishes to share. The service could be faster.
