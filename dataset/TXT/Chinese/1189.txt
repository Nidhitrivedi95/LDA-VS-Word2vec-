-juOL0eJC6kvf5RLEjoPvA I don't know...I feel like all dim sum places in Montreal taste the same, including this one. Must be just me, though I am no dim sum expert. Anyhow, this one seemed decent. Ate here with my bf and his mother and the experience was interesting. We decided to share a table with 2 other groups because we were just starving from waiting. It was extremely busy at the time we came, and we just wanted to eat.
The hostess accepted our request and put us at a large table with 4 other people. She was very pleasant.

Now onto the food! The har gow was not heavily stuffed with shrimp, rather it was smaller in size. I noticed that some dim sum places make extremely large har gow...too much shrimp like it's overkill. The flat shrimp pancake rolls were slightly on the dry end, and this happens to be my favorite dish. Bummer. 

Overall the food was decent, service was ok except they messed up the bill making us pay 15 dollars more than we should have. Thank goodness my bf and his mother rechecked the bill!

Come here for dim sum if you're in the brossard neighborhood, it's fair priced and acceptable. Also the establishment holds a  lot of people, so it is quite spacious.
