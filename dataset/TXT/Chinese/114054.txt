MSYpFcm5FAkQYLcY6tkOgw Had to update my original rating. Yesterday I placed my order for delivery as usual. One of the items I always get is the Kung Pao Shrimp with bean sprouts. The online receipt came to $17.35, I paid the driver $20.35, then I notice on the receipt on the bag it says $19.43. They charged me an extra dollar for the bean sprouts and another dollar for delivery.. That means I tipped the driver .92 cents!! Don't know if it's a new owner or manager, but I've been coming here for years and never disappointed until now. At least call and say here is a price difference and ask if I still would like the order. So I change my "never disappointed" to "sadly disappointed".
