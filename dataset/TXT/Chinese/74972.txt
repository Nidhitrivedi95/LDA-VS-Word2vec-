-Taiwan Beef Noodle
-Onion Pancake
-Shredded Chicken Rice

I'm a big of Taiwanese Beef Noodle and whenever I am in Taipei, I make it a point to try as many different places as I can. What I thought was cool was that there is a picture of a beef noodle shop above the kitchen that dates back many years. It looks like the old part of Taipei where there are a row of beef noodle restaurants next to eachother. My all-time favorite is the now closed Ay-Chung. The broth is not too bad, but the use of raw Napa cabbage is a little unusual. It is probably the "fusion" part to appeat to Western tastes? The normal vegetable used (I forget name) is a cooked broad-leafed one. Another reviewer noted they had alot of tendon. My beef didn't have any tendon, but not as tender as I would have liked. Also missing is the preserved vegetable that is always included with this noodle.

Onion pancake was tasty but on the thin side.Also the use of butter is not in the Chinese recipe and again, is probably used to appeal to Western tastes.

The Shredded Chicken fried rice was very flavorful.

Didn't try the dum-sum since it didn't look too appealing and I doubt it would taste better than our favorite places in Vancouver, BC (we feel that Vancouver has some of the best dim-sum in Western North America). Vancouver is a place we frequent often.

We were happy with the service and the waiter was very courteous and spoke Chinese to us. Glad we didn't order the tea as one reviewer noted that it is $4.99 a pot which is ridiculous.

I would sum up this place as, "150% more money for 75% of the portion size for a comparable Spring Mtn/Chinatown restaurant." We would definitely go back since it is just "around the corner" for those lazy days when we don't want to drive down to Spring Mtn. Glad to have this place in Summerlin.
