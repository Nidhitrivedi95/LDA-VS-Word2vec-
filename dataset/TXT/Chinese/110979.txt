M-4dNFcnRJ0_hI357OLGhg I was there for the Dim Sum brunch.  Very good.  Pittsburgh is not New York, so the select is not that big, compared to those city.  The crab soup was very good and service was great.  Here is the menu for the brunch (https://sites.google.com/site/goldenpalaceinpittsburgh/dim-sum).  For the 4 of us, cost with tip was $16.00
