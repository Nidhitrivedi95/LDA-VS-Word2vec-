H2RgkjPs3W-CxbyygCJJew I don't know where the negative reviews are coming from, but this place is great. I am suspecting it is from the competitors.     There are four other sushi places in the area, so one would think there is no need for another one, but i am really glad this place opened up.  They serve delicious food, have really nice staff  and very reasonable prices.  I have been here numerous times, and everyone I took here loves the place.  The food is that good.  The vibe is different from the other two popular spots, really peaceful.    They also offer Chinese dishes, the few items I tried, I liked them.  I am hooked on their rolls and the raw salmon. .  Their nigiri was great for the dishes I've tried.  Their lunch specials are super and you have to appreciate the happy hour special.
I highly recommend them.  Try them, you won't be sorry.
