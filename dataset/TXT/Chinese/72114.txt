FEWTPBUv-QiugBe-2uXD4A The last few times we ordered the food has been on the sweeeeeeet side. We like more savory/spicy rather than the sweet style chinese food. I doubt we will be ordering this again :(
Ordered the General Tso's chicken (very spicy) it had a little kick but more on the sweet side. The Chicken delight was very sweet and had a lot of chicken (good for you meat lovers) we wanted more of the vegetables. I guess I should have specified less meat more veggies. The singapore noodles were ok. The fried eggrolls were very good.
