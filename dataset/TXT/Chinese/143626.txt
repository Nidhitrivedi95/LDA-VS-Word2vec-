ropJyZdmv6NeDU2Vz1I_Hg I have been coming to this place for years and absolutely love it.  I have introduced several people here and they love it too.

I know the description says this place is not good for kids, but I see kids in here all the time.  If you have rowdy kids that don't listen, then this is not the place.  I take my niece (6)  and nephew (10) here often and they do just fine.  They are well mannered though.  You will need to ask for forks if your children cannot eat from chopsticks.

When I first started coming here, it was around $17-$20 for two people to eat Dim Sum and get quite a bit of food.  I've noticed recently that he portions are smaller and the prices went up, but the food is still great.  They serve Dim Sum every day from 10am to 3pm.  I like to get there around Noon as the food is still fresh.  If you get there closer to 3, the food is still great, but just not as fresh.  Also, this place has the best calamari I've ever had.  It's never chewy and the seasoning is wonderful!

Golden Buddha is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and there are a lot of neat shops to check out while you are there.  They also have a beautiful garden around back.  You can go back here, get some knowledge from the plaques and enjoy the serenity.  (if you can block out the traffic off of the main street, I've blocked it out long ago)

I definately recommend trying Golden Buddha.
