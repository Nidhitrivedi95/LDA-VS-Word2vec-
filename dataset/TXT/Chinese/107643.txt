LbeJgPgKKHw5qH0f02NHEQ I want you all to know one thing, that this place, by far, has the best eggrolls you will ever eat in your entire life.

I have lived in Pitt, NYC, Cleveland, and now DC....no where comes close.  Chinatown Inn's eggrolls are out of this world.  While their normal food is also very good, their eggrolls and fried rice are all I really order when I am in town.

I always make it a point to get some before my trip back, and my family still goes to this place after all these years.  It's amazing, and you all need to recognize greatness when you experience it.

Eggrolls.
Amazing.
