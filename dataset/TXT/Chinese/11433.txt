2gI7dlktBQXPZiuOW-HWvw I tried it because I did not want Panda Express, plus I was wanting some California Rolls!

It is nice, simple and clean inside. Just another regular size fast food eating area.
I ordered the Broccoli with Brown Sauce, which is like Broccoli Beef without the Beef. It came with one side, so I chose Fried Rice. I believe your only options are fried rice and chow mein. If you get two entrees you get two sides. The 8 pieces of California Rolls were fine, they don't seem to be freshly made though. All that for $10.26!
This place is not that bad nor is it all that great! The broccoli was nice and crispy and the sauce was good, so the combination was nice and delectable. I was craving it and I was not disappointed! I typically stick to what I like and will not steer too far from what I know and like. The next time I will try the chow mein, I guess.
