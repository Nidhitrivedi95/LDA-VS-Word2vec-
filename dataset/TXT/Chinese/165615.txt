v2a8hI1Tsi1SgFKFWD39qQ Love this place! New spot in the area serving Chinese and Japanese food to surrounding areas. It's all take out. Everything is made by order and was fast! The Japanese entrees are similar to ones you would see at many other places. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get in one order. I will definitely be coming back here!
