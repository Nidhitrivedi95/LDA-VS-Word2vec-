uLzgiSqVg5Pr93VVXSdOlg Excellent noodle soup! However the beef tended to have a lot of fat on it and was chewy (not tender) which was disappointing and unexpected based on previous reviews. The flavor of the broth and the fresh noodles however were stellar. We sat at the small bar when you walk in so we could watch them make the noodles to order which was a nice treat. Two of us got the large soup and split it which was still a lot for two people.  If we return, we will probably split the medium instead...
