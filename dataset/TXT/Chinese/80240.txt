GoXOq5SegVlAfaTwtDGTVQ Whenever I want real tasty and fresh Chinese food, we always come here to eat. It's always fresh and delicious! We always order the same dishes, chicken with noodles and vegetables, beef and Chinese broccoli, general Tao, Singapore style noodles and the wonton soup. We try to avoid going there between 6:30pm and 7:30 pm, the place is always full.
