wfWcE4K7vQX1Fjao9Q-12Q This place would get 0 stars if it wasnt for the good food, but the sushi chef is not very nice at all. We would frequent this place 2x/week minimum for a couple months. We would order the same things every time, it was a LITTLE different then what the menu stated i.e. we would get the singapore noodle and make it a combination and no bell peppers....not that big of a deal right?

Well one day we ordered the usual, and the sushi chef just SNAPPED. Started yelling at us and it was just insane, i know it sounds like its a story, but its a TRUE story. Amazing....i used to take care of the chef so well $$$ wise, and for him to call us out saying we are a pain in the rear and how we disrespect the menu by adding and changing our own things, it was just ludicrous. 

I really like the who's your daddy roll though and singapore, and the sweet n sour chicken....but its not worth going there having to deal with the DK whad behind the counter.
