IFXL6wMLBgBSGSiLBjtViA I have been to this place 3 or 4 times and have never left disappointed. 
The meat is quite good, yet it's the veggies that steal the glory at celebrity.
The staff are efficient, and the manager (I think his name is Dat) is is super friendly and very kind.
Like the other reviews, I am annoyed by a tip being put on the bill preemptively, but I imagine that it is required based on the amount of effort and the turnover rates and crowd which is why it didn't cost them a star.
