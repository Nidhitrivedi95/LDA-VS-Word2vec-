_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA I ordered the Dan Dan noodles which I've never tried before. It was slightly sour? Not sure if that's supposed to be a thing. It wasn't for me, but after a night of drunk gambling, I must admit I ate the whole thing. The noodles were nice, not over cooked, just not a fan of the dish I suppose. We were seated fairly fast, and were in and out within 40 minutes.
