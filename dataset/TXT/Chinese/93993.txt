jCg6MSfu3fgXxO2QrpDV7w The location is clean and easy to find.  Being Sunday dinner it wasnt that busy. First time eatting here and i was actually very surprised. We ordered 2 rolls that were fresh and really flavorful.   We ordered dumplings but nothing special. pass on that next time.  noddles and rice were good....other reviews compared fried rice to mexican rice. I actually like thia rice....nothing like mexican rice.  all the entrees were delicious fresh and tasteful. mongolian beef , general tso chicken and garlic chicken were great! be back again
