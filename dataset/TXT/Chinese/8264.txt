1czIVv2iyOHc3WMgtUWXCQ Out of towner and used an app to search asian nearby restaurants... walked in, had great service right off the bat. Quick order to table service, unbelievable crab rangoons and egg rolls. Best lo mein noodles I have ever had! The servers work real hard and were quick on refills and attentive to the table. Place has a really nice feel to it inside, very comforting and quaint.
