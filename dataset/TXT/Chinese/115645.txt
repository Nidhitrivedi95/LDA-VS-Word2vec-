N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ The food here is absolutely delicious, I don't know how anyone could give it a bad rating. The jerk chicken is consistently tasty, tender and juicy. The pineapple burger is unique and bursts with flavour. Those were the two stand-outs for me but honestly everything here is yummy. I like the low-key ambience as well. Thumbs up!
