PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg If I could come here for fried rice every day... I would. I've been in a few times to eat and to take out (phone orders and in person) and the staff is always courteous and helpful. Food comes out hot and fast (hence the name quick chinese). 
I haven't had a whole lot on their menu yet but the priced are great and the portions are big. Aside from the good food, it's nice to be greeted with a warm welcome and even recognized after only being in a few times.
