yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA THANK YOU, VEGAS, FOR HAVING A 24/7 PHO RESTAURANT. My miserable, hungover soul is so grateful.

I rode the struggle bus (Lyft) here on a Saturday night around 10pm after suffering from a dreadful day club hangover. I found my cure in the wonton egg noodle soup and the fresh young coconut. (I know, I know. Who orders wonton soup at a pho restaurant?) But the egg noodle soup was surprisingly pretty good! Coming from San Francisco and one of the largest Chinatowns in the country, I can definitely say that I've had better, but for what it was, it hit the spot. I was craving a lighter soup than beef-based pho broth anyway. 

But the light at the end of the hangover tunnel was the fresh young coconut. SOO GOOD AND SO REFRESHING. Comes served in a coconut, and they give you a spoon so you can scrape off the pulp inside to eat. I felt like a brand new woman afterwards! Okay, not really, my head still hurt, but the coconut/soup really did help.

Service was friendly and made sure our water cups were filled. I look forward to curing future hangovers here.
