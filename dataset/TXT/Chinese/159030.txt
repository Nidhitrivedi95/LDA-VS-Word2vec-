u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ Took us three trips to Vegas Chinatown to finally hit on good Chinese comfort food. 

BTW,  if you're a 'gringo,' ask what's good on the other menu. That's where you'll find the braised pork belly, salted fish pork or frog legs, etc. 

Our waitress Linnie was down to earth and gave us good recos on what's good and what's not so good.
