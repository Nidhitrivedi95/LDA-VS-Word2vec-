OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Very tasty dim sum!  Good service but like all crowded dim sum floors, you have to be patient and wait for the cart to come your way.  If you're extremely hungry, be mindful of any drool dripping out of your mouth while you stare at the carts slowly make their way towards you.  When the time finally comes when the cart that you've been staring at is parked at your table, load up on your favorite items since you don't know how long it'll take to come back around.  Another thing to highlight is that the waiters kept my water and tea jar topped off so that was a big plus.

This is located not too far from the strip so whenever you find yourself in Vegas and craving some solid dim sum, this is a great go-to spot.
