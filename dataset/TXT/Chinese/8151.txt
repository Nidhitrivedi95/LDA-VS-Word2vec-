1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w I called to place ONE single to go order for myself right at 11 which is right when they open- she told me that the food was going to be ready at 1145-1150?? I'm sure right at opening it's not that busy that I have to wait almost a whole hour for a single lunch entree? Typically you never wait that long at restaurants to receive your food- there are many other places to go around the area that will serve you much faster!!! So I went elsewhere-
Just note if you want lunch it's going to take a hour 
This isn't the first time it happened to me
