I-4CIMvJy_M7U4EuCijxZw This used to be my favourite place to order from as I live just down the street! I haven't ordered it in a while due to health reasons! I decided to have a cheat day today and order and was very disappointed! The food was hot but I asked for noodles with my meal instead of rice and they have always accommodated before for an extra charge. The charge hasn't changed but the quality of the food did. They literally sent me boiled noodles with no flavour or sauce. They put the sauce on my chicken balls not on the side and didn't sent any cutlery! 
I gave one star for the food being hot and one for the nice delivery guy... I'll never order from here again--- I'd rather spend an extra few dollars and go anywhere else!
