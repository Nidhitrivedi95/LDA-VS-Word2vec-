LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ Came here at lunch time with family on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty (though I hear that it's super packed at night).  Lunch time prices are around half of dinner prices.  

Food was great given the price, ranging from $5 -$14 for entrees.  Service was fast, generally.  You could tell that food was cooked fast here--quality a bit compromised (bok choy and fried squid were a bit salty and the roasted duck was a bit dry), but for lunch time prices, I wouldn't complain too much.  Chow fun and fried flounder were excellent!

For a quick, cheap, yet delicious sit-down lunch time dining experience near Chinatown, this place is a good, safe choice.
