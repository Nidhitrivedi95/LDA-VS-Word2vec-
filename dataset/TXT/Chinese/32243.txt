9WAnQD1nj1j3zLZ7ONtvfQ - Toro sashimi was SOO yummy but very expensive (expected)
- Tuna tataki was ok but we weren't a fan of the ground peanut on top or the dipping sauce.
- Uni nigiri was average. Nori (seaweed) was a little too chewy for my man's liking.
- Palm's roll is highly recommended. Rice can be too filling sometimes so this was perfect. No rice, lots of seafood (salmon, yellowtail, spicy tuna, and snow crab), avocado, and sprouts wrapped in cucumber. Different and refreshing.

Nice decor but the music was a little weird and didn't really help to kick off the night (our drinks helped a little though). Music was not romantic, fun, nor something you can dance to. Interior was a little too dark. Service was great. Food was just ok overall. DO try the Palm's Roll if you come here though.

Looks ideal for large groups because I noticed they have many large booths that can easily seat a group of 10.
