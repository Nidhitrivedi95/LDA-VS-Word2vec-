g6yfH6oH4B6KxmM6BGB5qQ Is the name for real? What was the owner thinking? You just have to get over the interesting name and the bright yellow/ green signage. Pure tackiness! But once inside you are greeted by a friendly staff and comfortable seating. And this place is relatively clean! Maybe coz its new? 
Now, I have to comment on their menu. We sat down and were presented with a stack of different menus. They try to do it all here: HK baked dishes, home cooking dishes, bubble tea, ramen, congee, BBQ, sizzling plates,etc,etc. It took us 15-20 min to pour over the menus and decide. Ordered steak and lobster platter ($25) and their signature lemongrass pan fried pork chop with rice ($7-8).
