U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Food was pretty blah. Had to add plenty of hot sauce and even soy sauce for flavor. I had the brisket noodle soup and I would say most of the meat was fat so only about half of it was edible. They could have taken a little more fat off before cooking it. And that was the dish the waiter recommended. I also ordered a drink that was just ok. Would not recommend.
