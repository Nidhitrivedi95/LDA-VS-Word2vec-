AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA My vegan friend introduced me to this restaurant knowing I'm a meat eater. I was very intrigued by how a vegan restaurant can use tofu based ingredients that would end up tasting like meat.
 
We ordered the spicy crispy eggplant, kung pao "chicken", house pan fried noodle, vegan roasted "pork" and the curry "chicken" and DAYUMMMMNNN everything tasted pretty good! 

The dishes we ordered that had "chicken" in it seriously tasted like real chicken!! As a meat eater, I had to remind myself that I was at a Chinese vegan restaurant! 

The house pan fried noodle had "shrimp" in and it looked and tasted almost like shrimp! 

I was disappointed at the roasted "pork" dish. The coloring was a little off from the real roast pork that I've had my entire life. It also didn't taste like pork. It tasted more like cooked dried bean curd. When I added the plum sauce to it, it tasted a little more like "pork" but it wasn't the same.

This restaurant is definitely an awesome hidden gem in Las Vegas! I highly recommend coming here when you are in the area!

Free parking in their lot and free wifi is a plus!
