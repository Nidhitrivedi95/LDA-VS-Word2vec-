Z4CA7jEArUT_D-1ZM4Bh1Q A year ago I'd have given them at least four stars.  The ambiance was great, cool decor, food was tasty and reasonable, service was friendly, and the beer selection was really good.  However, I've kinda given up on this place.  For the past YEAR, they've been saying that their kitchen would be open "soon."  For a good month, probably 6 weeks now, they've had a sign up outside that says their kitchen will be open "Really Soon."  Well... a year ain't "soon" folks.  Many times I drove up from old town Scottsdale to go enjoy a few beverages and a good meal there.  But as I said, I've given up on this place.  Not quite sure how they're staying afloat anymore.
