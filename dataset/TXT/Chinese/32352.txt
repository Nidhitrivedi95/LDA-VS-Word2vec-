9xPK9u_AGM1sxoG2CU9psA Had a few meals at this place, price and quality have been consistent and never disappointed.  The staff is always super nice and when i order party platters they deliver for free.  Their wings are pretty tasty and they don't skimp out on the seafood in their seafood noodle dish. The platters are always packed full and arrive hot.  My only complaint is they always give too much packets of soya sauce (brown bag full).  Not needed as the food has enough flavor.
