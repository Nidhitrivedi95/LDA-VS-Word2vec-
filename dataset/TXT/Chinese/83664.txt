HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ Randomly checked this place out as a pre-workout snack.  Prob the worst sushi I've had in Charlotte, but at least it was cheap ($7.99 lunch special for two basic rolls).  Now granted, I didn't get any of their specialty rolls - but it was the fish that didn't taste that good.  It didn't look that good either (I sat at the sushi bar).

Now don't get me wrong, this place wasn't terrible or nasty - but I won't go back.
