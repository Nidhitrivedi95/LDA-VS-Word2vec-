WbQOuI7mVST8XrJotWq9fA This was one of the worst eating experiences in Toronto. I ordered the Roast Pork and Duck and the Steamed Chinese vegetables in oyster sauce.

What I got was microwaved roast pork and duck which was still cold and veggies which were well steamed but tasteless. They forgot the oyster sauce
