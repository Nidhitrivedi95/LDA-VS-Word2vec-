ZlrHrg7jrbO6blqwfa0MkQ We were searching for a nice Chinese food restaurant where we could sit down and eat (PF Chang's doesn't count), and were pleasantly surprised by Baoding.  The restaurant has a nice and calming ambiance/decor.  The servers are very attentive and pleasant as well.  

We got the pan fried chicken dumplings for an appetizer.  They were good quality, but kind of boring tasting.  For the entree, we got plane lo mien noodles and General Tso's chicken.  The lo mein noodles were great, and the chicken was even better.  The chicken was extremely tender and crispy, not chewy and weird like at some Chinese food places.  And, for some reason, I didn't feel horrible after eating it....so that's a nice surprise.

We definitely look forward to coming back here again for a nice relaxing dinner.
