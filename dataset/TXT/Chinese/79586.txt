gjiAHOjw2hQPMkFiHlFVvg What to expect: noodle dishes and some cold Chinese side dishes. Everything here is spicy, but you can ask them to make it mild. I got the spicy wontons, the texture of the wonton wrapper itself was nice, but everything else was lacklustre. The actual chilli oil tasted very peppery, almost unpleasantly so. The pickled vegetables that they put in the sauce/oil was nice though. I also got to try some of my friend's cold chicken dish. I wasn't a fan but if you like cold chicken that tastes like Asian beef jerky then give it a shot. 

Prices were reasonable though, but the portions aren't particularly huge. I wouldn't recommend coming here since there's so many food options nearby. It's also not particularly easy to find. Definitely not worth the trouble of looking specifically for this shop, there's plenty of other noodle options you can try instead. 

FYI, they only accept cash and Interac.
