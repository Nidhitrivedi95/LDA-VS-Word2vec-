rBBAD_fHaYnqWC_APHO2SQ My boyfriend and I have given Go Go China several times to succeed and they have failed everytime.The people who take the order over the telephone are rude and never give you time to feel like they want you as a customer. They will make you feel like an idiot and rushed. At the end of my order they didn't repeat the order to me, who knows what I am going to get but also I have no idea how much I am going to pay.Also, last time we ordered from there, they gave us no sweet and sour sauce. When we called and nicely asked if they could please bring us some sauce they accused us of lying and that we had gotten sauce but wanted more.I avoid confrontation at all costs but am sick of this place. There food is ok, but not worth the rudeness from the workers. I quit!
