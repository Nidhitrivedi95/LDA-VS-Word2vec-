8lPxiYChdJdTV24NJvOB3Q Just tried Big Beef Bowl for the first time and was really impressed! The food and service was excellent. I especially enjoyed the variety of skewers and the Classic Beef Noodles with the thin round noodles. The bench chairs were a bit unstable so be careful sitting down. Overall it was a great meal and would recommend it!
