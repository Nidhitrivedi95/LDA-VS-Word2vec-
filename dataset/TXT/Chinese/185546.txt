y166Ve7c7y2EnnePytr71Q My friends and I were in Toronto this past September and heard soooo much about the Ramen so we came here. We were seated immediately in the front of the store, it looked tiny but it stretches back pretty far and there are more tables in the back! We all don't eat pork so we ordered the vegetarian ramen with tofu. DELICIOUS is the only way to describe it. The portions are huge and this was probably the best broth I've ever had. Very flavorful and rich. I was especially amazed with the tofu.. it had the texture of beef and tasted incredible. No spongy taste that you usually get with tofu in broth. We were only in Toronto for a few days, but I definitely would have had lunch here every day if I could have. Must-have whenever I'm visiting!!!
