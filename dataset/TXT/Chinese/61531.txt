drIFrAyZnyismS1ArZlmAg We live in Wyoming but get to Phoenix on a regular basis and the Loving Hut has become our favorite Vegan restaurant, after trying about every Vegan restaurant there.  The food & service is always great, although you may have to wait a bit longer then you would like.  We have tried the other Loving Hut Phoenix locations, but the Indian School location is clearly the best!  Make sure you try the Stuffed Tomatoes if they have them on the menu.
