3ijLguDlxXRDSPHSVrikPQ Just because it's your name, doesn't necessarily mean you should have it named after you.  It is difficult to take seriously a hole in the wall Chinese BBQ with such a ridiculously sounding title...that is until you tried the duck.

Okay, it's not Peking Duck quality, and the birds are not serialized from birth to keep track of quality, and there are certainly no time wasted on decorum, but for a local BBQ place where one can purchase a duck, half a duck, chicken, BBQ pork, duck liver, sausages, tofu, and a simple rice takeaway, there are no competition within a 3km radius. 
Hell, you can even order a whole suckling roast pig, as long as you give them a week's notice..and presumably some kind of deposit.  The idea of not having a whole pig available immediately for the buying is somehow comforting. 

There's little doubt to quality as He He Long has endured in this unforgiving plaza for as long as I can remember.  I've known people who live in houses located in the dreamland neighborhood of Bridal Path endure treacherous journeys in their Range Rovers and S-class to compete for specific parts of whatever animal available here. 
The duck livers sells quickly, usually nothing left by 3pm.

It would do this place great injustice to further describe He He Long, you either like it or your don't, and mostly all patrons are locals.  It's not the reason to visit this plaza, but it would be unreasonable to come here and not buy something from this BBQ joint!

Blame only yourself if you need to ask where this place is, and what you receive in return is a look of awkwardness.
