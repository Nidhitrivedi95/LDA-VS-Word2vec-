cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw I've eaten here 3 times now. Here's the thing with Noodle and Rice. They are a whole in the wall, with really cheap food. I don't think that its possible to get a cheaper lunch special 3.95 or 5.95(with a drink, soup and egg roll). The food isn't bad, but its not greatest thing either. 
I ordered the lunch Chicken Cashew, but asked for it extra spicy. I think they just sprinkled extra chili powder on top, which was a real shame; the dish had potential to be pretty good without that raw chili flavor. The chow mien was actually pretty good. The egg roll seemed like it had too much cinnamon or something that came off as being a bit too sweet. On another occasion I ordered the mongolian beef. The onions were so raw that it was just acidic to eat, I had to cook it longer, and it was good.
The thing with this place is that it has potential to be a great cheap restaurant, but its like they almost don't care to go the extra mile to make their food great. The people are really nice and friendly and in that regard I hope they get better.
