Zs8LPufciU-jDpbAVFqKcA Really glad they returned and reopened. My family and I frequented this restaurant dating back to the 80s until it was torn-down with the rest of Cedar Center around 2007 (sad time) . It was great then and is just as  great now! (minus the ability to dine in like before for they are now mainly a take out restaurant minus the 2 small tables) .   My favorites have always been the Beef and Broccoli ,  Sweet and Sour chicken and the Veggie Egg Rolls.  A hint to those that don't know, they will gladly let you substitute the white rice that comes with some dishes for a pint of fried rice for an extra $2 to me its worth it since they really pack it in like all the dishes. The food doesn't  even fit in the cartons, they tie plastic bags over the cartons and put rubber bands around the boxes because they overflow. You will be happy with the portions if you have a huge appetite like myself or like to have food left over for the next day. (Damn I'm fiending again from writing this have to go again this week.;)
