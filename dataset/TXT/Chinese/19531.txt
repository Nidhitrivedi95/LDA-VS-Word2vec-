5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ My husband and I enjoyed this place overall a five because of the taste and service. 
For starters we ordered the egg rolls and the lettuce wraps both appetizers were so yummy! Then we ordered the garlic prawn fried rice and the walnut prawns, great selection, both dishes are delicious so I highly recommend! The walnut prawns I have to say was my favorite it's jumbo shrimp with glazed walnuts and melons all drizzled with mayo, I could of kept eating but there was no more left. 
After dinner we were given these cute sesame cookies ( fancy fortune cookies) they had a similar taste to a fortune cookie but softer, again I was impressed. I was given a cute box with a fruit bar and a tea bag as a gift from the restaurant, this was cute. We will more than likely be coming here more often as it's always difficult to find good food worth paying the money for .
