I love all the fried garlic and presentation in general. For a Chinese place, it's kind of pricey...especially if you're used to going to a Chinese restaurant and feeding your whole extended family for under $100, but then isn't really your average Chinese place.   You should budget around $50/person here. 

Came here with a group of 8 and had a combo for "6 or 7 people" that consisted of crab, lobster, fish, clams, crab fried rice, and vegetables (which, being the only non-seafood item, was actually really delicious and we had none leftover). I was left with a few boxes of leftovers; part of this might be because they "ran out" of whatever size lobster or crab we're supposed to get and had to shell out a couple of dollars for a bigger one. 

I loveee how all the seafood we ate were all chopped up into pieces that you can just tear apart with your hands to eat (gloves provided). You don't need a special tool to crack shells or anything; this is seafood for the lazy! 

I especially loved the crab legs which were slightly spicy. Every piece of seafood had so much meat to it. The only thing we didn't particularly love were the clams which were a bit plainer, and just didn't seem really flavourful. We were served that first, so it's not like our taste buds were destroyed from the greasier dishes or anything. 

Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back here once I recover from the first visit. The seafood tasted fresh and delicious. Plus complimentary soup + dessert is always nice.
