88ntJxZNxRIY8W_hji9pzg Over the past couple of years, this has been my go-to place for dinner to grab on my way home.  A couple of taps on the Grubhub app, and theres a steaming order of water boiled fish and dan dan noodles coming out just as I pull up.

Tonight was NYE but getting a table here wasnt a problem.  Had the water boiled fish, the chongquing chicken and tried the seafood hot pot that is on a separate "hotpot" menu you have to ask for.

The fish and chicken were awesome as always, the hot pot came with a lot of seafood: mussels, raw headon shrimp and some precooked squid along with a boiling cauldron of broth on a gas powered burner.  Tasted like boiled seafood because the broth is pretty weak and boiling isnt really my favorite way to have mussels or squid ... it was fun and very communal but I dont think Ill be ordering that again.
