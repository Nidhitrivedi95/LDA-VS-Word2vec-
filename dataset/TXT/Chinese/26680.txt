7U73RqIg6JA0WThxWUV3uA I had the lamb salad at 15.00.... it was mostly lettuce. It was good. But it's mostly greens. Not worth 15.00... take 1/4 lettuce out and go easier on the dressing. It was too satuated. Add more tomatoes, after a side at 15.00 or drop it to 12.00.
Our waitress was very nice, efficient and deserved every penny of my 25 percent tip. The place was quite empty for prime time. 
The atmosphere was nice. Clean.
