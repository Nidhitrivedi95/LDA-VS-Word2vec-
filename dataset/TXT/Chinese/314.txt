-092wE7j5HZOogMLAh40zA I've been going here since they first opened. The food is ok for the price, but it seems like over time some of the quality went down (only on certain items). I used to eat here 2-3 times a week but I started to cut back after I got a bit burnt out (it's pretty cheap and it takes like 10 mins to be done and I'm home in 3). When I started eating there again (a few months later) I noticed that every 2-3 times I've ordered from there I get sick. I still order from here, but on a much less frequent basis, such as once or twice a month. I just know that there's a chance of getting sick, so I don't eat there as often.
