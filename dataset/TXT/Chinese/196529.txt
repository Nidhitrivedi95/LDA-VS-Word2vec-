ZN8EHmoe4Xjy4q4Y8ROEfw A friend of mine mentioned this restaurant to me since it's close to her place, so I thought I'd try it out. The Pho noodle soup was overall just okay, broth could have been more flavorful even after adding some sauces to the soup which didn't help too much unfortunately. I also tried the Lemongrass Chicken rice plate on another visit which was decent but nothing out of the ordinary. The portions for that were pretty good and I wouldn't mind trying another rice dish at this restaurant.

I could tell that the owners are really caring people with how they handle their food and service. It might be better to order takeout at this restaurant since the interior is nothing much to look at. I'd come back here to try some of their other dishes but may pass up on their noodle soup next time.
