aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ This was my third visit to this spring rolls. The guys at work love this place so it has been the go-to for the past few months. We had a reservation for a party of 6. We normally sit upstairs but we were seated downstairs even though there was saying upstairs. Not a big deal. 

We always come here for the all you can eat and this time we got the premium which includes more selection as well as dessert. There's so much to choose from. My personal favorites are the lemon grass chicken wings, tornado roll (which is basically shrimp rolled up in noodles and deep fried), Korean kalbi short ribs and the salmon sashimi. 

For dessert I tried the mango sticky rice (I didn't taste mango), the tempura cheesecake and deep fried banana. Everyone loved the mango sticky rice. I liked the fact that the portions were small so that I can control the intake and try them all.

Overall they have average pan asian food. Nothing is exceptionally well done but it isn't bad either. It's great for larger groups because they have something for everyone. The service wasn't the greatest either since we had wait quite a bit before our orders were taken and then again for our first order to arrive. It's very possible that we were part of the dinner rush. The service did pick up as the night on.

It's worth checking out if you've never been. I've been to other locations where the food was marginally better like the Fairview and front street locations.
