I like that they tell you up front that it's 20 minutes for the fried chicken.  For me, it took a bit less, about 15 minutes, even with the restaurant nearly full.  The chicken was very crispy and tender.  I thought it was a bit expensive at $3.25 a piece, but you get the quality that you pay for.  Bubble tea tasted clean and refreshing.

It is a bit odd in that they orient the restaurant in a fast food style where you order and pay first, and then you go to assigned seating while you wait for them to bring out the food.  Interesting business concept.
