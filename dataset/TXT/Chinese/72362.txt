fGrE4Om-cTh_JgQC42qx9A The lady that took my order was in a rush I guess because I said a bowl and she gave me a plate and put half chow mein and half rice. She was talking so fast I couldn't even tell her that that's not what I had said. Then she pretty much threw the receipt so I had to catch it. Worst experience at a panda I've ever had
