GlPvold8xQu3AVKOOCEkIA Tried again, and disappointed again! Called ahead and not ready because they take care of walk ins first. Got home and the only item hot were the fried zucchini. We were missing the curly fries.  Chilli dog was terrible! The mozzarella sticks were very cold! The only thing we can say is the fried zucchini is very good and so were the wings but everything was cold and we had to reheat.
