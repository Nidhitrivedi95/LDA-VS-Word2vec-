AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I ordered takeout here last night. My boyfriend has a dairy allergy so it's hard to find restaurants that can truly accommodate. No dairy. No meat here. Soy based. We had the Walnut Shrimp w/melon (amazing) Wonton soup (wontons were really tasty) Kung Pao Beef (the sauce & beef was really tasty) & Beef n Broccoli (would skip). Overall the food was really tasty and no upset stomach because of msg; we will be back. I Forgot to order noodles and fried rice so next time I have to try that. 

They are located on the second floor above the grocery store. Took me a couple mins to find them.
