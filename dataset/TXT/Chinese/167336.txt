VGKq16vCdPPHMoryy6XTHg Went here on a Monday night for dinner at 10pm on a monday night.  The menu is about 1/3 Vegetarian which was nice because the friend i was entertaining is a pescatarian.  We enjoyed delicious greek style pizza and a pitcher of octoberfest beer for $15 (Their Monday night special).  Great deal.  There was a DJ mixing solid rock music which transgressed decades. nice. 

 As you can read from other other reviews , Natt Spill has a great vibe, good crowd, and equally quality music.  Highly recommended.  especially if you want quality food late at night with vegetarian options.
