Y22IfhXChXoRp3vKi6QwaQ We love getting take out from this place!  I have to say they are very authentic and the food is not over sauced and salted like a lot of other restaurants.  Our favourite dishes are the fish sauce eggplant and the cumin lamb.  I have to say that they are a must try if you like eggplant and lamb.  

We are definitely going to go there again or do take out!
