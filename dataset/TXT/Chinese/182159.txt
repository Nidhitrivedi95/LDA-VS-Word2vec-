XGX5LW0s-OpjmOpVXXYshg One thing I admire Asian Legend is how it can maintain the standard of its food at various locations consistent.  It pains me to say it is standard Asian Legend food here, because the standard of Asian Legend is above-average Northern Chinese food.  I have eaten so many dishes at Asian Legend that I must say all of them are authentic and delicious.  Any difference in opinion is due to different flavour preferences such as how spicy and how salty one likes.

The services we had this evening was okay.  The waitress was quick and effective in giving us water, food and the bill, but she didn't smile much.  

This location is one of the older locations.  Its seating area seems to be the smallest one in GTA, as the Chinatown location has a seating area in the basement.  The ambiance and interior decor is similar to the Commerce Gate location, but less pleasant than the one on Sheppard Avenue.

Overall, 3.5 stars.
