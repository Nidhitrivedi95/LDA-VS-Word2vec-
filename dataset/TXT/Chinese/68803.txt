EV1Jyftx72oF7gG9Uo7pdA Wow I am impressed. The food is so delicious. We started with the wonton soup. The soup was very good & I loved the shrimp in it. Then for our main meals we got the chicken lo me in, beef broccoli and orange chicken. Everything was amazing. Nothing was overly salty and everything tasted really fresh! Portions were generous. Service was great. The food came out really fast and the waiters were very nice and respectful. The atmosphere definitely needs improvement and very casual. That's the only down side. I'm so glad there's a good Asian place in anthem now! I will be coming back for sure.
