x8dRsP9mpI2FD6vazC990A Excellent food and excellent service!  This place is an absolute treasure and I will be back. They offer brown and white rice- I got the teriyaki shrimp. The sauce was light and sweet- very good and the vegetables were fresh and retained some crispness- not at all over cooked like a lot of places. I enjoyed my meal and the proprietor said of you want something not on the menu just ask! They may have it anyway or can make it. Best lunch I've had in a while :-)
