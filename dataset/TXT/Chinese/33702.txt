A6lKCuTrDSJ_eFKyumZCJQ I walked in expecting a big place. Turns out to be a small spot for fast food . The menu is small and prices are what you expect for a restaurant in a Hotel. The kitchen is busy and have the aroma of Chinese spices cooking. And overall not a bad place to eat . However I find the same quality outside of the Silverton at less expensive price. So I give a 3 .
