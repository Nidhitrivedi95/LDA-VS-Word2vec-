Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg I could said this is one of the best sushi I ever had!! 
We went there to celebrate my wife's birthday, she wanted to have sushi and after searching alot of places in Vegas I decided to make a reservation here at Rice and Company, and to be honest one of the reason I chose this restaurant is because I had $50 credit to redeem with the use of the My Vegas app (an mlife program).

My selection:
King salmon sashimi
Rainbow roll (it surprise me with tobiko on top, I never had it like that and it was soo Tasty)
East meets west roll (with king salmon inside and toro outside, and again this roll was delicious)

My wife selection:
Spicy tuna roll
shrimp tempura roll
Mango avocado roll
She enjoyed everything, no left overs lol.

 I must say I'm soo glad I did choose this place, and we're definitely going back. This place deserve more than 3 stars but this is just my opinion.
