I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg This place is awesome! The menu has a great variety of ice creams (snoh), milk teas, iced teas, etc. And the best part is you can customize your order exactly how you like it. There is a great variety in toppings and flavors for all their products
I had the almond milk tea and custard pudding which was delicious! The milk tea itself wasn't too sweet and I felt the custard added the needed sweetest for the perfect balance. The almond pudding is great too! If you ask, they will usually let you sample before you make a selection. I loved that the prices are reasonable for the size beverage you get. The snoh is unique, it's neither ice cream nor shaved ice...it's almost like shaved milk. Has a great consistency and lots of flavors to choose from. 

Pros:
good pricing
great selection
awesome product
friendly staff

cons: 
its far from my house, wish there was a joint in Ahwatukee
Hoping for a better point system than the one on FiveStars
