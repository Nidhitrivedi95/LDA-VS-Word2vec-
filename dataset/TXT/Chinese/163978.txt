USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw Here is where you can get "value" dim sum.

By "value," I mean both the food quality and selection are much worse here than at Li Wah, but this restaurant is also significantly cheaper.  Really though, I would spend the extra money and go to Li Wah.  Or better yet, get dim sum in another city.

I mean, seriously, if you see five times as many cars in the parking lot for Siam Cafe across the street, it doesn't tell you something about this place?
