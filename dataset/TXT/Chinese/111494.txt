m9iqRUgclcsQs-z8c2FTeA I was in town for a week and needed to get some 'personal maintenance' done (aka waxing of various bits). I initially called their sister store, but was told I can get an appointment right away if I come to Suddenly Slimmer instead. No worries, so here I came. 

The reception space is well laid out, but it does feel like a big showroom and I immediately braced myself for an up sell. The treatment rooms are quite basic but adequate... quick note, the walls are not thick so conversations can be heard through walls. 

The beauty therapist who did my waxing was technically very good, but sloppy round the edges. She covered a couple of my nails in wax when we were doing a bikini wax. Puzzling indeed.

I assume this is one of the premium beauty places in town - I don't think it's quite at that level (from what I consider premium spa) but it's adequate.
