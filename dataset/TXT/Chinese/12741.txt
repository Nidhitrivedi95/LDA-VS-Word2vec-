2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg I only started venturing to House of Gourmet after realizing that King's Noodle is not open on Wednesdays. 

The food is decent for the cheap price, and service is relatively fast with about the same kind of standards you would expect from any other Chinatown joint. 

I have found that their congee (lean pork and preserved egg) is not always consistent in terms of taste and texture, which is why I tend to favour their noodle soups.

The beef rice noodle soup is usually my go to, it's generally very tasty, always comes out hot, and they give you a decent amount of beef. Sometimes they throw in bonus lettuce leaves at the bottom of the bowl, and sometimes they don't (I suspect they either run out, or they become sloppy with the prep). Beware that if you are a slow eater, you probably should not order any sort of thick rice noodle soup. The noodles will expand, your broth to noodle ratio will dwindle, and you will struggle.
