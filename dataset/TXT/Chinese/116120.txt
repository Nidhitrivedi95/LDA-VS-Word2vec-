n5jTCFF6LqNIAz6Jx5-3tw It's ok. I only went because they sent me a coupon in the mail, and I probably won't go back unless I get another coupon.
~$6 for a small plate, which comes with white/brown rice, meat, and a sauce. I don't think the food tastes any better than Panda Express, but they do have more 'healthy' options, since you can get your meat steamed instead of fried. Also, the prices are much higher than Panda for the amount of food you get.
Another strike against this location: they have a coke freestyle machine, but OVER HALF of the soda choices were empty! Including all Diet choices! Seriously??
Basically, there are way too many other choices in the area to go back to Pei Wei unless I get another free entrée coupon in the mail.
