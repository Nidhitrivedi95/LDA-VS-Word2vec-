What's also good is the Seafood sour soup.  It comes with a plentiful of shrimp, scallops, squid, and octopus.  Delicious in flavor and broth.

I don't quite like the Pad Thai though, to me it has kind of a sweet taste with just isn't accord with me.  I prefer the Pad Thai from Pin Kaow, which is separate when you get the Pad Thai you put the bean sprouts, peanuts, and dressing in it.  That's what I'm more used to when I had it in Viet Nam.
