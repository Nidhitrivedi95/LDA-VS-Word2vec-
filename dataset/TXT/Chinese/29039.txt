8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ My family and I were in Toronto for a little get-away over New Years, and normally we go to the Ginger and Onion (next to the Pacific Mall) for Dim Sum (which is just ok), but thought we would try someplace new. Looked on Yelp, and this place was not only the closest to our hotel, but seemed to be rated #1.

The details say it opens at 9:00 AM, and we were there are 9:07- in the seven minutes prior to our arrival- they were packed!  We ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table, and just so you know, we had ticket #1, and while we were waiting the 45 minutes, they got up to ticket #66!

Was it worth the wait-absolutely!  My wife, who is from China, said it was some of the best she has ever eaten in North America, and some restaurants in China.  All of the dishes were well seasoned and flavorful. The steamed shrimp dumplings were pretty large, and the fried shrimp dumplings were absolutely amazing. The only item I thought was just "ok", were the roast pork buns, but other than that, excellent.
