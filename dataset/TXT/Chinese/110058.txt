ltl1WFdxYcyKOCnV6llQjw The space is very nice, once found.  A friend in town and I were wandering around the Palms while our guys played blackjack, and figured it was a good idea for a cheap afternoon snack, especially in a casino.  First, we were seated in the 24/7 cafe, and did not see dim sum on the menu.  We got up and found Cathay House, and moved in there.  The hostess never asked us what we wanted, and we had seen the dim sum menu on the flatscreen...silly misunderstanding on my part.

Once seated, we saw the small dim sum menu with the larger Chinese menu.  There were plenty of cheap items ($2.88 and $3.88) on the menu and we wanted like 2-4 to snack on.  However, when it was time to order, the waiter said after 3 the dim sum menu is limited to 3 or 4 items, all which had pork except for one.  This was not on the menu or any sign.  If it was listed that way on the flatscreen or on the menu, we probably would not have wasted our time.  So we ordered the one, shrimp dumpling listed at $2.88.  I was disappointed, and mentioned I don't eat pork, but he didn't offer an alternative.

We got the dumplings, 4 total, and they were fine.  We decided to get the bill because there were no other options, and of course we we charged $3.18 for it.  I decided not to argue because I imagine we would have been told that after 3, it goes up 30 cents or something.  But that is sketchy nonetheless.  Not in a rush to go back - I know dim sum is not really an afternoon thing but if Cathay House, which is known for dim sum, is open long hours in a casino, I would think their whole dim sum menu would be available or something should tell patrons that it is not..
