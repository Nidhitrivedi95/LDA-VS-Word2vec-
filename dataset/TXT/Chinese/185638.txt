Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw Let me preface by saying, I am a huge Asian cuisine fan. Eaten many different chinese spots on various continents and this place is amongst the top in terms of taste and consistency. Really good portion size, casual laid back atmosphere and a really sweet staff. If I am ever in the area, this is where I am eating!
