VQDl9gM4PBMRnPMipFycrQ I've ordered delivery from this location a few times in the past 6 months.  The food has always been rather good if not very good and I've routinely been able to get a generous amount of food for $14 delivered with tax and tip.

It sometimes takes a bit to get the food, but it's always been reasonable and the staff, despite occasional communication issues, have generally be very nice.   If you've got a bit of cash in your pocket and like good chinese food, I'd recommend this place.
