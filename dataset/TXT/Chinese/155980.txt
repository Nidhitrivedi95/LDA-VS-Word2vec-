Todrg1F247iuDIm784XHfA Good food all around but the best feature of this restaurant are their combination specials. For around eight bucks you get two entrees with hot and sour or egg drop soup, vegetable fried rice, an egg roll, two crab puffs and two fried shrimp.

The owner, Monita, seemingly takes great pride in her restaurant and the quality of service she provides. The only thing that this place is missing is delivery service.
