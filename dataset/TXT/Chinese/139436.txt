qVWmMF5C0l-SFmbcyI8sYQ The food here is so fresh and the quality is excellent. I have been to all the so called great chinese takeaways in Edinburgh "Taste good, Ping on, Loon Fung and Kweillin. Although all good, they do not match in any way the Loon Wah on price, quality and portion size. The set meals are excellent value for money. I am a typical scotsman and always have to have a chicken curry and theirs is amazing, I get it hot with green chillies, they will make dishes to your liking which is great.. The rice is the benchmark of a chinese and it's tops. Get wafer paper prawns and see the freshness. A lot of people will not trust some chinese for seafood, you will not be disappointed here. The hot and spicy or peking ribs are to die for and you get loads for £4.50. This is the best chinese takeaway in Edinburgh by far, trust me, I have been going to this place for over 10 years and tried most other places by recommendation and the have never matched up. Take my word The Loon Wah is exceptional.
