hHtmzOwkdNj93QnKaUr5og I dropped in for lunch with my family, this place is really good! I had Bibim Noodle. The patty was nice and soft and the potato starch noodles were soft and sticky(my first potato starch noodle experience). Their Korean miso is spicy and filled with a lot of ingredients. My brother had bulgogi and it was sweet and savory. For dessert we had the Chocolate Truffle(ice cream in a ball rolled in truffle dust) and Mango Ripieno(mango sorbet served in mango skin, it's really cool). I definitely recommend this place if you want authentic and great tasting Korean food!
