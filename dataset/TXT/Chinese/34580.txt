This place delivers great tasting food and whenever I walk in during lunch time it's always busy in one form or another.
We decided to eat here on July 4th (today) and it was packed; had a line going out the door. 
Got our number and waited approx. 10 min before being seated:
-Half a duck
-Hoi Nam Gai Fan
-Noodles w/pig skin & intestine
When my dad got his plate, we could just hear in the background that they lost our check. 
It was kinda funny really, the chaos of a packed restaurant as well as the waiters yelling back and forth of where the check mysteriously disappeared to. (The matter was solved in the end.)
