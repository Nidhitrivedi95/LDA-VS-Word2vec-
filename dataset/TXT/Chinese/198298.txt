zXJilaBN28oUdX7Owf0fRA Sakura is consistent, has what I want when I order and expeditious. There's nothing really extraordinary about an Avocado roll and tomago in general because they might be some of the most basic options at this restaurant, so I measure their stars by consistency. I can expect the same amount of sweetness in the tomago, the correct level of ripeness in Avocado and the same portion sizes overall. These are really important for me! Their prices are also reasonable across the board for high-quality food.

I will continue to order from here and dine in whenever the craving strikes! I recommend it if you're in the area or want consistent quality.

I know I said consistent a million times in this review, but at least I'm consistent! ;)
