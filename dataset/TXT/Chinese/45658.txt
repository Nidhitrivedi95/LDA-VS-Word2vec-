bsjBLLHR4TMVR5eAeLAI9w Very very decent Chinese food, not Toronto quality but definitely better than any plaCE in NYC. We got the 4 dish set plus some salted egg shrimp. The portions were very big and seasoned very much to our tastes. And the fish was excellent, it's rare that any restaurant can get it steamed perfectly and they come pretty close. Returned also for dim sum...which was only OK. This is definitely a good dinner spot.
