yVzjjcyHNwAwZFBnWUbvnw First off let's start with this place is under new management. We made the misfortunous mistake of going to get take out in January of 2015. The staff was friendly enough but they had plenty of time to be so because our order took forever. Granted it was a $60.00 order so we were forgiving of the wait. Got home with our food, excited to dig in. That excitement soon passed.  Hot and sour soup was inedible, Pupu platter did not have the food that was listed on it.  Started opening the containers with our food only to find out that they were anywhere from half full to maybe 70% full.  The combo lo mein which should have had chicken, pork and shrimp had only 3 pieces of chicken and nothing else.  I have always been of the mindset to let a restaurant make good on mistakes so I called and told the owner would be in the next day.  Called him and explained the situation and he seemed somewhat confused but assured us he wanted to make the situation right.  He informed us next time we ate there that our meal would be comped and I told him I appreciated it.  We decided to let them have a little while to get their kitchen straightened out and called Sunday afternoon to make an order.  The girl who answered the phone stated the owner was there but on another line.  She took my name and number and stated she would have him call me back.  After waiting an hour I called back only to be told then owner just left and she couldn't help me.  At this point I feel I have no other recourse then to post my experience in hopes it will help others like myself who were incorrectly influenced by the positive reviews that were made when the restaurant  was under the old management.
