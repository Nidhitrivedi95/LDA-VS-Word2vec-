fh-hCT2esNJEocdBdggWoQ If you're having your first Peking duck experience, please try somewhere else first along hwy 7 (e.g Dayali or Dragon Legend for Ayce Peking Duck wraps). You'll have a happier time and won't feel like you wasted so much money. I thought R&D with their Peking duck was expensive at $75 but they do it way way better than here. 

Ordered the $110 Peking duck with the rose plating. Don't fall for it. Just look for pictures lol. A few side dishes were also ordered but it was nothing special. The saddest was the "hand-crafted" duck pastries. They were some of the driest pastries on earth. I've said it to my friends. A moist chocolate cake or even McCain delights would've been more satisfying. They're pretty but that's it. 

FYI my bill was $300 for $110 duck, 3 dishes, 2 fruit shakes, duck pastries.  Might be missing something but it will not be cheap here.
