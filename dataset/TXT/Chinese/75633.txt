fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA I was extremely disappointed when I found out this was not the real din tai fung franchise that I knew best in Shanghai. It's a fake :(

Regardless, the food is still pretty good. I usually get the Xiao long bao and the pan fried dumplings. Their deep fried pork chop with soup noodles was a bit disappointing since the soup and pork chop lacked flavour.
