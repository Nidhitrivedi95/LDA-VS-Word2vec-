01aNlDhbMObjc9OdAHuNpQ While the prices may seem a little high at first, my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised just how much food comes with pretty much any portion size. A combination plate is half filled with your choice of rice and the other your entree. An order of chicken fried rice takes up the entire styrofoam container. After ordering the Sweet and Sour Pork plate with rice, Chicken Fried Rice, small Wonton Soup, small Egg Flower Soup, and a 10 PC of pot stickers, it became very clear upon arrival that we weren't going to be finishing all the food for one meal.

As far as taste goes - it's quite alright. Rice has never been my thing, so me being a critic on that front doesn't seem fair, however the Sweet and Sour Pork is plenty flavorful, the Egg Flower Soup is very satisfying, and the pot stickers are probably my favorite from our selection last night. I wouldn't come here for the very absolute best in take-out, but I would come for large portions of pretty good food.
