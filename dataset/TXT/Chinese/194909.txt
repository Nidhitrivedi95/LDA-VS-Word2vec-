zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I came here on a Saturday Night with mom after seeing a wonderful French film at Tiff at nearby Roy Thomson Hall. The place was crowded, but we were seated right away. We were seated upstairs in the lounge near across from the bar and were greeted right away by the bartender and our server.

We both wanted the extremely spicy ramen. The server warned us, it was super spicy and they would not be able to take it off the bill if we don't eat it.  The server suggested that one of us get the super spicy and the other the ginger and we can share both. We took the server's suggestion.

Our food came, and the server dropped off a small glass of soy milk next to me since we were having the extremely spicy noodles. They meant business! My mom and I love spicy. These noodles were the spiciest I have tasted in my whole life. My mom decided to stick with the ginger, and I stuck with the spicy noodles. I loved that I could still taste all of the flavors with the chilies and ramen despite being extremely hot. I did take advantage of the soy milk and let the server know to keep the water coming (which she did). I managed to eat the entire bowl and it was AWESOME. I joked with a server and the bartender, that I should get a t-shirt for eating the entire thing without passing out. They agreed. I am sure there are people out there who can eat the whole thing without water or milk...God Bless em! I had a bite of the ginger ramen too which was pretty good, but I was happy with my spicy choice.

My only regret, was ordering wine with the meal, I could not taste it after having the noodles and had to wait several minutes until after I was finished with the ramen to drink it. I will definitely be going back next time I am in Toronto. I live in NYC where there is Momofuku Noodle bar, but they do not have this extremely spicy dish on the menu :(
