1F4T9e6bRFwL11wnNxW4Ng Great customer service from the manager on duty yesterday! I ordered two meals through UberEATS and only one had arrived, of course it wasn't mine so I was hangry when I called them! The manager I spoke with fixed the issue so quickly and within 25 minutes I was eating my favorite Kung pao chicken! I appreciate good service like that because it really stands out from most places today who don't really care and tell you oh we will fix it next time because this time you're apparently supposed to starve. Thank you for great service and helping me get my fried rice and spicy chicken fix
