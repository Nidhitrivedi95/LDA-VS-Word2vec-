kP2wC0luve3mT5fcdrA3nQ First the good.  Service was good, menu was extensive, and facility was pleasant, but dated.  Food was bland.  I had the Kung Pao Chicken Special, and everything was forgettable.  Egg drop soup and egg roll were without a distinguishing taste.  Overall the food is a 2 and everything else is a 3.
