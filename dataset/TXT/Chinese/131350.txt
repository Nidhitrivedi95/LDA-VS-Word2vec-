pImcSPg5tEkuvqHF7JnpoQ How is this place even open still?  Everything was absolutely awful.
My daughter and I went in for lunch.  The place was completely empty at 12:45!  
You know if the appetizer is bad the rest of the meal is pretty much done for.  The pot stickers were completely flavorless.  The crispy chicken with mushroom sauce was completely inedible; the chicken tasted like it had been fried in really old oil several years ago and left to dry on the countertop.  The coconut chicken curry my daughter ordered was also devoid of flavor.  The server said three words to us the entire time we were there, and when I told him how unpleasant the meal tasted, he had no reply.  I truly wish I had asked for at least one of our meals to be taken off the bill.  ARGH!!!
