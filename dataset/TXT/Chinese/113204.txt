MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ I have been there twice this month because I had a good experience for the first time, and the second time didn't disappoint me. Before the store changed to Kung Fu Chef, it was another Taiwanese restaurant. The decoration doesn't change a lot, but the menu is totally different and the food is even better.

For two time experience, I both ordered clay pot rice:  shrimp sauce pork first and  chicken for second. The waitress said I needed to wait 20 mins for that, but I understood that it supposed to be prepared and cooked that long. Also for that cheap price and delicious favor, I was willing to wait. One great through idea for them was that a small bowl of soup was served with the pot. When I almost finished, I poured the soup into the pot and mixed with the scorched rice sticking in the pot. This is a really really nice and attentive to customers.

We also ordered the chicken wings, goose intestines and fried calamari. All tasted really good. We did have some problems with the fried calamari since they added vinegar but my friends and I didn't like it, so they immediately made us a new dish.
Very kind to guests, truly. For drinks, we didn't put a lot of expectations on it. I liked my almond milk tea, but my friend's coffee milk tea was just soso.

Overall, it is worth for 5 stars since they have polite servers, tasty food and enough lamplight, and certainly we will go again.
