773ovbZW7HvfaNy5laUznQ Sushi is great, however, over 1 hour waiting... still no raw sushi roll...on a Monday night at 7:00... How is that ok?? And how does that make sense?!? Between the 2 of us we ordered only 2 rolls... they better figure out their volume control before moving into their new larger location... just sayin' ! #slowAF #stillwaiting

oh better yet...went inside at 8:10 to ask about our rolls and THEY WERENT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING READY... wtf I mean really over an hour after we ordered and still no where near being ready ... don't waste your time folks ...

Ohhh and the place wasn't busy at all... again maybe they should think about that before moving to their new location...
