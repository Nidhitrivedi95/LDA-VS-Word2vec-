JKTMgelIQ-VHn7SL5nyiWA Of all the Thai restaurants I have tried, this one has to be one of the best!!

I came across this place on a search of delicious foods to order off of Postmates, of course when I see a place I look on yelp for the amount of stars and reviews.

 Normally most places people complain about the customer service or the amount of food but this place I have seen neither.

The interior is adorable, it's cute has its own atmosphere that makes it comforting and romantic. I have yet to eat inside but I have ordered and gone to pick it up when I didn't want to pay a delivery charge. This place is located next to island sushi and red rice, it's a tiny parking lot but normally you can find a place to park. 

Right when you walk in, you are greeted by the kindest people who i believe own the place. They give you time to look at the menu if you are taking out but are eager to assist you if you are dining in. Super friendly and answers every and any question you may have.

Thai tea is an absolute favorite, I have to always order it. Not bitter, not overly sweet and not too creamy just perfect! The wonton soup with noodles is delicious, I'm a sucker for it. As well as the food, no matter what you get it's delicious. Definitely for dessert try the sticky rice with mango!
