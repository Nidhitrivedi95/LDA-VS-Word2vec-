Yecau5RHd7hjMlsZFBccFQ One word "Roaches". I was in the mood for Chinese and this was right around the corner from where I was. They didn't seem busy at all. I ordered my food and waited for it only to she a cockroach or waterbug what crawling across the floor and it was huge. It turned me off right away when I told the woman who took my order she didn't look surprised and smashed it with her shoes. From that point on it was time to go.
