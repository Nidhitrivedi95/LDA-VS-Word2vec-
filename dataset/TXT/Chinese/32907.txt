We had the Egg Rolls which were big, like mini burritos; crab puffs, which were stuffed full of yummy stuffing and not tiny either; cashew chicken, which was tender and juicy and flavorful; and general Tso, which was crisp and full of fresh veggies. The service was fast and friendly as well. The only ding I would say is the prices, which are a buck or two more than what I'd say is average, but they gotta pay Scottsdale rent, so it is what it is. That wouldn't stop me from coming back though, and it shouldn't let you either,
