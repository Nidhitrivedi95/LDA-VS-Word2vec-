rKhu9apa_dGPl8k36IMYQQ The dumplings are fantastic and come in a huge variety that I'm really looking forward to exploring over time. So far, I've only had the beef & coriander ones (steamed), but they were big, juicy and super flavourful. I think I'll try some fried ones next, and I can hardly wait. 

As for the rest of the menu, I've only tried the wonton soup and the General Tao chicken so far, but they were both great. The broth in the soup was perfect, and the General Tao was crispy without being too hard, and just the right amount of sweet (really tasty but not at all overpowering).

The portions aren't very big and the prices aren't very low, but the food is super fresh and expertly made on the spot, and the service is warm and welcoming. Plus, quality Chinese comfort food is something that's been lacking in the area, so I hope this place will thrive and continue to fill that gap. I look forward to going back with friends and working my way through the menu.
