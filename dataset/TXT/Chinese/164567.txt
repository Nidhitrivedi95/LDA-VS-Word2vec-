uUvnimNxg15Ds9r0SC3oMg I vowed to not come here again but unfortunately my grandparent still likes it here so we went for their sake. Once again it was disappointing. Service was still rude and the food wasn't even good this time. The pork chops were very dry, the bok choy was bland and the same for the snow pea leaves. The fish was bland too. The egg pancake dish we ordered was mushy. To top it off I got some pretty bad stomach ache afterwards and upon walking out I noticed they had a conditional pass on a previous dinesafe inspection. Nice. The duck was good though.
