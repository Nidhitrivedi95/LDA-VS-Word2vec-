PXKjfPxjJSykV3vN8GAoBQ China House has great food.  The family that owns and works in the restaurant are the nicest people you will ever meet and will bend over backwards to make you a happy customer. They will custom make anything you want. They are one of very few restaurants that will give you brown rice. The food is very, very good and the prices are the best around.  The only down side is the restaurant itself.. it's small and not realy "eat in".
