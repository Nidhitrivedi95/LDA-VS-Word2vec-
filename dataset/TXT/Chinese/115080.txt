n_J4ryIX_f2CVdse8Wd-Ig My boyfriend and I were craving Chinese food, and this place was the closest to our house.  The menu outside looked good and decently priced.  We went inside and took a seat near the window.  There were maybe 2 other tables there; it was pretty empty.

It took a really long time for us to get menus which didn't start things off right.  We looked over the menu for a few minutes and had decided what to get.  We waited....and waited...and waited for someone to come to our table to take our order, or even as if we wanted anything to drink.  It looked like two people were working.  The woman was busy on the phone, and going in and out of the kitchen.  The man was mainly watching TV or on the computer.  We waited so long that someone literally came in from outside, ordered something to go and got his food before anyone had even come to take our order.  No joke!  By this point I was livid and we walked out of the place.  It was absolutely inexcusable how bad the service was.

Their menu looked tempting though, and the prices were good, so I wanted to give them a second chance and try the delivery option.  We ordered from the Special Family Meal which came with one of 38 dishes along with soup and a spring roll for each dish you ordered.  Unfortunately you could only order Hot & Sour soup or the Chicken & Sweet Corn Soup.  I prefer Wonton Soup and was told I could not substitute.  The spring rolls were average.  We ordered the lemon chicken, beef with mixed vegetables and chicken fried rice.  I was surprised that white rice was extra.  There was a lot of food, so our stomachs were definitely full, and there was lots left over.  It was pretty average food though.  Nothing to rave about.

I would order delivery or take out again because the price is pretty good.  Take out is 10% off too, which is a plus, especially since I live close.
