4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A Fairly solid hot pot place. The main reason why I come here is that I feel like I get my bang for my buck. Honestly, some hot pot places are totally not worth it even though they may be all you can eat. Kim Tao is worth it because their seafood meal price is on par with many regular meal prices of other places. You get a huge oyster, a scallop, two shrimps, two types of fish and a mussel. It might not sound like a lot but when you're going out to eat seafood, you'll find that the cost is a lot more. 

In addition to your seafood meal which you should also get (unless you don't like seafood, but be cool and offer the seafood to your seafood loving friends ;D), there's a wide range of condiments you can order (they have the basics premade and put on your table, who knows how long that's been there and what has been flying around in them, just saying), a respectable variety of food you can get and an ok selection of soups. I've never ordered the additional fee soups so I can't say for those. I've had chicken stock and satay (also when they refill your pot they use water not chicken stock). 

Their fish paste is good and fun to dispense, their fish noodles on the other hand, although fun to dispense, not so fun to eat. They also have side orders like hot pot rice and fried appetizers such as chicken wings, wontons, dumplings and a few other interesting (seasonal?) choices. 

I only come here for my hot pot now because of the price. Service is.. you take what you can get. It was a little difficult to get the servers attention and even though we pressed the button to call for a server, sometimes they might not come. I mean as long as they bring our food then I am alright. Hotpot takes time to cook and eat, so if you are eager to have your second order in, have the sheet ready and throw them the order as soon as you see them whizzing by.
