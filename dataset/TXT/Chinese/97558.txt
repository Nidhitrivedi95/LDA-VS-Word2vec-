JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw Yummy! Came here for a late afternoon mini-meal so the bf and I shared the pork rib noodle soup (knife cut noodles is the way to go!) and the spicy wontons. I love the fact that they offer regular noodles, hand pulled and the knife cut! Knife cut noodles are one of my personal favorites and it went really well with the broth of the soup. The spicy wontons was a little of the small portion size but there was a nice dusting of sichuan peppercorn dust on them. I'd say it's on par with the asian noodles places back in LA and not too overpriced either.

Service is friendly, and the restaurant itself is pretty modern, clean and bright. Cute painting on the walls of the womens restroom too!
