NKMkvLWatV9v7zbMNS6D3g No more sushi!! Wow I didn't know they stopped selling sushi till I came in today and was disappointed. Since I was there I decided to order anyways. As usual the lady at the counter was crabby.  My order was completed quickly and was still piping hot when I got home. I had the Buddhist Delight, miso soup and veg spring roll. Honestly the spring roll was amazing. That being said, no more sushi means no more Chen's for me.
