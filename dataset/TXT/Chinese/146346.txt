S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A What's magical about this place? It's the actual making of the noodles and its authenticity! Oodles of noodles!  The skilled chef and the art of noodle making can be seen in the back of the restaurant as you are eating. My fave dish is #22 minced pork noodles with julienned cucumber slices, on a bed of lettuce and sprinkled with scallions. You're able to select the type of noodle but I always go with the hand pulled noodles. It's a great take-out item. I've also tried the beef noodle stew with the hand pulled noodles. If you're dining in you will most likely be served with a plate of steamed peanuts lightly salted and de-shelled. Try picking it up with your chopsticks for those of you that are chopstick challenged. ;)  This place is awesome because it's considered a cheap eat! Who doesn't love that?
