QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw This is probably my favorite hotpot place in town. I love that everyone can get what they want because everyone gets their own pot and I love the make-your-own-sauce bar, which also has noodles, eggs, potatoes, and sweet potatoes up for grabs as well! My favorite broth is their Thai one. This place can be kind of confusing to newcomers so go with someone that's been here before if you can. The seating is also very limited; if it's raining or around mealtime or you're celebrating a special occasion, try to go early to make sure your party can get some seats.
