oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q I was so excited to try this place - a friend highly recommended this as the best place for hakka chinese food in Mississauga. Having lived outside of TO the past three years i was so deprived of good hakka food and was looking for something other than Federicks in Scarborough - i love their food but change is good, right? i dont think soo...

the Chicken Pakoras were generous for an appetizer plate - 12 pieces and they truly were fantastic and thats where the dining experence halted...

Mains: Chili Chicken - i dont think that was really chicken - its tough and dry and the suace wasn't that great.

Chicken Chow Mein - very very greasy - the husband makes way better chow mein that Eddie here does.

Ambience: it was a nice looking halal restuarant but was packed on a Saturday night at 8 pm. People were loitered around every corner of the restaurant and there were only parties of 8 and higher here. There were children running around everywhere banging spoons against plates and it was loud.

Service: we were quickly seated because we were only two but we were then neglected because there were larger parties that were being attended to. They take pre-orders as you arrive and are waiting to be seated - so study the menu beforehand because then as soon as you are seated they serve. we weren't given the pre-order option since we were just a party of two.

I wouldn't make the effort to drive to Mississauga to dine here again.

ps: it's Halal
