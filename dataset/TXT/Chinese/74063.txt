FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ I rarely venture out to Mississauga to eat, but we were here for family Chinese new year's eve dinner and I was absolutely amazed as soon as I walked through the front door.  The entrance area was filled with numerous tanks containing various sized lobsters, oversized Alaskan king crabs and snow crabs.  My immediate thought was fresh seafood and the name of the restaurant was very fitting. 

Walking into the dining area I was immediately impressed by the elegant decor and spacious open room consisting of high ceilings with elaborate chandeliers, red linen table cloths and seat covers. Not many Chinese restaurants consist of this style, so it's one of the few luxurious ones I've seen.

We had reservation and had a set dinner menu which consisted of numerous dishes associated with Chinese new year.  I cannot comment on the pricing as my uncle handled the selection and we didn't have menus to use as reference. 

Since it was Chinese new year it was extremely busy and the service was very slow, but the servers were quite attentive when they were at our tables. The first dish didn't arrive until over an hour after we sat down, but the fact we were able to bring our own bottles of wine made up for the wait time.

We had two tables reserved and were seated at the very back corner by the emergency exit which was quite drafty.  Throughout the night staff members came and went through the emergency exit which was a little inconvenient as there was not much room between the two tables.  

Overall, it was a great restaurant with nice presentation of dishes and food was tasty with right amounts of flavouring, plus the ambience was really enjoyable.  Definitely a great place for fine dining and worth the drive to Mississauga for the seafood and decor.
