ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ The Clever Koi will reel you in with its soul satisfying ramen, cleverly named and crafted cocktails, and modern decor.
 
Walking up to the restaurant, past the artful logo painted on the facade, you'll find large glass windows through which you see trendy Asian inspired interiors abustle with activity. Whether you are in a group or on a date, find yourself a seat and ready yourself for delicious food and drink. The menu has an array of choices from small bites like steamed buns or Brussels sprouts to bowls of piping hot ramen. I settled on the cauliflower ramen with picked persimmon, cashews, and a soft boiled egg, which came on the side in a small bamboo dish. Oh lawd- the silky coconut milk broth, tang of pickled persimmon, tender crunch of cauliflower, and rich egg yolk came together in harmony in each bite. Let's just say there were zero leftovers. 

The experience was made complete by the excellent bar program with drinks like the Enabler- a delightfully rustic sipper with hickory smoked whiskey, grilled lemon, bitters and maple syrup. The sweetness from the maple played off the smoky whiskey in perfect balance. There are wines and beer too for the those not fancying the hard stuff.

By all means, when in Phoenix, step into the Clever Koi for an enjoyable and satisfying  evening
