2GtIC6u4hVneccWfTlOxHQ Let me preface this review with...I was not in the mood to die or get caught in a cross fire on New Year's Eve.

I walk in and manager (owner) greets me.  (He seems agitated...)

He seats me and I give my drink order.  (A buffet with COKE products?!? Score! )

I go over to the clean and attractive buffet and make my selections.   As I return to my booth, I notice this same guy in a heated duscussion with 2 customers.  Not professional by him, but I am hoping he walks away and I can enjoy my MSG in peace. 

He does.   Then, he comes back.  Argues again.  Then he leaves.  Then...he comes back.  Argues again....  

I am sitting there ready to duck if someone pulls a gun.  I take a couple of bites of food, but am too distracted. 

The couple goes to the front of the restaurant and arguing continues.   I am not sure what problem is; however,  the F Bombs are flying on both sides.

I decide I want no part if this scene.  I have only taken a few bites and I owe them nothing.   I walk out as other customers are.  I tell them to calm down and it's not worth it.

Just then my waitress comes out and asks if I am going to pay.

Um, no.  That was not a good scene and I barely touched food.

She goes back in.

He comes out.

He tells me I need to pay.  He says I wasted food.  I say that was unprofessional behavior and I am not paying. 

He says... (manager/owner)

F-Bomb!

F-Bomb you!

You Mother F-Bomber!

F-Bomb you!   You need to pay! F-Bomber!

I wave as I pull out of parking space and give him a thumbs up!  

He goes back into F-Bomb mode!

Yikes!  If this is how they operate I do NOT recommend choosing Hong Kong Gourmet. 

I do not know what initial problem was between other guests and who was at fault.   I do know it was unprofessional behavior x 100 by the manager/owner.

How can you expect patrons to dine in this situation?

F-Bomb!

F-Bomb!

F-Bomb!
