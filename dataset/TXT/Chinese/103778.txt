KMA1sN-RlOiSEi_nmH26Sw Desserts are good enough, but the rest is absolutely abysmal. Service is slow and terrible. Ordered a dish and they came back after 30min telling me it's not available. Utensils and napkins are literally dumped onto the table and you have to set it yourself. Dishes are blend and ordinary, and they even managed to overcook the white rice somehow.
