khxjYMwb_V8UovvwPVhysw This place is clean and delicious! The server was nice as well. I ordered the wonton soup for lunch. It was so yummy! Not too salty, and the vegetables were tender and crisp - not overcooked. It was more than with the price. I would definitely recommend this place! Thanks for lunch! :)
