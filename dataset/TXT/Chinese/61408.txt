dQojkooHaWvyCor5qcAS6Q Don't mind the few reviews this place has, this place is absolutely AMAZING! 

I consider myself to be kind of a Peking duck expert of the Toronto area. I been to almost if not all the Peking duck restaurants located in the GTA, but let me tell you this place has one of the best tasting ducks outside of China.

This duck here has very thin and crispy skin, the wraps here are the thinnest I had in the GTA, and the fat has been taken care of very well. 

If you're in the area or if you have time and love Peking duck, definitely come check this place out. You won't regret it.

Just a tip. Call ahead to reserve the duck so you don't have to wait forever for the duck to be served.
