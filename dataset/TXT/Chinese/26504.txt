7T3WU-Up01pgCeygbc_K-A It was such a busy restaurant, packed with a long line up. I am truly not understand how they are so busy.  The food they provide were all junk food and some preserved vegetables fish ball crab meat. In term of nutrition I will say ZERO. I picked a tomato soup base doesn't taste like any tomato in it.Rice noodle with Fully Msg soup.Everyone can cook such instant noodle at home. Really wondering where the people coming from to line up, maybe just me like to enjoy the real food.
