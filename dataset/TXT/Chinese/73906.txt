fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw I don't know what happened. 

I looked up Chinese food on my mobile Yelp and this was one of my two choices. This place got better reviews then Jackie Chan so I went with it. 

The Hubs and I ordered Chicken Lo Mein, Spicy Garlic Broccoli, Szechuan  Shrimp and Chicken Curry. 

They said it would be 45 min to an hour. Got there in 20 min. Great, we left them a big tip and got ready to dig in. 

Where did the meat go?? Considering I try not to eat many carbs, there was no meat in these dishes. I didn't try the lo mein but the shrimp and chicken curry had a few bites of meat and all veggies. Needless to say, I went hungry because I don't eat rice. The curry had a weird flavor. I haven't had tons of Thai curry so I am basing my comparison on Pin Kow which is yummy. The spicy broccoli was the only thing that didn't disappoint. When I am paying 9 bucks for a chicken dish, I expect there to be chicken in it. 

I will never order from here again. Waste of 40 bucks.
