I was extremely sick where only liquids would stay down so I could only muster up the courage to try this while my friends are family style on different plates (that looked astonishing btw).

This 5 star review is for this only. 

A decadent punch of buttery ecstasy mashed my face in with each and every bite. Not too strong and definitely not weak, the flavor profile was like butter but in its own category. The caviar and sea urchin added a fantastic texture element while the noodles were delicately soft and easy to slurp for a sick stomach like mine.

I would bath myself in this broth daily.

Perfect service - quick, quiet, and always there if we needed them.
