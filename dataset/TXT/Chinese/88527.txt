I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg After pizza, we had to get dessert. This is a small shop that has lots of neat artwork on the walls. Tables fill up fast so you may or may not get seating. Staff here were great. 

Green Tea Milk Tea w/ Honey Boba - This did not really taste like green tea. It had a mild cinnamon flavor so it reminded me more of a horchata. The boba was a little firm and chewy. Yes, we compared the boba to Tea Station and it didn't even come close. 

The Golden Touch - Found this on Instagram under their "secret menu" post. The workers didn't know what it was so it was kind of funny. For those of you that want to know, it was the house blended milk tea, almond pudding (I got custard pudding because they didn't have almond), ice cream, honey boba, Oreos, and caramel glaze. This was actually tasty. The Oreos were my favorite part. I would probably swap out some things to make the flavor pop a little more but I enjoyed it. 

We are from San Diego so it was nice to find boba away from home.
