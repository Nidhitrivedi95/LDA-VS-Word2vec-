SBPttAVjzEnN3VE6sKiaMg We've ate here a few times and every time it's just been fantastic!  The restaurant is extremely clean, the staff are great, and the food is simply exceptional.  

This isn't the stereotypical Chinese restaurant.  This is more of a upscale/gourmet style.  I've had a couple of different dishes from their sizzling beef to their Kung-Pao chicken.  The meat simply melts in your mouth and the sauce comes just as you request, and tasting like no other.

I would highly recommend this place!
