Ly48L1qSRdLpCSWcs_DWIw I've only been here twice and both times I ordered their fried rice. Their fried rice is really really good. It has flavour, but the only thing I didn't like was that it was too oily and the shredded lettuce don't belong in this dish. Decor is nice and the place was packed both times I got there, but wait time was not bad. Staff were quite attentive too.
