cjatara6LkXRu2BXD_jxlA My friend and I were looking for new places to try and came across Chat Bar! 
We came here for an early dinner, without reservations. We waited about 20 mins for a spot. Service was great - the servers spoke mostly in Mandarin even though we were ordering in English lol. We were seated at the booth area. 

Each table had a hot plate to keep the skewers heated, which is nice! 
That kept everything nice and hot.

Highlights of the night (skewers):
* Okra
* Lamb 
* Beef
* Chicken

Sides:
* Enoki mushrooms (These were marinated so well!)

Items I DON'T recommend:

* Rice cakes 
It was SOO HARD to chew on.. omg we only ate 2 lol

* Beef tendons 
This was one of the skewers with the "highly recommended" stamp beside it.. omg bad idea; it was like chewing on rubber with no taste hahaha

* Grilled pork on rice
There's no sauce and the grilled pork was so dry.
