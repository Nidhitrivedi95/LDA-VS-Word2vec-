qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA This was Blockbuster?  Great renos.  Impressed with the iPad menus!  Simple enough to use, or so we thought.  We ordered some food but after nearly 15 minutes, we received nothing but our seaweed salad.  Finally about 10 minutes later or so we received our sushi and sashimi, and then nothing.  The rest of our order showed as "sent" on the iPad but we got nothing.  So the waitress took  a look at our iPad and did some magic and had to check with the kitchen to figure out what had happened with the rest of our order.  After this hiccup, the rest of the night proceeded flawlessly.  

Everything we ordered tasted great-the best being shrimp tempura, flaky, light and crispy.  The only thing we had to order again because it was quite tasty was the mango pudding.  

Heart sushi is an excellent option and a great alternative to Yang's, Wasabi or even Prince.  

We were there at 5:30 pm and got a table right away, but by 7:00 pm it was packed with a bit of a line-up.
