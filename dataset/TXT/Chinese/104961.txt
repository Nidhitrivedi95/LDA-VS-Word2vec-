kSQUHJDQ8xYJAh1DtuTHAQ This review pertains exclusively to the Thai Fried Rice. There is nobody that appreciates a good fried rice as much as me - if you are out there let me know your pick. This place hands down has the best fried rice (Thai Fried Rice) available in the GTA - and possibly beyond. For $6.99 its a bargain and usually lasts me for two meals. They are about ten minutes away from my office and I go there for the rice quite often. Inside looks a little tired but I don't really care as I've only done take out.
If a better fried rice exists in the GTA, pleaseeeeeeeeeee, let me know. If your curious, give it a try, you will not be sorry.
