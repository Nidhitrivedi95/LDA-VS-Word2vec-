SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ We were excited to try out a new sushi place and were extremely disappointed. We ordered 2 California Rolls, a Chicken Tempura Roll, and an order of Veggie Tempura. While the rolls were ok tasting, the Veggie Tempura was a joke. $7.50 for the smallest order of tempura I've ever seen (pic has been posted). It consisted of 2 mushroom slices, 2 pieces of broccoli, 2 tiny slices of onion, and 2 tiny pieces of sweet potato. It's like someone searched for the smallest veggies they could find. A complete rip off. If I had eaten there I would have sent it back which I never do!
