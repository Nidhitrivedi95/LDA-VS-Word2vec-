VVUL1lzBOipXJlOG1wURMg We tried this restaurant for the first time two days ago. Let me start off by saying they did not disappoint! The food was cooked so good, flavour was on point too. The chicken fried rice was not heavy and greasy either, it was very light and flavourful. I wish I would have known it came with eggs in it as I don't like eggs; but you couldn't even taste them. We also order lemon chicken and general tao. The lemon chicken came as fried chicken pieces with lemon sauce in a separate container for you to pour it over yourself. Which I thought was smart incase someone didn't like it. (By the way the lemon chicken without the sauce was amazing.) As for the lay out  I wish that they had a separate waiting area for take-out as you have to walk through the entire restaurant with people eating to order your food, and wait for it. Though the food was cooked relatively quick. The restaurant looked clean and well organized from what I could see. The waitresses were well mannered and had great people skills.
