WEw08dCcOiwH3Sw1f_8DKQ Love this place.  Great authentic northern Chinese/Xinjiang food.  Price is great.  Their steamed lamb buns are so delish....we usually order some to take home to eat too.  They lamb skewer is also highly recommended. Lamb is their specialty here.  

A place like this, you wouldn't be expecting top notch decor/ service.  The place is clean and spacious.  The waitress comes by to fill your tea regularly. So overall a good place to enjoy some authentic dumplins and buns!
