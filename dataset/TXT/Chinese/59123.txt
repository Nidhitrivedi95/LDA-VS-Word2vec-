No fresh fish or meat. Although, they keep a good variety frozen towards the back of the store. 
I love how they always have pork belly when I need to get my chef on!

Recently just opened a restaurant a couple months ago. Pretty much just took over another suite and slapped a door in between the two. 
Food looks amazing though so I'll have to try it out next time.
