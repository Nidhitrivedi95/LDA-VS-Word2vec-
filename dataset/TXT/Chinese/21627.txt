6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q Beautiful decor:  red and gold with a mix of old and new.  But the food did not measure up to the decor and to my expectations.  I'm fortunate enough to live near a hub of great Asian restaurants and markets.  The food here basically tastes like what you get from Chinese takeout places.  Now I don't have an aversion to Chinese takeout, I enjoy it in fact.  But I really thought this place would be a little more special since I saw a large Chinese family partaking on a meal.  The food is mediocre and forgettable, but at least it's affordable (during lunchtime) and the service is pleasant.

I give it 3 stars for the food and 5 stars for the decor.
