Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw What a great surprise!! The food was delicious, fresh, and customer service was great. The potstickers were delicious and had a crispy texture in one side but they were moist inside. I am definitely stopping in if I'm in the area again. I had the Hong Kong style noodles and it was a very large portion with an egg roll. The noodles were soft on the bottom and crunchy on the sides which gave the dish its unique flavor. My kids enjoyed their dishes of beef and broccoli and Kung pao chicken with shrimp. The Kung pao had a kick to it of course. The other dish we ordered was the black pepper chicken which was spicy but oh so good. Overall a great experience to be had . We had a enjoyable lunch in which the place wasn't overcrowded and the food was delicious!
