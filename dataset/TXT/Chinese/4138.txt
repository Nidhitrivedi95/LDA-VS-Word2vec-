_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg I was told by close fiends that new ownership took over this resturant and their chinese food is authentic (that means they don't just serve orange chicken or Kung Po chicken...people that ISN'T chinese food). Finally, I had a chance to give it a try yesterday afternoon. 

The parking is chaotic. It is located in a small parking lot as it is. All the stores in the plaza are marking most of the parking spots. I almost turned around and left simply because everyone was fighting for parking spot aggressively. Fortunately, someone happened to leave the restaurant and I was lucky enough to get the spot. (And someone tried to steal it while I was waiting .... r u crazy???)

The restaurant was super packed and we ended up sharing tables with other customers. Nice people. There were only 3 people working. One is the busboy and two waitresses who are also acting as cashiers and hostess at the same time. Those poor ladies were running around like chicken the entire hour I was there. For appetizer, we ordered fresh cucumber that was marinated in garlic sauce. It was average. For main entree, we ordered green string bean and beef with scallion. String bean is absolutely delicious but the other dish was also average. As I was leaving, I've noticed that most people ordered the noodle dishes and perhaps that was what I should have ordered. 

I'll come back here again to order something else different. But for sure, I will not come back here during lunch rush hour lol overall, I think this place is OK
