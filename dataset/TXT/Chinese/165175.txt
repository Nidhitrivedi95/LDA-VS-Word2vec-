uyoZHZzHaZpqMzXovJxDTw OMG!  This is the place I go to for Chinese when I visit my family in Vegas. This place is so damn good my mouth waters while writing this.  
Like I've said before I always judge a Chinese food restaurant based off there Beef Lo Mien, (or Chow Mien, depending on what part of the country you're from)  Which is a soft long fat round noodle, with no vegetables and extra spicy, and cream cheese wantons.
For Chinese there customer service is top notch, it's cheap, and there establishments always seem very clean.  This particular location I come to because it's close to my parents house.  They also have fountain soda which is kinda important to me. I hate places that charge by the can, and a lot of Chinese places charge by the can.  That's kind of an immediate turn off.  This place is great!
You gotta try them out!
