K4-J1A_ZIzG2yNkee0KOaA I came here about a hour before it was closed for a midnight snack. When we got here the service was horrid, It took nearly a half hour before someone even came to give us water and ask us what we want. That would of been excusable if it was packed, but we were one of the 3 tables that were there at that time. 

The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is simply because of the Deep Fried Crispy Milk Block. Those were delicious as soon as i took the first bite and the milk was oozing out of it. The sweetness of the condense milk and the whole thing being fried was what saved the experience of the restaurant from me just simply bashing on it.
