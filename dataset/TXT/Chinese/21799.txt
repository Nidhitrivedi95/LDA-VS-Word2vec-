6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q i enjoyed the experience at red 8 which was one of the best restaurant experience. Dimsum tatsted great and chestnut shrimp was very delicious.

what i liked the most was the servers and the hosts are very friendly and seem to enjoy what they were doing.

but the weakness was that the price was little overated compare to other locan chinese restaurants
