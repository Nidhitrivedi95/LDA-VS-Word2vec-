pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA We were there with a group of 14 for a company dinner. After calling MANY places in Vegas which required a credit card to hold a reservation for a large party, Sushi Samba came through. Friendly staff, no card needed and seriously no hassles at all. they had at least three servers who looked like they were catering to our table alone, especially one lady who was like our private waitress. Lots of Sake, great sushi, appetizers, stew dishes ect, So much was ordered for the table and I didnt do the ordering, so im sorry I cant remember each individual thing but MAN WAS ALL OF IT GOOD!. 

One star is for the rest of the restaurant as it has no atmosphere really. 

I would definately go here with a group. Good food and it didnt make me sick as one review says. 

We were pleased with out choice.
