GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog 3 and 1/2 stars is an under-rating for China Poblano. Mexican / Chinese food or Chi-Mex is a staple in NYC though usually out of a bodega storefront, this place makes the two cuisines a delightful fusion. Though the portions could be bigger / coming from an American that's a huge eye-roll, the food was delicious. Highly recommended are the dan dan noodles of which we got two orders and the mango sticky rice which we were tempted to order a second bowl of. Maybe I'm just a glutton but I really enjoyed the food and experience here. Even ran into an old co-worker with excellent food taste so, that helped to confirm my feeling. 

Must try!
