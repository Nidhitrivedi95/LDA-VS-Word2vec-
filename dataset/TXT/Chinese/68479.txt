eS8OuIk6_fMNNslFnj8noA The food was actually very good. Unfortunately for my wife and I, the management is not on par with the food. The lady was rude and condescending. She screwed my order up due to a language barrier problem, then wanted to be combative about it. You screwed up lady. There is only one way to order panang chicken and that is by saying "Panang Chicken" please,  which is exactly what I did. Guess it is back to driving to Reign of Thai again. You don't deserve my patronage.
