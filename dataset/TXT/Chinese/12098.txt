2nQ2_o5pPUMByU86bDjOeg It was edible. I didn't enjoy my meal. I've had much better Chinese takeaways. It was more expensive than the usual takeaway I go to. The Szechuan king prawn was terrible. They had added weird flavours that made it floral and unpleasant. The egg fried rice was over done. The veggie spring rolls were soggy and flat with a weird taste in the middle. The chips were good. The prawn crackers were dry. 

The bottom line is, I will not return to so good Chinese.
