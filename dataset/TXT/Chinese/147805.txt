If you love dumplings, you'll love it....over 15 types of dumplings, it's definitely cute and homey.  The place is clean, and most most MOST of all it's all home made and fresh and affordable !!! Even their noodles are homemade...you can taste the difference.  Their dumplings are made perfect, the crust/ or dough isn't thick, so you're not just eating dough.  Also the dumplings were not oily, which is a PLUS! definitely coming back here for Dumplings...great Dumpling Dive!
