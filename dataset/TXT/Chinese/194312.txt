zfiSQ1dl3vTJ-og96eqXGA Been looking for a good Chinese food restaurant. I miss my Chicago days when I had several good Chinese restaurants to choose from... Today I found it. I'm no longer impressed with Pei Wei. J
I had shrimp egg foo young special with pork fried rice and and an egg roll. The egg foo young patties were huge. Plenty of shrimp.
