_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA They didn't want us to pay! We had a group of 10 and got our food and drinks quickly, but then were were quickly forgotten...some even went across to another bar to get a second round of drinks. Half eaten entrees sat out on the table for 30+ min while we waited on someone to bring us a check. We were ignored and eventually had to chase someone down to pay, then again to correct overcharging for items. It was an extremely bizarre experience all the way around. 

Vegetarian options are very limited and my shrimp dish had only 4 shrimp for a TON of noodles. Several people enjoyed their meals at our table, but more people did not. (Supposedly the chicken fried rice is about as bland as you can get.) 

Not recommended...there are surely better Asian options in Vegas.
