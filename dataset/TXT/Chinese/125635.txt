Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w Tin Tin has been a good restaurant for us. 
I think sometimes it gets a bad rap because the waiters are always very busy and can come off as rude. It slightly just comes with the territory, I think. This place is always packed for a reason. If you can realize that the waiters are not being rude to you personally/directly, then I think you'll have a great experience. The food is good. There's plenty to choose from and considering there is endless crab legs, the price is very fair. 
I recommend Tin Tin to my friends.
