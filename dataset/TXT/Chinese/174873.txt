wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw I would like to take back my negative review of Wonton Gourmet from several months back. I've come to realize that although Wonton has so-so service, the food is hands down the BEST Cantonese food in all of Cleveland! The price is also fair! 

Make sure you order the braised beef or fish and the jade tofu!
