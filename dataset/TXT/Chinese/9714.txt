1uPQTz5XZSWr0ti7kUpaDw Mai is a great place in Chinatown in an unassuming spot with an unassuming frontage. The lettering on the top of the restaurant is faint and sort of hidden. Almost like they don't really want you to read that you have arrived at a great hand-made-to-order dumpling house. Having eaten here once. Just once. I don't want anyone else to know where it is. I want to save it for myself but here am I. 

Our party of six got seated in a short while. It's good for groups. Six is a nice big size. Eight would be pushing it. You have your standard menu with dumplings broken out by main protein categories: pork, beef, lamb, and seafood. They also have dumplings in soup, not to be confused with soup dumplings. The former they have. The later they do not. 

We ordered beef curry which was right on curry flavor and spicy such that the beef was not lost in it. We also ordered the pork and pickled Chinese cabbage, which was the table favorite, and some seafood one that was good but underwhelming. Half of our order was steamed and the other fried. You should know fried dumplings are a buck and fifty cents extra per order, which is worth it, although dumplings were good enough as it. I would eat it raw and uncooked if I had them. It didn't look like you could order anything wrong. So what you really like is going to be personal. I'm ready to go back and see what can beat beef & curry one for me. 

Make sure to bring your A game with your chopsticks! The steam and water makes it a bit tricky eating it. And be careful of the water trapped from the steaming inside the dumplings. It is hot.
