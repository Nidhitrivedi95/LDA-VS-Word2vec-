That's probably the best part about dim sum in general - having the food pretty much ready all the time. The downside is that you can be somewhat beholden to the food preferences of others. Unless you don't mind ordering an entire plate of something for yourself, of course. I didn't feel like that today, opting instead with an aggressive first-and-last-bite sniper approach.

Anyway, you don't need to hear my secrets, so here's the stuff you should know: the food was always hot and yummy. Not extremely great quality, but everything that I tasted was pretty good. Well, except the egg tart - that bad boy is ridiculous. I feel the plaques forming in my blood vessels already. I was also surprised by the Chinese-style meatball. I couldn't figure out what was going on at first, but I do believe there's quite a bit of cilantro flavor going on. It was also very tender, and for a first-time experience, it left me wanting more. Luckily, I think I got my fill after noticing that nobody at my table seemed to want to kill the meatballs. I was more than happy to oblige.

I gave it a second try, and I think I'll give East Ocean a third try and more. It's definitely a solid place for Henderson folks to chow down on dim sum.
