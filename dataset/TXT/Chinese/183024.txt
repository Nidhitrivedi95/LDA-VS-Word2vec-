Xl70366GI5Qao-ORQYCofA I was craving Chinese food and decided to give this place a go. It was close and I'm inpatient when hungry. It was ok. Not sure if would go vack. The hot and sour soup had shrimp and imitation crab meat. Never seen that before and hopefully never will again. Where's the pork? That would make it a proper HSS. I also ordered house fried rice. No complaints there. Also Tuesday pot stickers were decent. That's about it. I'm ready for dinner now....
