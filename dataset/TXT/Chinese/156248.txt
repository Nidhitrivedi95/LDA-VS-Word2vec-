trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ Food was average and probably should get 3 stars at best. What I had a problem with was the bartender and his crappy attitude. 

I was in Toronto for work and had dinner here with my coworker. We ordered a few things and until then the bartender was nice and even gave us a free shots. However, the bill came and because I have a cap on my dinner expense I was going to leave some tip on the card and the rest in cash and after the bartender prematurely took the bill (cash was not in there yet) he started making snide ass comments making sure that we would hear. He said something along the line of "I guess in America tipping 10% is totally fine! I guess people work for 2 hours for only __ amount!"- Something along those line. 

Seriously? 

I gave the manger more cash telling him of what happened but I wish I hadn't considering the event but I've worked at restaurants before and always try to be fair with tip. 

Btw, if this place is one of Toronto's best restaurants, I feel really bad for the food scene in Toronto.
