ldKrUirpZZ6JDnNwOwLpvw The place was clean to start with so that is always a good sign. The bathroom is also clean. 
The service was very good, they really paid attention to us and ask if we needed anything. They also took the plates very quickly, so the table doesn't fill up.
The food all in all is good. I loved the frog legs, sushi, and so much more. Really nice place and a good price for a buffet
