EhGPj8iJDIdaHnWg9d5BgA as far as dim sum places go, this one is good.

the view of the harbourfront is amazing.
it's serene and it's beautiful

the food was good but nothing was spectacular.
their offerings are pretty standard as far as dim sum is concerned.
it's solid at best and quite pricey.
parking is a hassle, there is a wait, and the service is typical of any dim sum place.

i would go back if i were in toronto again, but more for the view than the food.
