ZRe7iIrIRDMMWhrcieMsiQ the best BOBA in town.
they use fresh fruit in all of their smoothies.
the boba is cooked perfectly - not too soft, not too hard, spot on!
and not too much either.
the proportion of drink to boba is exactly how we like it.

gotta say, the small mom and pop joints are still far better than all of the franchises.
