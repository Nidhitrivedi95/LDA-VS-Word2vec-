yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA As a homegrown Las Vegas local, its sad to see where this place is now. 

Before the 2 expansions, It was a excellent, hole-in-the-wall vietnamese restaurant. It was all the rave in town, constantly packed and everything about it was great. Great tasting hot broth and fresh vegetables and noodles. 

Then, the expansion. It seems that all the owner is thinking about now is maximizing profit. Such is apparent by the reduction in overall quality and waitstaff. Pho broth is bland, food is overpriced in accordance to the price and the service is negligible. I do have to say however their Chinese food isn't half bad. Although I'd rather go to K.J. Kitchen for that. 

Maybe I'm just being an elitist, or am still bummed that this place used to be so good. Nonetheless, this place is nothing more than average by far. 

Ahh, then I discovered Saigon 8.
