IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Yesterday, I was craving some soup after I saw their advertisement in the Mandalay Bay in house dining section.. I really didn't care for the chicken wraps as much. I think pf changs has better ones in my opinion. I ordered their pho w/ chicken instead of beef. I have to say it was one of the best I've ever tried... I am super picky about my pho. It's so good, that I might go again tonight!
