nH9sGGOaW0ONeIYcmsK3EQ I came here for their afternoon tea time special. All dim sum is only $1.78 between 1:30-4pm, execpt for the ones that are special and listed as $2.50. Dim sum is cheap, fresh, and quite good. Tea price is $0.50/person. Their rice noodle wrapped chinese donut is amazing. I also enjoy their different style rice as well as their egg tart. I see people ordering 10+ more dimsum and bringing them home. I mean the rice is only $1.78, you can save it for lunch tomorrow. Their stir fry noodle with beef is only $3.99. It is a little oily, but quite good for its price. Service is efficient.
