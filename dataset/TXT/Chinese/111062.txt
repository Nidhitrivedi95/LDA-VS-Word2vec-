M0A8RFdN1UqSd-tIqXFEBQ Im not sure if eating here one time is enough to give it a serious review, but I probably wont be returning. The food at Golden Gate wasnt bad, it just wasnt great. Do they use MSG? For me the sodium level was off the charts and the food lacked flavor. We tried the pineapple fried rice, moo goo gai pan and singapore noodles, none of which really stood out. On a happy note the people were very friendly.
