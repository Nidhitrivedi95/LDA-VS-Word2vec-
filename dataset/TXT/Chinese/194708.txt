zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I can finally cross Momofuku noodle bar off my bucket list. Came here by myself after a long day of work and got the kitchen counter seating which I enjoyed though there were no interactions between the line cooks and the customer. I got the Momofuku Ramen and was not impressed so I'm not exactly sure what the hype is all about for Momofuku. The broth lacked depth IMO. I prefer the chewy texture of ramen noodles and it wasn't so at this place. I probably need to try the original location in NYC and that could change my mind. But at least now I can say I've been to Momofuku, hah. 

The Old Fashioned IS good.
