VAMXWyvUI4qzfNDPoMr5-Q It's pretty standard Chinese affair.  For takeout, it's not bad and they give a sufficient portion, but don't expect them to knock your socks off with service, experience, or anything else.

I actually have a pretty bad bias against this place - many years ago when I was but a highschool lad, I came here with a few of my friends after a tiring game of street hockey.  We spoke in English, and ordered quite a few dishes including Dow Mew - not a cheap plate of veggies!  It took them an incredibly long time to cook the food, and we actually overhead them speaking in Cantonese about how we "were just kids" and "there was no need to rush".  Needless to say, we were pretty dissatisfied and boycotted the place for half a decade.

That aside, the food isn't bad at all - although it does tend to be a bit greasy ala most Chinese restaurants of the same ilk.  The place is rather small and they really try to pack as many ppl as they can, so eating a meal there can be somewhat of a harrowing experience.  

If you're getting takeout, I would highly suggest ordering in advance as there is not much room to wait for your food.

Must-try foods include the XO-sauce fried turnip cake, and a the "tossed soup noodle" that must be eaten in (taking it home just doesnt' have the same effect - I actually don't know the real name for this, but it essentially arrives as ingredients in a bowl and soup in a different bowl, and you mash it together and eat it while it's piping hot).
