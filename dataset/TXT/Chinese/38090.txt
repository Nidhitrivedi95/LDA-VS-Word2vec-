aTbz9GdpAf2M5MeAHVNhWw Unfortunately, not particularly sanitary in the kitchen; you risk food poisoning.  (Amended review a few hours later when symptoms were obvious. Ugh. Never again.)

I feel misled by Yelp here; the reason there are so many 4 and 5 star reviews is diners were offered discounts or free items if they posted positive reviews.

Otherwise: Reasonable Chinese food (apparently specializing in Yunnan at some point, more noodles now, but most common dishes as well), and inexpensive lunch combos.  Nice location, well decorated and comfortable.  Staff were friendly but not very attentive, even when there were only a few guests.  The thing which scares me is the C rating with the health department, and appearing on the news as a dirty dining option; couldn't see into the kitchen, but while the dining area and food appeared fine, it is hard to tell what goes on in the back.  Without that concern, would be a solid 3.

(EDITED: dropped it down to 1 star because a few hours after eating here, I had (have) all the symptoms of food poisoning.  Ugh.)
