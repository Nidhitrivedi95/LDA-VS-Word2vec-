RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw I live really close to this restaurant so my family ate there pretty frequently. The food is fantastic and authentic. The staff are reasonably attentive, although it can get pretty busy. Expect to wait if you arrive around dinner or lunch. This is a place that students often will go to for a midnight snack.

Typically, our family of four will get two congees, an eel fried rice, sometimes a stone bowl-cooked rice dish, and two stir-fry vegetable dishes.
