SxjNgkzAlUG-wt2rSbc2HQ I must say, New Ho is probably one of my favourite Chinatown spots. Not only because they have fed me when I was dying of hunger at 4 am, but because they have the best hot and sour soup EVER, and because they have a secret late night menu.

Yes, it's a secret, and I don't even want to tell everyone about it, but here goes: New Ho preys on all the drunk idiots who stumble in from Richmond Street at 3 am because they don't know about the Late Night Menu. If you ask for this menu, the server will silently go grab the menu and hand it to you in the least obvious way, so no one else sees. Everything on the Late Night Menu is the same as the day menu, except WAY cheaper.

New Ho is a delicious, Chinese restaurant with the typical plastic tablecloths and pots of Jasmine tea, and they even humour you with fortune cookies (ever since I learned that fortune cookies don't actually exist in China, I've been less enthusiastic about them). It's also the restaurant used in one of the Ontario Government commercials warning teenagers not to start gambling -- the one where all the friends are waiting for the one kid who is still at home addicted to playing Poker. Classic.

Anyway, I'd like to think New Ho is a Toronto staple, so if you're coming here for a visit, give it a chance. And now that you know about the Late Night Menu, you can enjoy the wonderful, greasy food for super cheap. I know. You're welcome.
