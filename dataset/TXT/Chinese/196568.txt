ZN8EHmoe4Xjy4q4Y8ROEfw This little hole-in-the-wall joint has some of the best pho i've ever tried, I will 1000% be back. The meat is tender and the broth has so much flavor. The spring rolls were really good too but not as cold as i would prefer. The atmosphere is underwhelming and it was completely empty when we were there, but multiple people stopped by to pick up to go orders. Not exactly an impressive place for a date night but the food is fantastic. The staff was so friendly and accommodating by far one of the best places for pho I've been to in scottsdale!
