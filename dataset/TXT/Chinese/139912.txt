Qzq-m_TKJ-Iv1BmYLcjlVA Don't go here looking for ambiance. This is a classic hole in the wall.

Rather my suggestion would be to go with your best friends to catch up over some good comfort food. The spicy dragon chicken is worth a try - its basically dry chicken with red chilli powder or something like that tossed freely with sauteed white onions.

We paid about 50$ for a meal for 4 with leftovers to bring home.
