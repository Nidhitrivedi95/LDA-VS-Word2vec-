JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A I love this little mom and pop Korean place. My brother in law who is Korean, said it reminded him of home cooked style food. Which coincidentally the Chinese characters <U+5BB6><U+9109> that are part of their sign actually mean "hometown" in English. One of my favorite dishes there is their jajangmyeon, black bean noodles. You get a plentiful helping of noodles in black bean sauce with bits of pork. I normally have enough left over for another meal. I also really like their take on Sundae, blood sausage. Of course all of their bbq is good too.
