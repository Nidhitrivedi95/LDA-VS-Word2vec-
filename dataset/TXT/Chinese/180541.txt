X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I went to Hakkassan with my girls last night, it was a good time however the place is very outdated and needs to be renovated. For that reason i'm taking away a star. It's Vegas - it should be nicer than what it looks like right now.

We had contact with a super kind promoter named Steven, he sat us at a table with a few other girls immediately and said we had the table for the rest of the night. of course someone bought the table later on but by that we were exhausted and called it a night. It gets very jam packed in here! 

It was a good time but i'm not sure if i'd come back!
