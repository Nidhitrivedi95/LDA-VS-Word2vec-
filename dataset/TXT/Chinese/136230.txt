qEe0mdIax3pz3DH4RPj3sQ My dad took a wrong turn off the highway and we wound up here. We had the shredded chicken cold noodle, black vinegar sugar braised deep fried fish fillets, green onion pancake, tiny pea shoots and cumin lamb, and ended the meal with the pan fried red bean pancake dessert. Big portions, good prices, very authentic numbing spice with savoury flavours. Also not too salty! 10/10 would return again.
