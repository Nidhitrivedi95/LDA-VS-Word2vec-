This restaurant is located in the Golden Square plaza behind Btrust Supermarket. 
It serves Northern Chinese hand-pulled noodles among other dishes. 
After about a 20-minute wait, we were seated at a table.
The place was very busy so service was definitely staggered but pleasant. 

We ordered the braised beef soup with sliced noodles, the hot and sour pork with sliced noodles, and a couple meat skewers.
Braised Beef: Good but lacking a bit of flavour. I usually expect anything braised to be a bit more intense than what I tasted here. Also, we weren't sure what the 'sliced noodles' would look like but they were quite big, kind of like a slightly flatter udon noodle. 
Hot and Sour Pork: The soup had great flavour but the pork was very much lacking. The few cuts that were in it, were probably 90% fat. This was disappointing but if you're not a big meat lover, this dish comes with potatoes; tofu; and carrots which sort of made up for it.
Meat skewers: We got lamb and beef. Both were looked quite dry but they were actually really juicy and delicious. Only point of criticism is that the size of the skewers were a bit small for what you're paying.

Overall, pretty good. Not the best hand-pulled noodles I've had but I would visit again.
