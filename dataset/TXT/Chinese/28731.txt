8U9nnnInBAvQLaX5LHrJ0g ordered Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, received Egg Drop Soup with chunks of imitation crab and 'Shrimp in Lobster sauce' on the lid. When I called back inquiring why, I was told they informed me this was soup when I ordered, which is courious as it is not listed under soup, nor did they mention it was soup. 

Good Luck, you are testing it with this place, if they lie about their posted menu what else are they lying about...rats in the kitchen???? Cat tastes just like Chicken!!!
