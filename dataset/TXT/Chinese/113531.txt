MpT8KheTjs7TSDWIoMUFxg We were on this ice of town and we're craving Chinese food. Checked out yelp and this is where we ended up. The food was mediocre, we ordered combination fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, beef lo mein, and egg drop soup. The combination rice had large pieces of shrimp which we loved. But everything else was just ok.
