CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ This is the same Little Sheep Hot Pot that has spread across China becoming the Chinese equivalent to say Olive Garden or maybe comparing it to Sizzler's is more accurate. Even though this is the same restaurant, it's been "localized" for better or worse. 

To begin with, it's buffet style. Grab your plate and walk up to the front and pile on the food.  Seafood only makes an appearance for dinner, which is why the evening price is quite a bit more. The front has a section of fountain drinks to choose from and a variety of pre-cooked snacks. The pre-cooked stuff is OK when fresh, but mediocre to bad once the egg rolls, onion rings and other items get cold.

The selection of vegetables is acceptable, but again this is where the "localization" impacts things. The veggies and mushrooms are all very safe, nothing is too exotic and this can of course be extended to the meats and seafood which all remain very acceptable to western palettes. 

This is probably the best hot pot restaurant in Montreal but is pretty mediocre as far as "authentic" hot pot is concerned. During my last visit some of the seafood was called into question and we were getting a pretty awful stench from an unidentified location. I'll go back for sure and I'll even recommend it to others, but remember you are dealing with raw meat and seafood and vegetables in a buffet environment so be on-guard for any suspect food.
