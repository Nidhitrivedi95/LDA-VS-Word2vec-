5h2DIYpfzc7KDTFg18uuew The food here is fabulous, my only problem is how dirty the place is. The door knob, the tables, the counter. They don't clean anything. I overlook that though and keep going back because the food is so good. I usually just get it to go. Great portions, they prepare it fast. The Sesame Beef is perhaps my fav food in the world! If they'd get out the Lysol and wipe things down I'd give them five stars
