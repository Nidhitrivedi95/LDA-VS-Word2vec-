t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA I wish I could have eaten the food at the restaurant! 

We got take out and ate at our hotel two miles away, and by the time I got back, everything had leaked curry sauce, the eggrolls were soggy from steam.  :( 
I can tell it would taste great fresh! 
The "Baked" tofu with vegetables and basil sauce was super good.  It was basically just whole basil leaves, but had great flavor and was not overly salty.  The BBQ pork bun was a lot doughier than I'm used to- and yes I understand they are steamed bread, and always somewhat doughy. 
I loved the curry, which was not thick and sweet, but just curry-hot.  Vegetables and meats were all cooked perfectly, and the woman who took my order was very helpful in determining whether we wanted "authentic" or "American" versions of soups and eggrolls. 
A to-go station had all the chopsticks, utencils, napkins, and sauces.  If I lived in Champaign I don't doubt this would be my go-to Chinese restaurant.
