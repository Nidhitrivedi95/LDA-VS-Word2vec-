E9aC5bLfXdQVZ5csvLuLJg i got a crazy boba craving tonight at like 9:20. my normal go-to place, the street, wasn't answering their phone and I had no idea if they were open or not. (i like how i call this my 'normal go-to' as if i have been a customer forever, let's be honest, ive been like twice. BUT i like it enough to call it my normal spot).

anyway, so i saw this place and decided to check it out. I called at 9:30 and the lady said they close at 9 but still had customers so I could come. i rushed my behind there so fast for my boba. i was not disappointed! 

this time i decided to get a few different flavors and put them in my fridge for tomorrow. i now regret this decision but what can i say? you do crazy things when you need a fix. 

so i got the following:
red bean- ok
green tea-  no thank you
thai tea- enjoyable
milk honey tea- yes please

I drank half of the red bean before it was too much and tossed it. it had a chalky texture? i totally tossed the green tea after a sip. and now i have the thai and my milk honey in my fridge for tomorrow.

the cons:
i spent $18, seriously, what the heck was i thinking?! 
they charge you $.50 per drink to add boba and I think it was room temperature? my drink was cold but the bubbles were not, i think they should chill them like the street does. it makes them way better.
and they charge to use credit so thankfully I had cash :) 

so, i will go back if they stay open just for me and i am desperate. but if  the street is open, that is my first choice. 

thank you for giving me my fix, TFE. you have a sweet spot in my heart.


BTW- boba goes bad in the fridge, it gets hard and gross. don't do what i did.
