Steamed mini pork dumpling $5.99
Fried leek and pork dumpling $5.99
Pork wonton soup $7.99

Get the first 3. Sooooooo goooood. Especially the steamed pork dumplings because it has soup in it (beware you will burn yourself). Wonton was meh, didn't have much taste so add soy sauce as needed. 

Everything is made from scratch which is not as quick as a typical dimsum place but so worth the wait. 

Get that fix!
