qf4w82L2F7xJwh1i82uYHA Well, after having a pretty terrible experience at Maki of Japan at the northlake food court, I was eager to try Yeung's to see if their Asian food is any better. Better, yes, is it much better no?
I got the singapore noodle and the lo-mein. The lo-mein tasted like soy sauce, the flavor was not impressive. THe singapore noodle while greasy lacks salt, i was seriously about to walk back and get a couple packets of salt for my noodle. The price  here is $6.10 for a 1 entree with 1 side plate. Spring rolls are $1.32...Soups are like $1.50. The price is not bad, not much different than Maki. They accept credit card but not American express.
