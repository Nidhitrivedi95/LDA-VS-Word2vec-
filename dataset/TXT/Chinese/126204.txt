Ozf92eEJSwwb3LbO50cvag We moved to the area from out of state and had really good Chinese take-out. With our move to AZ we no longer had our favorite go-to restaurants. We ordered from a few different places before stumbling across Tao Kitchen with less than desirable experiences. It's close to our house and the food is good. It is a little pricey but I feel like you get a lot of food.
