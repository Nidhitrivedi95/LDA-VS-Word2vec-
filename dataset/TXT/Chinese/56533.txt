czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA We placed a pick up order and immediately upon walking in I knew the food would be yummy. There were people dining in and looking happy. The place was clean and didn't smell funky. 

We ordered the Family B Dinner Special w Sweet n Sour Chicken, Kung Pao Combination, War Wonton and fried rice. We also ordered the Pad Thai and Hunan Beef.  When I was setting everything up I was super super impressed at the fact that they packed the sauce for our sweet and sour chicken separately- because who wants soggy food? That right there lets me know Rice n Noodle is up on their customer service. I snuck a piece of the chicken and found it to be crispy- yet light and not greasy!  The Hunan beef was so yummy! Perfect combination of spicy sweet. Kung Pao combo was my fave! Veggies were fresh and the sauce was super tasty. Everything else was also yummy and I wasn't pouring soy sauce or anything else on it! Their cooks obviously know what they're doing.

Conclusion- glad we ventured out and found delicious not greasy and clean tasting Chinese take out!
