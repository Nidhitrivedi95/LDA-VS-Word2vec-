ygJshif4VuxL1ijnRJnuYA Came here with my parents for a Sunday night dinner. I guess everyone else had the same idea as us because it was packed. Service is pretty good with staff often coming around to tables. The menu is a good size - not too overwhelmingly long yet there is something for everyone. We ordered three dishes with 2 bowls of rice (Sweet & Sour Chicken, Sautéed Chinese broccoli, beef sirloin in sauce). Generous portions, you will likely take food home. For a night out in Chinatown, Lee Garden is a good choice.

Good for: tourists, Chinese food
