WzrMNz9eUF78RgZGDTS8xg I used to LOVE PEI WEI
NO MORE to their positive they catered my business's X Mass party and it was great.
But on an individual dinner basis I have been disappointed. Also they are running a gift card special and have the signs almost hidden. I spent $170 for the office party wouldn't it have been nice for someone to point them out. Why have the offer and not promote it.????
