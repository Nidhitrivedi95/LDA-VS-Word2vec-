1qTx9z8RMz7RIYKAfnpZ0A This place wasn't to bad. I definitely wouldn't come back for the Sushi but the main dishes were pretty good. I had the sea bass and it went down pretty smooth. Pretty pricy place just for one person with drinks, I spent around $118.00 just for me with a desert.

The service isn't the best here, they make you feel rushed and the waitress seem like she wanted to be there at the same time.

I'd look else where if your looking to spend that kind of money
