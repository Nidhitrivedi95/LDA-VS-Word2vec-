I had the spicy beef and an order of the crispy spicy eggplant. Both were Delicious! Service was excellent. Only problem I had which isn't to big of a problem is that when eating leftovers for dinner the texture wasn't as appetizing as it was fresh. Which just means I need to eat all that I order!

Definitely on my go back list!
