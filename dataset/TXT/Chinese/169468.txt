vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q Super authentic! LOVE IT!

Stopped in here for late night food at 2200 and was surprised that they serve food so late.

This is definitely a FOB-U-LOUS dive-y place.  They had Jellyfish on the menu and of course I HAD to order it.  It was so tasty! I should have ordered more of it.  Where else are you going to find Jellyfish served at 2200???

The fried flounder was also very good.  It's not a lot of meat but it was just enough.  This thing must have been flopping around before it went in the fryer because it tasted really fresh.  YUM!
