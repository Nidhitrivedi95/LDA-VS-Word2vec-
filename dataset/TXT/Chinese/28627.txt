8QQuup7LTjYgXbP3pA446Q I went twice with their 'Combo 3' option which consists of either noodles or rice with 3 selections of your choice (with about 20 options) to go with your meal. Thus far I tried the mango chicken, the bang bang chicken, the grilled chicken and the pepper beef. My ratings go as follows :

Grilled Chicken : 5/5
Yummy! They do grilled chicken right with a sweet sauce that make my taste-buds happy after some serious shopping. Will get this every time I come here!!

Bang Bang Chicken : 4/5
Tangy and flavorful this chicken is a nice compliment to the sweet grilled chicken sauce. Will choose this often on consequent re-visits.

Rice : 4/5
Big portion (probably to give you less main food) but it's fresh and tasty. I'd like to try the noodles next time.

Mango Chicken : 3/5
Tastes like... mild mango and chicken? It's OK but I will try something else next time.

Pepper Beef : 2/5
I thought the taste was a bit light on the pepper and there was too much "cream". Wouldn't have it again.

All in all, solid food court grub. Service is quick and friendly.
