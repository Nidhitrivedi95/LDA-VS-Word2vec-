0XlbdDkYzC14SZF_bUGeXA I've been ordering from Chef Chan since i moved into the area 10 yrs ago. The pricing is high for sub-par food. If you want to order a combo, forget about asking for an equal value substitution, they will charge you $2.00 or more for each substitution, with an argument of it being discounted as a combo. Even when i pointed out that the substitution had the same value or less. That's b.s.!! I can understand if i was switching my item in the combo for a more expensive item, but has not been the case. The food is ok, but there are much better places nearby to order from without any hassles. I also once found a fruit/food fly in the sweet & sour sauce for my chicken balls.
