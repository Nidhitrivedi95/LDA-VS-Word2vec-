jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg I have been here multiple times on different Las Vegas trips, food is absolutely delicious and authentic.  We have ordered fresh seafood, tofu, noodles and many more .  They offer fresh Chinese vegetables here as well you have to know what to order or you can ask them and they will be happy to assist you with the ordering.

The only down side to this restaurant may be it is a little pricy but it is worth it because you do get what you pay for.

Definitely good Chinese food.
