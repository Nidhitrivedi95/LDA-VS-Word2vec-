qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w I am reading a lot of negative comment about this restaurant but based on a fellow "eastcoaster's" recommendation I tried it. I honestly gotta say.. I loved it! Maybe I got lucky the 1st time... IDK . Got pupu platter, fried rice, lo mein... I have been looking for chinese similar to back home and this is it!! Anyone from back east knows what I'm talking about when it comes to "west coast chinese" and "east coast chinese" food.. Not the Best but definately the best I have found out here. If anyone has any other recommendations please do share with me!! THANKS!!
