ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg Congee Queen is in a little strip mall on the southwest corner of Lawrence and the West Donway.  It's a cheap, cheerful and plentiful chinese restaurant in the same vein as Congee Star and Asian King, offering a plentiful menu with congee, noodle dishes, barbecue, etc.

The menu has some really nice photos of the food -- beware that serving sizes are large, larger than the photos, so don't order more than you need because you expect the serving sizes to be smaller than they are.

We had lunch there today, with:
- Clam, Mustard Green and Salted Egg congee: this was decent without really standing out for me.  It was well-prepared, but wasn't my favorite combination of congee ingredeitns.
- 1/2 BBQ Duck: Good, without being peking-duck-like (BBQ duck isn't, usually, but I always hope it will be anyway).
- Crispy Cantonese Chow Mein: I always love crispy noodle dishes, and this one was a solid contender.
- A tofu dish on chinese greens whose name escapes me. It was good without being stellar.

Basically, that was the theme -- I enjoyed each dish, nothing bad and nothing really superb.  I'd go again, but since Congee Star is pretty similar and closer to this office, I'm more likely to go there. I might slightly prefer Congee Queen to Congee Star, but they're close enough that the variance doesn't matter to me.
