1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I have been going here for years because I like the divey, hole in the wall impression. I find the menu to be a variety of comfort chinese food. 
It satisfies my cravings for a little bit of everything at affordable prices.
My favorites are the hainanese rice with dipping sauces, thai chili ong choy, chicken wings, drunken chicken with lup cheong, curry chicken with roti pancakes,  won ton soup, and fried won tons.
Always satisfying.
