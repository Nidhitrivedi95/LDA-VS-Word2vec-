Their prices are cheaper than any pho place I've found in Phoenix yet, and they give you more meat/noodles as well, and the broth isn't too oily. Spring rolls are great (around here places can have subpar rolls, even though it's an easy fix), and their banh mi are delicious, meat's made fresh daily by an auntie in house. Iced coffee is great too. Literally can't complain about anything, I'm so glad I found them!
