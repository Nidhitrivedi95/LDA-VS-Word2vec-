X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg This is one of the best nightclubs I've seen in a very long time.  They did a great job with the design of the club, especially the light and sound.  We were there on 4/26 to see Deadmau5.  We reserved a booth on the 2nd floor overlooking the main room...it was amazing!  The laser/light show was perfectly suited for the music and done very well.  From our vantage point, it was exceptional.

We setup the booth well in advance and it was easy for us to get in.  It's a mega-nightclub in Vegas, you have to expect to wait if you don't have things setup in advance....it cracks me up to read the reviews complaining about the lines, etc.

The bottles were reasonable....Magnum of Patron & Goose for $950.  Our VIP server was very accommodating and attentive, keeping our mixers full and replenishing our bottles when they emptied.  We had 16+ people in our booth, so the alcohol was being consumed pretty fast.  I have no idea what the final damage was for the evening....well over $5000.

Now for the music....Deadmau5 was simply amazing.  He came on around 1 am and tore it up.  There wasn't a bad spot in the club....the club is engineered well and the bass/highs/mids were perfect throughout.  I didn't want the night to end, it was that good.

1 level below the main floor, there's a Hip Hop lounge and a Hip Hop room.  We did wander there for a little while to check it out before Deadmau5 came on.  The lounge was dead....only 5 or 6 people there.  That was strange....I bet they change the format of the music within a week or two.  The main Hip Hop room was jammed packed.  It too was well engineered for sound and lights.  I like how they put it in the center of the room and there's a walkway that goes around the perimeter...it makes for easy people watching and access to the main floor.

Overall, I rate this place 5 Stars and can't wait to come back as long as they continue to have great DJ's.

Tip:  Don't park at the MGM Grand.  It's 1000x easier to park at the Tropicana Hotel valet and walk over....seriously.
