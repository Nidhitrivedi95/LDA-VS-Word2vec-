GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g The decor was nice but everything else about this experience was subpar. Starting with the choice of a Zen mojito as a cocktail which ended up being both too sour and yet too full of berries to enjoy. I ended up not finishing my drink. 

The calamari was too salty although the crispy take on a restaurant staple was interesting. The lamb chops we're good and so was the fried rice. However the service was very uninspired. We won't be returning.
