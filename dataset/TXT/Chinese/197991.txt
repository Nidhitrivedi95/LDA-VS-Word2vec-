ZuNJelvkJD4wsXNBRg6t5w This is purely from the perspective of finding a modest, local, family owned Chinese (they also have Thai dishes) take-out joint. We've ordered delivery from here several times. The food comes in less than 30 mins to Providence; real quick! The food is always hot and delicious. We've also, sat down to eat.  The place is clean and the service is above par. The owner did come and give us complimentary freshly cut oranges after our meal. They have some very good lunch specials that run from 11a - 4p. I defiantly can say that the taste, quality, and price of the food is a step above Panda Express. I would recommend coming here if you need that quick fix from a family owned business.
