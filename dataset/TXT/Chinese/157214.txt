TTLDDEeUyOkM4JEsGkIYmw I have to admit, for a food court, they are pretty decent.  I find their soup noodles/ramen a bit salty, but of course, I find all ramen salty.  

However, I think this is probably the best Asian fast food joint in the Square One food court because:

a) You have the option of doing combos or made fresh to order;
b) The fresh to order is pretty good and tastes semi-authentic.  I've had their Mongolian beef and their curry fried rice.  Both had good flavours.
c) Apparently, their sesame balls are pretty good here too.  

Verdict: If you want decent Asian food and willing to pay the "food court" convenience fee, it's not a bad choice. Fair warning - quite a bit of msg though.
