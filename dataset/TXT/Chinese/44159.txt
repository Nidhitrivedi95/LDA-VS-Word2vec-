BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg The Sichuan menu is amazing!!
The spicy fish Jianbei style is so awesome. The serving size was huge with perfect spices. The scallion sauce cucumber appetizer and the fish in spicy broth were great too. The food is a bit on the oily side but this will not deter me from going to this place again.
In the evenings the wait time is not too bad and the service is quite efficient. The regular Chinese menu looked alright but one must try their Sichuan food.
