dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ We have never been disappointed. This is our 5th or 6th time eating in and countless times getting takeout.  The all-you- can eat sushi is a great value if you are hungry. Ingredients and fish are always fresh and tasty. We recommend all of their house special rolls especially the Dynamite roll. Aside from the great sushi orient sushi grill offers a wide variety of Asian dishes not just Japanese. Our favorite standout dish is the Thai coconut curry. We usually order with shrimp but chicken has been tasty too. Both brown and white rice are nice. Ice tea is the best!
