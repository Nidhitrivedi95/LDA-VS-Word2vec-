qEe0mdIax3pz3DH4RPj3sQ Good homestyle Chinese food with decent portion sizes and good value price wise. Food is pretty tasty. Week nights are quiet so lots of empty tables but don't be scared off- The foods good. Weekend the place was packed at dinner time. Lots of large groups and this isn't a large restaurant so it was noisy and tight. Recommend for weeknight visits. Also they don't specialize in dumplings and Bao. Even though it's on the menu, it wasn't very good. Their sweet and sour chicken and green onion stir fry with lamb we're delicious though!
