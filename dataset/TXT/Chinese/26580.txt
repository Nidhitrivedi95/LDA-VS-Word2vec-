Albeit frustrated, I gave this place a try on another night during my work trip this week. 

Long story short- they don't know what kimchi sauce is. Their ponzu is DEFINITELY not ponzu. Their salmon roll smells atrocious and can't possibly be fresh (literally smelled of rotting fish). Their handmade dumplings were loaded with some watery liquid that appears to be a result of freezing them. Their hot and sour soup was pure salt, and they didn't put any chopsticks in my to-go order... so I had to use my fingers in my hotel room. 

There's had got to be a better sushi place around here... don't waste your time if you want a fresh, true, and safe-bet.
