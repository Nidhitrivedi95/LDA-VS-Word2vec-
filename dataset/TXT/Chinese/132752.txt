prHnRsgY-PuM7vxe8-RwEA I give no stars!! This place is horrible!! The orange chicken was over cooked and the chicken was hard and rubbery! The hot and sour soup... Well that went right into the garbage disposal!! The shrimp and veggie dinner, Tasteless!!! The shrimp Lo Mein was horrible and tasteless!!! If things couldn't be worse, the fortune cookies SUCKED and were stale!!
