8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ One of the top dim sum places in the GTA! The food is delicious - very contemporary way of displaying their dishes rather than the usual wooden circular shaped bowls. In the morning you have to get there right at opening (9AM I recall) and usually there is already a line outside. Half an hour after opening for breakfast, the restaurant is usually full (mind you I went on a Sunday and Monday). The dishes are a la carte so you order whatever your heart desires. The dishes are perfectly seasoned, not too salty or oily, and everything is fresh - you can tell :)! Definitely recommend.
