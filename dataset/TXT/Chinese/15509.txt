The owner of restaurant approached our table, greeting us with a large smile. What followed thereafter, unfortunately, was not smiles from us. The owner beseeched us with recommendations and offers on the menu. Personally, a recommendation or two would not be a hassle -- but a friendly offering and gesture. However, the owner consistently nagged us. In my subjective opinion, I prefer to read the menu and decide what to eat alone with my table mates. Perhaps I'm too harsh, but I consider this poor service.  

To begin our meal off, the daily soup arrived at our table steaming hot. The tofu and the shrimps were the highlights of this dish, balancing the soup nicely.  The soup warmed my stomach for the meal.

The razor clams were fresh and delicious. The clams were served alongside a hot pot filled with a clear broth and wasabi with soy sauce. The combination of all ingredients  and flavors complimented together nicely. However, the quantity was not worth the price.

The insipid dish of chow mein was a huge disappointment. The noodles were oily and greasy, lacking the basic seasoning or flavors. The ingredients were not fresh and mostly overcooked.

The stir fried vegetables with beef and carrots. The dish simply lack the wok hei you expect from a Chinese dish. 

As a reviewer, I tend to be optimistic and focus on the positives of every restaurant. However, the negatives of O-Mei cannot be simply overlooked, and if I may candidly write, the negatives outweighed the positives. The razor clams and soup were great. But the service and insipid dishes of chow mein and stir fired vegetables drags the restaurant down. I touched upon a few dishes that stood to my attention. If your stomach and mind desires food, O-Mei is not recommended.
