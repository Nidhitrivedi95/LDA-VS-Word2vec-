ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ Love this place!  There are so many different drinks (teas, milk teas, smoothies, etc) and different condiments to compliment the drinks (boba, pudding, jellies, etc).  I went twice and both times had a decently longer line than what I'm used to when getting bubble tea.  What's convenient is instead of newbies asking what is popular, Chatime has their most popular drinks numbered on the wall above their kitchen/drink making area.

The first time I got the No. 1 - Chatime and 2nd time was No. 3 - Red Bean Chatime.  You can control the sweetness of your drink and had some sugar added to my drink.  They were both good!  Not very sweet, even with sweetener, but still tasty!  Be careful if you choose the Red Bean Chatime as they add red beans to the drink.  Overall, delicious!
