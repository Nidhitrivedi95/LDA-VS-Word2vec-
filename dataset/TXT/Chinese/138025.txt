QmNrHxN7UahtdliH_kAuUg I've only been here once, but thought the food and service were both excellent, and the portions were nice and generous. I wish they'd given us the authentic Hong Kong menu to choose from (there are two menus), which was the only disappointing part. I guess it just means we'll have to go back.
