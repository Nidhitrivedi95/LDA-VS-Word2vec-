AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw Had an older Groupon that did not say dine in only (I see the new one's do).  I ordered  take out and the girl fought with me and told me not to come back.  I've use a few coupons before with no trouble as this is not a place i really would like my children to go as it is more of a bar type of place, and not a family atmosphere.  Anyways, I will never be back and I thought they were rude.

By the way, usually the food is good, but maybe it was the chef or maybe they were just mad about the groupon, but the food was horrible.
