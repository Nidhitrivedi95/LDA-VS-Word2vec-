Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g I love the atmosphere in here. The service is good as well.  I had the xiao long bao, and curry beef clay pot and ham veggie rice on my first trip here. The xlb was made fresh, but I think it wasn't the flavor I was used to. The soup from the xlb reminded me of the fat from Chinese pork sausage. The curry beef clay pot came with a lot of beef which to me was with the price. I like the taste of bit but I felt it was a tad on the salty side. I like the ham veggie hotpot rice. Everything was made fresh no doubt about that. 

The second time we came was a few days later.  Let's not talk about the bother plates I ordered, just the pan fried buns. It didn't come 45 minutes later, long after we finished our entrees. It makes me wonder what's going on in the kitchen lol. Anyways, I would recommend this place to anyone if you're willing to wait for your food. Your food will come fresh you just need to have the patience to wait.
