YjPWt-V5oMkakdRWrALb8g If you find yourself on Independence @ Village Lake you might as well  pull into the SuperGs parking lot and for a couple of bucks find out what the noise is about. 

I've eaten at honey buns a half a dozen times and the buns were always freshly steamed in bamboo baskets - they had to fight with the city to be able to use those, the health dept was demanding stainless vats instead. 

Now, not all buns are equally tasty. I found the Korean to be bland, the Americanized BBQ pork tastes like any crappy BBQ because it's made with the same catsup based BBQ sauce. To me the Korean bun is surprisingly bland and the Chinese buntastes just like a dumpling, good but mild. 

The Vietnamese Bun with egg and sausage is their tastiest bun, the Kimchi bun is also fun and make sure to try the Pearl rice balls and to as for hot sauce to sprinkle one everything.  You can literally pig out for 5 bucks (cash only). 

Then you can walk to the next counter and for another $6-8 get a Korean dinner to take .... a Blade Runner experience all the way. 

Fun, cheap not recommended for the hygiene neurotics.
