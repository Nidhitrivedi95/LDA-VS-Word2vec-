Sushi Samba located inside the Palazzo Hotel offers great ambiance and excellent food.  The only drawback is it can get quite noisy during their peak hours so if your looking to have a nice quiet dinner this is not the place.  Also the food will take a bit long so don't come when your starving or you will be annoyed.  

The rolls were excellent and tasted very fresh.  Their steak with the chimichurri sauce was also another one of my favorites.  The portions are not huge so it's good to order more than just a few dishes when you are sharing.  It adds up pretty quickly so be prepared.  

Overall a great experience and definitely will return to try some other dishes.
