pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA With all the other fantastic meals I have had in Vegas I left this one feeling kinda meh.  It wasn't horrible and our service was great but it was not great.  I guess that is why we were able to get reservations on a Saturday night pretty easy.

Moral of the story is there are plenty of sushi and asian themed places on the strip, no need to be underwhelmed.
