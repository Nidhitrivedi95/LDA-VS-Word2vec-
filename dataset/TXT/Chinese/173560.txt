W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g Average ambience, slow service but great food. The PHO is one of the best in the valley. Everything is fresh and delicious. If they could just step up their service and brighten the place up a bit it would make a world of difference. If you're just all about the food this is your place. If you want nice ambience and service you may want to skip this place.
