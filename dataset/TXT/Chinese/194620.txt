ZGpT6rcgSsJ4GxwTHbvvJw I've been going here since this place opened. Normally their very nice however today , the guy was so damn rude . I ordered 2 lunch  specials and 2 chicken egg rolls  , I gave him a tip ( like I always do ) the food comes to the table and I go up and ask for teriyaki sauce and and the guy starts legit yelling at me "no no no , every time you come here you ask "to go " an u never stay !!! . I was like , ummm I'll pay for the sauce , he refused to give me sauce and started yelling more . I was in shock . I told him " I'm sorry your having a bad day , God bless you . I then walked out . I will NEVER EVER go there again . Rude as can be ... Terrible service ....
