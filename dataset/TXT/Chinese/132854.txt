prr5pOED31nKWUfCHUvhrA It was after 8PM when my colleague and I arrived to this restaurant. It wasn't crowded so we got seated right away. The server was attentive and took his time to explain their specials and respond to our questions. 

I really liked the atmosphere and the food. The tartare I had was delicious, unusual but an excellent way to prepare and serve it.

I could see this place being perfect for dinner with friends or a date. I'm definitely a fan now.
