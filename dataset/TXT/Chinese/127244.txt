pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og The atmosphere at Otaku was wonderful! This was my first time coming here and all of the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. As soon as I walked in I noticed how amazing decorations are and got the feeling that it was a more upscale restaurant. The whole place was very lively and fun, definitely not stuffy.

This was only my first time eating sushi, or even any type or seafood, so I wasn't really sure what to order. The menu was huge and had so many choices things to order so I decided to ask what the waitress recommended. The waitress was very friendly and after asking what kinds of foods I liked she recommended I get the spicy tuna roll with rice paper instead of seaweed. The presentation of the sushi was quite nice. However, I was not a fan of how the sushi actually tasted. 

This being my first time trying sushi, I was not impressed. It could have been that I just don't like the taste of sushi because the other people I was with seemed to enjoy their meal. The food was definitely a little pricy, but the atmosphere and friendly wait staff was spectacular. I had a wonderful experience for my first time at Otaku and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys sushi.
