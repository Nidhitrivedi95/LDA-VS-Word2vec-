IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Needed to spend a resort credit and no options were appealing.  We decided on this place and I found it to be adequate, but much too expensive for either the portions or the quality.  The pork buns were good, but at $12 for three they were way overpriced.  The vegetable curry I had was not very spicy, was heavy on the eggplant, and was only ok.  The best thing we ordered was sweet and sour chicken, but it was't much better than panda express and sure cost a lot more!  Wish I would have consulted yelp! before checking this place out.  One plus was that the service was friendly.
