U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q We were there this past weekend.  When I first tried the Braised beef noodle, it was actually OK.  My wife and I decided to go back for lunch the next day.  I ordered the same noodle - was disappointed because they made such a big deal about my request for egg noodle (which is what I ordered the day before).  They kept asking me who waited on us the day before.  Apparently, they try to discourage the customers from picking which type of noodle they preferred.  The chef disagreed with my choice and they were pushing for the hand-made spring noodle.  I went through 3 servers (who were extremely rude) until they figured out who waited on us the day before.  Naturally, I was upset and basically lost my appetite.  I don't know if they did it on purpose but the soup base tasted like it was watered-down.  No flavor at all as compared to the day before.  I told our server about all the hassle because of my request and she explained that the chef gives them a hard time if they request on behalf of the customer a different noodle.  It turns out, their chefs come directly from Northern China and they do not like it when customers want egg noodle in their soup (which I guess is Cantonese style from the Southern part of China - according to the waitress).  Anyway, long story short - the first few servers were very rude.  They had to get permission from the manager AND the chef if it was OK for me to pick which noodle I wanted for my soup.  To top it off, they were not consistent with the flavor.  Should have gone to Noodles at Bellagio.
