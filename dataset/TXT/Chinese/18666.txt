5FiuxRWs-indyk2Y9imkSg When we lived in Atlanta our neighborhood was about 50% Asian and there was an abundance of very authentic Chinese restaurants...sometimes too authentic. Ingredients like cow lung, tripe, jellied pigs blood and chicken feet (yes...fried chicken feet) were common place. Basically the only thing they didn't eat was the snout and the asshole, and I'm not even sure about the later. 
    So upon moving here we decided we wanted some good, old fashioned Americanized Chinese food and boy did we find it with Chopstix! The General Tso's chicken and Happy family sure made this family happy. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra few bucks for the extra meat and noodles instead of rice. Everything was delicious and both times we have stuffed ourselves silly (and had plenty for the beloved leftovers the next day). 
    Unlike the authentic Chinese restaurants back home who (oddly) didn't deliver, Chopstix had our food to us hot, fresh and in about 25 minutes. I might note that we found the delivery fee to be pretty steep at 3.50$, but maybe that is the norm here. Either way, it was worth it to us and it won't deter us from ordering (although maybe from ordering as frequently). 
    All in all, a great place. We look forward to ordering again soon.
