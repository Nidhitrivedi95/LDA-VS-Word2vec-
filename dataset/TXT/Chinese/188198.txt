yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Eh. My boyfriend and I frequent this place maybe once a month. I reluctantly agree to go because he loves it here. But, again, I have to reiterate- eh.
Service is absolutely terrible. The staff has a way of making you feel like you're bothering them for whatever you ask for. Waiting for a table has never taken long, but forget getting refills on your drinks or checking on how the food is. Your order is taken, your food is brought out, and good luck finding somebody to bring you the check. You basically have to wave one down like a taxi.
Now, their pho can't be knocked, it's fresh, tasty, and always comes out quick. If you're feeling adventurous and try tasting some of the other some 1000 options on the menu, such as pad thai or beef and broccoli (slight wtf, isn't this Vietnamese?) it's a real crap shoot. 50/50 chance of getting something solid tasting.
On a lighter note, they have pretty good boba. And nice fish tanks to distract from all the post-club-we're-all-starving-and-still-drunk sloppiness that's going on late night.
