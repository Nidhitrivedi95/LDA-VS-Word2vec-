yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw We ordered from here for the first time tonight. We got delivery and they said it would be forty five minutes. We were pleasantly surprised when we got a knock at the door in under a half hour (we live pretty close,  but were not expecting it that quickly!) 

The delivery guy was very friendly and talked to us about our dogs. He also was very patient as I could not find my wallet! 

We ordered the family dinner: cashew chicken,  general tso (they let me substitute this as it was not listed under the options) , soup,  shrimp, egg rolls, and crab Rangoons. We also got rice and ordered extra chicken lo mein.

It was all delicious and we will definitely order again!
