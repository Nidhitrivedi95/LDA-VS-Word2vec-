DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA The first time I went to Sam Woo, I was impressed. I ordered chicken wontons and chicken with mushrooms. It was delicious! The wontons were the best I ever had. We just went for a return trip and I was extremely disappointed! We were told they don't serve chicken wontons and they said they never have. The chicken and broccoli was NOT GOOD! The chicken was under cooked and the broccoli was tough stems only. I don't think I'll go back. I'll find another place for authentic-ish Chinese food.
