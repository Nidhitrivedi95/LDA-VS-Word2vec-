  I found the place itself to be clean-ish.  I'm in the food industry, so I'm picky and with the poor reviews on here, I was looking for evidence of anything unhygienic.  We were given the option to sit anywhere, and the first table we were going to sit at was very dirty, with food bits all over it.  The second table we looked at was exactly the same.  We stayed for about 40 minutes and no one made any effort to clean the tables while we were there.  There was one other table, only seating 2 people.  There were a few people at the bar, but otherwise, I'm not sure what the waitress was busy doing.

Aside from that, the dishes, the table we finally ended up sitting at and the tableware seemed clean.  I did not see any ants.

The food was good, but nothing amazing.  I prefer the bowls at Tokyo Joes, but they were still pretty good. Really large portions!

The atmosphere was nice.  It is a small restaurant, and it was very empty when I went.  There are a couple TVs, but the restaurant was not loud.  If it gets busy in there, I imagine it gets loud quickly. I ordered the seafood curry bowl.  Their shrimps in the bowl were great!  They did not taste fake.  

 The waitress was nice, but I don't know what she was doing because she didn't take our drink order and there weren't other tables.   She made some good recommendations from the menu and seemed to know the food pretty well.

I liked that they could tell me that the seafood curry bowl did not contain any chicken or chicken broth, since I only eat seafood, and not fowl.  It looked like they had a huge selection of booze and a good selection of beers and wine.
