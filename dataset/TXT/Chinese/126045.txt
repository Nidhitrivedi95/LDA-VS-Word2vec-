oyPvqoQhsdkfUeHtdPD7BQ Which crime is worse: Mediocre food served by super sweet owners? Or a Yelper that embellishes their experience? It's super hard to be blunt when I can see the business try to give effort. However, It saddens me that the food I sampled left me extremely unsatisfied. 

PRO: Service 5/5
* Owners are super sweet & helpful
* Menu has a nice variety of original Thai dishes & also a dash of Chinese fusion 
* Prices are fair 
* Portion size is slightly above average on (some) dishes
* Thai ice tea is tasty

CON: Food 2/5
* Pad Thai - Although a great heaping portion, the egg /fettuccine noodles substituted instead of authentic rice noodles, left the dish extremely dense and dry. The noodles sat in our bellies like a rock and was difficult to digest. The blandness of this dish left a lot to be desired. 2/5
* Mongolian beef hash - The overall dish had a prominent sour, possibly lime flavor which caught me off guard and the portion size was questionable. The "hash" portion was a tease - the "1" hash brown that you can find at Costco'a freezer aisle (I love Costco) but still, it wasn't not large enough to satisfy the amount of beef cubes and the large chunks of bell pepper and onions underneath. After 3 balanced bites with hash, I was left picking at the rest of my saucy beef and veggies wishing there was some sort of carb, or rice to soak up all the moisture to eat it with. 2/5

We were let down by our first impression of this spot, but I can see that a lot of locals enjoy the variety and the value, so I'll just leave it at that. To each their own!
