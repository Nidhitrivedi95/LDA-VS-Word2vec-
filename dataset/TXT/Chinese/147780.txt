sDQDMrb5xez4aASZ8U5qTg The tofu dessert pudding was wonderful!  Silky-soft goodness that literally slid down my throat!  I haven't had tofu with better texture.  I had the original version (hot, with ginger syrup), and it was a perfect pick-me-up.  My only little complain was that the soybean flavour could have been a bit stronger/more concentrated.  Otherwise, great stuff at a decent price!
