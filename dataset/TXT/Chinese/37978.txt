ASxoWbHKUWBZLh2rWysLcw The service here was horrible. 2 carts only bringing out the same old crap. Will never go to this dump again. To make things worst dumb lady asks if i know what dimsum is and that theres no regular menu. I sit down and 2 carts of garbage going around and people ordering off the regular menu. Dont waste your money at this dump. I think the owner was the cashier she got mad at our waitress at least but screw this place. Im sticking to Orchids Garden for my Dimsum cravings
