dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ We have been to numerous Thai restaurants.  This restaurant by far is the best tasting food than any Thai restaurant that we have ever been to. The Pad Thai is absolutely unique and delicious.  The Kung Pao chicken is also the best I have ever tasted in any Thai restaurant. Here is a lady that is a server here and her name is Jen. She is outstanding when it comes to remembering your order and bringing your food out exceptionally fast. The place is always packed with people it's very clean and they run a great operation. I highly recommend it to anybody that enjoys Thai food
