ooFlFjIuGW8Lx0bxmvEZJg Great buffet! Very large selection on different types of food from chineese, Japanese, american, and mexican! The sushi selection is awesome! They have everything labeled so you know what you are getting the hibachi has a nice selection of things to be cooked for you. They have prime rib at the grill! It's a little more expensive than you normal buffet at $12 an adult but it's worth it! Very clean and nicely decorated. Lots of room around buffet so you have lots of room to move around. Great dessert options as well including a chocolate wonder fall!
