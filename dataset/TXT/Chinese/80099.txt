go623pgRx2nfIpsV4ePHXg My family has been eating at The Great Wall for many years.  It is hands-down our favorite Chinese restaurant in the North Hills.  The staff has always been friendly, accommodating, and very quick to fill orders and refills.  Even when I dined in with a large group, both the service and food were top notch.

The food has never let me down, either.  Serving sizes are easily enough for two meals, especially when you throw in the unlimited crisps served with the meal.
There is also a kids menu that includes more conservative dishes.  Even my brother who dislikes most Chinese food enjoys eating there.
