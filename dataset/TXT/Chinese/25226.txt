79e4GUc_y2A5Cn3z1lNERw My friends and i were looking for a place to eat. We were only allowed to be in Chinatown for an hour cuz we took a tour bus. So we decided to get something cheap. Since we were in a hurry the waitress sure took her time. Ordering drinks was a process. The waitress was slow. Only ONE waitress! The food was slow. However the food was delicious.  I ordered pan fried dumplings and cold noodles...one of the few places I would go back again.
