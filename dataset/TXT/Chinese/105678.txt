KXLjOJbl9VYXFxKT4YK99Q This is our go to for pick up Chinese. The food is great and the portions are huge. I love the sesame chicken and the orange chicken, both manage to stay nice and crispy, even on the 15 minute drive home. Sauce for both is delicious too. Friendly service, and quick. We've eaten in a few times also and the atmosphere is nice, but it feels more like a take away place. Either way we love the food and the prices and will continue to frequent it. :)
