zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Much nicer than the New York location, this Momofuku noodlebar Toronto has all the makings of a casual yet refined lunch and dinner spot. 

With the Milk Bar just upstairs, it makes it easier to have a cheeky snack right after. The only thing i have noticed is this location doesn't have nearly as much chicken as much as the New York location. Wish they would because the New York location is doing wonderful things with chicken (basically chicken whispering).
