jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg GREAT PLACE! 

Just came here for lunch with my family and friends, and we all loved it. Each person gets their own individual hotpot (Chinese hotpot is a heated pot of soup filled with fresh meats and vegetables). They have a great selection that includes lamb, beef tendon (yum!), beef, chicken, and a large assortment of fresh Chinese vegetables. You can also go to a "sauce bar" to grab extra flavorings, and you can choose the spiciness level of your order. You get a ton of food for about $10 a serving.

The owner told us he just opened the place last week, and it's already been doing well via word of mouth. He says they will also be getting their liquor license soon. He clearly takes a lot of pride in the place. Check it out!
