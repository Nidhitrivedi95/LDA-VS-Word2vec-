_blrEZQZ6et5QEUa-a2WLg This location is incredibly unprofessional. The employees at the drive through are unprofessional, flat-out rude, and always act like they couldn't care less. I've never had such bad service as I get at this Panda Express. sit at the window for a good minute or two before they even open it to say anything. I waited for my entree to be cooked for 35 minutes because their cook "went to walmart" in the middle of his shift. My entree is usually undercooked and the noodles are crunchy, like they've been sitting out for hours. My recommendation is to take your money anywhere else.
