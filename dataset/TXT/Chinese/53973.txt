cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ This is a pretty big restaurant at Don Mills/York Mills.  I enjoyed the experience - even though I am not a huge fan of buffets.  To me it had a lot of the same foods as a Mandarin restaurant, but a step-up in quality.  Chinese noodles, vegetables, etc.  The food is quite tasty, and the Chinese food was quite authentic.

However, they have some additional items like Peking duck.  Also, each person gets a lobster ticket.  I don't really eat lobster, and neither did a lot of the people I was with, so we ended up with a lot of extra lobster tickets.

The only negative that I have is the price - it seems to keep going up and up.  I think it's either 26.99 or 28.99 on weekends.  Which qualifies this as being the most expensive buffet ever!  Especially in large groups, you tend to have some people who eat max. $10 worth of food.  It isn't really worth it, you could probably get table service at a nice restaurant and pay less.

Also, tea is extra - it is a glass teapot with a candle underneath to keep it warm.  Beautiful, but another cost.

I feel like at every restaurant in Toronto, I have to multiply the total by 1.3 for tax and tip!  In Belgium and France, it's all included so the amount you see on the menu is what you pay!  I prefer that so much more.  Some restaurants now expect 20%, so then it's like 1.33!

Well there was one guy I had lunch with who didn't know how to use the portable credit card reader.  So for our 25$ lunch, he typed in $30 for the tip, thinking it was the entire total.  That is over 100% tip.  I don't really know him that well, should I have told him?  Maybe some people tip more than 100%, I dunno.
