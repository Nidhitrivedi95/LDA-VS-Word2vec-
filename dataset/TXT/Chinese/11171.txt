2DO-8SvPvx1rACloHiD9Mw Thumbs up...so far.  We've been looking for a new place to get good/decent "New York" style Chinese takeout since Jo Jo's China Bistro (in Stonecrest) closed.  We've tried several places in the area and have been very disappointed.  This is our 1st go-around with Lotus Cafe and we're very pleased.  As a test, I made a couple of specific requests on the how they prepare the food.  They did what we asked and we got what we wanted.  That's a huge plus.  Being this was our 1st time with Lotus Cafe, we only ordered 3 basic dishes but now we're looking forward to giving this place another try with other dishes and hoping for another positive outcome and a "go to" place for Chinese takeout.
