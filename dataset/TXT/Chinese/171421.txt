vYbpodi9utup_njMK5PAfw Tried to goto another noodle restaurant across the street but it was packed... Decided to try Nudo - lots of free tables. 
The pork strips soup was very good. Exactly what I had in mind, I could've eaten 2 of them! Even a couple hours after, I had that nice, warm belly feeling after having soup.
The noodles were so delicious, I knew after the first bite id be craving it soon after. The broth was perfect: flavourful and perfect amount of salt. Not too many vegetables, but that's ok.
Friend had steamed dumplings. Pretty sure they were from frozen and kind of mushy. Stick to dumpling restaurants if that's what you're after, and go for the soup.
Service was friendly and simple.
Reasonable prices.
-1 star=Atmosphere is really boring and semi basement...although you will be guaranteed seating so pick your battles I guess :)
