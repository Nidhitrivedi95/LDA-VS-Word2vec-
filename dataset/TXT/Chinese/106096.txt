KzLjbXEDH1e1WrfzrrzZKw Every now and then I get a hankering for Chinese food for lunch, and order takeout from here. I used to have to call, but now you can order (and pay) through their website.  However, after having order via the website today (with pick up time selected as "ASAP"), I will call in the future.

I ordered pork with garlic sauce, white rice and egg drop soup.  Normally when I order takeout (via telephone), it is ready by the time I get there to pick it up (just a few minute walk from my office).  Today, however, I arrived to pick it up. And waited.  After the cashier asked my name/order, I saw him furiously scribble something down on an order pad then walk back to "check" on my order. I don't think they checked their web order, and my order had been sitting there without going back to the kitchen.

25 minutes after the timestamp on my order confirmation email, the food was ready.  
That's an enternity for Chinese take-out.

The food is good, fresh and a nice portion size. But I ordered take out because I didn't want to wait and sit down somewhere
