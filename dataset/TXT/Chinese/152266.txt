t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA ZOMG.  A good Chinese place in the middle of nowhere?  Okay, it's not nowhere, but it sure as hell ain't SF!

Great authentic dishes-- ribs, mushrooms and greens, crispy duck, 

Prices = moderate

Pay in cash and you get 5% off.   They accept some plastic too.

Service = friendly but they're too busy to really check on you.  Plus it's mostly self service, so no need to tip either!
