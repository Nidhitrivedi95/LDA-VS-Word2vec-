vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I surprised my family by taking them here and pigging out at this dim sum place that I had discovered on my last trip.  The dim sum is surprisingly good and they have most of the stuff that we are familiar with whenever we go...

They charge 50 cents per person for tea which is what a lot of places do but I still consider that outrageous since I'm old school and such a practice was never used (*sigh*)...

Although it's not Alhambra/Monterey Park cheap, (2) $2.18 for dim sum type A, (11) $2.88 for dim sum type B, (4) $3.88 for dim sum type C, and $5.88 for (1) dim sum type D plus the $2 for tea still came out to be less than $60 -- A REAL BARGAIN considering where we are...

We were stuffed and happy for our return trip back to LA.  I would come back again...
