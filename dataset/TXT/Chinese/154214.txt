td9FZybutwNG7DgocHCiXA This place is great just not my type.

I am so not the person people should ask dim sum advice from. Although I am from China, but the cooking style between north and south can be very different. 

My first dim sum experience was when I was almost 12, or 13 yrs old during my 1st visit to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. I even refused to eat egg tarts cause I thought the custard was actually lemon . ( 8 yrs later I made the same mistake the other way around when I first came to Canada, bought lemon tarts and think they are egg tarts).

Anyways, although I always told the best dim sum place should be you order on the menu and the kitchen prepared right away accordingly, I still miss those places have those displayed on the tray or cars you can choose from. 
Also, I prefer food being cooked in a transitional way and using common ingredients, which are not very expensive.Knowing this, you might understand why Lai Wah Heen only a 3 star for me.

The dim sum is very good,  The presentation is even more impressive. 
But I just don't appreciate the lobster meat in pan fried dumplings or the won ton with chili oil but wrapped with wanyu. To me I can be perfectly satisfied with a port cabbage dumplings and nth wrap my won ton will be great appreciated. And believe it or not even emu meat and foie gras are on the dim sum menu. 

However, have to say  that it is great that Berkshire pork is used in dim sum, totally bring up the flavor.

Chef in charge of Dim Sum used to work in Luk Yu, one of the most famous dim sum place in Hong Kong and also my favorite. So that this place is definitely worth trying. 

Very warm serve and nice dining environment.
