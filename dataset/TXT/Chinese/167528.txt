VGZ_MJ7P3vSQMYyQf-mNjw I come here quite often and my last 2 visits have been very dissapointing. The service was terrible, when I would ask for something I would get ignored or the server would call someone else because they didn't want to do it (LAZINESS). A lot of my food was cold. Today dinner we had to wait 1 hour and 30 minutes before getting any of our food. And then we had to wait an additional 45 minutes for an $80 lobster that in my tables opinion was not worth the amount. The lobster was lacking in meat and was rather small, I've eatin a lot of lobster so I'm aware of the size and price of my lobsters. We returned the lobster after they dropped the price down to $60.
Doubt I will be dining here anymore.
