Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w I can think of three better buffet place then Tin Tin right off the bat! My parents love Tin Tin for the crab legs so we always end up going here when we're doing a family outing.

Today was Father's Day so we went there since it was my dad's choice. Going there reminded me there's nothing I like about Tin Tin except for their interior design of the place.

Everything at Tin Tin is way too salty! I think this is probably their secret method to get you full quick with all that salt intake. 

They have a lot of variety, but nothing that stands out. All I taste is salt! Their sesame chicken taste like they put way too much pineapple juice in there. Butter shrimp is way too salty. 

I love lo mein and their lo mein today was just basically noodles and grease. No flavor beyond that whatsoever!

They do not have a good sushi variety either. Fruits are never fresh, ice cream is blah... and way overprice!

**PS, I'm not sterotyping, but I am Asian and I know what good asian food taste like. So my reviews are very honest in terms of quality and taste of food. ** :)
