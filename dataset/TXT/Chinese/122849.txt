OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw We arrived at about 10:35 am (they open at 10:30) and the place was already half full.    By the time we left about 11:15, it was packed.

Prices can't be beat here and the food is good.     We'd tried Cathay House on a prior visit to Vegas and Chang's is definitely much better, on par with San Francisco, New York and Boston.

A prior Yelper noted the worn carpet - we thought it was in pretty good shape compared to some of the other dim sum places we've been.     It's the nature of the business and I'd be scared if it was too new.
