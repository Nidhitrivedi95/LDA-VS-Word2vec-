xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw I went here for lunch one day and was expecting a lot more. My waitress barely waited on me and kept giving me nasty looks. I thought maybe it was because she may have been hormonal (she was in her 3rd trimester), but she smiled at other tables and as soon as she came to mine, I kept getting the same nasty look. She stopped at every table but only zipped past mine. It couldn't have been because the hostess sat me at a further table. She sat me there herself. She asked me if everything was good and before I could even say anything she was already off somewhere else. It was as if she was pretending to serve me. The guy who brought me my bowl asked if I wanted Sriracha or soy sauce and I asked if I could have both. He walks off and passes by my table. I wait again for him to pass and nothing. He passes by a third time and goes to the hostess area and gets on his Facebook. The table they sat me at was wet when I sat down. I had to use the one napkin they gave me to wipe it off. I don't know what was wrong. It was as if they were in a hurry. There was no rush. It was about three in afternoon and there were only two other tables. The amount of staff outnumbered the amount of guests. The bowl they gave me had some dried food on it. I had to ask for another one. When it came time to pay the bill was a little under 20 dollars so I left a 20 and just walked out. Smallest tip I have ever left in my life. I pay 15% even for mediocre service, but this level of WTF, idk, they should have paid me to endure that.
