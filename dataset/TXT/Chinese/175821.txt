WLCdg4ib7-_7b8epoXRjAw Ordered delivery and was satisfied. Got here ten minutes earlier than promised. Good portions for the prices. The chicken egg roll wasn't very good and the crab wontons were just filled with cream cheese. The sesame chicken was spot on and the Mongolian beef was the best we ever had. The beef was tender and super flavorful. Only complaint would be too many onions with it. Also got pork lo mein and shrimp fried rice. Both had decent amounts of protein and fresh veggies. This will become our regular Chinese place.
