nQe4TPwn3iGiWlRWqguhwg This Chatime may be one of the Chatime stores that doesn't have a long line up. It's near my house so I always come here for bubble tea.

The menu is the same with other Chatime but the taste isn't consistent. Sometimes it's too sweet, sometimes just way too bland. Some with too much ice, some just wishy washy...(even tho I always order mine with regular ice).

The staffs in the morning are nice and friendly and quick. But those work during night shifts are just inattentive and they always talk too each other. Plus, they have the music on extremely loud.

Even tho the line isn't long, you may experience some impolite people who love to cut line and don't care much about your feeling. 

You may also have to experience some eye-staring from other customers if you're asian and you walk in with a white friend/boyfriend/group of friends. Just ignore it and enjoy the drink.

The decoration is the same with other chatime: purple wall, and purple straws (which I love).

I love to come to this place in the morning since the staffs are friendlier and it's not very busy. I can have my drink in less than 5 minutes, and the staffs know what I want and how I like my drink.

You should try their Taiwan Plum Lemon Iced Tea (it's pretty good, take my word for it!). But just don't try their new Thai Iced Milk Tea. It tastes like Vitamin C supplement drink (eww!)

But since it's near my house, and good thing is they open late and during holiday, so I always stop by to satisfy my bubble tea craving lol

Not the best place for bubble tea, but definitely the best around Vaughan Mill mall.
