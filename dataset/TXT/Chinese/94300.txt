JdbYyxufvaU6uwmNg0EqhQ The place isn't have bad.  I got a sweet and sour lunch combo, and it came out fine.  Their menus pretty thurough, and prices are really fair.  Its chinese food, and if your in the area, it should get you where you need to go.

Place is clean, staff is friendly.  Would return for lunch here again soon.
