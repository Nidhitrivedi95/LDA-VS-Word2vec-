fHkiH52AATeRa8Fi2yStpQ We came to the restaurant after reading all the good reviews & it definitely turned out to be a very disappointing choice. The food tasted very horrible & burnt. We ordered hibachi chicken, sushi rolls (Boston, Ninja), hot & sour soup. Overall, every dish was badly cooked & poor in taste.
