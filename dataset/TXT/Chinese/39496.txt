AVLj5MSJD1si-Rl6X6qTXQ Dim sum on a weekday afternoon was fresh and delicious. It was very busy and we still had to wait even though we had made reservations. 

Food rating is easily 4 stars but I was not impressed with the service. We were seated in a private room and were forgotten. We waited 40 mins before reminding them again.
