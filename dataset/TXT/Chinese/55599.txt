cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw Noodle & Rice remains the best Thai food in Phoenix, and by far the best value for real quality Thai food.  I am updating my review to comment on the service, which is done almost exclusively by the incredibly hardworking Theresa, who it seems is always at the restaurant.  Theresa is always pleasant and thoughtful. She knows our names and our usual orders.  She remembers that I am a vegetarian and makes helpful suggestions for vegetarian options (just about anything on the menu can be made vegetarian, even if the menu doesn't give that option).  Theresa makes my already great experience with Noodle & Rice even better.  Noodle & Rice is not a fancy white-tablecloth restaurant.  But if you like "hole in the wall" restaurants with great food where the staff know your name and make you feel comfortable, you won't be disappointed by Noodle & Rice.
