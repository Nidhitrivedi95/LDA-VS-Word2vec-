6UxZJhcZClFdHJcA4kEG_g Stopped by this new neighborhood Chinese Restaurant for a quick lunch.  It is located in a storefront just South of Albertsons.  The place was new, very clean, and the staff was friendly.  Lots of lunch specials. Ordered the Singapore Rice Noodles with Chicken, which comes with hot n sour soup, small salad, egg roll, crab puff, and brown rice.  Portions were ample with plenty of tender white meat chicken, all for a very reasonable price.  I like to support local, family owned businesses and will definitely be back for more.
