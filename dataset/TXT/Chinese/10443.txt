1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I used to come here a lot because the prices were affordable and the food was good. 
My favorites were the Hoi Nam Chicken, salt and pepper chicken wings, pork chop, and ribeye. 

I no longer frequent this restaurant because of my last visit. The older gentleman that took our order was extremely friendly and our dishes came out quickly. I then noticed that he spilled something on the floor, cleaned it with paper towels, and then proceeded to grab food from the kitchen with the same gloves on to bring out to customers. To my surprise, he even boxed up our food for us with those same gloves on. We decided to just ask for the check and leave. Again, the money was handled with the same gloves on...

Later that night and the next day I had extremely bad stomach cramps and "issues". 

It may have been something I ate earlier or it may have been from this visit to Big Wong's. But either way, I would rather not go to a place that doesn't practice cleanliness and proper hand hygiene. If they do this in plain view for all to see, I can't imagine how it is in the kitchen.
