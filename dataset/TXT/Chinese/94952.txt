jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg You would think with 200 plus reviewers and an average of 4 stars rating the place would live up to its name of JOYFUL . NOPE!!! Based on their location, you would think it's some bomb authentic Chinese food, WRONG again. It was the most flavorless food you could put in your mouth.  Money, not well spend. Overpriced. Note to Owner: Please rename your business to AWFUL HOUSE FAKE CHINESE CUISINE.  I am giving it a one star, because yelp made me do it, in order to comment.  P.S Absolutely not the best of LAS VEGAS!!!
