X4CRPHvv-33kjxVJISZpUg How does this place only have 2 reviews? My entire department eats here. It's about the best Asian food in walking distance of CMU, but that doesn't really say much. The lo-mien is decent, as is the Hunan and Szechuan plates. I feel like it's easy to get decent Thai food in Pittsburgh, but for some reason Little Asia screws it up, so stick with the Chinese dishes.
And if it matters, their fortune cookies only spout proverbs, not fortunes.
