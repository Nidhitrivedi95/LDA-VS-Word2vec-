X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I came here with a bunch of my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday and had a great time!! I consider myself somewhat of a club connoisseur and Hakkasan was among my favorites.  Of course, as any club-goer knows, an epic night is made up of a host of factors coming into play, so take my five-star rating of the club itself with a grain of salt.  

We arrived around 11pm with advance tickets for Calvin Harris and the line was really long, but moved quickly.  The venue itself is massive...it's a bit confusing to navigate the various levels, but we walked straight onto the main/EDM level and were overwhelmed by the crowd.  After making our way to the bar, paying for a round of overpriced drinks (expected of any club in Vegas, so can't really deduct stars for it), and making our way to the dance floor, my friends and I decided to find the hip-hop room.  

One flight down lay a less crowded and exponentially more fun venue.  My friends and I pretty much camped out in the hip hop room for the rest of the night, and  didn't even mind missing Calvin Harris upstairs.  The music was on point (a mix of current stuff and throwbacks), and the crowd was great - not as many skeevy guys as in NY, but  we still got the right amount of attention that we all secretly crave (don't lie, you know you like it).   The set up was also great, with these platforms for girls to dance on (lots of fun!), and the bar separated from the dance floor for easy access.  The hip hop room closes before the main room, bc it emptied out around 3am (I think?  Who knows what time it was).  

In short, great music, great crowd, and def a great time.
