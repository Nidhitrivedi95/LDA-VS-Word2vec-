7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ Date night (for me and the wife)  and birthday celebration for a friend started here. What a great start to a night out. We were sat immidiatly,  and the staff was on it. I don't think my wife ever got more than half way thru her water before it was filled up again.  That's a huge no no for her. She absolutely hates to constantly ask for water.  

We got a mix of a few things. A spicy fried chicken thing, I think it was called General Chows Chicken. .....I loved it.  We also got the Sriracha Mac and cheese. This was also really good. I was surprised I loved the Collared Greens. I'm generally not a fan, but my wife got them and I had some. I might even order them myself in the future. :)

My wife got a bitter melon, barley dish. Be forwarned....Chinese Bitter melon is an acquired taste. We pulled then melon pieces to the side and took them sparingly with the rest of the dish to work us into it. That being said....the dish was great.

We love this place and will definitely be adding this to the date night rotation, you should too.
