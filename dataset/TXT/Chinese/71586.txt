fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A If there was a way I could give less than a star I would. This restaurant was awful. Words can describe he experience I had that establishment. 

First the service was awful. Waiter couldn't even speak English. Second food was mediocre. And third and most important, not only did I get sick from the food, but I was so sick I missed my flight back to my home town.  

I will NEVER eat here again, and after is said and done never eat Chinese food ever again.
