_Ss4d4dYzehTmWJGpkqL7w I feel like I've had much better.  The food was unfortunately bland (all of us found we had to request hot sauce, and I do not usually do that).  The shrimp balls were delicious, though.  Hard to go wrong with fried seafood!  The lobster was tasty, and it's always nice to be able to splurge on something like that, but again, rather bland.  For post-bar greasy Chinese food, though, this place can't be beat!
