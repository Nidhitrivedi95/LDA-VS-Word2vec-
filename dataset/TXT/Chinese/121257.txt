O7_rXHN_-cFp0TgiMaNulw My wife and I spend a couple of months in Birkdale and the rest of our time in Long Island.  Kung Foo Noodle is easily the best Chinese restaurant that we have been to and is 1/4th the price of NYC Chinese restaurants.  Tommy, the owner, is exceptional as well.  Their black bean sauce, Tom Yum soup, pan fried or steamed dumplings and Si Fu fried rice are our favorites.
