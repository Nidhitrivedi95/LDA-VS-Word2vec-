cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg I ate here for the first time last week based on a recommendation from a teller at the nearby Wells Fargo. Always good to ask people who work nearby where they like to eat.

The restaurant is stylish and tidy with welcoming staff.  They have a lunch buffet, which we didn't bother with as we were eating lunch late. The waitress was in the middle if taking our order when another gal came over and insisted I change my salad order to the House Salad that isn't on the menu. I'm always suspicious of this, it happens a lot at Asian restaurants and I often feel obligated to go along with the recommendation. She was rather insistent, so I gave in. What can I say?  I'm a middle child so I dont like to let anyone down.  Well, for once I wasn't sorry, as this often goes quite terribly wrong. 

Here's our whole order:

Crab Puffs, as expected but the sauce was nicer than the horrible orange stuff you usually get. 
House Salad, lovely chopped salad with a mildly tangy sauce and crunch cabbage and almonds (no meat)
Thai Shrimp Salad, spicy with big shrimp. 

Everything was wonderful.  They actually gave us an extra dish after my aunt said how she likes things really spicy. It was a spicy chicken dish that was also delicious. 

I'll definitely be back to this restaurant, although it's nowhere near my house in Mesa, but luckily my aunt lives close by!
