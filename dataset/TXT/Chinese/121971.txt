OBnqMdIsS8vWPrzPtnlb-w This place was soooo good! We are visiting from out of town, read a few other reviews and glad we decided to try it. Had the dumplings in chili oil wonderful, and the moon shoo pork never had it and it was great. Our waiter had made a few recommendations that we will definitely try next time. He was so awesome too! Great restaurant, great service, great food!
