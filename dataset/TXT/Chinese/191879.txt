ywtDqnrLeWzG7Q-9ORmSsA i always love how fast they are also the fact its probably the best Chinese place that's fast on delivery around my work only that the taste is a little off and all there dishes sometimes it wasn't fresh produce but others it is overall its good for the price but that's all 

i ordered the eggplant with tofu it was not bad just the eggplant wasn't fresh also order the sesame chicken and it was ok a bit heavy on the batter 

but the delivery was really quick usually (if its the usual guy but the girl will get lost in the parking lot and drive by like 7 times before realizing where she was... kind of funny but sad...)
