pAzNUuM3DkDOglojfYMTDw Excellent delivery, service and food, and the owners are friendly and professional. Ingredients always really fresh (high quality meat too) and the food tastes fantastic - our favourites include the General Tso chicken wings and the ginger beef. So happy to have such a fantastic place locally!
