zG3GJiIrF01bwgP0tQdkZg Great place to go to when you want authentic Asian food. I get the orange flavored chicken and a spring roll. The wait is not long at all and the waitress we had last time was very nice but hard to understand. The food is great but sort of expensive    I recommend this restaurant for sure!
