AKMvsVr_9meoSmawkEBe4g Ridiculous service. Standing around doing nothing. Took at least 10 minutes to get their attention only to wait another 10 minutes to other. What kind of service is this   I've never experienced service this bad. Rude and lazy servers. I wonder how this place is still in business. The food isnt even good. Cold food and cold soup. In what world is soup served cold. The server just places the bread on the edge on the table. I mean.  Seriously.... Are you kidding me.
