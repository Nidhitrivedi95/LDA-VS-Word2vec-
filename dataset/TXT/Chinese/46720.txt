bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q This is just the best place.  Delicious, fresh and authentic food.  And reasonably priced, as well.  If you go on the weekend you might be lucky enough to see a really fun show in their separate plush bar area. The owner Sherry even sings for you.   But you should call ahead for a seat.  They always fill up.  The owner is full of charm and personality.  You will be happy you have chosen The Singing Pandas!!!  Great food and fun!
