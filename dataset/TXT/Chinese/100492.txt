k-zr3rReFvYWz8vNyDpJMA This is my go-to place with my husband.
The portions are huge (one dish is usually enough for two people) but take-out dishes are slightly smaller. There's normally no wait time for a table because the place is so big, and the food comes quickly. 
This is the best HK cafe in the area.
