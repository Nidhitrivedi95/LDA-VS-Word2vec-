fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A I have never had Cantonese before and was taken here by a friend who was born and raised in China. This helped a lot, as he could speak the language (only with a differen dialect). I loved that they walked past with carts, so you could actually see the food. They would explain what each plate had and what was in each dish. 

I liked the shrimp (don't know how else to say this, so excuse me) balls. They were cooked well and very tasty. There were things that looked like wontons with chicken and spinach in them, that were very good. The tea was okay, but the servers were definitely on their job; constantly checking on my drinks, but not in an annoying way. Tried this rice that was in a giant leaf thing, didn't care for the flavor. Had this dessert that was made with sweetened egg, and it was delicious! I also liked that the portions were small, so you could try multiple things. 

My friend said that there was some pressure from the women with the carts, so I'm not sure if they work on commission, or maybe they need to empty their carts in a certain amount of time, or what. If he were not a confident man, I'm sure this would have made for an uncomfortable vibe, but him and I laughed it off. Will definitely be coming here again.
