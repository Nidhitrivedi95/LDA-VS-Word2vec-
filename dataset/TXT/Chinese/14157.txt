39AOOQM4Ff6rWXW8b9ZPvw Customer service needs to be worked on at Chen's Bistro. After a long day around the corner at the DMV, my husband and I were starving. We walked to Chen's and thought it would be good to try.

The hours posted on the outside were not the most recent and a bit confusing (e.g., lunch stops at 3:30 and dinner starts at 4:30...what happens between 3:30 and 4:30?). Because we saw people eating and it was 3:50, we went in to see if they were serving. As we walked in, one hostess greeted us with a friendly smile. When we asked if they were serving, she looked at another employee and they weren't sure how to respond. She said, "Well, we stop serving lunch in 10 minutes and then the dinner starts." So, does that mean we can eat? Both employees looked confused and didn't offer us the lunch that was currently being served or the dinner that was to follow. My husband and I looked at one another and just left...confused. 

I don't think I'll return. However, I cannot speak to the food quality. From the door, it looked like they served a lot. If you choose to go, just make sure it is during a peak time...the off-peak times is when it gets fuzzy.
