Mv3pO01Alty1pXQwi-Uy5A With this place, I feel torn.  Torn because the food is excellent but the customer service is unbelievably bad.

The first time I went here, the lady heard the bells ring as I walked through the door, and she did not acknowledge me for at least two minutes. It was the lady with the 80s mushroom hair.  Then she came out and I ordered a combo, wanting to sub in fried rice for the plain steamed rice.  She was quite snippy with me for this request.  Has no one done this before lady?!?! The bill skyrocketed to over $10 by doing so.  Then I asked for extra hot sauce and she was like, "I already gave you one!!"  I've never understood the stingy hot sauce packet thing; they're a dime a dozen. AND i tipped so it shouldn't have been a problem.  

Anyway, after that I was like, forget this place, and forget that lady.  There's so much food on Queen West, I don't need a side of sass with my meal.  Went home and ate the food and not one grain remained. The Kung-pao chicken was unbelievable.  That  chicken's death was not in vain It was sooo good I'll deal with her attitude, I don't care. In fact, I'm going there right now. Five Stars!!



update - OMG I really did go to R&N following this review, and I just ate my general tao and rice and now I can't go back there.  I'm totally heartbroken by this weird fluffly spongey general tao chicken. Blech! U just can't be chicken! You can't!! At best this meat probably comes from a fine dynasty of badgers.  Also the rice was all clumped together all mushed up.  This shrimp was yellowish and it's texture was the same as mars bar nougat. ALSO they gave me two fortune cookies but only ONE packet of hot sauce! You've GOT to be kidding me! U thought two adults would be cool to share ONE packet of hot sauce?!? Only babies share stuff and I don't know any hot sauce baby enthusiasts!! I just don't understand what the heck going on behind that curtain.  I'm so over this food and that mushroom lady.
