9Zhiktm7_LYN_uxaT9XEhg So I went for a "quick" lunch today and ordered a simple fried rice and waited 20 minutes,when I caught the woman at the counter realize that my order wasn't placed so she sent the order and preceded to argue with another customer about a take out that was done wrong. Waited a couple of more minutes then left and ate at Johnny's Red Bowl . The End !
