hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q Oh man I am so bummed! First time here and was so excited based on reviews. I order wonton soup and orange chicken and asked for extra spicy.

The place seemed cleaned and the hostess was professional and very welcoming. 

The wonton soup has great sized and full wontons but the soup has so little flavor! Needs lemongrass or something. So much potential and yet so bland.

Orange chicken had literally zero kick. None. Again even without the spice kinda bland? Close like the soup just missing something special even if not spicy. 

With some minor changes it could be amazing but lack luster now. I'll try one more time perhaps... sad I didn't have any kick like I asked for...
