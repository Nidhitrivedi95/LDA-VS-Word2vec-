6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag So the service was HORRIBLE! We were waiting to be seated and another couple who arrived after us got seated first... the hot tea was not HOT, i asked for a soft drink 3 times before i got it... we ordered soup dumplings, pot stickers, salt and pepper shrimp, and kung pao frog legs... we received the frog legs and shrimp and never received the pot stickers or soup dumplings, when we asked the waitress she didn't even admit she never placed the order. By that time we were already done with our main course, my wife really wanted the soup dumplings we waited for them the waitress said or would be about 15min, but it only took her one minute and the dumplings were hard and not soupy at all so my guess is that the dumplings she served us were already just sitting there... i had to get up 4x for drink refills because the waitress would just walk by our table several times and never asked if we needed refills or sugar or anything... the service was so bad. Oh and not to mention that as soon as i walked out i had tummy troubles and had to stop at a restroom before i even made it home so the food made us sick. Never will we go back and the place was dirty and just all around Nasty... the only good thing was the salt and pepper shrimp, but with their terrible service i will never EVER GO BACK. your better of going to Panda Express
