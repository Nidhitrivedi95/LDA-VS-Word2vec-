n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A This review is a bit tardy as we were there a few months ago.  The food, service and atmosphere were all excellent.  There is a server team and they did an outstanding job with no confusion. The honey walnut shrimp was delicious and too much much for the two of us but we sacrificed and ended up taking some of our entrees back to our room.  I think it was a great value for the quality of the whole experience.  If you think this is pricey, try Nobu!
