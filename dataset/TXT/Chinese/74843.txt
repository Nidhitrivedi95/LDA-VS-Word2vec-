Fu5rL-dPs-VNW0k315xMbw I have mixed feeling with this restaurant (3.5 stars).  We tried a couple dishes... the iced sweet and sour pork, and the crispy beef brisket with curry sauce.  These were interesting twist on classics.  But I'm not sure what the ice is meant to do... perhaps quickens the cooling to what end.  I've had the same dish elsewhere fresh and not had issues with the crispiness.  points for trying something new.  I really enjoyed the crispy brisket... the crispy coating reminded me of the texture and flavour from deep fried taro dumplings.  The brisket was nice and tender and topped with a hot curry sauce.  innovative... I like the new texture on the outside and the soft brisket on the inside.  The Shrimp fried rice was a bit bland... needed a little more seasoning... atleast on the shrimp... perhaps adding some fried dried scallops would add another layer to it. 

The service experience was lopsided... waitress was not attentive... and dropped off dishes as if saying she really didn't want to be serving us... but the waiter was much better and tried to anticipate our needs.

Overall a good meal.  Will want to try some of the other unique chef creations.
