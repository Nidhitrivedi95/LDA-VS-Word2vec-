qMJCVx6-ZYvZQHlfrZ_cug I'm a really picky eater and hands down my favorite food is Big Bowl. The Big Bowl Special has the most phenomenal chicken. All white meat, tender, with the perfect amount of delicious sauce. My husband gets the Hunan Chicken and it's really delicious as well. All in all this is my favorite, favorite place to eat! I crave it if I go too long without it. Love!
