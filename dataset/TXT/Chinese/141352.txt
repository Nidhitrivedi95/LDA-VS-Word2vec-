Rexpqwh7nam2F1CB9DMNTg I've been a long fan of the Fantasy Eatery in Scarborough since its inception.  But I haven't been back in recent years.  Don't get me wrong, this restaurant has some of the best dishes at the lowest prices.  But perhaps the number of food choices in Toronto is so phenomenal that I tend to ignore once frequented restaurants.  Today, I rediscover this gem at their newer location in Richmond Hill.

On our menu for dinner includes spicy assorted veggie shrimp pot ($7.95), minced pork and eggplant pot ($6.95), barbecue short ribs ($6.95), stir-fry clams in black bean sauce ($11.95), ginger and onion stir-fry lobster (promotion at $7.99!), and for dessert, a popular Chiu Chow dish called Fan Sha Wu ($4.95) which is essentially fried taro covered in a crunchy sugar coat.

First came the barbecue short ribs.  The beef was thinly sliced making it easy to quickly toss over the wok without overcooking the meat, and leaving it slightly crisp and golden brown.  They used garlic to enhance the flavor of the barbecue sauce.  A simple dish yet so delicious that one must order.  It goes really well with rice.

The night ended on a strong note thanks to the taro dessert.  The outer sugar layer was crunchy and the taro was warm and moist inside. I highly recommend this item.

Both Fantasy Eatery locations serve up slightly different variations to accommodate different neighborhoods.  Price wise, the Scarborough location wins because it has a number of dishes at around $4-5 which the Richmond Hill location doesn't have.  Considering the comfort factor, Richmond Hill takes it.  It's cleaner, more spacious, and there are generally more establishments around the area, including dessert.
