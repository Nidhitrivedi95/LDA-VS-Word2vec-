sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg I have stopped coming because the food is not that great, the chicken has an after-taste and I have had better food. If it were not for the friendly manager and some employees, I would have not been such a glutton for punishment. The red-haired cashier will ring up your order, and then go to the men's and women's restrooms to empty the trash, bringing it through the kitchen (how tasty)  and then prepare the rice and rest of the meals without washing her precious little hands. I am sure the health department will enjoy this review.
