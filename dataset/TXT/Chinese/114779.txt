The dim sum was absolutely disgusting. We ordered one of everything. It was all either cold and bland, or extremely hot and rubbery. I spit out my first bite and wouldn't touch the rest. 

If you're willing to spend 30 bucks on water and tea, go for it. Otherwise you're better off at Panda Express.
