VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA Good Food, but WAY OVERPRICED!!

I have been there twice since it opened, mainly because I missed authentic Chinese food.  I've only had the noodles there, and they are very authentic and taste good.  However, this restaurant definitely skimps on the amount of "other stuff" you get with your noodles.  My noodle soup consisted of just noodles and some spoonfuls of broth plus tiny amounts of canned veggies and strings of pork.  Flavors are good, but in my opinion not worth the price.  I'm only going to be coming here for cravings, definitely not going to be a regular.  If they dropped the price I'd probably be a regular.
