HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw Depending on what you order, some of the menu items are really good.  Today I had the Iced Red Bean Drink.  It is very good.  Nice cool refreshing taste for the blazing heat.

Today I had the salt & pepper fried squid.  First class.  The squid was fresh, soft, and succullent.  Taste was just perfect.   Fried squid at most places taste like rubber or hard frozen squid.  Well not here.  Very fresh and soft.  Probably the best fried squid in Phoenix.  The portion was huge.  It filled up the whole big to go box.  And it was only $9.00.
