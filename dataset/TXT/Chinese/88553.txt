I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg stopped in cause i love Shave Ice but it's hard to find good stuff here.  the place is a decent size and very clean inside.  I ordered the Original with mangos and Milk Glaze.  i bought the Small cause it seemed really big (and it was really big) but it was so amazing that i wished i got the large.  the guy working the counter was friends and helpful and i can't wait to go back and try some other flavors!

People just need to be aware, this is NOT a snow cone place, if you are looking to get one of those you need to keep looking!
