ZuNJelvkJD4wsXNBRg6t5w Moved into the neighborhood about a year ago and we love this place. It's definitely on our rotation at least once a month. The owner couldn't be nicer and more accommodating. We get the beef chow fun which is awesome and mix up the chicken dishes because they are all pretty damn good.
