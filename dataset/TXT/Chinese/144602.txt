RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ Stopped in there last night for a pickup order for the first time in a few months- the restaurant wasn't too busy.  I ordered the eggplant basil w/tofu, shredded pork with bamboo (extra spicy), and chinese watercress.  The food was delicious as usual and not over sugared/oily.

Two things that struck out with me:

1. I was pressured to use cash- to the point that it was uncomfortable when I repeatedly told them I didn't have cash.

2. The prices have been rising over the past year.  For those 3 items, I paid $39+, which seems exorbitantly high for 2 vegetarian dishes and a pork/bamboo dish.  I could easily have walked down the block for cheaper and just-as-tasty food.  

I left feeling somewhat ripped off and disrespected.  But then again, the food is tasty so I guess it depends how much you're willing to pay.  Probably won't go there again in a long while.
