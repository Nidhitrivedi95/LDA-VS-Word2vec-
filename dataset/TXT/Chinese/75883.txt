fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA really good dim-sum!
i'm giving it a 3 star only cuz everything else on the menu are really hit-or-miss. not a lot of dishes have picture so I don't really know what i'm getting even with the descriptions. few times i ended up with pretty weird stuff. 
tips: don't try to be overly adventurous. stick with the dimsums
