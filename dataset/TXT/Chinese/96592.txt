jNiZgCwZj4CNw1noxiC8PQ Mandarin Buffet is NOT a Chinese buffet regardless of what they call it. There is Asian influence, but other than some traditional "Chinese food" such as chicken balls, and wonton soup, a small (cooked) Sushi bar,  a few Asian inspired veggie dishes and some seasonal "special menu items" -- it is mostly north American cuisine.


The food there is excellent regardless of what inspires the chefs though -- and that is what is important ! 

Clam Chowder, Roasted Salmon, baked mussles, Prime Rib for dinner, with mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, with brown gravy and au jus. (does that sound Chinese to you?!) 

A full salad selection, hot and cold seafood selections, a massive dessert bar and 8 flavours of ice cream --  its amazing -- and versatile.

Having a romantic night out with your loved one?  They can provide the ambiance needed. A 60th birthday party? They can seat you! Team get together? Yup -- they have room for you too!

In all this location has 6 separate dining areas all with beautiful decorations. And the staff, are always super friendly and attentive -- I have never reached the bottom of my soda glass!

The owners of this location also make it a point to travel the dining area and introducing themselves to the diners and asking for feedback so they can improve on any shortcomings. 

Bottom line is -- it's a great place to eat and it's affordable. Food is fresh and hot, and the lines move quickly.

(Special note -- if you are there for dinner, you can ask the Sushi counter for a custom Sashimi platter! )
