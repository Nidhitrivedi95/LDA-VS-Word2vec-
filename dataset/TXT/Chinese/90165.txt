IDW4QFw-fN_wk81G9OV-Mg Loved it!' Didn't think I would. I saw the menu and was gonna leave until bf said he'd try it. Glad we did. They actually have more than noodles and I saw Italian food on the menu, but that would be blasphemy as an Italian from New York to order that here. They suggest you look at menu and know what you want when you come up to counter to order. We decided to split the Pad Thai and you get a choice of meat, chicken, or shrimp to add if you want. We chose beef. We also ordered the Cucumber salad. We chose a drink and I picked a little bottle of Pinot Grigio and he chose beer. You pay, take ur number card and sit down. They bring it to your table. Let me tell you, the portions are big enough to split if you want. Pad Thai was delicious!! Perfectly cooked noodles, great spice and flavor, texture and the beef was tender enough to cut with a fork. Cucumber salad was huge and had carrots, red onions, cilantro, tomatoes, slivered almonds, and what looked like romaine, shredded mozzarella, (odd but ok) and iceberg lettuce and slaw. Dressing was Asian and light, needed a little more flavor but so good. I can't wait to go back! Great little place for fast, cheap, and flavorful.
