IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Had a quick meal here as it was 2pm and all we had to eat so far that day was Fat Tuesday's frozen daiquiris (yes, with the extra shot). I wasn't about to repeat my L'Atlier experience from last year. I needed something in my stomach before dining at Sage, stat! My friend ordered the beef satay and I got the Hong Kong won ton noodle soup. I've had better, but for under $12 it hit the spot. The broth lacked any of the subtle nuances that you can get with ramen broth, but the won tons had generous amounts of shrimp (and not much else). My friend thought her beef satay was way too sweet. Service was well, true to what I call "Asian restaurant service"--they bring you your food and leave you alone. I rarely tip 15% nowadays but here is where it may be justified. The reason why this place exists is because Vegas attracts a lot of Asian gamblers and if they're like my parents, they would prefer to eat Asian food. Heed my advice and do not eat here if given the choice. A better meal awaits you somewhere else.
