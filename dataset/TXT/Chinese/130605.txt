pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Sushi Samba, located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, was one of the best meals I had in Vegas. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. We got reservations on a Friday night for 6 of us and were seated promptly.

Service was great - they answered all our questions and were very understanding when 2 of us had to get out of there faster to catch a show. 

We started with sake and also got a few cocktails. I got the cucumber cocktail which was delicious and not too sweet. My friend and I opted to order some small plates to split, while the rest of our group participated in a tasting menu where they gave the server the price they each wanted to spend and they had the chef make them a surprise menu-- so cool! 

We ended up with:
- rock shrimp tempura: amazing and huge portion
- seared wagyu beef: thin tender pieces of meat with a delicious sauce and TRUFFLE
- broiled peruvian bay scallops: the sauce on these were incredible- disappointed that there were only 3, because I could have eaten like 5 myself
- crispy jidori egg: kind of strange but good flavor. almost like a bird's nest appearance. I wasn't sure what I was eating but it tasted pretty good.
- coconut rice side: nice flavor, nothing special

They forgot our purple mashed potatoes but we were pretty full so we didn't really care. Our group, as part of the tasting menu, got the wagyu on a hot stone that looked and smelled incredible!

It was a little pricey for just small plates, but hey, it's vegas and the food was excellent overall. Definitely would come back next time I'm there!
