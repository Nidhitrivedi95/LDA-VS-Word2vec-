bsme1TUoEQt5EDF7O6HBrg I have visited this restaurant 4 times now and all experiences have been wonderful. The restaurant has seating for dine in but a lot of customers seem to order take out. The owner is very nice and she has held the door for me on more than one occasion as I was leaving. I have had the triple delight which is shrimp, chicken and beef which is very good. I have had the vegetable egg foo young, hunan beef, shrimp fried rice and vegetable fried rice and everything has been excellent. It has taken a long time to find a place that makes good egg foo young. They also have a Thai menu to order from also. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Cantonese dishes.
