b7wUWVV01xaa7E0FUNMDiw I'm going to be short and sweet with this review and just say that I've been to DaiLo more times since it opened than I've been to all other restaurants combined--probably only a slight exaggeration.

The pork hocks are a must-get. 
I love their slaw-type salads: they are fresh, fragrant, and crisp--this is probably the only restaurant where I order salads.
The lamb neck is awesome.  (Dear DaiLo: please keep it on the menu forever!--unless you switch it with a lamb shoulder or something.  ;))
Even as a non-fish-eater, I will still say that their whole fried trout is worth getting at least once.
And even as an anti-sugar-Nazi, I find they often have interesting and experimental desserts that are worth trying a bite or two. 

Service is excellent, every time.
