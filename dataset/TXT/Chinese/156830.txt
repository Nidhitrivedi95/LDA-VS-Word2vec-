TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ I was craving some Chinese food, I ended up turning to yelp for a good Chinese place. This place had great reviews, so I decided to try it out. I was not disappointed at all, great price, huge portion size and friendly workers. Food came out fast and yummy. The BBQ pork fried rice was prepared so good, I finished it completly. Had to even order some more to go. Definitely a place to check out if you want some good Chinese food. They even deliver and take out if you don't want to dine in.
