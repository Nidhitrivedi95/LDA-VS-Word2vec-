MWde5YzXWcNbpQ0604yGKA I first discovered Pine Garden when my mum was driving me home from Edinburgh and we stopped off for dinner.  Inside it is quaint and unassuming with modest decor and pleasant service.  The menu has a large range of authentic Chinese dishes from beef curry to crispy shredded Peking duck.  I had the beef in a mushroom sauce with fried rice and it was probably one of the best meals I've ever had as the flavour of the sauce was unbelievable.  
Since then I've been back with my family several times and it always has welcoming waiters, amazing food and a friendly atmosphere.  The dishes on the menu are all well described and some of them can be extremely spicy.  I ordered the beef szechuan once and just about had my head blown off by the green chillies in it.  This is rare, however, and each dish has its own unique flavour, something which really makes the restaurant stand out.  Further, the main courses are all relatively cheap, costing little more than £7-8 each.
It also does takeaway meals which are popular with locals and I can definitely understand why.
