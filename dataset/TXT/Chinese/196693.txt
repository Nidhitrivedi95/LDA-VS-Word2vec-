ZOAid_xX3q85wAkBWtFDPg Beef Brisket Potato Noodle Soup ($8.50)
The potato noodle texture is really interesting, super slippery and chewy. The beef briskets were okay, some pieces were tough but some were tender. Overall its good, nothing special though in my opinion. 

Also tried their minced pork meat in a pita. The meat was flavorful, but wasn't feeling the combo with it being sandwiched in a pita. I think I prefer the pork hamburgers at other locations where the bread is toasted and crispy.
