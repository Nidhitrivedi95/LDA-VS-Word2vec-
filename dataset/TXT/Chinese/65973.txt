EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw Sometimes when the place you want to eat is too far, you look into alternatives that are closer. We were craving dim sum and the 30 minute drive across town to our usual spot didn't seem ideal, so we checked to see what was nearby and found this place in half the distance. SCORE!

But you know how they say, "Stick to your bread and butter?" Aka, stick to what you know? 

Well... I don't want to completely bash this place. The location is convenient and near the freeway, and the venue itself has lots of seating, is very clean and is decorated well! 

But at the end of the day, the food just didn't do it for us... at all. We ordered a handful of things from the menu (shrimp shumai, shrimp har gow, sharksfin dumpling, curry cream cheese wontons, baked sweet cream bun, etc), and while everything was presented well -- everything was "just okay." It all really lacked flavor or just... wasn't good. We did NOT eat everything we had ordered AND we did NOT take it home (even though our server kept insisting we finish eating before she cleared the table). 

Needless to say, we would rather do twice the travel time/distance to Orchid Garden and will not be returning here. Sorry!
