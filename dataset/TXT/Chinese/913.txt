-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ DAYUM! I gotta come back here. I really enjoyed myself. I usually dont trust less than 4 star reviews, but this place doesnt deserve it.
We ordered a ton of things, and I really enjoyed almost all. The pork belly bao bun was delicious. My favorite. The beef rib one....eh. Not sure much. The toppings on the short rib overwhelmed the dish. The beef was tasty though.
The pork rice was delicious. The gyoza were just OK. The shrimp toast was really good too. I didn't care for the soba noodles and I really that it's me. I think I like them.....I dont. Oh well!
Service was decent, prices are good and the food was delicious. i will absolutely be back. Oh, and they are open late too!
