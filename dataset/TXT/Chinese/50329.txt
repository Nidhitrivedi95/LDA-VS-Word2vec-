cEFnJrDaz7BLO0xOCJlF6A While not the best Chinese buffet I've ever been to, it certainly wasn't the worst by any means.  It's in the middle of Chinatown, so at least the food tasted like it was made by people who know what they are doing.

I tried everything.  And everything tasted good.  But not a lot of it was memorable.  I did get seconds on the chicken feet and the braised short ribs.  But again, not much to write home about.

I read the past reviews of this place and I have to say that all of the dishes looked and tasted fresh as far as I could tell.  And the grease level on most of the dishes seemed within typical expectations at a Chinese buffet.

Not bad.  Not great.  I got full.  And it was cheap.
