KI9oZak3zdULpM8_RRap2g Paradise Chinese Restaurant specialized in Hangzhou and Shanghai cuisine which is not commonly found in Mississauga.

The taste is more refined and subtle with emphasis on fresh ingredients. We ended up ordering some of the "famous" dish that are representative to Hangzhou cuisine.

Longjing Shrimp <U+9F8D><U+4E95><U+8766><U+4EC1>($12)
Dongpo Pork <U+6771><U+5761><U+8089>($13)
Double-boiled old duck soup <U+706B><U+71D1><U+8001><U+9D28><U+7172> ($19)

Food were all well prepared but nothing really wow me enough to come back for a repeat visit. 

Service here though friendly and the restaurant itself is spacious which is good for groups.

Paradise Chinese Restaurant is a good option if you are looking for something different from the usual Cantonese or Northern Chinese fare in Mississauaga.
