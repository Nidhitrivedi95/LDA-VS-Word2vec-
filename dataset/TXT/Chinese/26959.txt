7wgKazvblPECOzBrd6N50Q Visiting from the US with mom and dined here on 23 June. We're Chinese and have very high expectations of Chinese food. The food exceeded our expectations, especially my mom's, which is rare. She complimented the owner repeatedly for having food that isn't greasy, heavy on sauces, or too salty, things we're used to seeing in American Chinese food. I strongly recommend it!
