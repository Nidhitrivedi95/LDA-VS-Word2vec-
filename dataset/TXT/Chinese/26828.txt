7vFTldKs-b-wS5J56PGGew Always trying to find the ultimate Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix area so here I go again.  Good reviews on Yelp led me here so i was surprised that on a Saturday evening about 6PM, the restaurant was rather empty.  It's a clean restaurant with many tables and a few booths. 
 
We ordered Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce which we like much better than American broccoli, salt and pepper shrimp (spicy), chicken fried rice, and orange chicken without breading.  The food took a long time so I knew this would not be recycled food, LOL.  

The broccoli was crisp and nicely flavored, but a little on the salty side.  I noticed the garlic were little tiny pebbles so I knew the garlic was not fresh, but rather out of a jar.  The chicken fried rice was plentiful and had generous pieces of chicken in it.  Unfortunately, the pieces of chicken were unseasoned and had no flavor.  The salt and pepper shrimp was a generous dish, 14 shrimp in all and perfectly cooked.  But this dish also lacked seasoning.  Needed more spiciness and salt.  The server said it was spicy so I assumed the spiciness would be discernible. The orange chicken dish was also generously portioned, sweet and nicely spiced.  
Of all the dishes, I enjoyed the chinese broccoli the best.  The pricing is very moderate here giving you a good bang for the buck.  However, we were not impressed enough with the food to return with so many choices available especially in the Chandler area.
