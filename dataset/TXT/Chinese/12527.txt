2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w Basic run of the mill Chinese that seems to be geared for the Sun City crowd. Bland and ordinary on most dishes. Family Tofu, Sweet and Sour, Lemon Chicken, gloopy and way to much corn starch in the sauce. Just over all unimpressed. We did ask them to make Chow Fun with beef and green peppers which was very good but "seasonal".. WTF? Seasonal? It's noodles, beef and bell peppers.. what's so seasonal about that? 

If in a real pinch and are dying for some Chinese this is probably one of the better Chinese choices in Surprise. At least its not a chain or a buffet!
