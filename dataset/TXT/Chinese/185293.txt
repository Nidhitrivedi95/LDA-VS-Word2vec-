XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA GB Hand Pulled Noodles! I finally visited this place during lunch in downtown and I did not regret one bit!  The wait time here gets pretty long if you come after 12, so if you could leave your office a little earlier, I recommend being at this place by 1145am.

This place is small, but the turnaround is quick since once you finish your noodle, they literally ask you to leave because of the amount of people standing at the door.  While waiting, if you are bored, you can watch the chef making the noodles, just make sure you are ready for the occasional BANG sound as the chef smash the dough on the table.

Food wise, they have 4 appetizers and 2 mains to choose from.  The 2 mains is either the soup noodle or the cold noodle, both option you can choose the size of the noodle you want.  I tried both and I prefer the soup noodle more as it wasn't as salty and was packed with flavours!  The beef although cut very thin, but the taste is great. Ask for mild spicy and you have yourself a very delicious and affordable lunch in downtown ($13 tax and tip in).
