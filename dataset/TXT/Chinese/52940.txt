Cl-xl1vTUwHeaGgBxzdTRA Awful experience with this place... The called us 40 min after placing our order online and said they would charge extra for red pepper!!! Never in all the years has that been told to us... like saying you have to pay extra for sauce on a plate of spaghetti... Out of pure principle (and insulting my intelligence) I cancelled our order that would have been late even if I would have been an idiot and paid extra for red peppers... I just don't get places like this.. Do they not realize the American restaurants  are built on customer satisfaction, good food, word of mouth and referral's/ repeat business ...For probably about 25 cents worth of red peppers (their cost) they lost almost an $80 delivery order... PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH....
