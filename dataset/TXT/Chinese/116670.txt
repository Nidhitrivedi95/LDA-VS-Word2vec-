NaO8109RYqscYu8fLzURsQ I ordered a plate of stir fried beef and vegetables, 
90% of the plate was a big lump of noodles that wasn't even stir fried. So basically I had boiled noodles like spaghetti and a few vegetables that tasted rotten. On top of that, the sauce tasted like cheap cheap soya and had a horrible flavor.  The server was very rude and extremely carelessly impatient, the restaurant was disgustingly dirty. I paid left my plate. And went to eat somewhere else.
