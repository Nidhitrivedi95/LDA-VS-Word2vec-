It's a little loud there especially on busy weekend nights.  They redecorated a few years back making the place much cleaner and nicer to dine at.  I have eaten many items here, but find that the Chinese food is average and the Vietnamese food is excellent.  I especially like the pork chops, Bun, and the KimPho Long egg rolls.  The Pho is good, but not their best dish - I think the broth could use some more flavor  Some of the best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas and we have tried many of them.
