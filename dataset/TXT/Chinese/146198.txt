S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A YUM!  I was craving some noodle soup and made my way to China Magic Noodle House.  Not because I thought the magic noodles would make my cold go away... but because I had heard of the fresh, hand pulled noodles.  And those noodles were craziness - soft and chewy with great texture.  Who knew that the little man behind the window could stretch and slap the dough to create these fabulous noodles?  We also shared pan fried dumplings - huge dumplings with a savory filling.  

My friends and I were pleased with the meal.  Nothing is better than a great bowl of noodle soup.  I know some people complained about the meat to noodle ratio.  Personally, if I'm eating noodle soup, I'm there for the noodles, so no complaints from me!

This place is a great value as well.  3 noodle dishes with 1 appetizer ~$25.  Happiness for your tummy without breaking the bank!
