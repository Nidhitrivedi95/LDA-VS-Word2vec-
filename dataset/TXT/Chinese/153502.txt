taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg Our friend recommended that we come here for dumplings. We had just gotten to Montreal and we had some logistical issues getting to the restaurant (our Uber couldn't find us). By the time we got there for lunch, it was 4:00. We were ready for some food and a couple of drinks. We ordered 2 kinds of dumplings: lamb and green onion and curry beef. I wanted a cocktail, but they were out of ingredients for 2 of the drinks I tried to order. I settled on a Cosmo. It arrived in a wine glass and was overly sweet, with little alcohol. The dumplings were very good. I would definitely want to come back and try others. The service was spotty, but if you like dumplings and want to try some kinds that you haven't seen elsewhere, come to Qing Hua.
