I am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons here.
I guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and Americanized food. I never tried the Americanized dishes but the Chinese ones are decent. I always just order their specials, which are listed on the first page of their menu.

My favorite dishes are: 
Chinese style mapo tofu, 
Beijing duck (you need to order it ahead), 
fish with the spicy sauce (The spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers. It has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug.),  
and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots.
