AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw I Love This Place...I work across the way and I eat there most days for lunch and I have to say the food is awesome and everyone who works there are extremely nice and courteous...always a smile !!! I've met the owners and see them more often then not behind the bar working! And the decor is awesomeness!! So if your looking for the spot to chill, drink, and not spend a ton of cash and has great food.chop and wok is the place..
