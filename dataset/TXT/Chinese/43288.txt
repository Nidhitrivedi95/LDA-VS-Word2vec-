BevY0RqrIxHOgfd8l_UWSQ If you haven't had HK style cuisine before, you should give this place a try.  For those who don't know, HK style is a take on European and American food with a uniquely Hong Kong twist.  This was the type of food that western style diners in Hong Kong served in the 1960s and you'll only find this type of restaurant in places where Hong Kongers live.

When you walk in you're greeted by a dark theme with black painted walls.  There's a solarium area where you get a lot of sunshine along with your food.  We chose to sit there and order some of the classics.  

The German pork hock looks nice and crispy and is brined just right on the inside, served with a side of jasmine rice, while I had the Ox tail in a tomato red wine sauce served Asian style, on a bubbling hot pot of sauce with a side of spaghetti.  Our table also had pork chops with rice, and salmon linguine.

Prices are quite reasonable even at dinner time, with the average HK style combo costing under $20.  With the combo, you get a choice of HK style borsch (cabbage and tomato) soup or cream soup (in this case clam chowder).  You also get your choice of coffee, tea, lemon tea, lemon water for after dinner.  Add a little to the bill if you want those drinks iced.

if you've never had HK style food before, give this place a try for a blend of East and West.
