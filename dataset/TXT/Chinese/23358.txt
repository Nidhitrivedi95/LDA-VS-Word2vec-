6TLIuls4SiG9VFf2U42p1A I love the food there. It's so fresh and delectable. 
My recommendations are Cantonese Chow Mein, Pad Thai, Satay chicken or beef. It's delicious and never a regret. I also love the service! All the staff there are so friendly and kind. Very helpful and have a constant smile on their face. Oh, and best of all I love how it's late night! Fri and Sat this restaurant is opened till 4:00a.m. If you're in need of food, they have you covered and the only restaurant opened. They also have this pho-king spicy challenge that is really entertaining and fun. Check out their hall of shame and hall of flame, genius concept! and even better to watch it in action. It's an awesome place, can't complain!
