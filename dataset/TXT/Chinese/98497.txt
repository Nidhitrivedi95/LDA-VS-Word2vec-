JRRduMZI2aU3UCjfNEQURA One of my favourite dumplings restaurants to go to. Literally anytime I have a craving I will go in town just to order these then go back home. Every once and awhile the service can be a little rude but getting these dumplings for me is totally worth it. I order about 30 minimum each time but at this price I can't go wrong
