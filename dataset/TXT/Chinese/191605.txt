yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A Trying to find good Thai in Phoenix can be a challenge. So is trying to find good Chinese that doesn't make you want to fall asleep an hour afterwards. I think Flo's just came up 2 for 1. My GF is gluten free and loves calamari, loves breaded calamari but can't eat it. Bam. In comes Flo's to save the day. They have this seasoning that imitates breading and is actually pretty awesome. I had the spicy pork and added pineapple. Recommendation of the the waitress and bam, home run! It was out of the park good.

The portion size is great for the average person to have two servings. I'll admit it, I ate the whole thing. 

So good.
