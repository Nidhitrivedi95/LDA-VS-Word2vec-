5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Have to say this place was a disappointment to say the least. The hot and sour soup was very good. Ordered a fish and veggie dish that tasted like nothing and the main veggies they used was cauliflower!! REALLY cauliflower??? The other dish we ordered was equally boring! The chiefs they are using must be bored with their job. Service was good though.. do yourself a favor and take uber to the Chinese district off the strip for excellent Chinese food as well as authentic! And 1/3 the cost of Blossom.
