f-ookZOX4pBNldaOHMkJ4A Very authentic Hong Kong style food. A convenient and tasty stop for quick won ton noodle soup for 4.99 lunch.  A tasty, reasonably-priced, and varied lunch menu means the place is usually packed so expect a short wait during peak hours.  My only complaint is that their shrimp are not de-veined!
