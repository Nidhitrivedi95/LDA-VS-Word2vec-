x9SL1nCaUYM4JP91UrVkxQ After reading all the reviews, I HAD to try this place. Hubs was looking forward to this place! We reserved the sticky rice stuffed chicken 2 days before. Hubs remembered eating this a few times when he was a kid and this brought back nice memories! We also ordered the Mapo Tofu and Vermicelli with Melon and Dried Shrimp Casserole. The chicken was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!! I'm bummed that we don't have this back in the US! We're already trying to plan our next trip to Canada so we can have this again! They have this whole presentation where they bring the whole chicken to you and cut it up in front of you. SO DELICIOUS! My mouth is watering as I'm writing this 1 week later! Oh yeah... On to the rest of the meal! :). The vermicelli casserole was also our favorite. It was nice and tasty. The mapo tofu was nice and spicy. Everything was good but the chicken entree stole the show! They offered free soup but it was weird that they took all the meat out and served it to us on a separate plate. I would've given this place a solid 5 but had to deduct 1 star because of the service. Service was friendly but very pushy. They kept coming back every few seconds to ask if we've decided what we wanted to eat even though we said that we needed a little more time to look at the menu. I felt we could've ordered more if we were allowed more time to look at the menu. Owner is very friendly. When I went to reserve the chicken, I told her of my daughter's peanut allergies and they made note of it not to add any peanuts or use any oil where peanuts were used. Aside from the pushy service, I love this place and will definitely return when in the GTA area!
