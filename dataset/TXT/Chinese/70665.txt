F9h98ZFHLCHG7SdVbXMz0g Delicious dim sum, fresh ingredients and great service. I will definitely be coming back. Came here this morning to have dim sum with a friend. Ordered many items off the menu. My favourite were their steamed rice rolls. Their shrimp and beef ones were delicious. I would skip the plan congee and donut rolls as there is no flavor in the congee. Their dumplings were fresh, filled with meat and veggies and didn't have a lot of fat within their filling. Lastly their milk tart and mango sponge cake were not overly sweet but completed our meal. Yes, it's a touch pricier than other places and yes there is a $2 tea charge per person however I feel that their environment, food and service make it worth it.
