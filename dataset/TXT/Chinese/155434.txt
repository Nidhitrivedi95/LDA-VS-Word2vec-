tKNu5QQDlQQnVe821KzwKA Went to Basilic with the whole family on a recent road trip to Montreal. We went in there as it was the cleanest looking restaurant of the whole chinatown area, and we were craving for vietnamese food. We ordered the pho noodles, pad thai, fried rice and spring rolls and were disappointed. As one who has travelled to vietnam before, the food was "too light" by comparison and hence not authentic by our standard. We also ordered the bubble tea and it was horrible. The coffee was good tho, and for that and the ambience and clean surroundings, it still wouldn't be enough for us to go back there again. We will stick to french food the next time we are in montreal.
