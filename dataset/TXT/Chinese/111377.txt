M9fOuiesoUSaouOqNQ3U2w I have been frequenting this restaurant for about 15 years, and have never been disappointed with a meal.   I like the mixed vegetables and the broccoli with mushrooms in oyster sauce.  They will add tofu without charging extra.  Of all the different people that have eaten here with me, only one person didn't like the food.
