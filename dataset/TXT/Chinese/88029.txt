I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg ***UPDATE***
Tony from Snoh decided to reply to my review, kindly apologizing for them not having the coffee when I ordered it. 
Unfortunately, he completely ignored the issues listed in my review:
*Was not told they were out until my credit card was already processed. 
*No apology from the cashier for being out. 
*Complete indifference from the cashier in regards to my disappointment. 
*Long wait time for a simple small Snoh. 
*Observations of staff more worried about being on their phones than taking care of customers. 
Glad they actually respond to the reviews. Sad they don't actually read them.

Delicious (and reasonably priced dessert). I went with the Milk Cream Snoh with Marshmallows and Condensed Milk. Awesome!
My criticism is that I ordered a Vietnamese Coffee and wasn't told they were out until AFTER running my credit card. And the way I was told was less than ideal, "we are out of coffee, do you want something else?", "no, I had my heart set on the coffee.", "do you still want the Snoh?", "yes.", "ok, your new total is $4.35"...
Maybe I'm expecting too much, but shouldn't there have been an apology in there somewhere? Especially when you are out of an item less than 2 hours after opening?
You'd also think my very simple order of Snoh would take less than 5 minutes. At least do the 2 teenagers working the counter get back to their (fascinating, I'm sure) Instagram and texting. 
Good product, poor service. Rant over.
