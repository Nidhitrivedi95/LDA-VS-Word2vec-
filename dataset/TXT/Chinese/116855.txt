NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og We've been here twice, and had a total of 5 entrees (plus eggrolls). 

The restaurant itself is decent, modern, clean. Prices are reasonable. 

Food is bland. Horribly bland. 

Two okay dishes: 
1. Chicken with snow peas - bland but decent flavor
2. Cashew chicken - bland, nice (subtle) garlic flavor. NOT prepared properly - they just threw the cashews on top. 

Three horribly bad dishes that they should have paid us to eat:
1. Pad thai - creepy orange color, absolutely tasteless 
2. Orange chicken - this is basically a staple in American chinese restaurants, this should've been at least decent, right? The sauce was slimy and flavorless; the breading was mushy. 
3. Pineapple fried rice - they managed to make it kind of spicy - but again, somehow, absolutely no flavor. 

Egg rolls: if you like 'em with very little filling and super greasy, these are for you! :) 

Oh, and the second time, we were supposed to get egg rolls with our meals as part of a special . . . but they didn't actually bother to give them to us. Maybe they were trying to do us a favor? 

My boyfriend doesn't mind this place as much as I do - but he likes very simple, very bland food. If you're looking for that, it's probably fine; if you're looking for flavor, do NOT come here. 

p.s. they also charge for fortune cookies.
