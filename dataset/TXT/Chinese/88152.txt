I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg We try to scrounge up shaved ice places all across the nation because we love shaved ice especially the old Taiwanese style kind that's so hard to find these days unless you are in Houston because more fusiony modern ice is popping up everywhere. We usually don't perfer this kind and have tried it in our hometown and elsewhere BUT so glad we found this particular place. Read the reviews, was near where we had dinner and gave it a shot. I was so excited to bring my fam here because it's not easy to find a good shaved ice eatery especially with funky flavors like sesame and taro.

That's what we got. Yes it seems a bit much at $8 but you get to pick two flavors of ice and two toppings. Of course I got mochi n boba. Yes I did wish they gave us more mochis n bobas but the large sized  dessert was decently sized (idk if it's the same to-go), totally shareable with the kids although I would have enjoyed it more just with my husband n I :) Kids didn't like the sesame yes it's an acquired Asian taste but they devoured the taro and condensed milk n my toppings :/ we need Snoh in Austin! 

My daughter got pistachio milk tea and man was it yummy! Non dairy too :) 

Cute lil place with games to play, picture wall with props and clean bathrooms. Nice guys working there who told us to come back up to get more condensed milk topping halfway through. Who does that?

Definitely will go back if we are in town n wish we have one back home :( would go here daily vs Monster Ice here :/ 

Definitely would recommend a try and not to expect it to be like the typical shaved ice or snocone you get. Its different not meant to be pebbly but funkier, grittier, n silkier. Fun ;)
