N_ML37GOTOLtGKWqRnbJRA I've had my share of Tempe Chinese delivery disappointments which makes this place even more exciting.  My husband and I have been ordering delivery from Big Wa for a few months now.  It is the best Chinese delivery this side of Tempe for sure.  They are quick!  Tonight they warned it would be an hour+ wait for the food and it was here in 45 minutes.  Most nights it only takes 30 minutes or so.  The fried rice comes in huge proportions -- we prefer it with pork.  Super tasty Kung Pao Chicken.  It's all good.  Five stars for nice staff (the people who take orders and deliver are always really nice and polite) and dependable/yummy/satisfying food.  Big Wa will not let you down!

PS: They give you free egg rolls if you spend more than $20.
