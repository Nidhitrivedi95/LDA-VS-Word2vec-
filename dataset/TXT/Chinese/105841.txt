KxqAQ-CJcAPDTJbrnQUTfg I will never eat at this place again. For starters, I waited 50 minutes for a pickup order that was supposed to be ready in 20 mins. On top of that, the restaurant was disgustingly filthy inside, the wait staff were rude, and others inside shared my same sentiments. 
Finally, when I got home with my bag of takeout, my sweet and sour chicken was overcooked, had no veggies, and was missing the red sauce that completes the meal.
