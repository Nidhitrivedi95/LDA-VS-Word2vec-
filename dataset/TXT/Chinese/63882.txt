E0h1kK-8P_DtBHk5ClVI_g The worst customer service ever!!! this restaurant located at 1177 Central Pkwy W  Mississauga, Ontario!! 

From past experience, I have seen the owner of the restaurant pick up my fiance cousin's baby and carry it around, away from the parent while holding onto a hot teapot. She should be thankful that the baby was safe otherwise she will be sue. Also yesterday my family came to this restaurant to celebrate Mother's Day, we've make a reservation and still waited for more than half hour. That was fine, they told us to sit at a table while they were cleaning it from previous customers. So my family of 15 including me, sat there waiting for them to clean and set up the table, all of a sudden the owner came over and ask us to switch table. Making everyone including my grandma who has trouble walking (because she had stroke from before), walked to the other end of the restaurant at a table next to the door where it was cold with her walking cane!! What is the point of asking us to sit at the 1st table!! I made a complain to the owner and she just said that's because you have 15 people, blah blah blah (but the 1st table we sat on fit just fine) asking us to move to a smaller table without apologizing and without looking at me!! WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS!! I don't mind me walking to the other end of the restaurant but asking an elderly to walk to the other end of the restaurant squished into a smaller table and without apologizing! I WILL NEVER COME HERE EVER AGAIN! And to all moms out there, be careful of ur babies in this restaurant!!!
