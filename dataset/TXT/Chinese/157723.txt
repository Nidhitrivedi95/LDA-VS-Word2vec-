tw8I1hZdlGpwO2QaAIeQWg Awesome Asian cuisine buffet. They have a make your own pho or udon noodle soup station and a hibachi grill station. The sushi here is good as well as their fresh fruits. The staff here is very friendly and always clear plates and bring drink refills in a timely manner. The price also can't be beat.
