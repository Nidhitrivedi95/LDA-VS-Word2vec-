GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg A friend of mine had actually worked here a half a year ago and had suggested we try it.  I'm glad we did!

At 5PM, the place was half-full of merry patrons doing sake bombers and guzzling Happy Hour $5 large beers.  The conveyor belt was constantly full and the fish was fresh.  The portions are pretty decent as well [unlike Teharu which has been lacking in size and quality].  Price-wise is pretty comparable to Teharu and you're definitely getting more bang for your buck.  While the selection wasn't too plentiful on the conveyor belt itself, you can order whatever you want off the menu.  While it's not exactly Las Vegas or San Francisco quality, I'd definitely come back.  The two of us had a bill of $43.  Not bad... I can definitely justify taking advantage of that semi-annual sale at Express!  :)


Note:  The hours listed on Yelp is wrong.  They no longer have the two-hour break in the middle of the day.  Happy Hour falls around this time so don't miss out!
