cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Me and my friends just ate here awhile ago and we are definitely coming back again!
Asking for a reservation in this buffet is so easy and the staff is so nice!

The place is so huge and very different from the common buffet house
I think a thousand people can fit in and it will still not be crowded..
It is a self serve buffet and you can see the managers roaming around the place most of the time. 

Theres a variety of foods there (I saw a tiny pan of pizza but havent tried it)
The salt and spicy shrimp is good and also the Philadelphia rolls.
The sashimies are also good specially the salmon and the white fish tuna.

You should try their dragon pearl sesame ball (you get to see it right away because it is so big)
It doesnt look good at all but it really does taste PERFECT. It costs 9 dollars to buy it but you get to taste it for free.

The ambiance is so relaxing and peaceful. (Ship inspired)
One of the managers came to our table and asked if we liked their place and how did we know the newly opened buffet. He was so funny and entertaining and he didnt look intimidating at all.

If youre thinking about going to Mandarin or Woo, you should definitely go to Dragon Pearl Buffet because it doesnt look cheap and your money would be worth it.

Here's a link of their lunch and dinner:
