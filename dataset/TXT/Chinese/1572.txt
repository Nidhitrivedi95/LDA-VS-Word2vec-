I usually just order food to-go from there, haven't experienced much inside, so decided to check it out. They had some sort of war history show on the TV, seeing death and destruction doesn't make things very appetizing. They were playing karaoke music (without any lyrics or anyone singing) so it was interesting to hear "My Heart Will Go On" on an electronic keyboard. And my fortune cookie had no fortune in it! (how unfortunate)

Other than that, it was just an "okay" experience. Service was okay, food was okay, but I've had better.
