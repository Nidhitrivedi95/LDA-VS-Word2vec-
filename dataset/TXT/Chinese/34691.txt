aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg Roasted duck was a killer. It was juicy. The skin was crispy. 
The fried noodle with chicken gravy was excellent. The noodle was crispy and had nice A'Roma. The gravy was mild and nice A'Roma. The vegetables were crispy. The chicken was cooked to perfect and not dry. 
However the roasted belly pork which brought me back here was very very salty today. I was very disappointed. The skin was crisp and the meat was juicy. If it wasn't super salty, it would have been perfect.
