QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA I am originally from Szechwan and I'm glad that they do offer quite authentic Szechwan dishes (at least compared to other Chinese restaurants in the valley). The spiciness and the seasoning are just right. The place is clean and the servers are okay. Try not to order from the Americanizd Chinese food menu and try some authentic Chinese food! You will be surprised.
