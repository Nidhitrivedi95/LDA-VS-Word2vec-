My favorite is the beef curry bun. Delicious.

The melon bun isn't bad, but their salty buns are better.

I think I tried the fish one most recently and it was surprisingly good!

Harmonie is a chain, BTW, there's another one at the Guy exit of Guy Concordia metro and one in Alexis Nihon near the Atwater metro entrance.

Quality is identical across locations, in terms of value for money, these guys have it spot on.

Highly recommended, safe bet.
