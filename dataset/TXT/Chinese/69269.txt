EzGGUtQtbE8z57pqxE0I8w Great tasting food, but you better put your dinner order in at lunchtime because the delivery at this place takes longer than the second coming of Christ. 

I must be retarded because I keep going back to this place thinking maybe next time they will be quicker, but they continue to keep me waiting.
