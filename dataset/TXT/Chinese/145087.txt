rXKzE4Iraz7vGWovWW-aBA I had the opportunity to check this spot out for a Wednesday lunch last week. I was surprised at how well done the design is and how upscale the materials used in the space are - I guess I just had no idea what to expect! I had a really hard time reading the menu. I feel like they could help with a definition or vocab list. Or atleast have the servers more forthcoming with explanations to help those that are uneducated. I was curious and asking questions but did not learn much about the menu's nuances :(  I ended up ordering what was described to me as an elevated ramen soup or sorts - "Shoyu Tare Paitan pork marrow / chicken broth / shoda shoyu tare / scallions sauteed mushrooms / cha-shu (marinated pork belly) 30 min egg / corn / nori".  I think I made a good choice - it was delicious! Our meal arrived within 5 mins and was very tasty and fulfilling. Great lunch spot or take out choice for those working downtown. Would like to return to try the curry options.
