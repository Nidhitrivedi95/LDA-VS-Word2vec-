JOrz9T33rVHDbusIKPj96g We were actually going to dinner to a restaurant around the corner but we passed this restaurant and my wife commented that she hasn't had chiu chow cuisine in a while. So we decided to split our dinner at 2 restaurants. 

After eating our half dinner at the first place (which by normal standards was a full dinner, if I'm being honest with myself), we came here for dinner part #2 and got the Fried Lobster with Ginger & Green Onion, Marinated duck (Chiu Chow style) and Deep Fried Filet with Chili Salt (which turned out to be grouper filets). For greens, we went with the tried and tested snow pea leaves with garlic. Can't usually go wrong with that.

What we really wanted, instead of the fried grouper, was the deep fried pomfret fish. It has been ages since I've seen that on a menu but it was the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival celebration and the restaurant was packed all night long. So, unfortunately they were all out. I give them props for even having it on the menu though.

The food turned out to be quite ordinary to le wife and my disappointment. The lobster had too much corn starch in the sauce. After cooling slightly you could see the huge gelatinous clumps of corn starch clinging to the lobster - but hey it's lobster so we ate it all. The duck was disappointing as it had a mushy texture to it which was strange and slightly off putting. Nothing special about the fried grouper either but it was salted nicely. Good drinking dish if you're having a cerveza or two. 

I'm not sure if we got the right dishes. If I lived in Mississauga, I'd come back here to try some of the other stuff but unfortunately we were only there for a day. Boy I really wish they had the pomfret. My mission now is to find it in NY.
