1skTxDMBQSpElbLfhBgmVQ Great food for the price, nothing beats Golden Flower off Russel and Pecos but this place is right at the top. The Lemon Chicken is good and so if the BBQ pork fried rice. Friendly staff and you can see them cooking the food from the counter which is cool. This place is worth going to again.
