7Nz4kTghhicjsR23GYMlLg I just had absolutely the most tasteless Chinese food I've ever tried. Thanks, Jade Dragon! 

The ingredients all seemed to be fresh and the takeout containers rule. Now, if only someone could explain "flavor" to these folks. Seriously, I've had a lot of Orange Chicken in my time, some good and some bad, but until tonight I'd never had any that was 97% FLAVORLESS. (How does that even happen when a pretty strong flavor is part of the dish's name?!) But even the chicken packed a flavor punch compared to the fried rice. It was literally brown rice with some oil and vegetables. Apparently there is a strict "No Seasonings" policy at this place. Not so much as a hint of salt. And for the hefty price, this was a real disappointment.
