eMTE-wqpk_YWaV3mf7Ii3A This is a very pretty restaurant - inside and outside. The patio is lovely and the decor on the inside is dark wood, straight lines and very chic.

I met a couple of friends for lunch and realized there's no entrance from the mall so you have to exit where Michel's Baguette & Jugo Juice are on the upper level to access the restaurant. 

I know that Spring Rolls calls itself Asian-fusion food, but I've never had a hot-pink, SOUR pad thai dish before. It was revolting. I picked at it because it was $10.99 and I felt guilty about wasting so much food, but after having about half of it I felt nauseous just looking at the plate.

My friends were not impressed with their appetizers or main dishes either. We ordered the shrimp rolls to share and they were minuscule! They were served in a martini glass full of marinara sauce but you would have had to quadruple their shrimp rolls portions to make it proportional to the amount of sauce. 

Service was slow - even three glasses of water took 10 minutes to arrive at our table. The best thing we had of all the thing we ordered was the fruit smoothie...
