taXKuFldSoerm9SXrckh_w This is the best Chinese restaurant I have ever had! The staff is very friendly, I get delivery and it arrives hot and fresh they get my order right every time, The food is so good I highly recommend them. if you haven't tried them you should give them a chance you wont regret it.
