taXKuFldSoerm9SXrckh_w Now I have to say, it ain't good if it ain't attracting Asians, and this place was flocking with Asians. The food was really delicious. I don't really see a flaw about it, it was clean, the staff was nice and the food, well my food was ready in 15 minutes just like they said, and it was great! Fresh hot! And the Tupperware is a plus! Don't throw it away, you can reuse it in the near future. Good bang for your buck and I ordered for pick up and they packed it very securely in a brown paper bag, very presentable. Yeah I'll definitely be coming back here every time I get the chance.
