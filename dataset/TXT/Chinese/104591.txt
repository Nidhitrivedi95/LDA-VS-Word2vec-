kP2wC0luve3mT5fcdrA3nQ This week the Jolly Diners went to China Village. We started out with vegetable egg rolls and crab rangoons. The main courses were egg foo yung for my sister, sweet and sour chicken for my mother, vegetable chow mein for my brother-in-law, and vegetable chow mein for me; with the addition of tofu. Everything was prepared and served expertly. The wait staff served us China black tea and beverages right away. They offered help on the specials and they were great throughout the meal. I didn't know what chow-fung noodles were and so they brought me a small dish of chow-fung noodles to try. Both the service and the food were delicious and reasonably priced. If you have a family, you're on a date, or you just want a really good Chinese meal - then try China Village. It's very obvious this team of professionals had been doing this for some time.  The Jolly Diners rated China Village at an overall 5 out of 5. Hope you enjoy it the same way we did.
