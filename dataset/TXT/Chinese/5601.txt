0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA OMG what is wrong with you Yelper's bragging about this place!  If this is the first place you ever had Vietnamese food you have been duped!  I have been there 3 times and I am done. Today was for lunch.  Cheap plastic furniture starts it off. We sit down at a table that was soaking wet and a older guy comes over with menus. Ten minutes later he brings us water. Five woman come in and sit down.  He brings them water. As he walks by I ask him if we can order. Nope he goes and takes the orders for the 5 women who of course get there food ahead of us and we now are there over 30 minutes.

Simple food ratings-
Lemongrass chicken Dry as can be and it comes with no sauce.
Pineapple Curry Chicken was terrible.
Lastly the short ribs matched the other two dishes.

Other than the food runner the staff was not friendly.

Never again
