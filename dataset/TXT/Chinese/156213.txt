tQH_DyUIWYOHMD7CYg6-jQ I'm a Hakka Chinese so I know good Hakka food when I eat it. The food here is what I eat at home and considering friends and colleagues love my family's food this place is just as good. A bit far for a Toronto native but worth the drive if you want some good food. By the way there is a LOT of spicy food
