Qi_7WcHFwjZZsz9CHXC7Dw Best Chinese in Huntersville but, you have to drive to Cornelius to eat there (it borders H'ville). Dine in or take out available.  I order the General Tso chicken with steamed rice.  I dine in when I visit, the place is very tidy, atmosphere is business casual and service is good.  Portions are generous enough where you might have some to take home for later.
