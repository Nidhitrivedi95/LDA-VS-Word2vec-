BmSLyxm8b86dtzwuT7LqBA Pretty long wait for a bowl of noodles considering this is a food court place. Very simple bowl of noodles in a light broth with a few pieces of bbq pork. The noodles were a little soft, would have preferred it more if it was cooked a little less. Besides the appeal of handmade noodles and a demonstration of how the noodles are made while waiting for the order, there was nothing else that made it special. The price for the meal is good compared to the other places around.

Overall, would not go through the crazy Pacific Mall parking just to have the noodles again.
