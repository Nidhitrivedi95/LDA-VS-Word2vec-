Chin Chin's doesn't say on the website that they have a breakfast buffet.  But it was good.  The previous day we had gone to the breakfast buffet at MORE in the Luxor.  Chin Chin has the superior buffet when it comes to quality of food.  The selection was very good.  I would recommend this buffet.  The service was very good as well.  Jose was very busy but he kept us stocked up on coffee.
