K4-J1A_ZIzG2yNkee0KOaA Coming here late night for some comfort food we decided to keep it local.
Keungs has been here for sometime since this plaza came to existence.
The place is very spacious and clean with contemporary decor.
With its late hours till 2am on weekends J and I decided to order some congee after grabbing one of the many booths available.
With an order of dough fritter, we decided to order their Eggs and preserved salty eggs with pork congee.
Overall for both dishes averaged to 3/5.
