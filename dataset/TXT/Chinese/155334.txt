tK-PQOhZo94fonbQVXaOSg One of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever eaten at! 

Let me preface my review by saying I've lived in several states, but spent the majority of my life in the upper-Midwest; if you like that style of Chinese food, this is the place for you! 

The regional differences in American-Chinese food is heavier than many would suspect, however many of my fellow Midwestern-ers turned Arizonians agree that this is the place to go for eastern American Chinese food.

Everything we've had so far has been above average  to excellent (well, except the Hot and Sour soup which was kind of blah).  Seriously, I recommend this place to everyone when they ask! 

(and the driver is super friendly :) )
