_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA I was so pleasantly surprised by this place. I went to Vegas with a few friends and one of them really wanted to go here. I saw the name of the place and thought to myself... really? Noodle Asia?

Good thing I gave it a shot. My boyfriends and I weren't super hungry so we ordered an order of egg rolls and we split a BBQ Pork and Roast Duck noodle soup. Honestly I wasn't expecting much, but this place was pretty good. The broth was toned down for the American clientele, but it was still flavorful and rich. The BBQ Pork and the Roast Duck were so yummy. The egg rolls were just okay, nothing out of the ordinary.

I will definitely be eating here again. I mean, you know the place is good when you go to an Asian restaurant and all you see are Asians eating there.
