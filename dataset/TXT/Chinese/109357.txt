lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA This is the exact opposite of a real chinese restaurant. Great service and not so good food. Clean, nice ambience but the food is just not authentic. 

The service is undoubtedly excellent and the staff is incredible but the food is just mediocre. 

We ordered the seafood noodle which was tasteless. The broth was just so basic. The Hainanese chicken was very bland as well. The bbq was actually not too bad but expensive. If the price was lower I wouldn't be so upset but the price is just too much for the food. Probably won't be back unless I have no car and stuck in the palazzo lol. 

PEACE!
