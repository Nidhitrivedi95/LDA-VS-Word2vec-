MKviRVX2QxRgGS6juCEeYg Great hole in the wall late night dining option.  We use to go more often but they've changed the decor a bit and also raised there prices significantly from before so I have to give them a lower rating.  Also consistency is not the same as before as we noticed sometimes the food quality is off.  
However if you feel for the munchies at 1am or so, there is not much better!
Basically they serve all the Hong Kong favorites but some of our favorites is the Chicken with Ginger in Hot Pot, Stir fried Clam and Chili Chicken.
Service is fast and typical of most HK diners.
