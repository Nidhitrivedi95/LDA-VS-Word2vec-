We had a pleasant meal. We were a party of five and wanted as quiet a table as possible and the restaurant was more than accommodating.

Staff was friendly. Service was timely.

We asked about MSG and they were forthright about what to order, what not to order and where it could be eliminated. So no problems there.

Eggs rolls were good (they have MSG)

The potstickers came - atypically for me - in a broth. I thought they had brought the wrong food. But that's how they were prepared. And they were very tasty as was the broth.

Five of us split four dishes. Mongolian beef was the best and very good. Kung Pao chicken was was good but the peanuts seemed like an afterthought rather than a part of the dish. Buddha Delight mixed vegetables were okay. Fried rice disappointed in that the pork and other protein was dried out. 

The biggest issue for me was that I felt completely overcome by salt a short while after dinner but that might just be me.
