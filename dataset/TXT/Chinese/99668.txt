Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Orchid Garden is one of the 2 locations in vegas off strip that serves decent dim sum.  They have the standard stuff, nothing fancy, har gow, siu mai, pork buns, radish cakes, spring rolls, etc. I saw the historical museum guy from pawn stars with the red shirt and funny hat!  He knew that I recognized him and tipped his hat to say hello!  ;)   Friendly!

Back to the restaurant, the carpet could use a touch up or a new carpet.  Things are starting to look old and dirty.
