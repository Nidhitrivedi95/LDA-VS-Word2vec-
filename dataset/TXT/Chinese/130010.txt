pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA The place was packed, it was Friday night, and we did not have a reservation. I thought we were doomed, but we were able to be seated at the sushi bar in 5 minutes.
I have some food allergies and told the waitress what I couldn't eat. Despite her being clearly busy and running her butt off, she took the time to help guide me through the menu. And if she didn't know, she was ready and willing to find out (despite clearly being hella busy!)
My cocktail was complex and intriguing (but supposedly spicy and it wasn't) and I'd love to try to figure out how to make it at home.
The plating was spectacular for all of the dishes. The standout was the shishito peppers (which I always love, but these were extra awesome.)
The foie gras on one of my sushi rolls was a really nice touch.

I'd give 10 stars for service, if I could. But my 4-star rating is for food alone. That said, I'd still really recommend giving it a go.
