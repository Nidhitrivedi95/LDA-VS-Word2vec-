eV-5b1Bjtnn-QePN3t3taQ i come here every time I visit Vegas. The price is well worth it. It's $9.99 for lunch and $13.99 for dinner AYCE stir fry.  The ingredients are always very fresh and the kitchen area is open, not cluttered, and very clean.  The way it works is you are given a bowl in which you can fill it up as much as you want with the variety of meats, veggies, and sauces available.  After building your bowl, just hand it to the staff behind the counter and they will cook it for you on the huge grill (which will only take maybe between 3-5 minutes to cook).  Lastly, the staff will ask if you would like a scoop of white or brown rice to enjoy your stir fry with.  The first round, I decided to have the stir fry with the Go Lo Mein noodles.  Second round, I decided to have a scoop of rice instead of the noodles.  Third round, I just had the meat and veggie stir fry without rice or noodles.  In any case, it was delicious.  The sauces are amazing here.  They have something that's sure to suit everyone's own tastes.  The sauces available are fire, hot, pineapple, curry, garlic, sweet, house, soybean oil, and sesame oil.  Mix and match 'um and have fun creating your own unique personalized stir fry flavors!  I personally love the house, garlic, sesame, and soybean oil in my stir fry.  

Next time you plan a trip to Vegas, check this place out if you want great stir fry without putting a big hole in your wallet. The staff is wonderful as well, very friendly.  I always look forward to visiting them whenever in Vegas :)
