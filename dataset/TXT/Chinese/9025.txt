If you want fried rice with a meal it's $2 to swap the white rice. If you want shrimp fried rice it's $3. When you order unless you clearly specify a size they won't ask and will automatically charge you for a large. I ordered chicken in cashews and it was not good. They made it in peanuts and when I called they said to come back and they would make another. When I got there they refused to make another and gave me a cup of cashews and told me to pick out the peanuts. When I said it wasn't good they said plenty of people order it. I will never be back. That's no way to earn my business.
