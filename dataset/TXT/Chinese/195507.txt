zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ It's great to find good Vietnamese on the northwest side.  Finally visited after passing by so many times.  Yum!!!!  Tried the summer rolls...packed full of cold noodles, veggies and shrimp.  Peanut sauce for dipping was just right.  Love spring rolls wrapped in lettuce with fresh bean sprouts.  Spring rolls came hot...very hot...right out of the fryer.  The sides of fresh veggies were perfect.  Has the beef ball pho, split  with my wife.  Plenty to split...taste was yummy with some peppers was just right.  Left with a bill just over $20 (including tip).  Atmosphere was ok, nothing fancy.  Clean but basic.  I think with a little bit of time, this will improve.  Total repeat!!!
