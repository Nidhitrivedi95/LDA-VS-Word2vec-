TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ Outstanding lunch special that is served up quick by super friendly staff.
 
My personal favorite is the General chicken with fried rice and Wonton soup.  The pieces of chicken are all white meat.  Not pieces of chicken parts but ALL WHITE MEAT.

For an added bonus give the pot stickers a try.

With drink, less then $8 out the door.
