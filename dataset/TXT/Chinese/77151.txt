The service there is exceptional and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  

Some of the food menu items are quite good and it is hard to go wrong with their fried rice and mandoo dumplings (sorry forgot Chinese name).  Although they present themselves as Szechuan the heat is toned down.  Ah, way down, but you can remedy that by asking for chile oil. The other dishes we sampled were average at best, but this is Cleveland and we are still looking for our first really good Chinese restaurant.  The pea shoots with garlic were not bad as far as taste, but the vegetables were not properly drained so the dish came to the table soupy.  But, at least they were only slightly overcooked.  The spicy beef dish was the weakest of the four dishes we had.  The beef had been pounded out to tenderize it, but the dried chiles that were added for flavor had not been effectively rehydrated.  As a result chewing the pepper pieces was a bit like chewing sandpaper.

I'm adjusting my rating one star higher than I normally would because they are very nice there ... So a 5 for service, courtesy and adjacent parking and easy access combine with the 3 for food to be a 4.  Plus they have beer and wine.
