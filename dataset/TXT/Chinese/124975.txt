oVtnnGat2Wco0ksQT1cGCA We go there quite frequently, since it was opened last year. 
We loved the freshness of the food, the ambiance and the service.
But over time we are seeing a fall in the quality and cleanliness. 

Still it's one of the good places for sushi lovers, good and wide choices of sushi/maki/sashimi and a nice dining environment. We really expect the quality of the food and service to get better, like the initial months when it was opened.
