dJnF_GUWdoX3tUucpKbYMg I went here for dim sum just the other day. As a Vancouver native, I've learned to lower my standards when it comes to food here over the years. With that being said, this place is pretty standard. Dishes are relatively cheap and decently sized for the price (except for the Feng zhao aka. chicken feet). 

The most important part for me is the MSG levels. I did NOT get that thirsty feeling that is so very characteristic of high MSG levels. 

Service was slower than I would have hoped. Some dishes took almost an hour to come. Not so good if you're looking for a quick dim sum fix.
