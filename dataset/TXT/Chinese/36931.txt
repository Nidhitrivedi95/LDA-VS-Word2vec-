AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw Great Tap List! Poor Service

We went on a weekday night, so not exactly in the middle of peak time. The tap list is probably the best on Scottsdale and Shea! However if you actually want to eat, or get a second beer you're probably going to have to wait a while. When food finally does arrive, don't expect anyone to come back to your side of the bar for follow-up (we were literally sitting at the bar!!!). So... If you're just going there to have a few beers or pick up take-out (the food is pretty good), this is a good spot. If on the other hand you plan on eating there, bring your patience and drink another beer. :)
