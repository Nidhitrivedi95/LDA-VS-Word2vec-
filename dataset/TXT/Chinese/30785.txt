9gQyf3h7XK0lKJYLGcIYlA I've been going to this restaurant for a close to a year now. I guess the honeymoon is over. I ordered lunch today at 11:08am. I called it in so I would not have to wait. I ordered 2 lunch combos and a side of steamed dumplings. When I arrived to pick up my order, the tab was over $20. I asked the woman what I ordered that came up to over $20. She said I ordered a lunch combo and a regular combo and dumplings. I told her I ordered 2 lunch combos. Again she said I did not say lunch combo then she started to argue with me. I paid my tab, took my food and went home. I looked at my food and both containers had the same amount of food in them. I called back to Fu Shing II and asked to speak to the manager. The same woman said that he was not there. I asked her what was the difference between a lunch combo and a dinner combo. She recognized my voice and began to argue again. I could not get a word in so I hung up. This is sooooo unacceptable to me.  The food is good but I'm looking for a better experience with the people.
