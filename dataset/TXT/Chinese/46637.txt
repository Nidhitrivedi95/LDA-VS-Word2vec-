BwbPzuEuIN_oFmNRJIgHlg I wish they had 2.5 stars! I enjoyed the experience,  friendly staff, unique when they prepare steak at your table, very clean... The signature beef noodle is good, at $22.60 (minus tip) it's not that good...
I was ready to keep walking because I assumed it would be packed (dinner time on bloor st), it wasn't, lots of tables. IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. if it was $12 I'd return, $22 is a one time visit. Too bad....
