D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Pretty good Malaysian food. The roti canai is pretty good with the curry sauce. It was sad that they did not have fish curry dipping sauce. Most of the dishes are pretty authentic, as I grew up in Malaysia. I know. The curry laksa was good. Nasi lemak mediocre, but if you guys want to get an idea of how nasi lemak taste like.. I guess you guys can order it because it's not bad. The char quay teow was also pretty good. The servers are very attentive and I will probably visit again.
