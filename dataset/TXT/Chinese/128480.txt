PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ This is one of the better places for Dim Sum in LV. They serve it all day, as well. The food is great. I haven't tried their regular entrees, yet. Until I do, I'll keep this review at 4 stars. They have a lot of diversity in choice of foods. The price is a plus, as well. The service is fine. When dining dim-sum style, there's not much "interaction" between server and diner. Hence, why I'll wait until I try their main menu.
