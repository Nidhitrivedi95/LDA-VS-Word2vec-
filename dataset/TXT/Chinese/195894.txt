ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg I don't go to Chinese restaurants for the customer service or ambiance. It doesn't bother me that Congee Queen does not excel at either of these. 

The place is clean, service is quick, and the food is excellent. They turn the tables quickly enough that you don't have to wait very long even during peak hours. You can find cheaper alternatives in Scarborough or in Chinatown, but there is nothing cheaper in the immediate area that is comparable. 

My favourite dishes:
- fried chili turnip patties
- spice & pepper salt squid
- lemon chicken
- shrimp and chicken fried rice in cream & tomato sauce
- bbq pork
- dough fritter
