c-Ur4wPDNjt-e2N5MkRRaQ We had 5 different dishes and loved each one! The atmosphere is relaxed and quiet; perfect for a quick lunch or romantic dinner. Service was amazing, our tea was kept hot and fresh, and we were checked in and accommodated no matter how busy the restaurant got. 

If you are unsure of what to order, they do have a picture menu that you can scroll through with the name and item number for easier ordering. 

Overall, we were really pleased with the food and impressed with the service!
