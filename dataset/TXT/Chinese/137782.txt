QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw I went to Madison for a getaway trip. Finding a Chinese restaurant with a good review is pretty hard as most have low ratings. I am glad that I chose Mini Hot Pot. It tastes pretty great and the owner is awesome and friendly.

The one thing I don't like is that some items for the hot pot are over priced. For example, the $1.95 vegetable plate only has a few leaves and the $1.95 mushroom plate only has three small mushrooms.

However, there are some free stuff. Noodles, potatoes are free.

Overall, good choice in Madison.
