WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg Chili chicken was amazing. Highly recommended.
Hakka Chow Mein was nothing special 
(although the waiter warned me that it was not a dish that blows your mind, haha), but it was cooked well. 

Service was decent, a little bit slow. 
I am definitely coming back for more. We will see how they perform :)

UPD: Other dishes I recommend: General Kwan chicken wings. 
This place is a good lunch option.
