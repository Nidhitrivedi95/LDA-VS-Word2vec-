Kig-T7wfebjGIpgSKcdlKA I'm a big fan of pho and I think Big Bowl is one of the exceptional ones in the Mississauga/ Halton area. Their food is great and price is reasonable. However, I think their customer services isn't that great... 
Last few times we went the orders were messed up, we werent really bothered by that until recently one of the waitresses dropped off some wonton which we didn't order. We told her thats not our order but she said they are free. Assuming they are really free, my boyfriend and I started biting to it... then another server spotted that and ran over and commanded us to stop and told us those aren't our food; and he took the plate away right away which I find it very rude. We don't really care about the free food or what not. But he sounded like we shouldnt be eating that plate while his colleague put it there.

And the worst part is less than 2 minutes later, they brought out the same plate and handed it to the table next to us... We could tell the gentlemen at that table wasn't impressed at all because basically they reserve the same plate of food to another table.

After this experience, I'm not sure if I would go back to this restaurant again.
