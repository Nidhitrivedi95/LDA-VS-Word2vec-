Each time I've been here, I've had the Ming Family dinner & be prepared...it is A LOT of food!  It easily serves my entire family of 4 with plenty of left overs. for lunch the next day.  The Sizzling Rice is fun & tasty, as is the Pu Pu Platter.  My son LOVED the Tangerine Chicken (not so spicy, as requested)!  I enjoyed the Pork Fried Rice and so did my daughter.  My husband's favorite is the Mongolian Beef.  For us, there's something for everyone!!  I almost forgot...the service was top notch as well. 
I guess the only thing I'm not a fan of is the beef.  Although my husband likes it, I thought it was a bit chewy & gristley (I know...it's not a word)! Give this place a try.  It's better than most of the other Chinese joints in the area.
