G6_M3Dg-gjwVIbRGLIRBkw One of the few Chinese places that delivers around Matthews, NC! Not only that, but the food was great! You give instructions and they execute. Quick, easy, satisfying and the portions! You can save for another meal, so it's definitely worth the value. Crazy this place isn't higher rated!
