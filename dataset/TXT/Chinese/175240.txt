wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA I stayed at the hyatt place across the street from Stir Krazy. Without a doubt their food was amazing. When you prep your dish the employees give you tips on sauces to make sure you enjoy your food. 

Pro: You an pile up as much broccoli, carrots, beef, pork, chicken noodles and other normal ingredients associated with Mongolian meals. So stack it as high as you can;there is no limit! When I came back to the hotel room all the other guests said the food smelled good. And I agreed with them as I ate it in their faces. Shortly after and for the next few days my family and I became regulars of this place during our short time. Unfortunately when I asked the manager if I could get some commission for bringing everyone over to eat.

The prices were good also. I would definitely return! Last but not least its al you can eat if you dine in.

Con: There is not a Stir Krazy in my area.
