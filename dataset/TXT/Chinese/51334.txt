cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A I went a while back and was excited from all the big talk on how great this place is. Unfortunately the chicken was extremely dry and the rice and beans I could have made better at home with more flavor..... Maybe it was a bad day or something not sure.... I almost threw the food in the garbage..... hopefully they can improve... it could have been a off day....
