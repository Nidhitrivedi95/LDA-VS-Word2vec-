1yAbNyUgJhOjCz9EcOCWdA Although most people prefer the traditional dim sum restaurants with carts, I am one who prefers the paper ordering. This is probably because I enjoy eating dim sum at dinner which most people raise an eyebrow at. Its hard to find a lot of places that serve dim sum at all hours of the day in downtown Toronto since this isn't normal dim sum protocol, but I like coming back to here.

There isn't much to report in terms of its uniqueness. We are often eating in there with only a couple other tables at 7pm on a Friday, but the food is really good.

The one dish that keeps me coming back is their fried shrimp and port dumplings. There is a crispiness to them I have not tasted in other fried dumplings. Its hard to describe in words why they are different, so the only option is to try it.

One knock I have on the dim sum is that the paper's English descriptions of dishes are very vague, and so its hard to know what you are ordering until it comes out.
