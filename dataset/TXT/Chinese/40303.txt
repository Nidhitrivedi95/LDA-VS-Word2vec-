B_v7rpwUV1mZf0VSCm1IQg I've lived in Scarborough almost my whole life, and I never would have found this place if it wasn't recommended by a friend.

We got the fish maw soup, shrimp pakora, hung mei mein, chili chicken (less spice), chili crispy beef, manchurian fried rice, and beef and broccoli. My favorite was the shrimp pakora by far. It was perfectly fried and very tasty, definitely a must have. All of the other food ranged from decent to good. I was very happy that they would accommodate spice levels as we had a person who did not like spicy food.

The dining area is quite small and could definitely use some additional lighting. However, the staff was very friendly and gave me a homecooked vibe to the meal.

This place is definitely worth a try if you are in to hakka style food.
