4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A We came here for new year's eve dinner after we lost our reservations at a seafood restaurant.  We came here on a recommendation because I haven't had good hot pot in a long time. It was also bitterly cold last night so hot pot was actually a great idea.

Firstly the waiters are pretty non responsive but I already expected that. They are overworked a bit so you just have to be a bit patient and holler a couple, three...ok maybe four times to get their attention.

Since we came on nye, they charged us the weekend price which is fine. A 2 dollar extra we got the seafood as well which included oysters, muscles, scallops, salmon, mushrooms....One piece each.  Not bad.

The beef, lamb and pork slices were quite fresh. The homemade squid and meat balls were very good. The dumplings and wontons were the usual.  I really liked all the different sauces you can order for dipping.  Also the lemon tea drink was tasty.

All in all it was very good ayce hot pot...you just have to learn to be patient with the wait staff which could get some people annoyed.

2 stars for the wait staff.
4 stars for the food.
