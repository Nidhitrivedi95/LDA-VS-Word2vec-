TSGBM2z5BTeJvYQAznz8Fg The selection of raw sushi for the lunch buffet is incredible! For only a mere $9.99. Lots of other seafood and non-seafood goodies to choose from too. Excellent steamed clams! Real ice cream (not soft-serve) including Green Tea. Nice décor and very clean. Attentive service. Best buffet of it's kind since Todai back in 2005.
