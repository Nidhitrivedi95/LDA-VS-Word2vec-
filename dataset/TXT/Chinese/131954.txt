PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ 3 stars I feel is worthy rating for this place. This was my first time ever eating at a shabu grill and I was not impressed by this place due to how they are not real explanatory in how their restraunt works. They give 2 broths one is spicy and one is straight water. I don't know is tis is the norm at a shabu grill but I felt lost. and there selection of sauce sucked and there were like no labels so I was mostly going In blind but there hog apps were good jus make sure u order ur fill because u can only order once.
