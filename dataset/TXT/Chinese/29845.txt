966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA I love Wendy's. They are one of my favorite Chinese places. They have a really unique menu. They have a lot if items that they don't carry at your typical Chinese joint while still having a lot of the traditional things you would find.

I've been on many occasions and usually get the wonton soup with egg noodles. 

I also recommend the Portuguese curry with fried pork. 

Crispy pan fries egg noodles are delicious also.

They also have those soup dumplings.

The prices range a lot so you can get a really affordable meal while they have some things that are a little pricier. 

They also have a lot of unique drinks and desserts.


The main thing I love about Wendy's is the staff. They are really good with kids and that's a huge plus for me.
