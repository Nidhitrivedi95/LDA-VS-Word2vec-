k2c7nIIDgY-FD6Yk-I_3Ww We just walked (wok'ed) to this new restaurant to give it a try. I was unsure of what Indo Chinese food would be like, but they explained very well the mix of spices they use.  The owner was very kind and helped us pick out dishes, which were very tasty. We had spicy chicken and lamb in cayenne sauce, as well as soup. We look forward next time to try more of the vegetable stirfry dishes. The whole staff was very nice and there was a lot of diversity among the customers which makes you feel like it's good authentic food.
