Let's break it down. Service is horrible. Not enjoyable considering the staffs SO rude and unprofessional. The server seems like we were bothering her.  

My food was... I don't even remember what I ordered. Clearly it was forgettable. There are plenty other Chinese Restaurants that are much better. If you are looking for fantastic Chinese food in Vegas- this really isn't it.  

Price is high, but it's normal in Vegas. Why not just stop by other restaurants with better service and better food?

Aka, don't go here, you will get terrible service,and average food with the same price.  Plus, they just lost potential client with that kind of attitude...
