OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA I'm not happy with my visit to Lin gardens. The food was not fresh at all and the noodles were really dry. Broccoli also tasted like grass. Customer service wasn't great as well, the lady kept ignoring us when we would ask for water. Overall, I will not be coming here again. 
Toodles.
