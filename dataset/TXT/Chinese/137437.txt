qJ18IGaDsQtzJ6v2UzkdcQ We have ordered take out from this Grand China several times and liked it! Tonight it was exceptional. The hot and sour soup was deeply layered in flavors. The best we've had anywhere! We enjoy Moo Shu Vegetable and tonight it was fabulous, but the pancakes were a little old and the only reason for the 4 points rating. But if I could have I'd have given them a rating of 4 1/2! It really was no problem, as I saved on carbs and that was fine with me. Beef broccoli and Kung Pao chicken (extra spicy) also quite good! I had to call the restaurant to let them know how impressed we were. I don't do that very often. Delivery time was less than they told us, so another plus. So nice when you have a great restaurant so close to home!
