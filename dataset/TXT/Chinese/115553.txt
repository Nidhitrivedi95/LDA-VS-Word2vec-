n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A Where to begin? From the loud and horribly designed main dining room to the many distractions like the chef banging the noodles disturbing guest conversations, or the roof going up and down, room colors changing every fifteen minutes or the way too loud and out of place music its difficult to say what I disliked most...actually no it's not: it was the waitstaff saying your Peking duck is ready and removing food from our table that we didn't even finish eating yet. They were untrained at best, rude at worst. You can bet we won't be going back there anytime soon. And yes we thought a few dishes were good such as the shrimp with candied walnuts but the BBQ pork ribs or corn and crab soup or noodles were just plain uninteresting. 

Do yourself a favor, and head to RAO's if in Caesars and avoid The disappointing mr. Chow.
