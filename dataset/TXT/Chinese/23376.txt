6tm4ttFRiSZEyGFXikqWtw Awesome Chinese food - very busy take out place - they deliver or you can order and drive up.  Their menu is online and they have tasty family meals.  Portions are very good and enough to split for 2 people - good size dishes with crispy veggies in the dishes (usually green peppers, celery, carrots, baby corn, bamboo shoots etc). Really as good as China Town in Toronto and Markham.  This is real deal Chinese food (tasty, not too greasy, fresh veggies, sauces are tasteful with just the right amount of spice in the Szechwan and Flavour in their Black bean sauce - their curry's are good also).  If you order a certain amount (I think $25 and pay cash) you get free Chinese Chicken Wings also with your delivery.

I highly recommend this place for Chinese Food.  Ajax sorely lacks an array of good Chinese food - this place makes up for it.
