XaqWUocr0MlYVi5yusjk0Q I ordered this by accident. Thought I was ordering from No. 1 Chinese (which I love), but clicked the wrong button on yelp.
Chicken teriyaki: awesome! Very tender and flavorful with large pieces of chicken. 4 skewers.
Chicken fried rice: they have a lot of nerve calling this fried rice. It was slightly yellow, with some scraggly pieces of very white chicken and a few sprouts. So. Bland. No flavor whatsoever.
Shrimp lo mein: meh. Could've used more shrimp. The flavor was ok-ish.
Beef and broccoli: beef was very tender, broccoli was very fresh, but again NO flavor, especially no Chinese flavor.
Egg drop soup: and again...NO FLAVOR.
When I order (american) Chinese food, I usually expect some hint of (american) Chinese flavor. 
Will NEVER order again, I'll be sticking to No. 1 Chinese, which may not be perfect but at least had (American) Chinese flavor.
And I must add, the only reason they still have a decent number of stars is because for some reason the many other negative reviews have not been posted. But you can read them at the bottom of the page.
