OIw3415Pgh2_5eNPCiIN8A We visited this place earlier this week. It's one of the more decent AYCE sushi joints in Oakville. The host and most of the servers are friendly, but avoid the Asian guy with a slight ponytail-he comes off as rude (forgetting to bring drinks, banging plates/glasses) and for the price you pay, brings down the service rating.

As far as food goes, the sashimi is fresh and teppanyaki (chicken and beef) are well cooked and well marinated. Dim sum is okay, but you're better off ordering from their sushi list. Also avoid take out and a la carte, this place is great if you're looking for a buffet of food as it is better served fresh.
