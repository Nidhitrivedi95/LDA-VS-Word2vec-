nH9sGGOaW0ONeIYcmsK3EQ Went for dim sum. Excellent taste. Got siu mai, har gow, chicken feet, egg custard tarts, crystal shrimp rolls. The only, bad thing is that we didn't order tea because we knew that they would charge us $1. But they added it on our bill, we disputed this and they gave us some bs answer that they charge it anyways if we don't drink it or not. Then they gave us another bs answer saying they charged it because it was ``standard`` amongst dimsum restaurants. What a load of crock!!! They then said it was being used to pay kitchen staff ahhaha. Honestly, I would've tipped more because my meal was so good! But this left a sour taste in my mouth. Don't get scammed people.
