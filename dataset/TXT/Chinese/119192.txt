So I yelp a nearby place for lunch and this comes up but as noodles something or other which has 5 starts with 2 reviews.  I cant find it...do I call and its pan Asia...so I ask oh did you change the name? The girl says no I dont think so...any ways we decide to eat here and go in. The place was pretty empty, just another couple at the bar.

  The waitress quickly comes over and gives us menus and drinks. So right on the top of the menu it says ...formally simply noodles?  I realize  that our waitress is the one who answered tbe phone. I asked about the special that was on the chalkboard and she turns to the other patron at the bar and asked him to explain it to me? It was some chicken over cucumber salad..so she adds..well I have only sold one of those so I don't know if its very good. Really?

 So I ask about some other dishes and end up ordering a shrimp and chicken curry noodle ..my husband orders a beef noodle dish ... both were delicious!   

                                      Neither dish was exactly as yge waitress discribed them. But honestly really good food. I love that I could've sat at the bar and watched the food being prepared.             

What I dont love is families sitting at the bar with 4 teanagers.  So the bar area is cool for watching the chef...but it is a full bar. I mean 3 girls came in and sat at the bar telling the waitress that they have a party of 5. About 5 minutes later the parents come in with another young girl...but what if there were no parents? Either way. ..not cool.

So 5 stars for the delicious food and the chef who knows the menu:) 

3 stars for the quick waitress that literaly knows nothing about the menu or the restaurant itself.

0 stars for allowing minors at the bar.
