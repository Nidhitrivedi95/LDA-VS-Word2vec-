gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw Just arrived to AZ craving Sushi the fish is fresh the staff was Sooo nice and welcoming. The sign on the wall says "quality is always in style". My wife is pregnant they made cooked rolls for her no mayo, no spicy, cut using a  knife that was not used on fresh fish. 

You can pay more for amazing Sushi but you can't guarantee great service with a smile:)
