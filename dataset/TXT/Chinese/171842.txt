VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Flo's lunch deal is good bargain. The dishes are usually around 7$ and come with a salad with a tasty dressing and bowl of won tons with a nice orange dipping sauce. I usually order the Teriyaki bowl and they now have the option of white or brown rice. It is enough food that I can only eat half of it and bring the rest home for dinner. I enjoy the ultra quick water refills as well. You can't beat the lunch deal I recommend it highly! Only complaint is that it can get a bit noisy when it's packed and it's usually packed!
