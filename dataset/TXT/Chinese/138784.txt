Qqu_MRaus17-4VVmzXq1_g Visited this location with some friends the other day. Nothing really to say about this location......it is clean, small restaurant. Traditional Cantonese food was served, Overall, it was a nice experience. 

On thing that you have to be careful of is the parking. The parking here is terrible. There were crazy drivers everywhere, and I almost got hit by one person while I was trying to park. Off to the side, I saw two people arguing over a parking spot. Maybe it was the lunch hour rush, or maybe it was a sunday afternoon and everyone was hungry....Whatever it was....i will not be going back there any time soon.
