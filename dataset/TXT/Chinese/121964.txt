OBnqMdIsS8vWPrzPtnlb-w I recently had a destination wedding and needed a place to have a home wedding banquet for those who couldn't travel.  Chengdu Delight was able to serve 140 for my private event with some alterations to the menu.  Some of my guests are sensitive to spicy food and I requested that some dishes have little to no spice.  The owners were very accommodating and the dishes they served were phenomenal!  We had ten dishes with 10 people at each table.  After everyone finished eating there was still lots of leftover food!  Service was quick and fantastic.  The waiters were attentive and friendly.  My mother raved how clean the restaurant looked!  Before my wedding banquet, I dined at Chengdu several times and love their menu!  Some of my favorite dishes include special mushroom, yu xiang eggplant, spicy water boil fish and beef, crab with ginger and onion, and braised pork belly.  Chengdu exceeding my expectations making sure me and my guests were well taken care of.  I highly recommend this place!
