It was hard to rate this restaurant because there were some things I loved and some things I hated about this place.

Pros:
- Hand pulled noodles!  They had the perfect chewy texture that you can only get from hand pulled noodles.
- Chef making the noodles.  I absolutely love that you walk in and can watch the chef pulling the noodles right in front of you!

Cons:
- Cramped seating.  Three of us were seated at a small table for two, one of which was seated in the aisle and had to get up to let customers past.
- Service.  The restaurant was busy but the staff was very pushy about getting us in and out as soon as possible.  While I understand their need for turnover, there are tactful ways of doing this and they were blunt and pushy.
They also seemed very cold.  When I left I told the staff member that was ringing me out that their noodles were absolutely delicious and he just grunted at me and showed me the door.
- Cilantro!  This can be good or bad to some people but I didn't like that they threw a handful of cilantro in the noodles without mentioning it on the menu.

Overall, the noodles and soup were really good!  I would consider coming again if I just wanted a quick bite to eat.  However, I'm very disappointed that they can't surround good food with competent staff.
