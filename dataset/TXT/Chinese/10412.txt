1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Actually I forgot to mention that the day after we got take out and we noticed that the rice in our chicken and rice was not the seasoned kind but the regular kind. So upsetting BC the rice is a big reason we order chicken and rice! I don't know if that was a mistake or they always do that for take out.
