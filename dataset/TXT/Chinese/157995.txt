tWtuHpIFtQHMQq8q8DG3dA Overpriced "health" food. That's what this is. This is an asian restaurant that is cashing in on the health movement within Cleveland (and elsewhere of course) and doing so kinda lazily. 

The food isn't executed well....from the noodles, the broths, spices....just the execution....hell the recipes. 

Could it be good? Yes. All they need to do is lower their prices 20-30% and revamp their recipes a little bit. Just my take on one visit.
