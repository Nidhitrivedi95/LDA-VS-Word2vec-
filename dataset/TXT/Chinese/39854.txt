ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ I have been here countless times. Fast food at extreme low prices. You can get steak and fries for $6 here as one example. 

I always get a HK style milk tea when I'm here.

Some must tries are the scrambled egg sandwich and the french toast. I know what you are thinking already. Its just scrambled eggs and french toast but trust me its done the right way here and without holding back any of the unhealthy ingredients. 

There are many other dishes you can try here and if you ask for an English menu they will give you like 5 different menus all with different type of combo offerings.

This place is always busy but the turnaround time is quick so even if there is a lineup you can expect to be seated within a few minutes.
