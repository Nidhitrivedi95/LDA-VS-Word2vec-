IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Every time I have attempted to visit the Noodle Shop restaurant at the Mandalay Bay something has happened which prevented me from going. (E.g., Closed due to remodeling, closed due to water main break, closed due to stars alignment with Jupiter, etc..)  Anyway, I finally had a chance eat at the Noodle Shop and we weren't disappointed.

My daughter Muff, sister Luch and I were exhausted and broke after spending the day at the Fashion Show Mall.  We barely dragged ourselves back to the hotel and decided to eat before we went to our rooms. (We said that if we could make it to our rooms, we were NOT leaving.  And the previously checked out room service menu didn't strike our fancies.)
We perused the menu and here's what we ordered:
*  Shumai, 
*  Singapore-Style Fried Rice Noodles with Shrimp and Pork
*  Shrimp, Beef and Chicken with Garlic Sauce;
*  BBQ Pork with Mixed Vegetables

Only four dishes with rice and enough to feed a family of moose!  Everything was delicately flavored and wonderful.  I love garlic, but it can easily overpower any other flavor in its path.  It was present and accounted for in my Shrimp, Beef and Chicken with Garlic Sauce but not overly so.  My sister's Singapore-Style Fried Rice Noodles with Shrimp and Pork was also delicious.  And my daughter Muff's BBQ Pork with Mixed Vegetables was simple yet enchanting.  And the freshly made Shumai was delightful.
We had a scrumptious lovely meal to end our day of shopping madness.
