weZbyOaXyIySSaZzkooUzA Brian, I will be eternally grateful to you for giving me my life back. I have been suffering with excruciating shoulder pain for three months.You healed me in three sessions. I tried 3 different chiropractors, pain clinics, medical massages
, Regular doctor who just prescribed pain killers. I spent thousands of dollars on various treatments, nothing worked. Shiatsu did. You are a true Healer Brian, You are intuitive, very knowledgeable, your treatment is relaxing, soothing and most of all it works. I will tell the whole world about you:) My twins love you because you gave them their active mommy back. xoxo
