hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q Went here a couple weeks ago, and ultimately it was Adequate-Plus.  I would have ranked it a 4, but my sushi standards are freakishly high from my time traveling and living in Japan.

The fish was fresh, and the prices were reasonable.  Rolls were well made and beautifully displayed.  The Japanese say that you eat first with your eyes, then with your mouth and the chefs at Kawaii definitely mastered that.   Besides the standards, there were many creative options on the menu.  

Service was good, someone was always available to help or refill our beverages but not to the point of smothering.  

We would come back without hesitation.
