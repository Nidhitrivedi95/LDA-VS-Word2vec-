5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A I gave this restaurant one star because the delivery was actually early, it was convenient to order online, and finally the first bite of the tum yum soup was fairly good.  However, after eating the second bite it was just good and by the third bite it was ok and then by the fourth bite I wanted to throw up. 

The Red Curry Chicken was by far the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life.  It tasted like coconut milk straight with some added seasoning and the chicken thrown into a mess of a dish.  After traveling through thailand and other asian countries like Singapore (who knows how to do it right) I can sometimes be snobbish about my thai food.  Usually when I order thai food in the United States I keep in mind that it is not Thailand.  However, this restaurant is far beyond saving.  I would give it some kind of constructive criticism but the only thing that comes to mind is ... close the doors!
