nl_gkvVXtsIlhGE0sP0qFw I stopped here for lunch today planning to get take out, but when I found out they charge by the pound, I figured I might as well eat in.  I was dining solo and had some studying to do....it was busy but not too noisy and beverage service was very prompt.

I would have to agree that many of the traditional entrees are greasy.  This seems to be standard and typical with most buffets and small, divey chinese joints.  I tend to steer clear of these items as I enjoy fresher, lighter food ,and I found plenty of selection here.  Starting off with cucumber salad, seaweed salad (good if you like unusual flavors and textures), sushi, shrimp/squid entrees, grilled chicken w/ spicey chinese BBQ sauce, jasmine rice etc.   There were plenty of fried items if that's your thing which actually looked fairly appetizing and the desert selection seemed very adequate.
