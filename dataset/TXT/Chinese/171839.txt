VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Love their lunch here. It's an excellent value. You get crispy won ton's, salad, and an entree for $7-$9. It's quite a bit of food so I always take some left overs back with me. 

However, it is always really loud an crowed here. Parking can also be a nightmare in this lot. It's a small shopping center with a couple of popular stores/restaurants (well it doesn't look like there's much else but apaprtments/condos/houses in this immediate area) and minimal parking.  

And it's pointless to make reservations here for large groups here. We've had issues a couple of times. Most recently we had a business lunch here a few weeks ago and called and confirmed our party of 14 twice and when we got there on the day of our reservations they acted completely clueless. And because it was during a busy lunch time it took them awhile to get some tables together to seat us.
