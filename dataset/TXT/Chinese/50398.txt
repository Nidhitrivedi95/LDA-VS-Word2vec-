cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ My husband and I came here two dinners in a row. It's very delicious food. The staff was very friendly. The basil fried rice was very yummy. We ordered fried banana with icecream for desert. It was awesome!!! Great place. Will definitely come again next time we're in Vegas :).
