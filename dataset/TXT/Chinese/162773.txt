uO-jz7dBD1pzu17V_RIVLw Food with very good. I ordered my meal and it came within a reasonable amount of time food was hot and very fresh.  If you come during lunch hour or  dinner hour there might be a line to get your food but that tells you that the restaurant is good.  If you order takeout call your order in and show up in 20 minutes it is always ready I don't understand these people walk in order takeout and then sit there waiting.  I usually order my food with no garlic and it always is cooked to order and taste good.
