y0YM6nQcrBKwg59bv1YzBw After screwing up 2 different home cooked dinners, my gf and I decided we'd run here for take-out soup. 

Pros
- The staff was friendly
- The place looked clean
- The portions are very generous
- The food is well packed and secure

Cons
- My BBQ duck tasted like nothing
- My gf barely got any veggies in her veggie soup. She basically had a big bowl of broth with some cabbage and udon noodles

I heard good things about their general tao chicken, so I'll gladly give them another shot. However, when it comes to satisfying a soup craving, I'll be looking elsewhere.
