TgshgSQtZV-RTZlQ0ztmBw We have eaten here a few times and each time we were disappointed the wait staff is hit or miss. The food on the bar is OK the sushi is will not eat any of the raw fish be a use it is not kept to the right temperature  the rice in the crab olls California rolls and others is dried out the sushi it's self gets dry from sitting out because no one eats it. (it is suppose to be chilled not room temp) all around not great and a lot of the food is not made fresh it's reheated or thawed. Deffiently won't be back anymore if you want a decent buffet but like sushi try the new Passion grill.
