ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg I went to Jasmine ten years ago and thought it was the most amazing restaurant...Unfortunately it has gone down in quality and service to the level of complete embarrassment!!!  The food quality is equal that of a panda express you would find in a local mall.   The service is equally horrible!  The only thing that makes up for both is the incredibly amazing view of the Bellagio fountains.

Incredibly sad to see a restaurant completely go down in such a way. I will NEVER go there again.
