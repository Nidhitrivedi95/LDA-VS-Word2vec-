EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q This restaurant s just so very good. It's kind of pricy, but in my opinion it is well worth it. As I have complained in the past, Arizona has very little to offer in the way of Chinese food. I have traveled far and wide and have had very good Chinese food. I became spoiled, after experiencing what other states have to offer. I used to really like certain places here in the valley, but after leaving the state, I found out what I was missing out on. This place is the closest I've come to decent Chinese food. The staff is really friendly and boy do hey work fast. Now only if their prices were a little lower and they delivered to Surprise, we'd be in business. Keep up the good work Wok Wei (translation: Walk Way) lol
