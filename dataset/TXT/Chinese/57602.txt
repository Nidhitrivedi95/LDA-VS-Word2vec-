D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA Service was bad & slow but food came fast. I loved the dumpling lady! She was great & recommend good choices! I'd would have preferred to just eat dumplings the whole time. Lol. But for reals this review is mixed. My husband liked the food but I didn't, I guess I prefer more sweet food. Also I didn't like how our server recommend the noodles with chicken but we ordered the noodles with BBQ pork & when the food arrived it was with chicken.
