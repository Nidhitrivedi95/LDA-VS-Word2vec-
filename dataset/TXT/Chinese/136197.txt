Qe8vFq-3HMld-ymBQLDnpg Overpriced!  $3.50 for a small egg roll - this will give you a sense of how expensive everything is. I have been eating here for a few years now and I think they increased their price and the quality has come down. Poor value. Last time I eat here. Very disappointing. I feel like I have been ripped off.
