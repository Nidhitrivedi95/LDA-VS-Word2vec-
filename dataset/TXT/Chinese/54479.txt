csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA Buyer beware: looks like the place is under new management. New decor. New staff. New menus. Service was so slow that we were able to look up reviews on Yelp while we waited, saw the dismal change in food quality, and left before anyone even visited our table. I'm so disappointed to know that my faithful Asian fusion spot near the house is no more, but I'm hopeful that one of the 7 (I think?) competitors within 2 miles can win me over.
