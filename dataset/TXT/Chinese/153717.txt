TbjAR4JMgBuPXiMUKsO9RQ The place is bigger than how i thought it was going to be. Mongolian Grill is basically a buffet that has 2 sides for you to eat from. 1 side you can cook your own bowl of food. Choices from beef, lamb, pork, artificial crab meat, squid, udon, egg noodles to a lot of other noodles. Also, there were a bunch of sauces for you to choose from. You can either use the ones that are combined by the chefs or you make your own! 

The second side has precooked food. Salad, Sweet and SOur pork, garlic bread, cocktail shrimp etc. Also there is a dessert table behind there. There is chocolate fondue, shaved ice, jello, cookies, and fruit. Oh yea, you can choose from a menu they give you on your table. They have many dishes there. Those dishes are cooked inside the kitchen. 

Overall, good restaurant with good service. Just one recommendation, don't eat the chocolate fondue because I saw children using their hands to put the marshmallow into the fondue. There are sticks available but they didn't use it.
