xahtvkGLbwU___3GMqmWUw My husband and I first started eating from this location about 5 years ago. At that point, we both would have given them 5 stars. This place was amazing!! Over the last 2 years, they have taken a deep dive in their quality. Orders are routinely wrong and when we call to ask for a remake, the lady on the phone argues with us. If the person writing the order down wrote it incorrectly, it somehow is our fault. They refuse to remake an order the correct way without us paying for it again. The one time the order was so wrong (allergy issues wrong) and I was asked to dig the plate out of the garbage and bring it to them. The chicken is often undercooked, the shrimp overcooked, and the wonton watery.
