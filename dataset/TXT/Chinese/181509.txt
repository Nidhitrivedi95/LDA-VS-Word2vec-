xdphjWZymq-3dqOWmA_wwA We had the cold noodles in peanut sauce, which comes with sliced cucumber and bean sprouts.  It was yummy but not as thick peanut buttery as I'd prefer.  Still, definitely good, especially with the chili oil mixed in.

We also had the Henry's hand shaved noodles as part of a bowl of soup that included baby bok choy.  The noodles were fantastic!  Thick, meaty, and delicious.  The soup was good if maybe a touch salty.

Finally we had the crunchy tofu.  Delicious if you're okay with soft tofu.  Crunchy on the outside from the bonito flakes and soft tofu on the inside.  The soy glaze sauce was also delicious.  One caution - the inside stays hot so have an iced drink ready just in case.

We shared a mango fruit ice.  It was okay.  The mango was a little green tasting.

The prices are very afffordable and the service was good.  It's a small space that seats maybe 20 people.

We will definitely be back.  If you're looking for some dishes that are not the usual chinese/thai/korean fare, then we can recommend Henry's.
