The prices was pretty good, you have the option of selecting either a small or large which comes with a fountain drink. 

The meats and other selections seemed very fresh and appetizing. I loved how the staff are willing to throw together a concoction of sauces and spices to add flavor to your dish!  

All in all this was a fun experience and the food was very delicous! I would recommened this place.
