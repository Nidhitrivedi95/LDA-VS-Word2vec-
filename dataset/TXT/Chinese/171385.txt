vYbpodi9utup_njMK5PAfw The braised beef shank noodle soup tasted like how I remember the cha chaan tang restaurants in Hong Kong. The noodles are hand pulled and they taste like it. The braised beef shank is tender and falls apart in your mouth. The soup broth tastes like the meat so it goes together great.

I also got scallion pancakes, which had too few scallions in it. It was mostly dough and it suffered for it. They also topped it with what tasted like balsamic vinegar, which was an interesting combination that worked well to offset the fried oily feel.
