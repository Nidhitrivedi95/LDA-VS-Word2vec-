aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg Had the roasted duck, bbq roasted pork with crispy skin, bbq pork, Chinese broccoli, wonton rice noodle soup.  All were good.  The duck was tasty.  Both pork dishes have the right amount of fat (not too much but just a little to keep it juicy).  The pork dish with the crispy skin was very good and better than most places.  The dipping sauce was very tasty.  

Much better than the Sam Woo in Las Vegas.  Prices were good.  Service was good - I did order in Chinese so may be that helped a little?  

Seating was a little messy and they don't really have a system.  People showing up during lunch time and for a second, no one really know who was there first.  The waitress did try to sort it out.  We had to wait about 15 min on a Thur afternoon (shortly after 12 pm or so). 

Given the food and knowing how Chinese restaurants are, I am still a fan.

By the way - cash only.
