R7-3MCD6_RL_VxN65yCh2Q This mom and pop shop is a true little gem! Everyone knows that  I'm a sucker for a lunch special and this place will certainly be a part of my lunch time rotation. Lunch specials are from $5-$10 and include soup, egg roll, wonton and your entrée. The service is fast and friendly. Most people seemed to take their food to-go. I ate in, it was a little quiet with only a small amount of ambient noise from a TV. The interior was very quaint but clean. I absolutely love a place that is generous on shrimp portions, I'm sold!
