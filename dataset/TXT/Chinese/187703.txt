yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Before a concert my boyfriend brought me here as a first pho time eater. It's located in the heart of Chinatown on spring mountain. Parking was a pain but we managed to get one (not like there's a lot of space in Chinatown). Walked in and the place was pretty busy, about a 10 minute wait, not so bad.

Once we were seated the waiter took our order. We got the flank and brisket pho with an order of combination fried rice. Since I had never eaten pho before my boyfriend made my bowl for me. It came with a plate covered with greens to brighten up the dark brothed soup. I did add everything to it and also added a few dashes of chili sauce to have a kick. My goodness, this soup was uh mazing. The broth was hot but not lava and they are not stingy with meat. The bowl is big enough for my boyfriend and I to share and so was the rice. The rice was nice also, had plenty of chicken and shrimp the order is huge. 

The check with both the rice and soup (drinks also) was under $25 how can you go wrong. Left stuffed but satisfied. Been here a few times more because no other pho joint has been this good. The only reason I took off one star is because the service is very slow and sometimes you have to call for someone to seat you or take your order. I understand you're busy but they need to become more organized.
