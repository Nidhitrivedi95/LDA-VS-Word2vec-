iyPtSR0s6EkvaQFbdJ_jVA Dim sum is dim sum. Tapas is not dim sum. Well, maybe dim sum is a form of tapas, but I definitely think you can't advertise it that way! 

I went here for a Sunday lunch with a small group. One of our group was gluten free, which was a huge oversight on our part. Not a lot of the items are GF, and the severs didn't know which ones were. Lots of breading = lots of gluten! 

The service here was certainly slow, but friendly - this was especially annoying because we were basically the only table. 

I found the prices to be high, which fits the area but with so many other dim sum joints just up Spadina, I can't imagine myself heading here any time soon. If you're going to spend that kind of money on lunch, cross the street and check out Canteen!
