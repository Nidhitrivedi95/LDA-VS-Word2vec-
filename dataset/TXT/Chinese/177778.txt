WzrMNz9eUF78RgZGDTS8xg Food is good but I feel they skimp on the servings more now than ever before. Granted I ordered the "lunch size" but for $7.00 I expect more than a few bites of chicken on 3 cups of rice. 

Their egg rolls are absolutely delicious and if you care to be healthy the spring rolls are a great option. I always order my meat steamed instead of fried and it's delicious.
