DQMaUSbKsRtB5lJD3egqxQ I must say, after reading other reviews, I was rather disappointed.  The service was kind, but slow.  The spring rolls we had were indicative of a delicious meal to come...but frankly it just fell short.  I had lo mein with beef and wontons and it was alright, but nothing really spectacular.  It actually reminded me a lot of an inexpensive frozen meal.  My husband's noodle bowl was much the same.  Additionally, both of our meals tasted overtly of shrimp...and we both ordered beef items.  Our daughter, however, ordered pork fried rice and it was DELIGHTFUL.  

The price was low, so it is silly to get overly disappointed with the meal.  However, it is not somewhere that I would likely return if given the opportunity.
