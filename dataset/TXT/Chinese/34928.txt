aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg Excellent authentic noodle dishes, expertly prepared. BBQ duck and pork with crispy skin was also top-notch. The BBQ boneless pork wasn't quite the level of the other dishes (would have benefited wither a sweeter or longer marinade time).

The noodle dishes (beef with flat noodles, crunchy seafood yellow noodles) were tender and tasty without being greasy, serving sizes were large.

Service was friendly and fast despite being busy 

Prices were very reasonable

We will be back for sure!
