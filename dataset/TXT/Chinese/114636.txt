mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w This is my first time writing a review because I usually never write reviews but I was so disappointed with their level of service that I had to write a review.   I called in for a take out order and pick up time was at 6pm.  Now I arrived promptly but apparently they didn't start making my order yet until I got there.  I simply ordered chow fun and what was supposed to be a 15 minute wait turned into a 1 hour wait.  I basically watched 2 families walk in, eat, then leave.  Unacceptable.  There was another gentleman before me who apparently waited for "a while" before he received his take out order and he wasn't happy at all when he left.  Let this be a warning to all.
