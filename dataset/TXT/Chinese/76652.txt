gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw We had a very nice dinner.  The food was very good and the service was friendly and quick!  We sat at one of the ~eight outdoor tables on their cozy heated patio.  We ended up at this sushi restaurant because we used the nearby free electric vehicle chargers and the restaurant reviews are good.  I'm sure we will be back!
