Gx3mxDNDd4XX897CgsAYNQ I liked it.  This was more the east coast influenced that I'm used to, so they get 5 stars in my book.  Friendly staff didn't mind all of my questions and they were very attentive.  Prices were good for the amount of food provided.  Will go back again because I want to try the Pad Thai.
