taXKuFldSoerm9SXrckh_w Very good truly authentic Chinese.  I find that at good authentic Chinese restaurants, they usually don't have a problem changing typically deep-fried dishes to non-deep-fried ones and this place did not disappoint--I got non-deep-fried orange chicken and it was de-lish.  Server was extremely nice and well-mannered.  

I was in late near close and at the end of the night all the restaurant workers (all family?) sat down for a group meal themselves.  Kind of cool, but one suggestion...  I think this should be conducted after close or the server should probably not be a part of this meal because I felt like I had no one attending to my table at the end and I didn't want to interrupt the group meal.  Not a huge deal but others might get more upset.
