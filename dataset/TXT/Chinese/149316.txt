sPGbBt01zybTxV2FRdRaDQ holy moly. we drove all the way from nyc and mom wanted some sichuan food so we happened upon this place and boy were we in for a treat.

We ordered 2 noodle dishes, both were delicious and the perfect texture.

The lamb dish we ordered was a bit salty. 
Sweet and sour pork was tasty.
but the fish. this flash fried spicy fish was the highlight of my entire toronto trip. the delicate fish filets were crispy on the outside while soft and flaky on the inside with a kick of spice. 

highly recommend.
