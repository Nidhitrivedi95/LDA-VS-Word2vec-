cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg Have tried it a few times and definitely good Chinese food. Very good and just what I'd expect (my point of reference is SF Chinatown). Tried the different dumplings and as others note - they are FRESH!  You can actually watch them making these items. Unfortunately I'm not that into the steamed ones as they are too much dough for my palette. But that's my preference, nothing wrong with the food. Pot stickers are great.

I need to check out a few more menu items in order to say it's great. Some regulars had an interesting dish that caused me some entrée envy - definitely gonna give that a shot next time.

Place is not huge but I've never had a problem getting a seat. Food is at least 4 stars but service leaves a bit to be desired, so rating 3 stars. Waitstaff I've had just don't even bother to try and connect (except to the regulars I mentioned - they got a LOT of attention). And our last waiter's apron looked like he was in the back cooking! Would show up, slap our dishes down and then disappear. Didn't look like it was isolated to us as I noticed a few other tables having a similar problem getting his attention.

All-in-all it is a good place. Much better than most any other Chinese I've tried in the Chandler area. Yeah, that's not saying much, I know...
