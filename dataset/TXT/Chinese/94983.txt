jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg After dining here a few times I unfortunately must drop my rating to 3 stars. This was quickly becoming my go-to place for when my folks would come into town to visit. By no means is the best Peking duck we've ever had, but still very crisp and tasty, and without the strip pricing. The duck bone soup is delightful. Very simple and fresh. We don't really have too much to complain about with the taste of the food we have tried. I mean, some are hit or miss, but nothing has been terrible. Well...except our last server. The first few times we came here our servers were fantastic. They put great care into the preparation and cutting of the Peking Duck. This last time, the server we had very strangely refused to allow us to take his photo when he brought the duck out. Then we realized why... he just grabbed the duck and started hacking at it frantically with no care. Instead of thin, crispy slices of skin we received just a few chunks of duck that we had to separate from bone and tendon before stuffing into the buns. It was disappointing. We will likely return to try more dishes but we'll have to search for a new place for peking duck after that experience.
