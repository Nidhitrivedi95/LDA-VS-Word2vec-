X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Overhyped but still reputable (Is there such a thing?) The drinks were average but $9 for a small bottle of Fiji? No, thank you. I'll take that extra glass of ice and wait for it to melt. There are two floors (top floor for tables and a great view of the space in the back where you can't see the stage and pit.

The ground level is pretty expansive though it didn't feel like it when Afrojack and Steve Aoki played there the weekend after Christmas. You get a really good view if you stand on the center stairs leading down to the pit. Security will tell you (and nudge you forcefully) to leave but it's a great place to take that pic for the 'gram.
