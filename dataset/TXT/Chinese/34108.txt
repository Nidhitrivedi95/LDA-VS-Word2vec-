They also have A.Y.C.E sushi which I have yet to try. Outside it looks a bit meh, but the inside is very nice or appears that way whenever I pop in to pick up a to go order. The lunch specials are nice, though we usually get 2 full sized dishes which can fed 5 people. Bargain. Nice big pieces of vegetables, sauces can be a bit watery, it's obviously greasy, but there is some good flavour going on. I normally talk about specific dishes in my reviews, but everything kind of fits what has been said so far.
