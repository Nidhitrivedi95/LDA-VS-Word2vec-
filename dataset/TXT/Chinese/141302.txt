rEAFZFziiOWxSLsOLohccQ I've just finished my first take- out  at Anns Bistro.I am a total foodie and take flavor very seriously. I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan lunch special for around 11.00 including tax. Let me first tell you THE GOOD SIDE:the Staff was very friendly and prompt: food was ready in 10 minutes. My food was still warm by the time I got back to work to eat  approx 8 minutes away. My lunch included a small 4 oz cup of soup, FRIED RICE, EGG ROLL AND WANTON CHIP. I chose the Hot and Sour Soup. It was perfectly balanced with just enough vinegar(sour) and white pepper (heat)and I would compare it with some of the finest Chinese restaurants in the Valley. My stir fried vegetables and sauce were perfectly fresh and seasoned  to perfection,On the BAD SIDE...... there was a huge problem with the chicken. It was old chicken.  It was actually cooked perfect but I can taste a strong pungent after taste on my palate that I recognized as old chicken,not very pleasant in spite of the wonderful seasoning and sauces. Then the Fried Rice. One bite, DRY OLD and DRY. YUCK. Egg ROLL(2)they were ok nothing special: mini and Bite sized. SO I gave it 2 stars for the best soup and vegetable stir fry ever but Rice and Chicken ( which is pretty much a major portion of entrees) Not just bad but YUCK.
