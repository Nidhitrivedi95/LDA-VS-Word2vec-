z_XUh5ep_Fj8s95SlriNZw I found this place on here and decided to try it. It's near the gym I go to so it's very convenient for me. The place is quiet, clean and I was welcomed in a professional way. Now, I've been struggling with back pain for the last 7 years and I've had acupuncture done before so I knew it works. I've been going to this place 2 months and my pain is literally gone. Dr richman is amazing and does wonders. I recommend this place to everyone 
Price is reasonable
