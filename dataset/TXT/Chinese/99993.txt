JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA I"m so glad we rediscovered this place.  My friend and I had been all grubby painting and were driving around doing an errand on a Sunday early evening when all of a sudden i start feeling bitchy.  Which means my hunger headache was about to hit.  We were in South Scottsdale at the time so we were searching for a place to go as is (pretty grubby) and so we hightailed it to YC's.  I hadn't been here since college which was a lifetime ago.  So glad we came here.  It was really good.  You pick different various meats, veggies, noodles, sauces and they grill it all for you. I totally packed in the bowl.  The price also includes a beverage, side of rice (they have both brown and white), and desert afterwards.  What a deal!   
Just fyi....if you can't finish what you got and you have to ask for a to go container they charge like 50 cents for the container.
