dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ With all the great reviews on here I was really excited to try it. I was so disappointed. We walked in and it was if we were non existent. No hello.. No eye contact. We stood there and wondered do we seat ourselves? Finally someone seats us.. I think it took 10 minutes for a server to get to our table. He was indifferent and kind of ignored is the rest of the night.

Now the food.. Ugh. I ordered egg flower soup .. It was so thick I couldn't stomach it. Mongolian beef was okay .. Very small portion and I don't eat that much. Egg foo young looked gross on the plate. It tasted okay.. I mean it's only eggs. It just wasn't that great like I thought it would be.
