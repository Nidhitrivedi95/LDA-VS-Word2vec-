Z4CA7jEArUT_D-1ZM4Bh1Q Just not a fan of Chop and Wok.

It's been here for years and I remember the food being better when I was a kid.  If anyone thinks this is good Chinese food though, I don't know what you're smoking, but I'd love some!  The orange chicken bowl is the only thing I've had that is decent here, but its nothing to get excited over.

I think the only thing they have going for them is the 1-cent Yelp cocktail and the wide selection of beers.  But the crowd here is a little rough...you definitely don't think you're in Scottsdale, which I guess for some is a nice change.  For me though, it's not a place I want to sit and drink at.
