LsgE9TBlyvGFF2n7esSd2w Skip PF Changs. Eat here


Originally, PF changs created Pei Wei to compete in the fast food industry, however I think they did too well as Pei Wei is better in many ways than PF changs.

It taste as good, its cheaper and faster.   They have many options mostly meat/w some kind of rice or side. 

They give you free oranges slices with your drink, as many as you want!!!!

It pretty clean and never crowded.  Its a solid place for lunch or to-go
