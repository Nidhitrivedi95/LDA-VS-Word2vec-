7WHAdFHiHLmNJN72M_AKYQ This place spoiled our dinning experience in Vegas. It was so hot in Vegas and happened to stop by here and it should be a warning sign when all the staff including the cook from the restaurant coming out to talk us in. We ordered a scallion pancake, stir fried noodle, mix mushroom with seafood and a soup cook vegetable. The seafood pancake is ok but only a little of scallion. The noodle and vegetables were so salty that were unbearable to eat!! We actually used water to wash it down!!!!! The sauce is so thick that is look like jello. I wish yelp could allow me to give a zero star to this place. This place also charge us $2.95 for water. I had never write so badly about a restaurant. I wish I had gone to panda express instead of this junk.
