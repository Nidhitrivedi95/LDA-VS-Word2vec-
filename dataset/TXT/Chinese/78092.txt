GibwaDiqJJ_62x0h3oCyxA Could use improvement. Online, Panda Express states they now offer a tea bar, yet this location doesn't offer it. It's a Chinese food establishment (all be it, American Chinese) and they do not offer chopsticks. Noodles offers chopsticks for their few Asian dishes yet Panda Express doesn't? Really? We used a $10 gift card we received from Panda Express for screwing up our order over a year ago (can you tell we don't go here often?). Good food, but service and provisions offered could be better. Keep going hoping they've improved... *sigh* I guess we'll try again next year.
