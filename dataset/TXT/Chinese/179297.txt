X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I am by no means a club expert but I am a little confused as to the terrible reviews of this place. My friends and I had a really great experience at Hakkasan and I would go back. We went to see Calvin Harris and it was a truly amazing show. We had a table in the Ling Ling Lounge before the show and we enjoyed having a table to go to throughout the night that was a little bit away from the action. Our server was great and kept the drinks  flowing all night. When it was time to go to the main area to see Calvin, it was complete chaos, as expected. Yes, people were obnoxious and pushing, shoving, etc, but when are people not like that at these things? I had a blast though and would definitely go back and see him again. 

One word of advice, plan your visit to Hakkasan carefully. Make a contact with someone from the club when you book a table and make sure you have all the details prior, that way you know exactly where you need to be when and it will cut down on your wait time getting into the club. Our group was one of the first groups to be let in as we got a tip from our guy to get there around 10:00pm and it was a great piece of advice. People were waiting about an hour to get into the club, we had to wait about 10 minutes. If you do have to wait, you'll be very entertained with the people watching though.
