dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ One of the best Thai restaurants I've ever been to.  Every time we're in town, we make sure to eat here at least once.  We've even ordered to go on our ride back to Cali a couple of times.
This is what we usually order and have never been disappointed:

Papaya salad w/ salted crab - THE BEST
Tom Yum Goong
Pad Se Ew seafood
Beef noodle soup
House fried rice

Can't wait to go back in April!
