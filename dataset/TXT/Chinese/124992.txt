My waiter got our order wrong a few times and forced us to have the order from another table because she gave them ours by mistake. The selection was minimal, not as good as the Britannia location, very steep collection of food like usually stuff you would find at any AYCE sushi. The food quality is that the Chinese food and Korean food was too oily; the tempura was fried to death with a burnt brown tinge-tasted like old oil, octopus that was grilled was chewy, the sashimi tasted a bit off- it was also lukewarm, and don't get me started on the rock hard skewers that were very dry. I wonder if I tried their regular menu would it be better. Almost 32.00 with tip doesn't seem good for mediocre food.
