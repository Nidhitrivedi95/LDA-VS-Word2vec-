H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag This place has the worst chinese food I've ever eaten. I have been to quite a few chinese restaurants and have chinese friends who often let me sample their food. This food does not even begin to compare. The flavors were all over the place. Its a nice place with nice service but when it comes down to it I think the food plays a big part in the review of a restuarant.
