XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA Authentic Lanzhou beef noodle. Only flaw was the noodle was too thick for the type I ordered, btw, I am a Lanzhou born native so I know what my noodle should look like. Soup base was really nice, radish can use bit of longer cooking time. I had a small, xi noodle, extra spicy came to less than 10 before tip. Servers are friendly, they were busy running around most of the time but still remember to bring me water, woohoo! I would recommend go at 11 or after 12:30, otherwise you might be stuck for 30 min in the lineup.
