kpxUsRQ7i65ipQ4wLeZKeQ When I go to a restaurant, I have different expectations depending on each place. For this spot, I expected a cheap price, good food and my tummy being filled at the end. And this place managed to achieved all above standards.

If you go there at noon, you can expect to eat a pretty nice variety of chinese food. They got chatsu, general tao, fried shrimps, even sushi and many more. Obviously, the food is not top notch then again I didn't go there for a royal diner. I went there a few times now and every time I was happy with the food, price and my tummy is definitly happy.
