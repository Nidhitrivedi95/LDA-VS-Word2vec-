PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg When Gary owned this restaurant, the food was delicious. But unfortunately, it just isn't good at all anymore, and I'm not picky about food! I've tried several dishes and they were bland, with hardly any meat and/or too salty. The lemon chicken was prepared like sweet and sour chicken, with very small pieces inside the fried batter. They didn't even know what Chow Mein was, and gave us Lo Mein instead, which had short noodles and not much seasoning. The hot and spicy cabbage salad had pieces of chicken in it (which it didn't before) and it was salty and covered with soy sauce. You'd be better off driving a few miles to the Qwik Chinese Bistro and get excellent food with Gary.
