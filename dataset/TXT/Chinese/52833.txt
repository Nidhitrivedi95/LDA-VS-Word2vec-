ckLk2nQiTGeVgg62JxZGZg I shall begin with the basics. 
Plenty of parking, lots of seating and super fast service. A bit off on customer service but do they really care.  Lol.  I have been here for Dim Sum and regular eats. They have two Dim Sum happy hours everyday. Great deal for tasty Dims. 
 
The Poods. 
I found everything really delicious at GF.  This restaurant is more pricier than others for regular eats but I don't mind.  Yum is all that concerns me here. 
Stay real Yelpers.
