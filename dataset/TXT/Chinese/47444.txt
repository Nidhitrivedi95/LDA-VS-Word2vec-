bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ This is my second time eating here.... I ordered 2 lunch specials: General Tso Chicken and Shrimp With Garlic Sauce, fried rice, wanton soup....also, an order of fried shrimp dumplings. All the food was average, to slightly above average. So I am going to stick with my original rating of 3 to 3 1/2 stars.
