The food that was supposed to be served hot arrived at our table cold (very cold).

Our table was dirty and from my seat looking at the kitchen, it didn't appear too tidy either.

The service here was so poor that we simply left the restaurant and paid for only the drinks we had ordered.

Wanna be ignored? 
Looking for an absent waiter and arrogant host? 
Looking for a less than clean dining enviroment?  

Then look no further.

They might have 'great deals' on food..... if you consider awful service, nasty dining conditions and food that would be below par even in a federal prison a great deal.
