Qme4ZWzZEdZUwnpo-sPPIw The portion sizes were pretty good, presentation of food was good too. However the flavour was lacking so much. The restaurant is so dark... they have lights but none of them are on all the lighting is coming from the big window outside. The floor and table legs are covered in really gross stuff. Along with the windowsill. There's food and sauce stuck there. Lost my appetite right away. They were also taking care of their baby while making food. It's a family business so it's understandable but it doesn't seem safe for them to be in the kitchen.
