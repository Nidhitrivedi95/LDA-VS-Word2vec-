G7Ull-QUaNXyPwtEErHZ8g Their vegetable fried rice was not my favorite at all! Thought I would be getting something like Panda Express but I got huge chunks of vegetables in my rice...so I did not like it. Also didn't care for their vegetable egg rolls...wish it was actually egg roll wraps and not spring roll wraps....Gave 2 star since i did like their egg drop soup
