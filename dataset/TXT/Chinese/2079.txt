-YWr1wm_NaAlgEf9TZzsMQ 911 NEED TO REACH OWNER--------------

Horrible experience. I'm from out of town so I called to see closing time. Manager Erika said 9pm they close door but failed to mention they also stop serving at 9pm. Got there about 845pm and they were taking forever to bring food out. When they did it was loud and messy. My 5yr old niece slipped because floor was moped but no caution sign was up. Erika did not apologize to my niece. Her assistant manager laughed at me and then raised his hands up. I could've engaged physically w him but rather I wanted to speak to the owner. I asked what his name was "BEN". It seems Erika gave me BENS name as owner and cell phone so they're just giving me the run around. 
*IF ANYONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT HOW I CAN REACH OWNER PLEASE LET ME KNOW* 
I've already filed complaint w health services on their poor food preparation.
