uKZavQ6X-uoj49QeraMzaA I'm having mixed feelings about this place. Everything was nice until I had their noodle soup.

Let's start with what's good. The scallion pancake is crispy, thin, and satisfying. For 50 cents, they add an egg on the pancake. The drinks are colourful, but I've never had any.

The chinese hamburger isn't as good as people described it here, but maybe it's because I had the spicy version (whatever hot sauce they used, it wasn't good). It's essentially a braised pork sandwich. The meat has a similar texture to pulled pork, but the taste is chinese. They also add a bit of coriander, but it wasn't enough.

Anyway, the braised beef noodle soup is the reason I'm only giving 3 stars. The broth was bland, the flavours were hard to identify and it was even lacking in salt. The udon noodles were obviously store bought and of cheap quality. The braised beef was the only tasty element, but everything else diluted its goodness. 

My friend had a fried chicken filet noodle soup (same broth). I didn't look closely but it seems like it was a frozen chicken burger patty, my god.

From what I understand, people call in to order cold noodle dishes and pan fried dumplings, so I might try that next time.
