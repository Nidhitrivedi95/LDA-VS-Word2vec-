sQFpfRs1Flcw3evCdI2wpA I always come here when I'm downtown near the eaton centre. Love their chicken on rice ! 

Their grilled chicken on rice is the most underrated dish in this restaurant, pairing it with fish sauce is extremely tasty, best chicken in Toronto. The pho here does not have the strongest flavour, but it is still pretty good. If you're a big eater, then you should get the super bowl (+$2) 

The golden soft shell crab is a must try. It's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is one of my favourite places for soft shell crab. 

The tom yum soup here is not that great. It's really really sour. All I can taste is sourness. It overpowers the tom yum taste.
