8xPmlVJy2o6x0J04CBpEMQ This shop is located on the second floor of Langham square and is owned by the nicest and cutest couple ever!! I have always passed this place when I get my nails done, but have never really gotten the chance to order anything off their menu due to time constraints. I'm glad to say today I finally tried their egg waffles. They have a very extensive menu for egg waffles and other desserts, like thai ice cream rolls. I ordered the coconut and HK milk tea. I really enjoyed the crispiness and the flavour of the coconut. The HK was a bit underwhelming for me, as I'm used to a more rich taste. I will be coming back, with extra company to try even more items on their menu
