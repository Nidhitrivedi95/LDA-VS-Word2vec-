VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA I decided to visit Dumpling Haus yesterday after discovering that they served BBQ bao, an item I've been craving since a first had one in San Francisco years ago. 

My dining companions and I decided to try the BBQ buns, shrimp and haus dumplings and the Nutella buns for dessert. Everything was quite tasty, but I would have liked a bit more filling inside the buns, as the dough was a bit overpowering. 

The star of the meal for everyone at the table was the shrimp dumpling. The bite-size pockets of goodness were amazing and so full of flavor! Definitely a must try. 

Overall, the food was tasty at Dumpling Haus. Although the pork buns weren't as great as the one I had in SF's Chinatown, the dumplings were enough to ensure that I will be back again.
