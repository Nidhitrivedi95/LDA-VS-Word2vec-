01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ The food is good here.   Not quite traditional Chinese but a pretty good facsimile.  The fried chicken was a bit bland and a bit dry.  For some odd reason they paired it with a sweet and sour sauce that was sickeningly sweet.  The chow fun beef noodles were fantastic as was the Chinese broccoli.  

I prefer the other location on Spring Mountain for many reasons. 

First, the place was packed and they were hopping.  The problem is there is no waiting area so those queued for a table mill around the people eating. 

The servers run around like madmen putting food out and work very hard.  But they make you feel rushed because they take plates as soon as they are empty.  The whole vibe is " sit down, order, eat and GTFO so we can seat the the next people".  It is an uncomfortable.  

The place is very small and the tables are super close together. You get to hear what the other tables are discussing and moving around is awkward. 

Lastly, there was a table of 6 that brought their dog.  Who brings a dog to a restaurant for a sit down meal?   The damn thing took off like 5 times and the owner had to chase it down.  Leave your dog at home FFS.  Not everyone finds dining with dogs acceptable.
