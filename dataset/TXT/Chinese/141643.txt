Here it's all about the Mu Shu and the sizzling platters.  Flamingo Palace still provides old fashion table side service where the waitress plates the black pepper beef onto the hot cast iron platter right next you so you can see the steam and hear the dish sizzle.  The mu shu is also wrapped table side.

Don't let the obscure corner location deter you.  The interior is much nicer (though a little worn) than the outside might suggest.

Extra star for the service.
