oaTbZh8B-IVFEwbzJcIOBg Great place for good Asian food in the area.  The restaurant is always clean and decorated beautifully. Service is always friendly and usually very prompt... however, they can get very busy around lunch. That said, the one time I was there and the service was very slow, they went above and beyond and offered every customer a card for a 'free sushi roll or appetizer' as an apology for the wait (and i never even complained!).  
 
I really like their Pad Thai, Lo Mein, chicken with broccoli, and chicken with cashews.
