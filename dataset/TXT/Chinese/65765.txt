ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw After being a customer of 2 years at this location I pretty much had it. The manager By the name of Ryan was very disrespectful and rude. I had gotten extra steak in my meal and was charged for it. Upon receiving the meal I see that it was less steak and just topped off with rice. I explained my case to the "manager" and he denied it and said "if I wasn't happy, I can go to the other side of phoenix and have low quality food". I didn't even receive my money back for something I didn't get and I left the store upset. I will be doing a follow up on this matter and I will never step foot into this place again.
