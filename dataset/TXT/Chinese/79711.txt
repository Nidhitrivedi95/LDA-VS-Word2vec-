GkY6UWWn0Fz2ehcuBp66pg Wow! What an amazing restaurant. I've been a vegetarian for most of my life and finding good, vegetarian options can be very difficult. The fact that this restuarant is completely vegetarian was a pleasant surprise.

I contacted the resaurant before my visit to Toronto, as I really wanted to find a vegetarian version of sesame chicken (which is not an easy task). I immediately received not only a response, but a picture of their sesame 'chicken'. When I finally made it to the restaurant I was pleasantly greeted. My mom and I shared the 'chicken' satay, which was delicious. Our server also verified any food alergies, which was nice as someone with a peanut allergy.

The sesame 'chicken' was so good, that I broke my number one rule of traveling, and returned a second time. In addition to the sesame 'chicken' I worked with the same server from the day before to create a personalized udon noodle dish. It, too, was delicious.

What really sold me on this restaurant was the fact that the server remembered our conversation from the first day (going to the zoo to visit the panda cubs) and truly made me feel welcomed in the restaurant. The menu is diverse and the service very attentive.
