DwmAsemahJywywhuqv5J1Q This is what my hometown flavor is! Very Authentic. I ordered the hot and sour yam noodles and spicy pork intestines. Both of them are pretty good and I'm so full after eating! In my opinion, this restaurant's food is in high quality and suitable price, but the vegetables is a little expensive, for example,the potatoes' price is as high as 9.99.
