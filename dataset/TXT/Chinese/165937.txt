vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw Food Express is my go to Chinese restaurant when I'm in Las Vegas.  A lot of regulars come here instead of the busy Spring Mountain hub bub, as do I, because the people here truly appreciate the business when you walk inside their doors unlike some others in the Chinatown area.  The people here are really nice, and despite not having been there awhile, they know when you been there before.  It's nice to be recognized as a regular!

Now, don't let the name fool you.  This is no Panda Express.  This is a real Chinese restaurant that just so happens to make your food fast.  Hence the name, Food Express Chinese Restaurant.

Although I've tried a lot of dishes here, the one dish that makes me keep coming back for more is the EGGPLANT W/ GARLIC SAUCE (clay pot).  You cant pass it up, trust me!  I would also recommend the Chicken & Corn Flour Soup and Roast Duck.  I can't ever see myself going to Food Express and not order at least one of those items.  Good people and good food.  What more do you need?
