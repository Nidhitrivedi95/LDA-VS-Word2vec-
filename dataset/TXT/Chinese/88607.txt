i_O7Xfu1OWRzjgvXgiy0jg Had the chicken tikka masala and the shahi paneer. Both dishes were very good but one of the dishes has some sort of stringy plastic in it. The plain naan was a little dry and burnt but still tasted good. The garlic naan was perfect. The water jug tasted like warm melted ice. The owner was nice enough to not charge us for the one dish. The staff and owner were all very nice. I would come back if in the area but wouldn't go out of my way. PS. The hot and sour was really good too!
