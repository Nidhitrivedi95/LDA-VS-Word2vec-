_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w I came here with my family on a weekday afternoon. There were already several tables seated already to my surprise. The restaurant was kind of dark and old looking, despite the drab decor,  knowing from people who had been here before, I knew I was going to be in for a treat. 

The server was very attentive and helpful in advising us what size lobster to choose. I suspect he was the owner or owner's son. We ended up getting a 7 lb lobster and a side of fried vermicelli and green veggies. 

The 7 lb lobster was way more than enough for 4 people. We had to pack half of it to go home. The lobster was very tasty and succulent. The meat was very tender and overall it was a joy to eat the lobster, although I am not a seafood fan normally. Because of all the seasoning and garlic they had added to the lobster, it was fragrant and added a nice crunch to the fried rice that they had spread over the base of all the towering lobster pieces. Truly decadent and worth the experience. I would absolutely come back again if I ever wanted to have an indulgent seafood feast.
