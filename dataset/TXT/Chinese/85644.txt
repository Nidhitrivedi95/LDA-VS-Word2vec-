hMgIF04rrJ7oB1lGIpFt5w Another Chinese restaurant in town with a BIG menu (opened like yesterday). This place was previously the Boneyard Bar & BBQ and you can tell that because there is a bar area in the middle. They have fresh lobster and tilapia in the tank so thats a good thing. They are newly open so the menu is still kinda unofficial and it can sure use some remodeling and decoration to make it more like a Chinese restaurant but overall its not a bad place to dine.
Based on their menu, they can cook some big dishes like dongpo pork hock but we tried something basic. Food is nicely cooked and relatively authentic (they have american chinese food too). Price is medium ($$).
4 stars for the food
2.5 stars for the environment but things may turn better with running
