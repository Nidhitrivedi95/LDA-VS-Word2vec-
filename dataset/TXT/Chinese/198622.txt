ZZF5iqlKFBWJSGSZzWHMzA Lucky Red is the creation from the same owners of Bahn Mi Boys. Being an avid fan of Bahn Mi choice, I had to try Lucky Red out. It was also widely hyped by friends of mine, as to being a unique location with great fusion flavours. Sadly, I was unimpressed.

Lucky reds is situated in the center of China town, oddly standing out as a gastropub alongside traditional Asian restaurants. Once you enter, the design of the place clearly reminds you of Bahn Mi Boy's layout, and gives a trendy feel to the establishment. Service was pleasant and quick, and the waitresses were charming and helpful. But let's talk about the food.

Perhaps it was my misconception that the food will be bold in flavour, or the inevitable high expectations of a fusion typed restaurant, the food simply did not stand out. We ordered a sizeable selection of shareables and starters. These include the thai sausage bao, the pork belly bao, the fried chicken, the Korean fried wonton, and Japanese eggplant. Every dish was unique in it's own, with some twist that breaks it off from traditional flavors. But unfortunately it just did not deliver the depth of flavour I was hoping for. The thai bao sausage was dry, the Japanese eggplant was lacking in flavour, and the fried wontons were not filled completely. The most strange combination was the fried chicken with sugar sprinkled on top. Not sure what they were going for with that. The one saving grace was the pork belly bao, which stuck to Momofuku's traditional flavours, which was quite delicious and fresh.

Throughout the entire meal, it felt like Lucky Red is trying to break the barrier of the traditional flavours, by adding or removing a flavour profile from each of the dishes. While that may be considered "asian fusion", the end product was lacking and uninspirational. Take this one with a grain of salt...or sugar...
