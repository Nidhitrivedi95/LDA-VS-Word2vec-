GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Nothing special about this place. Over-priced and a very weird menu. As much as I want to like Chinese-Mexican food, the menu was uninspired and the execution was bland. It's like they just put together a menu with some Mexican items and some Chinese items randomly mixed into the menu. There's very little in the way of creative fusion dishes.

I hate this place!!! j/k that's strong but I think this place is for tourists.
