8LUKD_9rkJoUIIuT9uiDbA So I'm updating my review to say that rice inn is still my favorite place for sushi and Asian cuisine! I've had the chance to try the pad Thai, love! And so many different types of sushi. The rice inn roll, mango roll, and eel roll are 3 of my favorites. Also pictured below! The service is always so friendly, and the prices aren't bad, especially for lunch. I'll be sad when I move out of this neighborhood and no longer have sushi less than a mile from me! Can't wait for my next trip or call in order to rice inn!
