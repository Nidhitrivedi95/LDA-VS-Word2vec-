dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ After driving around in search of a Chinese restaurant, we decided on this place. This place is hood!! It's extra ghetto inside with the worst service ever. I really can't complain though when the dishes are soo cheap. The food just wasn't good. In fact, I would say it's pretty disgusting. I ordered a broccoli and chicken dish, and the chicken wasn't fresh at all. I was actually scared to eat the meat!! Everything inside was sticky, dusty and dirty. They definitely need a makeover with the decor, food and service.
