I'm willing to actually say Ding Tai Fung's sister branch is better than Ding Tai Fung themselves.

Xiao Long Bao opened a year or so back, and is a completely open-concept/modernized Ding Tai Fung. The restaurant is also much bigger, so waiting time during peak hours isn't as bad as DTF, where if you don't reserve during peak hours you're likely waiting north of an hour.

I arrived on a Sunday night at 8pm, and the place was 3/4 full, which was about what I expected. The menu is the exact same as Ding Tai Fung, so if you're used to the menu over there it shouldn't take long to determine what you want to order. I had the chicken marinated with wine, steamed soup dumplings with dried scallop, shrimp, and chinese okra (new thing on the menu), steamed soup dumplings with pork, steamed silver roll, minced beef pie, and the sesame paste souffle balls.

I highly recommend you try the new okra soup dumplings, as I believe that one is much better than the regular pork soup dumplings, as you can really feel the dried scallop taste. The chicken marinated with wine is an excellent dish to start as it's served cold and you get that nice alcohol taste. The steamed silver roll (steamed, not deep fried!) is an excellent alternative to white rice, and I definitely suggest ordering the rolls over bowls of white rice. The minced beef pie was extremely juicy, so if you're not a soup dumplings fan but want something juicy, go with the beef pie. The souffle balls, unfortunately, were the worst part of our order, as the sesame paste wasn't runny at all after it cools down; A La Kitchen unfortunately does a better job here.

Service was excellent, much better than Ding Tai Fung I find. Personally I'd save Ding Tai Fung for the tourists who may not know about its sister branch, cause I definitely found this place to be more enjoyable.
