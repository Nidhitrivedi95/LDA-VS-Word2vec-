9SHoWGXsGOCa5hOjBOzPtg Made an order for delivery through GrubHub while I was at work. I left explicit instructions in the order to send me a text message when they were here so I could come to security to pick up the food. 20 minutes after the food was supposed to have been delivered, I chatted into GrubHub support who, after 15 minutes of trying to call them because they didn't answer the phone, said they dropped it off and tried to call. Because I'm at work, my phone is off, and I've got email alerts set for my text messages, which is why I clearly said send me a text message. 

So I finally go to security to be greeted with a dripping bag of food. The cheap and flimsy styrofoam containers they used had completely fallen apart, probably because they took hot as food and put it in styrofoam, which then melted. So, not only can they not follow simple instructions, they also use shoddy delivery materials that resulted in me not even being able to eat. 

If I could rate lower than a 1 star I most certainly would. This place is an absolute joke.
