pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I was excited to try this place and they did not disappoint. Everything was fresh and perfect. I treated my husband for his birthday dinner and expected it to be pricy but I didn't mind because it was worth it. From the service to the ambience and of course the food. Try the ceviche/sashimi sampler!
