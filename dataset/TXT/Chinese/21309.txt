68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw I had read about their pork floss in glutinous rice roll and had glimpsed their austere interiors on a couple of sites (this included). Service was slow on a mid-afternoon with only a few other tables occupied.

The much anticipated pork floss with fried donut and glutinous rice roll arrived and was met with some dissapointment upon inspection. The rice roll was not at all glutinous, rather was sticky and packed tight against the rest of the dish, which ended up falling apart anyway on your plate.

The two other dimsum dishes were acceptable but forgettable. I'm not sure I'd return to try any of their dishes.

Extra points however for having possibly some of the cleanest and most well-designed washrooms in Chinatown.
