ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Been here a dozen times. Always make me feel at home with a handshake greeting and some small talk. The Ramen with all of the a la carte options is awesome, no, amazing, no, perfect. I load it up and yes it can get a little pricey, but you know what...it is probably one of my favorite meals right now in all of the Valley. Pork belly, duck, tofu, love it.   And for those of you carb conscience, get it with bamboo and without the noodles and you will not miss a thing.
