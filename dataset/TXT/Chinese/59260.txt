DitL2M_iiHq0DcuA1vNMAQ Friendly employees, fast service, and a spacious store make this location stand out among the Panda Express locations I have been to around town. An employee is constantly cleaning the dining area as well so everything is always clean. The food is fresh and consistent with other Panda Express stores, and the warming trays are usually fairly full. I have never seen any trays run out because they usually yell back to the kitchen if something is starting to run low. This location gets busy, but there is never too long a line when I'm here, even during lunch rush.
