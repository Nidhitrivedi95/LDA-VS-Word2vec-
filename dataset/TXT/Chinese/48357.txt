My mom stumbled upon this little gem last week when she was getting her nails done. She brought home an order of Orange chicken, Pad Thai and a Chicken teriyaki bowl. I didn't try it until the following day for lunch, when I went home, I had to ask her where she got the food from because I was quite impressed with the taste. Since then I had the place bookmarked to try.

Yesterday after church, since we were in the neighborhood and since I've been craving their food we decided to order dinner here. At around 5:30 the place was empty, as soon as we walked in we were greeted warmly by this older Asian lady, very sweet and timid. The place is tiny but very clean, no clutter seen anywhere and they have an A grade to boot, for those of you that are dubious lol. 

We got the Basil String bean stir fry with Chicken ($8.75), Orange Chicken ($8.50), Pad Thai chicken and shrimp combo ($9.45) and a cup of egg drop soup ($1.75) comes with 2 large carton of rice. All that deliciousness set us back $30.75 very affordable given the quality and huge portions they give you. Everything tasted so good and fresh, they don't add MSG on their food so that definitely is a big plus. Nothing oily and didn't give me a sluggish feeling after I ate. Their Orange chicken doesn't taste artificial and with just the right amount of sweetness unlike the one I just had the day before yuck! Pad Thai was very flavorful with an abundance of everything. I noticed they don't skimp on ingredients here thus the very tasty offerings. They also offer great value on their lunch specials, everyday from 11-3 most items priced at $5.95 and some $6.25 and comes with rice, egg roll or soup.

I now have my go to place for Chinese/Thai cravings. YAY!
