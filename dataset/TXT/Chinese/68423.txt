eS8OuIk6_fMNNslFnj8noA We usually order carry out for a quick good meal!  But last night the food was awful not only was it wasted calories and money, it tasted like a piece of paper.  The Thai noodles were the ugliest pale pink color with no species or flavor. The Shrimp fried rice had no description whatsoever, and the shrimp smelled.  So no dinner for us!  It will take a lot for us to even consider calling for take out again.
