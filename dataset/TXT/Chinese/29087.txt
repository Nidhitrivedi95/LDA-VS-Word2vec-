8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ TL;DR very very very yummy dim sum, but extremely long wait times (~1 hour).

Really really good dim sum. Definitely one of the best places around this area. The food is delicious, gets to your tables in a reasonable timeframe, and service is good too. There's a good selection of the classic dishes, all of which are quite yummy. For example, the siu mai is very juicy and tasty, though they one of the biggest I've ever seen.

Unfortunately, with great food comes great popularity. And with great popularity comes long wait times. It is insaneley packed here during lunch hours. Expect to wait at least an hour if you want to be seated here. Parking around this restaurant can also be quite troublesome, since the spots close to the restaurant is reserved parking.
