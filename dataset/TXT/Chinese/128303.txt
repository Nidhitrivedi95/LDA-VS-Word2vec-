pGjtxXBq4tZcdKdgTU-Tww Came here for lunch and it was sooo good. Their lunch buffet is only $5.95 and it's very delicious. I especially loved their General Tso's chicken and their wonton soup. Such a great deal for so many different food options. They also have dessert. They were constantly bringing out new food too which was nice.

The inside was very nice and clean. Very modern style that had an upscale feel. They are located in a plaza with many other businesses. Make sure you come hungry because you will leave feeling very full! Great spot for lunch or dinner.
