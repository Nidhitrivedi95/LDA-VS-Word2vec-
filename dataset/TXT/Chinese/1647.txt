-rx-9Ra2OHfmD1yaUS-CMg A Mecca of all asian cuisine- has Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, you name it. 

Service was great. Our waiter warned us the dumplings would take a while and that our actual mains might come out first. But our dumplings ended up coming out first anyways. We had the beef dumplings and the shrimp/beef dumplings. Both were excellent! Got a little head of myself and tried to eat it all in one mouthful- rookie dumpling mistake! Basically torched my mouth with all that heat. 

We also ordered the hot and sour soup, which was more on the sour side. Wouldn't recommend it! The highlight was definitely the crispy chow mein. We ordered the one that had the beef, shrimp, and chicken- smartest choice of the night! The Thai red curry on the other hand was pretty standard. 

Overall would come back. Gave it a 3 stars because we feel that we've had way better Asian food before.
