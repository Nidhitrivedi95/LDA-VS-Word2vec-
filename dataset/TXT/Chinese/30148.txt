97V91GSG-OQvrvOc9GXoGA I have been here a couple of times, each time with a different group of friends. Overall, I think the price was pretty reasonable. But their business doesn't seem to be that good recently compare to when it first started, maybe because of their location- it was kinda in the hallway. I would recommend their fried squid, fried fish fillet, popcorn chicken, three cup chicken ( used to be meh but recently we ordered it again and I was pretty happy with the improvement), and braised ground pork over rice. Check in on Yelp saves you $1 for over $10 spending!
