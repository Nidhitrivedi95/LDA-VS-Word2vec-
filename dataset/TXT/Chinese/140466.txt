r6WO_jkx4rkMMauvPvMDeQ i come here a lot for their family dinners, it's a great price and a lot of food, plus its good. highly recommend!

update (9:54pm) : i order the family dinner with the sweet and sour chicken, got home and they gave me the sauce but not the chicken, when i drove back they were already closed.
