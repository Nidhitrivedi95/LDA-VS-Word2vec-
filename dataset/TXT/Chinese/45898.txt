I ordered a fried rice dish that was so bland. And on top of that, the vegetables were frozen! The type that comes in a frozen bag with the corn, green beans and peas mix where the beans are perfectly cut in the same shape! I get the restaurants use frozen vegetables at times, but using the frozen vegetable mix is pretty bad. Especially with all that fancy decor and upscale ambience. I expected a lot more.
