yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Absolutely awful experience! This was my second visit with them in hopes that their customer service and food quality had improved, but instead of making the situation right and apologizing for the bad service they had a guy in a black suit claiming to be deputized "escort and 86" me and my boyfriend out of the building. He told us to get the fuck out now. And the guy in the black suit tried to take my picture without my consent and tried to make me give him my ID. Eat here at your own peril if you want to feel unsafe. I have contacted my attorney about their verbal harassment and unlawful behavior.
