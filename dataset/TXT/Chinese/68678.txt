eV-5b1Bjtnn-QePN3t3taQ The thing about Mongolian Grill is that it's basically up to you (the customer) to make good tasting food, so no complaints there -- except that the person on the grill literally poured out the different flavoring sauces that I put in my bowl without seasoning my food with it... so my food was very bland. They were also SUPER slow -- I went up for a second bowl, and I waited fifteen minutes at the window before having to leave (and wasting a whole bowl of uncooked food) because I had to get somewhere. The selection of items is pretty small and random for a Mongolian Grill -- for some reason, they had pepperoni, pizza sausage, and cubes of ham, but no seafood, and a small selection of vegetables. There's also a sneeze guard over the food items, but it's so low that you have to basically put your face on the glass to reach many of the sauces. 

Despite all of the above, the server was nice!
