VbY4yD6UmA9jKKxHscrxvg Tried Sakura tonight with my family. The decor was nice and the staff was friendly, so I had high hopes for the food. We ordered the chicken udon soup, hibachi chicken, chicken lo mein, and chicken fried rice. The portions were generous but the food was pretty flavorless. Sushi seemed to be pretty popular there (other tables were ordering strictly sushi) I should have taken that as my cue. We won't be back.
