VbY4yD6UmA9jKKxHscrxvg First of all, the food is good. However, I had the worst dining experience of my life here tonight. We purchased a Groupon worth $40 that we paid $22 for. We ordered the rolls which were 50% off. When the check came for about $75 we were told the coupon did not qualify. It was only good for the "all you can eat lunch." The coupon didn't specify lunch nor not applicable on any specials like the 50% off rolls. My position is they have $22 of my money already and they wouldn't even take that off the meal. I already paid that! I will NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN. I will tell my friends not to also and I have many friends. At the least they could have taken $22 off the bill and they wouldn't do that. POOR AS HELL CUSTOMER SERVICE. They will not stay in business with that attitude. Bye bye Sakura.
