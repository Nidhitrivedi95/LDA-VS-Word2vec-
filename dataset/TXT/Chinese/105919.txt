ky5L-EfUwU9chSPcIeXM5w I ordered the honeydew boba and it came as a very icy slushie. Like they kind you would get from a gas station. It was very sweet and syrupy too. I also got the kung pow beef which didn't taste like I expected it to. I'm not sure how to describe it but it's not something I would eat again. The flavor isn't really exciting and the texture seems mushier than the kung pao beef I've had from other places. I don't think I would eat here again. I'm pretty disappointed. :( Try it if you want and decide for yourself, but it's just not what my taste buds were looking for.
