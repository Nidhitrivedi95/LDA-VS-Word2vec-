spDZkD6cp0JUUm6ghIWHzA A traditional HK cafe-style restaurant.  The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is quite relaxing.  Lots of open space and comfortable seating.  My family and I went at around 7 PM and there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated fairly quickly.  The menu offers a variety of choices, from individual items to set meals for larger groups.  They also have lunch and dinner specials for a good price.  I was excited to see an all-day breakfast section (because come on, it's never the wrong time for sausage and eggs), but that quickly changed when I realized that there were only two items in that section.  What a tease.  

We opted to order a bunch of dishes to share, so we got a beef curry with spaghetti (that interestingly came with a side of croutons, cheese, raisins and sunflower seeds), soft-shell crab fried rice and two noodle dishes.  I was most excited for the fried rice, but it ended up being pretty bland and overall disappointing.  The curry was tasty, but I didn't have too much as my spice tolerance is basically non-existent.  The other noodle dishes were good, but nothing amazing.  We ended off the meal with a dessert of green bean soup, which was quite tasty.

The service itself wasn't the greatest.  The restaurant wasn't packed by any means, but the waitresses didn't seem very attentive to our needs.  We had to wait a while for anyone to come and clear some of the finished plates off our of table.  Same goes for refilling our tea.  

Overall, nothing too special.
