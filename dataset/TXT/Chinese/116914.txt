NbaP_lZTns_GbTSkQz_KIw Been here lots of times for that traditional Sunday family brunch. Quality is a solid 3* in the sense that it doesn't really stand out but it isn't the worst thing I've ever eaten either.

It's a huge restaurant and the service is alright. Honestly, it's about as average à place as you can think of.

I did really like their scallop and vermicelli with grated garlic dish. It's huge and it's $6.99, only available on weekends. Definitely get it if you are feeling rich. It's a nice experience and it's actually pretty tasty. I think this is what makes it different from other places.

I also really like their congee. Flavour is great but the actual congee is a little too watery, meaning they didn't cook it enough.

Finally, I don't know if it's because it's so big but their ac is weak. I was literally sweating and fanning myself the entire meal. I looked like I was having hotpot but I was just having cooled down dimsum. Ridiculous. 

Their yin yang rice... I wouldn't recommend it. The shrimp has some veins and the taste isn't totally spectacular but the red sourish sauce was not bad.
