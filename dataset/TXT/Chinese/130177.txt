pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I am writing this review based on what I had. The Bobo brazil and the El topo roll was sooooooooo good! They are not huge so you can just pop one piece at a time and it's like heaven in your mouth. All the flavors and textures just worked so well together. I am not a big sushi eater but I would come back here the next time i'm in vegas. The miso sea bass was awesome also. I got drunk off of one strawberry mojito cause they made them so damn strong here
