uTlDVK8-7VwpLhHnCRTCLg I love this little place! Grew up going here 10 years ago as the Bamboo House. Came back when they changed owners to New Bamboo. Food was just the same as I remember! I got the lemon chicken as a kid, and had it again today.. Quality, simple, and delicious. Super sweet ladies working here. Very kind & they even boxed up my food for me. Wish more people would try.. it was very quiet here today. Can't wait to come back
