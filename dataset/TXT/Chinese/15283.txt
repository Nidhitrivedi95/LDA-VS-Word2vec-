3PhF188adiC8ZutKRP9gyQ This place is a hit or miss.. Some days are good and some days are disappointing. 

There are not that many traditional Chinese dessert places in the area so this place is good to go late night for tofu dessert or some classic hk desserts..I remember hanging out here way back in high school! 

This place is open quite late on weekends and offer a large variety of desserts, drinks and food. 

The reason why I say it is a hit or miss is that I have had very watery tofu dessert before (in the wooden bucket) and some days it is the perfect consistency. 

The price is reasonable as the average dessert is around $5-6. My favourite desert is the warm glutinous rice with coconut milk!
