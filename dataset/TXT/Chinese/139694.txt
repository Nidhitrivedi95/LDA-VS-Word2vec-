Also had the steamed shrimp dumplings and the fried pork and cabbage dumplings and both were excellent as well.   I brought my family and one of my coworkers who ordered the duck entree which was so delicious.  The portion was big.  The meat was moist and the skin was crispy.    The only entree that was just okay was the beef chow fun in soy sauce.  The noodles were chopped up into one inch pieces and I'd prefer if the noodles weren't like that.   Gary was still there to serve us and did an excellent job at that.  At the time of check-in, there were still offers for free boba tea.  Yum.
