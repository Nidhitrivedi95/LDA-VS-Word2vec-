OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I asked my cousin for authentic and true Chinese food. We went here for dim sum. You can not walk into this glorious restaurant with a Western attitude...or you may not enjoy your experience. Wave for the waitress, drink tea and at least try what you ask for. We had shrimp har gow, pork sil myl, fried taro cake, shrimp dumplings, turnip cake, shrimp rice noodle roll etc. My personal favorites...sesame ball, sticky rice in lotus leaf, the chicken feet and oh my goodness the fried shrimp... I know we ordered more but the carts just kept coming. It was so wonderful to have such a variety.
