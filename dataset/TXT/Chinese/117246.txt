NdpvGGF4cLrdnA6ydSZz3g I expected the beef to be more fresh and to have more fatty in the beef (Although this may be a personal preference). 
I think there should be more assortment of vegetables on the menu.

On the positive note, the interior was nice and the place is very clean. 
Service was great, our waiter came back to check on us in good intervals. Since it was AYCE, it was very convenient for us not having to flag someone down all the time.
