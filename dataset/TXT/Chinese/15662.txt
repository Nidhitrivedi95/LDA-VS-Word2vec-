As the name suggests, they specialize in noodles, which includes American and Italian-inspired types as well as the Asian-inspired ones you might think of.  I've tried several varieties here and at the downtown location, including the penne rosa, pesto cavatappi, and mac and cheese.  Although the dishes may not be the most exciting ones you'll find in the area, all of them have been served hot, have tasted good, and have been filling, providing for a solid lunch (or dinner, in the case of my downtown excursions).  The small size is perfect for a lunch portion, whereas the larger size is better for dinner, and meat can be added for an upcharge.  I've tried the parmesan chicken (on the pesto cavatappi) and the BBQ pork (on the macaroni), and both have been tasty and have gone well with these dishes.

Although I don't usually order a drink, as other reviewers have mentioned, they have the Coke freestyle machine, which provides for unlimited flavor customization options. However, there is another establishment down the street that has a Boylan soda fountain, so if I'm feeling like a soda, that's more my speed. 3.5 stars.
