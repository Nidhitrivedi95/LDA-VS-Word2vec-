_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg The bad:
House of Egg Roll - do not order their namesake-unless you want something that was previously frozen with your typical bright red sweet and sour sauce. Mehhhhh. 

Zero parking in this lot. 

Will be seated with other people at tables. 

Worst tap water ever-get tea or soda 

They were out of 3 chicken dishes -those must be good? 

Disgusting restroom. And you only went to wash hands-I guess I'll Bring hand sanitizer next time?


The good:
We had the scallion beef-good-would order that again. The chicken chow mein was decent, a little greasy tho. The yahnzoo fried rice was good. I think it tastes better even without the ham. 

Decent prices, good portions, will come back and try other items and update review.

Almost 100% of diners were Asian-and it was packed. Got to be a good sign, right?
