1uPQTz5XZSWr0ti7kUpaDw I went last weekend with big expectation. However, both food quality and restaurant service are so disappointment. The restuarnt is too small and too crowd because there are many tables in this tiny place. Besides, the restaurnt is freaking cold (only one door, you can image  how cold it is in Montreal winter time especially when people come in N out)  It took us 10 mins to make an order (b/c there is only one waiter) and 30 mins to get dumplings. 

We ordered one boild dumpling and one deep fried dumpling. I dont know why so many people recommend the dumpling. The boiled dumping wrapper is TOO THIN and TOO SOFT . The good dumpling wrapper is supposed to be not too thin, not too thick and chewable.  However, this boild dumpling skin taste like frozen dumpling cooked too long time<U+3002>The skin is too puffy and too soft. The filling is average . The deep fried one is better.

Honestly, I ate better homemade dumplings than here. Not recommend.
