EHKzu5r2NEz5Zq2R84J4ow DONT EAT HERE!!! HEALTH DEPARTMENT WAS NOTIFIED!!! Me and my husband grabbed take out from here on 12/09/2016. We ordered chicken and broccoli and fried rice...got home and opened the container and hair was all inside my rice and the smell!!! It smelled like the eggs in the rice went bad, it was awful! I drove all the way back for a refund and they REFUSED MY REFUND!!! Even the manager acknowledged something was wrong with the food and the obvious hair inside didnt belong to me!! Save your money and steer clear!
