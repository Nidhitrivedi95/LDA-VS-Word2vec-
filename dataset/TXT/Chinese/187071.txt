Along with different variety of sandwiches, they also have sushis, vietnamese street food and finger food. I really like the option of the brown baguette and the choice of 7 or 10 inches baguettes. Made to order, you can also customize your baguette for a little surcharge. The portions are really big and generous! I usually share a 10-inches sandwich with my hubby. There is usually a little line up but the service is fast and efficient. The prices are very reasonable and i believe they also hand out fidelity card for the sandwiches! Give it a try.
