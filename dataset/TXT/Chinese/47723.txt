C04pA51n5jPS6KJJHWyuYA the food here is sooo gross. the fried rice smells off. the chili chicken and sweet and sour chicken is full of fat, bone and cartilage. the sauce for both those dishes are goopy and gross. this place has potential but they really need to put quality into their recipes. i wont eat here again. last time i ate from this restaurant, i ended up throwing out what was on my plate about a few bites.
