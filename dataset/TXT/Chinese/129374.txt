pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Always a pleasure eating at sushi samba. From drinks to food you are left extremely satisfied. 

The waiter asks what the budget is and what you like and he works to set a few courses. 

Each and every course is wonderful. 

It's a fun place to come for a big group gathering and even great for an intimate setting. 

The waiters, servers and hosts are all extremely kind and attentive.
