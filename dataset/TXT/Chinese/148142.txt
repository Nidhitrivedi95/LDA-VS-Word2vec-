sePTDv1dGHPID7kwuNzXaA Are you looking for some great juk (congee) along with some tasty dishes on the side? Well, if you said yes, this place in Markham has your answer. I arrived at Market Village (a shopping area in Markham) and met up with some really interesting people to get some lunch. 

I lost track on what kind of congee that we ate, but all of them were excellent. The thickness was just right, not too watery and it was almost rich. I really enjoyed the beef and chicken varieties of congee and the texture of the seafood is not bad. Even better was the Yau Zha Gwai, also known as the fried dough. It had a great crispness and a soft chewiness, and it was probably the best complement to the congee. It made the congee tastier. The fried noodles had a simple flavour, but were excellent. The Zha Leung Cheung Fun, also known as the Fried Dough Rice Noodle Roll was also pretty good here, especially with the sesame seeds and the sauce. The Lo Bak Go, also known as the turnip cakes were also great, and were prepared in a somewhat unique style. They did not look like cakes, but more like a small pile of mushed turnips. Despite that look, they were still tasty and even tastier with the sauce.  

Wait time is a little long, so make sure you have something to do while you wait. Eating here can be a little messy, so hopefully you will have a lot of napkins. Eating at this place did not give me the feeling that I was in Markham, but possibly somewhere in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The setting is a tiny bit gritty which gave the Hong Kong vibe, but it's definitely not a really gritty place to eat.

Overall, I thought I had some of the best congee and the best Yau Ja Gwai in Markham and possibly in the Toronto area so far. I think this place may become one of my favourite and primary choices for congee in Markham. I hope this place will stay in business and I hope to come back here again for some excellent congee with some Yau Zha Gwai.
