_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA One nice bowl of soup is all you need to forget all the money you just lost at the poker table.  And the roulette table.  And the craps table.  And the goddamn spin-the-wheel.

At least that's what I tried to tell myself.

I sat down, table for one (sigh) and ordered the BBQ pork and Roast Duck Noodle Soup and a nice, big, free glass of water and watched the World Cup on the big screens in the sports betting pit.  The water was worth every penny.  So was the soup!

By the time I left Noodle Asia, the bowl looked much like my wallet: bereft of anything holding value.  Will definitely do this again, but I seriously hope I don't do what preceded this meal again.  But I know I will.
