The service was excellent.  They were polite and helped my wife out to the car since her hand was hurt.  That's pretty much the end of the positive experience.

I ordered the vegetable lo mein.  The noodles were very, very oily and it had a grand total of 5 vegetables other than loads of cabbage-3 pieces of broccoli, 1 green pepper, 1 snow pea.  Other than being very bland, the serving was rather small.  I'm not a big person, but had to reheat leftovers as there wasn't enough to feel full.  My wife ordered the Mu Shu Chicken.  The thin pancakes it's supposed to come with were thick tortillas.  She said the flavor was good, but didn't use the tortillas.  My son ordered the sweet and sour pork which was pretty good.  

Overall, the portions are small, prices double what I could get nearby for more food and better flavor.  Tried it, but won't be back.
