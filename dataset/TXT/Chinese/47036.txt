bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A I agree with reviews below, service is lightning fast!  We got the lunch special I ordered veggie lo mein, it wasn't bad. I guess I'm more f a t his food kinda girl, flavors were pretty good, but my skirt isn't blowing.  If you've come for free Wi-Fi, u had better be charged up with a full battery because the one available outlet is dead. Not bad fo- $6.
