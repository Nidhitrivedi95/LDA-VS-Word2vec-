The owners wife is the cashier and she has her son with her. He's a boys boy, and defiantly likes to play. I had my two year old daughter with me, and I'm sure people don't like being bothered by kids they don't know. I could tell by how the mother kept nervously telling her son to be nice and to leave my daughter alone. I thought it was cute, she's only two and the little boy is four. I enjoyed him keeping my daughter busy while we were waiting for the food. The food came out pretty quick and tasted good! The prices are great too. I will probably go back. :) defiantly a child friendly restaurant, which can be hard to come by on the eastside.
