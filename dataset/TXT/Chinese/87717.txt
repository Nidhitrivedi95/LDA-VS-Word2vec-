hwe7f0QthkND-H4Ekg37qw This place is very average. Sushi delivery is why this place didn't get 1 star. With so many other choices in Squirrel hill, why go here? Staff are kind and knowledgeable; they appreciate you business. But the food is very...plain. Nothing special comes out of this kitchen and sushi is the poorest you can get that is still alright. To be sure, you will be getting fatty tuna in lieu of tuna, dark meat chicken instead of white meat (you need to request white meat). Not worth finding a place to park other than you can shop at the record store located above the restaurant. Skip it unless you must have sushi NOW!!!!!!! Then get it.
