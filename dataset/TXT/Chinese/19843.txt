5UvAxXy6BBgyuxv0B3ztjA Came here with the boyfriend's family because his mother suggested eating here. One of the better places of the Las Vegas Hotel (formerly known as Las Vegas Hilton).

Location is a little bit difficult to find, but it is located where all the other Asian restaurants of LVH (Benihana and Teru Sushi) are and you just have to walk on back past the front desk of Benihana. (: The decor is mediocre. 

First off, the waitresses and waiters are super friendly. We had awesome service.

The food... was a bit overpriced (but what restaurant near the strip isn't?). $6.95 for a single serving of Hot and Sour Soup, which was kind of bland. $8 or so dollars for 8 baby gyozas.... and the drinks (about $9 for cocktails) were tiny and filled mostly with ice. 

We also got some dishes like Black Pepper Chicken (huge cut portions of green bell peppers, onions, and chicken) which looked like it could have been just cooked at your own home, Special Roast Duck Noodle Soup (which I didn't try), and Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup (good beef and broth, but crunchy noodles that didn't seem to be cooked all the way.. 

All in all it was okay. Decent Chinese food if you're looking for something to eat. No wait when I came on a Sunday night.
