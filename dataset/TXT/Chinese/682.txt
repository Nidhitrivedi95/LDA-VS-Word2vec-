-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw Finally got to try this location out I always pass by it and the line up is ridiculously long. Finally got here on a Monday night around 9pm and its quiet tried the roasted brown rice green milk tea hot with tapioca and it is delicious. Very good drink I see the quality of the drink tastes really good and authentic. Would come back again but line ups I tend to avoid... Its too crazy here daytimes.
