BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg Best Szechuan I've had in Pittsburgh.   Order off of the Szechuan menu, not the regular menu.   The only disappointment was the dumplings, they were obviously made with store bought wonton wrappers, the sauce they came in was great though.   Prices are high but the portions are large, definitely a place that is best to go to with several people so that you can try a little of everything.    We spent $40 for two people and took home nearly as much as we ate.

Some earlier reviews say cash only, but they now have a credit card machine.
