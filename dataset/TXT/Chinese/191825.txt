YWrrjZ7KdYwN_pUNbLfTCw I used to love ordering food from here when I wanted my Chinese food craving satisfied. Until my last visit that has changed. The food was VERY oily and bland. The chicken pieces were full of fat and absolutely disgusting. It's unfortunate that this place has let their quality to fall to such a low, but I guess that's expected from these "quick serve" restaurants.
