9WAnQD1nj1j3zLZ7ONtvfQ I have to say that I am the only one at our table that really enjoyed the sushi.  Everyone else thought it was just okay.  

The miso wasn't the best but their house rolls were really really good (according to me, anyway).

The bummer?  My friend ordered a double espresso and they actually charged him for 2.  That would be $8 for that little beverage.  

The service was nice and I loved the decor.  Doesn't Tao look the same?  It's been a while.
