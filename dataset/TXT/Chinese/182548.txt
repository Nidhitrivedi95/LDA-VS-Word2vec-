XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA Used to be one of the best seafood / Chinese buffets around.  Has really gone down hill in the past couple months.   Several items were cold.   Crab puffs were only wrapper and frying grease was trapped inside.   Frog legs were really good and sushi selection was nice.   Weekday price of $16.88 was high.  Won't be back anytime soon.
