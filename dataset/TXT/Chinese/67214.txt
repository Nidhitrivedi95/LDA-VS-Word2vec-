em3TpGN9BAA85u2lXewDiQ Finally! A place in Charlotte with boneless ribs! The dishes seem to be hit or miss when it comes to flavor. That being said, none of the dishes have been bad. They've all been at least good if not delicious. The sesame chicken has a nice fried crust but has a nice ratio of fried to chicken. The chicken and broccoli is tasty but could use a brown sauce or something to bump it up a notch. The broccoli is very fresh, even if you just get it as a side. The rice (white, brown, fried) is never stale or heavy. 

We've done both dine in and take out and haven't noticed a big difference, which is awesome.

Every staffer I've interacted with, whether in person or over the phone, has been very pleasant.

The dining room isn't too large but can sit large parties fairly easily. 

If you are coming from Trade, you don't have to get onto John to turn left into Ming Fu. Instead, turn in behind the Exxon. There is driving access that goes behind the restaurant.
