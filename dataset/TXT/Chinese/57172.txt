D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw The dressing on my salad was a bit too sweet and so i minus one star. That said, the service was great, all the other dishes were delicious! The Tom Ka soup and the boba were exactly how I wanted them to be, and how I'd hoped they'd taste. So definitely no disappointments there. My friends all loved their food too. And I had an urge to just hang out drinking this amazing Vietnamese hot tea afterwards outside on the patio for hours. If I didn't have so much work to do, I totally would have done that. Def going back on a day where I can chill for a couple hours on that patio.
