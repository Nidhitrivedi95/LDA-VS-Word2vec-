ZGpT6rcgSsJ4GxwTHbvvJw I can't even review this place because they said that they couldn't delivery to my apartment because it's "too far". 

Apparently they have a 5 mile limit and when I mentioned it was listed on Google Maps (which I think is pretty reliable) as 4.5 the guy on the phone 'corrected' me saying it was 4.8. So I told him, "That's still not 5." I got a "I'm sorry." 

Well, I'm sure you are because now I'm ordering from another restaurant because you were too lazy to drive 4.5*** miles because of your '5 mile limit'.
