TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA Came here for dinner about an hour & 15 minutes before close & it was absolutely dead. My friend and I were the only ones there. That being said, the service was terrible, I waited about 15 minutes before I got a refill on water. The food was mediocre. Ordered the sesame chicken and I could tell it was not fresh, had a weird taste to it. The rice was cold. The only thing I managed to eat with no problem were the crab Angels. The check was brought to us immediately after our food was, made us feel rushed. Over all, just not a good experience. Would rather have spent so much money elsewhere!
