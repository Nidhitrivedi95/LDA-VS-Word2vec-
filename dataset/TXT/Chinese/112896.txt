Mkpg9S2j0ZrZc3q-VjfLsA Bought half a BBQ duck and half soya chicken tonight for take out. Really bad, no taste at all for both. And the BBQ guy was too lazy to chop the duck and chicken , I end up having 8-9 cube of meat in each container. Their BBQ meat went downhill. It used to be good . Now it's no better than those BBQ meat sold in Chinese grocery store but cost double here.
