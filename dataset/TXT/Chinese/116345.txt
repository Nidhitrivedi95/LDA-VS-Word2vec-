This is a typical HK style cafe that has almost everything you can think of.  Came here for breakfast this morning and there were 4 or 5 menus...the dim sum special before 11am menu, the dim sum set menu, the HK style western breakfast menu, the noodles, rice, etc menus.  I'm not actually a huge fan of breakfast at HK style cafe because it includes dishes like macaroni soup with ham & peas which I don't really care for.  My daughter and husband love this!  I like the fact that they have dim sum as well and I was really surprise that it was pretty good.  The set menus are also a good deal which comes with hot tea or coffee.  It's a great place for family with lots of selection for everyone.

This place has been around for at least 10 years and I totally forgot about it.  The place is quite spacious that probably can accommodate over 100 people.  There were 3 dim sum dishes that I liked the most which were the black bean spareribs steam rice, BBQ pork steam rice rolls and Chiu chow steam dumplings (meats & peanuts)......these were just as good as some of the fancy Chinese dim sum places like Dragon Boat and Premier Banquet.  The prices are also really reasonable, our total bill came to only $33 for 7 dishes and 2 milk teas.

If you're not looking for a fancy place but just want some good Chinese food, this is the place.
