fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA I've been here twice now. Once with my parents who've spent a considerable amount of time living in Shanghai. I also spent a semester abroad in Hong Kong where I tried the Silvercord branch of the real Ding Tai Fung in TST (the first branch to get a Michelin star), as well as one of the branches in Taipei itself. I also had the opportunity to frequent some competitors such as Crystal Jade.

So at a high level, the Markham ripoff isn't as great as the Asian locations, but is still very good. Key differences from Asia are that it's significantly less busy in Markham, it has a much broader range of menu items, and it's cheaper - even on a purely nominal basis. In terms of the xiao long bao themselves, the soup is more oily and the skin isn't as thin/fresh.

That said, I reiterate that this place is very very good, and probably the go-to in the GTA. I've had the traditional, shrimp, and scallop xiao long baos, green onion pancakes, shrimp/pork shiu mai, shrimp/pork dumplings, spicy wonton, pan-fried buns, beef noodle soup, soy milk, fried dough, and some of the veggie items. Everything is consistently very good; it just doesn't 'wow' you after you've had it in HK/Taipei.
