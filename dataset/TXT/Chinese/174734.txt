WfgupKdYx1h0mKBmOmNQ3g Wish i could put no stars, ordered the orange chicken and honey chicken, and  chicken chow mien with egg-roll. First they must never read their reviews, because the EGG ROLL tastes like a cinnamon spray paint can. The orange chicken and honey chicken are the same thing and VERY VERY bland. I used to order lunch from here all the time and loved it, I don't know what happened. I am now ordering from GRACE GARDEN for my Chinese food needs, I hope they don't disappoint either, they were great the first time and I was going to order again, but I hesitated, because Taste of China used to be my favorite and my dedication for food stays true.
