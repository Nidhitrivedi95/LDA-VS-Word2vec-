Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA Went to Have lunch with my husband and our server did not attend us very well. He took like 6 min to get to out table to get our drink order. After we order he only checked on us once when we got our good, when we were done eating we asked for boxes to go.He didn't even ask if we wanted dessert or if he could get us anything else. Wasn't too happy with the service at all.
