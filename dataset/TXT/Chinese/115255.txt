n_rEQNgsCOLNfMzGqFhn1g I do not give bad reviews often, but this one is one of them unforutnately.  My husband is from the west coast and he is picky about his Chinese food.  He thought he found a good place once on his lunch break and wanted me to try it for dinner, so we went.  It was aweful.  How can you mess up wonton soup and vegetable spring rolls.  The sesame chicken was terrible.  The shrimp with garlic sauce just ok.  And the waiter was MIA after we got our food...we wanted to get some extra white rice at least and then our check at the end took forever, it was bad.  We also returned that wonton soup back to the kitchen since it was so bad.  Lastly, I did not think a tip was deserved so I made that known...and the owner was pissed off and made sure to tell my husband about it, but honestly I do not care.  YOU NEED TO DO BETTER, CHINESE FOOD IN CHARLOTTE OFFICIALLY HAS A BAD NAME!
