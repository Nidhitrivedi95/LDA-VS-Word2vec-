qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA Do NOT go there. I had a mini gathering with my friends and they wanted to eat there for dinner so that's the only reason I went. The grilled eggplant was drenched in oil and the surf clams were definitely NOT fresh. The raw scallops were not the usual big ones where you slice into thin pieces at sushi restaurants but they gave us tiny ones where people usually use to cook with. Those were not fresh either. Guess what? Within an hour, I went to their bathroom because I had to puke. My body literally physically rejected the food. NEVER AGAINNNNNNN.
