rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg Sun Asian has won me over! The happy hour runs from 3-7pm and is a smoking good deal. $1 eggrolls, sushi and sashimi, and all other sorts of items all under $5. I love the fired tofu, the beef skewers, the spring rolls and the crab puffs. 

They have Kirin Light and sake and wait staff is incredibly friendly. If I lived in the area I would find myself here more often.
