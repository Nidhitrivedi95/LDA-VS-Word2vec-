CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw Health hazard! Decor and extremely high price suggests high quality, handmade food.  It's not.

Taste is awful. That's actually not my main complaint. Taste is suggestive after all.  Trying to be Din Tai Fung I think.

Portions are miniscule.  $25 for three tiny shrimp.  Appetizers are bigger than this place's entrees.

However, my main problem is the fact that they serve raw meat.  And it's not steak tartare.  It was a won ton noodle soup.  Won tons are supposed to be pork and shrimp.  No shrimp.  That would cost them too much.  This was corn starch, gravy, and some meat I think was pork.  Yes, it was awful.  Not the main problem.  Owner insulted me and we got into an argument about it.  He said I didn't understand what fusion food is.  Fine.  We'll agree to disagree.  It doesn't change the fact that the pork was RAW!  You can't serve raw pork!  You can pass intestinal worms that way.

Our poor waiter was so embarrassed.  He even said that he doubted he would see us again but if he did, he hoped they would have improved.  The health department will probably shut them down first.
