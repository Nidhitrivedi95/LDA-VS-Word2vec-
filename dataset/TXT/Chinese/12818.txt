2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg I heard good things about this place so I wanted to give it a try. I think it might've just been what we ordered, but the food we had was bad. We ordered their fried dough in rice noodle roll and baked Portuguese chicken rice. The fried dough was cold and not crispy at all. The rice didn't look or taste baked and I didn't like that they served the rice separate from the heavily battered chicken and runny sauce.

I think they're more known for their stir-frys, so that might still be worth a try.
