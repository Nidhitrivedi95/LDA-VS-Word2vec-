7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew Mm m m....I love Dim Sum!  My family loves going to China King.  I think it's the closet thing to good Dim Sum in the Southeast valley.  China King is not your typical Dim Sum restaurant; it's pretty small place.  Their service is okay, but is such a thing as good Dim Sum service...Ha!  If there is, then you're not a Dim Sum restaurant :)  The Decor here is mediocre, it's plain jane with no pop, but I don't think they really care.  I would still recommend this place if you don't want to travel to the city to Great Wall.  Enjoy!
