U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q BEST. HOT AND SOUR SOUP. EVER 

Ate this place 3 days straight because of their hot and sour soup!!!! I never ever in my life had a seafood hot and sour soup and it was so delicious. I couldn't get brought of it!! Their general tso was good as well but I think you can only get that via room service...unless I didn't see it in the menu at the restaurant. I think I literally tried everything on the menu and nothing really impressed me except the hot and sour soup. All the other foods just tasted like typical Chinese food...except it's expensive (for a Chinese food) 

The interior is odd but unique. The front entrance pathway is filled with a goldfish tanks and the whole restaurant is white. When I dined in at the restaurant, I didn't think the food was as good as when I got room service. Maybe it was because a different chef?! But if your ever in Vegas, they their Hot and Sour soup. You won't regret it.
