jIc8lKpK0S265D18cgQKEw 5 years ago I would give this 5 stars. 

Came on a Wednesday evening at 8pm and the joint was empty. Unsure if there has been a change in management, but the service was subpar. Our food came out at room temperature and our waiter was hard to track down. They cooked us a new dish, which was much better, but it was a 1.5 hour ordeal. The restaurant is nice and clean, but the food was average. 

You can find much better Chinese at Siam Cafe in Cleveland or Ho Wah in Beachwood.
