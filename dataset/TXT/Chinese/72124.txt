FexomhlA5G7ipOEH3pqFkA Its great for a big familly. . But personaly for chinese food id go to china town ;) its very American ish .. its good but like I said its not a place I would crave to fo back to.. we go every now and then because the seatings are wonderful and for a big family its perfect. Its a bit pricey. The soups are delish there and the drinks are cool.
