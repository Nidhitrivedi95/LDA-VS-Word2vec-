1lRytuj8IdLMHDFl2LetxA The food is alright, but the service is terrible.  I'm here right now, waiting for my food and have been here for like 20 years waiting on the staff.  I came in clean shaven, and am beginning to feel a beard growing.  When they DO get around to you, most are rude.

But the food's alright though - did I mention that?

1 star rating -- chalk it up to that "WORLD-CLASS" service.
