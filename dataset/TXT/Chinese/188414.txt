yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I guess after the rapid growth of business, Pho Kim Long starts having some issue on their QC and customer service. Last time me and my girl went there, we found a cock roach in the soup and told the server about it. And guess what? He came check out the bug body and then took it away. Then he claimed that it was just some pepper they used to make soup and left a check then walked away. I can't believe this is how they treat their customer.
