Good location with nice view during daytime, for sure. At night, it is dark outside. We were seated at the window, but did not bother looking outside at all as there was nothing to see (perhaps prices should be decreased when it is nite outside there...).

Dim sum are good, although too big to my personal taste. I like my dumpling to be no more than 2 fabulous bites. But at least, that's really worth the price. 6$ for 4 huge dumplings, that is decent.

Pekin duck is OK (rice pancakes are on the fluffy side), second "crystal" course is really good.

All in all, good and relatively classy Chinese place. Good for a date (during the day or early Summer nites) or if you are around. For Chinese food craving, I will still go to some of my other favs.
