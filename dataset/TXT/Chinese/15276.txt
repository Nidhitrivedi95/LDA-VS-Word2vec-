3PhF188adiC8ZutKRP9gyQ This is one of those places I would just pass by but my friends wanted to go so I gave it a try. I actually very much enjoyed it but they told me my food was watered down...

Food: 3/5, I got the taro slush and it was good.

Service: 2/5, not very much other than bringing over the food.

Ambience: 3/5, odd seating with others but it was ok.

Price: 3/5, about $8 per person.

I enjoyed it so I will return.
