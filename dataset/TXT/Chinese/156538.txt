trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ Started coming here when it was still called Starfish years ago.  Food is always excellent, wine list is small but spot-on to match their menu, and the beers on offer are excellent with a dozen oysters.  The combination of great food and it's relaxed atmosphere is perfect.  And there is no better sticky toffee pudding in Southern Ontario.

Service is generally good - only had one hiccup ever.  Last time we were there our mains came before our oysters because the bar guy / shucker was really busy.  Turns out the guy causing the slowdown was Kevin Brauch from the Food Network (a friend of the owner).  Kevin came over to apologize, gave us a second dozen oysters on the house for the delay, and then took us to the bar to teach us how to mix and match flavours for the perfect cocktail.  A pretty good way to make up for a 10 minute delay.

Should also try the Ceili Cottage - same owners, same quality of food, but a more traditional Irish pub theme.
