cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A This is my go to take out food. Love the flavors and my food is always ready within 10-15min of ordering to go. Most of the time the food is fresh; however I've ordered a couple of times where it seem the meat wasn't as fresh as I would like. I usually get the two meat combo and love the variety, quesadilla, burrito etc. I haven't tried the burritos but love the Jade chicken quesadilla, it is definitely a must try. My go to are the Jade chicken and Jen pork with jerk fried rice. So yum!!!The order also comes with a cookie which is a great touch.
