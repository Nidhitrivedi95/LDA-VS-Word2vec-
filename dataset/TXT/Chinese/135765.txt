QDJBn7I1EdtP9w4nYT24Pw Good Chinese delivery, East Coast-style. It's now my second-favorite Chinese delivery in the area.

Lucky Kitchen strikes the perfect balance between restaurant quality and delivery style. People who love fried noodles and thick gloppy sauces deserve good food too! Every ingredient packed a lot of flavor and was just the right texture. Roast pork and shrimp were especially good. 

Unfortunately, the sauces left a bit to be desired. The dark brown egg foo young sauce was just shy of burnt, and it ended up tasting like cafeteria salisbury steak. The fried rice was also a bit too dark for my taste, and was light on the extra ingredients. I'm guessing the extra-browned sauce was due to ordering in the middle of the afternoon... I'll try again during the lunch rush. 

Egg rolls were excellent, as was the cashew chicken and sweet and sour pork. More than enough to outweigh the egg foo young.

Bonus points for allowing online ordering. 

And - this feels a little weird to say - the delivery guy really is very charming.
