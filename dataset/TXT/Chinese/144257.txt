ruHEkBY2ysclSFIcai4tfg I come to this place when feeling nostalgic for 70's Chinese Restaurant decor and the typically popular North American version of Chinese food. The staff are great, friendly and professional, always refilling your water glass on a hot day and making sure we ve seen all of the available options. The reliable weekday lunch combos for $6 or dinner meal combos are fine. I have yet to taste anything spectacular from this place, but you know what you ll be getting, it doesn't cost an arm and a leg and they ve got discount for pick up (and lots of seats and magazines to leaf through while you wait). There s a lot of newer restaurants in the area that may be taking away business from this restaurant (it s been here for a long time). Give em a chance!
