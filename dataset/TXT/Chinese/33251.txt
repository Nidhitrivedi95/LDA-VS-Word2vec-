The location is great and strange, close to the Plain Dealer building down Rockwell. Apparently this giant gilded building was the old "Chinatown." Now Emperor's Palace is the only thing there, although there are signs posted saying that "Chinatown Development" is up to something. Very very cool location, interesting decor.
