cjatara6LkXRu2BXD_jxlA Service is good food is decent but 1) food are way over priced like 4 lamb skeward cost almost 6 bucks. 2) all food tasted the same. 3) you have to pay for every drinks, even for water. 4) place is small, if you go during winter there's no places to put your jacket. 5) def not going back 6) cash only 7) they won't sperate bills even if you handed in separate orders
