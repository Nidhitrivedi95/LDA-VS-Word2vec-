dj4eotH4cBqbeIH2CgSmYg I eat here a few times a month because it's convenient to my home and office. If I'm with co-workers we will dine in, but usually I order online & just pick it up. They generally have your food ready in 15 minutes or less which is awesome. 

If you do dine in, they have a cool soda machine with dozens of flavored soda and juice options. I love the Hi-C fruit punch because mentally I'm 5 years old.

Oh and if you're a fan of tofu- definitely try theirs! It's excellent. If I'm in "diet mode" I'll just order tofu with quinoa (that's their new grain option and it is really good IMO), and some veggies and it makes for a delicious, healthy, protein-packed lunch. 

When I'm not in "diet mode" (which seems to be most of the time lately- eek!), I'll order the honey seared shrimp, add tofu, with quinoa and veggies. It's really good for "fast casual"!

Pad Thai with tofu is also yummy!

I think my only issue with Pei Wei is, they are way too heavy with the sauce 80% of the time. Often I will ask for my sauce on the side to avoid this.

Also, don't leave without taking copious amounts of the fortune cookies they leave out. I fill up the bag with handfuls of them every time and no one bats an eye!
