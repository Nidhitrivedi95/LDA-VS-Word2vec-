-k30GnIy_6V7YyODRr9PdA Wanted a quick and easy dinner for a late night. We've always had good luck with Panda. To start of this bad experience, Claudia had the worst attitude and very poor customer service skills; from the eye rolls and the tone of her voice she should not be allowed to interact with customers. The cashier was friendly. The food was ok. Some of the chicken was really dry and some of it was really saucy so it was very inconsistent.
