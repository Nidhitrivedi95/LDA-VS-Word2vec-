9ok8nLK-8emYWbt6kwd-HA I've been to the Golden Duke Chinese Cuisine restaurant for Dim Sum three or four times.

The Pros:
Quality is consistent
Quality of food is excellent
Service is good
Selection of food is good

The Cons:
A bit more pricey than other Dim Sum restaurants
You need to arrive early or you will be waiting for a long time.

Highlights:
Peking Duck with Pancake wrap
The chicken (moist and flavourful)

I would recommend this restaurant but the thought of one less available table does not appeal to me. So please, stay away ;)
