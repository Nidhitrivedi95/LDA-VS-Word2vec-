Ly48L1qSRdLpCSWcs_DWIw I was born in Hong Kong and even though I was just a kid when I left there, any HK style cafe brings me back memories of my birthplace. Phoenix has been my go-to HK cafe as of late and I really like their selection especially the baked dishes. Any place that lets you add a fried egg on top of your dish is a place I'll visit again.
