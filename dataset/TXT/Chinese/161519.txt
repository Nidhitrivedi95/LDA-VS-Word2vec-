If you come here during regular hours, food is average and not bad. One of their best sellers is their stewed beef brisket noodle with their hand made noodles. The hand made noodles are fresh.

Cons: Sometimes you get too much soup and not enough noodles to go with the soup.
Service is average during regular and after hours and especially when it's busy, it's hard to get service. I usually go here with friends when we can't decide where else to eat.
