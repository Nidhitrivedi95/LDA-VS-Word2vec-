However, I am so tired of the owner raising his prices in 50 cent increments.  I feel like they are the post office raising the price on stamps.  He has done this so much, that I really don't think YC's is as good a deal as it once was.  They also changed from Coke products to Pepsi products after 20 years--bad move in my opinion.  One of the workers told me that they have already heard complaints about this from several of their customers.  Yes, I will continue to go, but not nearly as much.
