Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA With all the great reviews for this place, I thought I'd be more blown away.  Maybe I didn't order the right items but my food just felt like standard fare.  We got the pad see yew, the crispy spring rolls, the basil stir fry and the red curry.  Everything was well done (however I did find things a tad on the salty side).  Portion sizes were decent.  If this restaurant was closer to my house I can see coming here regularly, but otherwise I'm just as happy with the local asian / chinese / thai restaurants closer to my place.
