BJW6rCMoWcn8fDFhbMVyEQ Last night I was seriously craving some good Chinese food, and remembered that a while back a friend had picked up some take out from the them and it was really good! 
Arrived and the placed was SLAMMED, 30 minute wait - thankfully, there was a table opening up in the bar, so we grabbed it! Service was super friendly and efficient without be obtrusive. Ordered the sizzling rice soup, I had never had it before and it was delicious. There were 3 of us and we were easily able to share the soup for 2 among the three of us. For our entrees we shared an order of the Chow Fun Noodles with BBQ Pork, Spicy Home style Chicken, and the Double Dragon with had two kinds of shrimp, the Grand Marnier Shrimp and the Sweet and Pungent Shrimp. 
Everything was DELICIOUS! My two personal faves were the Grand Mariner Shrimp, it reminded me of this shrimp dish I used to get when I lived in Los Angeles, I am so happy I know I can come here and get it when I am craving that sweet delectable dish, The spicy home style chicken was really good too, spicy while still being flavorful! The Chow fun noodles were great as was the Sweet and Pungent Shrimp. The rest of their menu sounded delicious and I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu. One thing to know is that this place is PRICEY for Chinese food, our bill was $100.00.

A must if your in the area looking for some great Chinese food!
