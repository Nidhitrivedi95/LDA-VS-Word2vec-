CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Noodles is the bourgeosie dream. It's wildly overpriced carbohydrates tucked into one of the world's most famous casinos. My shrimp dumpling soup was pretty good, with a fishiness in the broth that didn't wrankle my nose, which can be a hard feat with a diner who didn't eat much fish growing up. But you're paying a lot of money for a small bowl of noodles. The ambiance, like the rest of Vegas, covers up structural problems with a dazzling and dizzying array of exotic looking noodles in jars against the wall, almost as if a noodle crazed mad scientist had taken up residence in the restaurant. But the food was on the meager side, and expensive, evn given the quality. And we found the service to be wanting. I think they were short a waiter, but we had to call one over after waiting an unusual amount of time for someone to take a drink order. The food also took a long time, even though we arrived well after the typical dinner hour. Also, I wouldn't come here if a member of your party is a frequent visitor to bathrooms and has trouble walking. The bathrooms are on the other side of the casinos (of course), so you'll be trekking through slot machines and hordes of well dressed career professionals to get to the facilities. Unfortunately, while Vegas may have good food here and there, often there isn't a lot of choice once you're anchored in a casino. Each one has their pride and joy restaurants. For what it's worth, I'd either skip the noodle section of the menu here and hope for something better in, say, the Mappo dofu, or try the Cantonese restraurant across the way which may or may not be a better choice.
