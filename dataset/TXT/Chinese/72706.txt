fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA Arrived in Kensington at 10pm with a Montreal posse craving dumplings. Whipped out ze Yelps and discovered the #1 rated spot was around the corner and open for another hour. We ordered 4 kinds, about 14 dumplings per person, and despite the wise-eyed doubt of one dinner companion while ordering we plowed through them all, plus a cucumber garlic salad. 

Everything was the best. The pork and fennel was insane and I could eat like 100 of these every other day. The fried dumplings were delicate and gorgeous. Each pocket was lovingly made by hand in the front window by a multigenerational crew of laughing ladies. The cucumber and garlic in the salad were both super crisp and fresh and the flavour so intense it will burn the evil out of you, purify you and make you new. Super friendly service, tiny cute spot, but all that matters are the perfect dumplings and they are perfect.
