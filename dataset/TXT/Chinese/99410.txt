Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Not bad Not bad.. the dim sum was quite fresh and the cost was quite reasonable.. 
WHen people say this chinese place is dirty.. i would agree.. but its a CHINESE restaurant.. I would be quite concerned if the place was too clean. 
Now I've been to some bad places.. so I know bad when i see it.. for those of you who love dim sum.. this place is a good choice..
Also you might want to plan accordingly.. i went on tuesday for lunch and it was crowded.. I can  just imagine coming here on the weekend..
And by the way this place is so popular they are open on Thanksgiving.. AND they extended their hours this day.. hmmm..
