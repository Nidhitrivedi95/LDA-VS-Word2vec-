taXKuFldSoerm9SXrckh_w Really enjoyed my lunch. Ordered and paid online for pick up...said would be ready in 30 minutes. ..arrived 10 minutes early and it was ready. ..and hot! Yes! Food was flavorful and plentiful off the lunch menu and the price was right.  I had the Kung Poa chicken with egg drop soup and white rice.  Plus order of crab puffs.  And , it was packed in nice containers so food would not spill. Will definitely eat there again. Yummy.
