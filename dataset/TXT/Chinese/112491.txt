0-2 stars for service

First impression was great!  Family sharing food off to the right and they looked happy. 

I was doing takeout and was greeted by 2 females. The awkward moment came when I had to ask for a menu,they didn't even ask if I wanted to eat here or takeout. 

They don't have lunch specials on the weekend but that wasn't stated on the menu. 

Different sizes of meals and appetizers not listed on menu

They gave 2 free egg rolls with the meal but they
are bitter and soggy on the inside.  It also has a smokey taste

I got home and they didn't even give me my wallet shrimp. After digging through everything it turns out that they gave me wonton soup.

The crab puffs are greatly filled but it's not crab.  Not even imitation crab.  It's more liquid that came out of a piping bag. 

I was hungover and didn't want to deal with it anymore. I drove by the place.  Dropped off the soup and went somewhere else. 

0 - the food because I didn't get what I ordered and the crab puffs had 0 crab in it. 

0 - they got my order wrong and didn't offer me a menu. 

I can't give a 0 so 1 star it is
