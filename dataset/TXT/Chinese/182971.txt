xL-Ckvr8k8vEBJxC1wsCqQ Pricey and the food was not so good.
The nine of us ordered the buy one get one lobster for $28 and a couple of other dishes.  The lobsters had no meat in it and we were definitely not full, which is surprising, since our total bill was $200. Honestly, their portions are way too small. The food tasted okay, nothing too good. I could have had waay better food from Congee Wong.

The service was very unfriendly, and considering how we had 30 people that day, giving them so much business, they definitely didn't feel like they appreciated us being there. I've had way better Chinese food (come on, we are in Toronto after all) and they definitely could have done better catering us.
