3dk9XrtorfOJu8yX6BVYRg YC's Mongolian Grill is my absolute favorite places in the world for stir fry! Hands down the best! I Love that they have fresh ingredients, and a wide verity. The beat part? YOU get to make your own! Its also pretty cool to be able to watch them make your food RIGHT in front of you!! It's a pretty cool experience!!!
