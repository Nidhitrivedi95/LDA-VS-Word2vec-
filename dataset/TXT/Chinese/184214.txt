xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I had always heard that Lulu's Noodles was supposed to be good............,well I sat down w/my friend & it was like sitting in a wind tunnel.  Artic blasts of freezing cold air whooshed all around our table.  Now mind you we haven't even eaten yet!  My friend put on my down vest & I wrapped my scarf around my neck hoping to garner some warmth.  We moved to another table in the back(our waitress was very patient w/us)but incredibly it was even more frigid!!!!! All around people sat shivering in their coats.  The food was extremely MEDIOCRE.  Again our server was a sweetheart. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone but an enemy!  By the way the Manager has no customer service skills.  I have a head cold that should it worsen, I will be blaming Lulu's Noodles!
