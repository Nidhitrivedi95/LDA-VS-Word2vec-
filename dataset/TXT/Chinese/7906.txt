1bkp1NeTw5yg3hTsldkoPA I wanted to like this place because it's close by and convenient however unfortunately I did not, I got take out so maybe dinning in is better. 

I got stir fry noodles and pan fried onion cake, the noodles were super oily and didn't have much taste and the pan fried onion cake was burnt. 

Only real plus I can say is that it is one of the only Chinese food establishments in the area and the menu options are vast.
