Dumpling House gained a lot of notoriety a few years ago when a picture of a rat in the kitchen was circulated.  But, lets be fair, their kitchen is in the main window of the restaurant.  Most restaurants have an animal or two - plus they put 10 000 dollars into renovations after this, leaving it as - potentially - the cleanest place on the China Town strip.

They lost some of their charm, for me, once they started to clean up - but I'm sure most folks thought it was a big improvement.  The only throw back to the original restaurant is the bathroom in the basement.

If you want some steamed Dumplings, there's no reason not to check out Dumpling house.  Not only are the dumplings great, but the dipping sauce you can create really gives it the extra kick.

I suggest: 3 parts chili, 2 parts vinegar, 1 part soy.

On your way out, why not grab a Bahn Mi sandwich next door, and some Chinese buns from Ding Dongs across the street?
