QpOAv584eb-ecG4TLEm95g I've been there a few times and have not been disappointed! Their lunch/dinner plates are reasonably priced, taste delicious, and are quite full! Even their delivery is quick and friendly. It's one of the very few places that offer fish in black bean sauce in their lunch specials. For that, they have my heart!
