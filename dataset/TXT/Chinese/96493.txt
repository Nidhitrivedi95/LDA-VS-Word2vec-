jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow Unlike most buffets, the food here is consistently fresh.  Included in the great variety of options are simple sauteed mushrooms, terriyaki chicken on a stick, or chicken poppers. From the simple dishes to the more elaborate, each and everything we have tried is tasty and delicious. Higher priced than we normally pay,  but considering the quality, an excellent value and worth every penny.
