cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw Very bad Wor Wonton soup no wonton skin just starchy dough pockets with very little meat stay away from this soup no shrimps nor slices of pork . I went to another Chinese Restaurant about four miles from them and got a good ole' fashion Wor Wonton soup the way I've had it for years.
