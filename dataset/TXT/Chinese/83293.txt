hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA I was here at 5pm today 4/3/16 Most of the food was just warm even the egg drop soup was only warm,but the main reason for going for diner are the crab legs which I waited 10 mins for the refill to come out they were COLD and this is what you pay extra for.I told the mgr and he said the steamer under the crab legs was hot maybe so  I told him but the crab legs are COLD he could care less and suggested I didn't know what I was talking about.I have been a regular here for the last 5 years.But no more !!!!Buffet Asia you have just gotten a new customer.
