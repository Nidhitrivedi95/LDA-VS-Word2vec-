TdjydrOFUSMUsTKdlXW6aQ I grew up eating in little hole in the wall chinese restaurants and I really wanted to like New Garden.  I had driven past the place many times and thought it was abandoned but after looking on Google and seeing some good reviews on Yelp I decided to give the place a try.

The interior matches the exterior,  There were food stains on the wall next to the both I was eating in.  The server laid out our place setting by handling the eating surface of every utensil she put down.  One of the bowls they brought us was dirty too.  

The server never came around to see if we needed anything else but she did decide to drop off more napkins right as we were finishing our meal.  The food isn't bad the prices don't match the service and the questionable cleanliness will make it enough for me to never come back.
