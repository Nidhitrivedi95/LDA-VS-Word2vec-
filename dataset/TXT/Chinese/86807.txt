hQMx2ZbGAa_oxJNpnTZf8Q I would like to start by saying that this place is a 2.5. I was always a little skeptical of this place since they are called "The Diner" and also have Chinese food. (I love Chinese food, but would prefer it from a Chinese restaurant.) My husband and I came here for breakfast last Sunday and it looked like a great place with home-style cooking. There were no issues with parking and we did not have to wait to be seated. The inside also had that "diner feel" and I regretted not coming here sooner. Immediately upon being seated, I started to question my regrets. There was a giant dying moth on our sticky table and I understand that it could happen anywhere- it just had me feeling a bit uneasy. There was a very small selection of breakfast choices; yet, 1/3 of the entire menu was Chinese food. The prices of breakfast options were average and we did have a coupon, which was excepted without an issue. My husband and I got the "Diner Two's" meal, which was two pancakes or french toast, two pieces of meat, and two eggs. Ultimately, everything was just OK. Not bad, but really nothing special. The eggs could have used some salt and pepper, the sausage could have been cooked a little more and my husband was unhappy because his french toast did not include cinnamon and powdered sugar as it said on the menu. To give the place some credit, the service and bacon were good.
