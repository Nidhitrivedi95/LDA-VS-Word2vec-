yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I had this place bookmarked since my last trip to Vegas (June 2013) but had never had a chance to try it. With my most recent trip to Vegas being a bit longer of a stay.... finally, I had enough time to make it out to this 24/7 pho joint. I'm glad I did!! 
First off, the Crab Rangoon was so good that I ordered a second order... (don't worry, I was sharing haha). So definitely try that!  
For my main dish, I ordered the beef and flank pho... sooooo delicious! I think I'm getting the hang of how to eat pho! I'm still quite the novice pho eater, so I don't have a bunch to compare to... but the pho I had in Hawaii was on par with this establishment. 
To be honest, this place was a lot bigger than I imagined and a lot nicer, too. For a place thats open 24hrs a day, I figured it'd be a little hole in the wall... but there is ample seating and the ambience is surprisingly a slight step above casual. (Though you can stroll in here casual, dont worry).
