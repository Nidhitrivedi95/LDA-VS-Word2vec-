_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Thank goodness for your congee ^_^

Hubs felt under the weather during our stay at the Venetian so I was searching for jjuk or anything equivalent to slow-cooked rice without leaving the hotel. 

Congee at Noodle Asia? Bingo.

Plus they had kimchi. Best combo when ill. 

Their kimchi wasn't fermented/spoiled like I prefer but it still has the pungent strength to destroy symptoms. Trust. It's good meds w/jjuk (or congee since we're here).

Too, their teapot is generously filled with teabags (plural - yes) so all was in his favor :) MMM hot brewed oolong teabags. I'm a fan.

Nothing wrong with this casual eatery sit-down location next to the Race & Sports Booking area of the Venetian. Being next to it actually kept us visually entertained.
