cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A By far my favorite little hole in the wall in Arizona! When you think of Chinese and Mexican food mixed together, you may doubt it. But please don't! Chino's has nailed it with 5 stars!

Don't be shy to be a newbie at this place, the employees are very friendly! You can also sample the meats if you are unsure on what you want. The prices are great. (last night I spent $35 on dinner for 3 with beers as well)

Did I mention they serve beer?!
Yes that's right. Enjoy this amazing food with a nice cold beer! 

They have tvs so you have something to do while you wait for them to bring the food to your table. It's pretty quick service so you won't wait too long. 
At the end of your meal, don't forget to eat your snicker doodle cookie they give you!

Seriously, come here if you want the best Chinese/Mexican food in town!


*** My Recommendations: 
Jen Ren Pork, Jade Red Chicken, or Emerald Chicken. 
Black refried beans & the chicken fried rice!
