AnooUWnq68nDpMjXf2n4_g We planned our wedding here at La Rosa last July with the help of Patrick.  HE WAS AWESOME.  We are from out of town and Patrick was extremely accomodating and helpful.

Whatever we requested - Patrick will take care of it.  

We had a traditional chinese menu - food was delicious and with generous portions.

La Rosa/ Patrick are not frugal hagglers - very generous and happy with what we paid.  Great staff and service.  

Our big day was exceptionally smooth and Patrick and staff were on hand and foot at all times.
