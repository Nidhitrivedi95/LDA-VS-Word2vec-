Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg This blows our former favorite sushi joint in D.C. out of the water!  

Great fresh and innovative flavors, as well as a really gorgeous room...we shared the Crazy Mad Dragon roll, then dug into some Pad Thai...the portions are really large here.

We used to go to Chinatown to find a REAL Asian flavor, but for the ambiance Rice & Co offers, I think from now on we'll just drive a couple of miles further...it's worth it.

BTW, totally affordable which is REALLY unusual for the Strip!
