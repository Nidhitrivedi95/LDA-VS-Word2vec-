ve7-f5urgRoFvhoez9eUjA I'm a native from Streetsboro so when I found out this place was right under my nose, I had to give it a shot! The service was awesome, and it's family owned so that was definitely a bonus. The food was delicious!!! The portions were generous and the price was right! I'm very impressed to say the least. I highly recommend giving it a try, it's totally worth the foodgasm
