yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA It's always crackin at Pho Kim Long everytime I come here! Usually it's when I'm drunk/after clubs/morning after lol and it never disappoints. Of course pho is the to-go meal for when you're hungover from the shenanigans of Vegas night life, so that will explain the herds of people who are always at this place.

The food itself is bomb. The pho is always good to have, hot and with all the right flavors to cure your bod. The bun bo hue is also not bad. Egg rolls, of course. Can't say much for other foods that are non-soup because I have never tried them. But the pho, you can't go wrong.
