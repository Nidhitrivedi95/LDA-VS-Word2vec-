IHX9FiUyNxxGFgFS5rTOxQ Stopped in for dinner.  I was the only person and the host/waiter was very cordial and helpful.  He said they usually do lunch and deliver for dinner.  Hot and sour soup was ok.  Dark brown broth, pretty thick. Not an over abundance of vegetable or other items.  I had fried spinach as an appetizer.  Its super good.  I have never had it.  It is light and flaky fried spinach sprinkled with sugar and garlic I think.  Made me feel healthy but tasted like candy.  I had General Tao chicken at the waiter insistence.  Large chunks of chicken in a mild spicy / sweet sauce.  It was good, but I would have like some vegetables or pineapple or something to cut the sweet chicken taste.  It was a huge portion and I could only eat half.  Overall ok.  $27.59 plus tip for meal.
