FcYAwxuOys7NtnUPhRkA_Q Very above average Chinese food.  We had the szechuan meal for 2, which is quite a bit of food.  We did this on purpose, as we wanted to try several items since it was our first time.  The fried rice was of much higher quality that I've had before.  The veggies were clearly fresh, a lot had a "snap" or crispness to them.  You could taste the egg and pork in the rice.

The ribs were a winner, although they were messy.  The egg rolls were a bit on the small side, I would want more substance there.  They deliver to our neighborhood, so for future cravings, I won't have to suffer the indignity of leaving my couch.

Excellent, friendly service.  There is a parking lot, but it's small, only a few spaces, and it's a tight fit.  Wish we had more places like this on Water Street.
