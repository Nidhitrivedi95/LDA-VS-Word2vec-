An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg When hunger strikes and I'm in the area, Deer Garden comes to mind; it's on my go-to list. They've got variety, fast service, and good value. What more can you ask for?

Their soups and broths are clear, no hint of MSG. One of my all-time fave choice is their Peanut-Sauce & Chili soup noodle (<U+64D4><U+64D4><U+9EB5>), I always get it here because I can't find a good one anywhere else! Your customized noodles are paired with a drink, HK-style. They also have rice dishes & snacks available. But of course, you'd come here for the noodles.

The restaurant is modern & clean. I've never had any trouble or confusion with the service here. This business knows what it's doing and I respect that.
