Se63tFm5tLlO5wuUlyww8Q The motif and layout of the buffet is deceiving, as it's nicely designed for easy buffet maneuvering. Hot & sour soup was watered down, seafood selection was minimal: clams, squid, FRIED crab legs, and cheesy variations of "seafood". Meat was tough, orange chicken was primarily just batter, and vegetables were cold. To be honest, I enjoyed the fruit and green tea iced cream the most. I paid $11.99 for 2 pieces of watermelon and a scoop of green tea iced cream. This place is not recommended by me.
