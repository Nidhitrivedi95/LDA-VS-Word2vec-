BJW6rCMoWcn8fDFhbMVyEQ Excellent Chinese food in a nice atmosphere. Ate there with friends celebrating a birthday. Everything was fresh and well-seasoned. Had Peking duck wrapped in lettuce for appetizer that was a special and very good. All dishes were beautifully presented. Just all around excellent and not very pricey. At end they presented all of us with blood orang sorbet for my friend's birthday. Staff was friendly and conscientious. Worth a trip if in Scottsdale.
