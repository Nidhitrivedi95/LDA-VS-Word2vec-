9LNs7rIaRngiI57TEfSYiQ Do not go to this restaurant! They're scammers, they should really be shut down. We went in as a group of 4. When it was time to pay, the total was surprisingly high. We thought it was strange, but we looked at the receipt and it added it up. So we paid and even added a 20% tip. Before leaving, I decided to take a second look at the menu, and realized they actually added $1 to each item from the menu prices, and that was the amount on the receipt. I went back to the waitress and asked her about it, and she said the menu prices were wrong and didn't even attempt to fix this! The menu was already over priced as it was, they had the audacity to add $1 to each item thinking we wouldn't notice! I left the restaurant because I didn't want to get into an argument, and told my mom who was waiting outside. My mom was furious, and went back in to get our money back, and this time around, they said their machine is faulty. They are clearly aware of this, and trying to scam their customers! Also the food was awful, most of the skewers weren't even cooked.
