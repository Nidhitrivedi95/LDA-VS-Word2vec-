g1UVmCOhQDY7TGSZ2rRT_w We meant to visit this place since day one arriving to Toronto (GTA) and finally got to drop by on a Saturday night just hours before our scheduled departure.

The place was located in a safe area yet busy looking plaza despite being 11:00PM at night.  From the outside of the glass wall, I could see the place was in full swing of activity which was always a good sign of a restaurant.

We were seated in no time and the assigned server was checking on us regularly waiting to take our orders.  Their prices were good compared to other typical chinese places of the same category, but their portion size is very generous--about twice the size of other places.  Everything was delicious and tasted right.  We were pleased with the food, service, and atmosphere here.  We definitely would come back to this place given the opportunity.

TIPS:  
Order and ask for everthing you may need while the servers are at your table.  Once they move on, it's hard to get their attention again--that is very typical behavior of chinese restaurants in Toronto. 
 
If they place a printed menu + pen/pencil at your table, that usually means that you need to mark down your own order and they will be back to collect and confirm your order.  If you wait too long after marking down the order, just wave at them with your paper order.  That's a universal language of "come and take my order".  If you can speak chinese, that is a plus to get good service.

All the chinese restaurants but one we visited in Toronto only accepted cash and  this seemed to be the trend in Toronto as far as Asian establishment go.  If they can do good business without paying 1-3% to credit card companies, why would they want to change?  So....do yourselves a favor and ask first before siting down.  Yes, cash is still king in Asian community in the 21st century
