AjcOXSV1ECKja4JqY3UIXg Mandarin Buffet was a major part of my childhood...many a gathering with family and friends were held here (and at various other Mandarin locations). 

Now that I'm older, I realize that buffets are not the most high quality selection in the world but this place still holds a special place in my heart.  The selection is unparalleled.  As a child, I held this as the standard to all other buffets and was very dissapointed to find out they did not have a full selection of dim sum, snow crab, carved roast beef, sushi and 20+ flavors of ice cream.

To this day, I have not found another place like this. I love visiting whenever I'm back in Toronto.  It's a piece of my hometown and childhood!
