XEKx5litKe1KkfJpqtmJUw Our family went out for a dinner. We ordered many dishes, and all of them tasted so delicious! My favorite dish was the rice cooked in a clay pot. We got 2 portions from this dish: the soup and the rice. Non of the dishes failed us.
Besides the excellent food, the customer service was brilliant! The servers were super friendly. They happily provided everything that we asked for. Overall, this place has given us a pleasant experience. Definitely recommend, and come back in the future for sure. Love it!!!
