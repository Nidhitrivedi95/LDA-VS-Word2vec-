SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA Delicious, fresh and perfectly cooked. My Kung Pao chicken could've been spicier, but I'll order it extra spicy next time. The veggies were still crisp, the chicken was juicy and tender, and the sauce was very well done. Husband had the Szechuan pork, and he said it was the best he's ever had. We had the lunch specials that came with egg drop soup and an egg roll. The soup was very flavorful, nicely thickened, and broth based rather than some I've had that are more creamy. Now the egg rolls...since we moved to Phoenix I've been severely missing the crispy egg rolls from our old go to Chinese place in Chicagoland, not anymore. This place nails it. The owner told me they hand roll them from scratch everyday, it shows. They were crispy (think spring rolls), not greasy, with a nice veggie filling. They give you a little cup of sweet and sour with a dollop of hot mustard. They are delicious. Everything came out quickly and piping hot, the staff was very friendly and attentive, the restaurant is very clean, and the prices were beyond reasonable. I'm so happy we found our new Chinese place!
