mpG1R1ktTI3x1twNBsGvXQ We have been here 4 times in 3 months and love this place.  The curry & Pat Thai had good flavor and our kids liked the fried rice options.  Sushi was also good.  Great Asian options for a good value in a comfortable sit down environment.  Service was attentive.  I ate at the sushi bar on one of my visits and found the chef to be fun to talk to in addition to preparing great rolls.  We plan to make this a regular place to eat.
