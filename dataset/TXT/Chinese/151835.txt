t_SvwKRaMyNHj2NOMvMv1Q I am really picky about Chinese food and actually had not had Chinese for almost a year when I tried Phoenix Express. So delicious! I have had the pad Thai, sesame chicken, sweet and sour, beef and broccoli and the egg rolls. Everything has always been delicious. I can usually get 2-3 meals out of the lunch portion. The place is clean and everyone is friendly. So happy there is finally a good Chinese food option in Stow.
