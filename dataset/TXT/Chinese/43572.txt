bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug This literally is one of those hole-in-the-wall places that serves up some pretty decent food.  There are definitely some hits and misses here.

Misses:
Cream Corn Seafood Soup - it's a bland soup with a heavy handed helping of corn starch slurry that leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.

Manchurian Beef - both the look and taste of this dish are appalling. It came as a plate of red sauce with chunks of beef in it and it tasted just awful.  We took a few bites and let it be all night.

Hits:
Chicken Pakora - I would come back to this place just to eat this dish.  If you love pakoras this dish will knock your socks off.  It literally tastes like pakoras but with huge chunks of chicken breast that's not hidden under a thick coating of batter. Fried to perfection and tender as ever.  Yum Yum!!

Szechuan fried rice with beef and shrimp - this dish is hot as hell. You don't notice it the first two bites but then it hits you like a ton of bricks.  But no matter how hot it is, I couldn't stop eating it because it tasted really good.

Ok: 
Chili Chicken - it was not too bad but I found the texture of the fried chicken pieces a bit off.  The sauce could have done with a bit of sugar to highlight the chili flavour.
