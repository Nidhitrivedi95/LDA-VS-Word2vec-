szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A I've been to this restaurant many, many times because of their great dim sum, but after today I don't think I ever, ever wants to go back.   I saw a dim sum cart lady drop the sesame seed balls on the floor and pick it up and put it back in the tray, and pretend like nothing happened. She continued pushing her cart while I was looking at her.  When I confronted her, she pretends she doesn't speak English.  What the hack?  Top it off she's completely ignores me and serve the sesame seeds ball to other customers.  I told one of the server looks like a manager, he said he's busy.  Ok, diners you work hard for your money; therefore, you deserve hygienic foods am I right? Great Wall Shame on you!!!
