nMo0ozHO7cqsPaxw_7N6ow Pricy place for just a mediocre dim sum place. There were 3 of us, and I have never eaten $80 worth of dim sum in any other places, not even in NY. Maybe there are not a lot of dim sum places around in this location so they can price whatever they want.  I would not go there again.
