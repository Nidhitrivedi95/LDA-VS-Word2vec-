hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q Second time I've been here. The atmosphere is really cool. It's a very tiny restaurant, but there is outside seating and  the decor is neat. If you have the forethought to make reservations, do so, because there are literally two chairs for guests to sit on while your waiting. Prices are affordable, even alcoholic drinks. Their food is good. I like their orange chicken and fried rice. We waited a really long time for our check to both be delivered to us and then for our waitress to return for it. She was really sweet though so I'm not that upset by it. If you're looking for affordable Asian food, this is the place!
