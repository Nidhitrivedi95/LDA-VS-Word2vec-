U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q This isn't good Chinese food in general.  Beijing No 9 dumpling is just horrible.  No taste in the meat whatsoever.  The soup within the dumpling has no taste either.  I have no idea why they claim it's the best seller.  Maybe people doesn't know what the expectations are, who knows.

The service was okay when we went, so no complaints there.

If you want great Chinese food, this isn't the place or the outrageous pricing.  This place deserves 2.5 stars.
