nztjmkY4LZp18kviHIO7ow Today was my first time at this buffet.  I had been looking for a good Chinese buffet for awhile. Since I am not from the area I didnt know where to look.  A friend recommended China City and it was well worth the trip.  My visit was on a Friday about 1:00. The food was all fresh and they were constantly filling up  the pans.  There is a very large variety of food choices and it was all very well flavored. It even has a sushi bar although I am not a fan of sushi.  I would definately come back here again.  During the week the price was 8.95 and I noticed that weekends it goes up to 12.95, but with the large amount of choices it is not overpriced.  I was pleased with my eating experience here.
