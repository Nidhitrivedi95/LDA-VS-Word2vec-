VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA Honeydew tea is very refreshing!  I love this place because it is so different.  It is authentic.  It is not my usual burger or pizza place...well, mostly because it has neither of those items.  But it does have a great variety of noodle dishes, dumplings (hence the name) and well, other stuff I have not tried.  When I feel adventurous I like to go here.  It is pretty sad that red bean paste is me stepping out of my comfort zone but it is good!

Everything is really clean and efficient as well.  We got our food within 10 minutes and it is all really fresh.  Good prices as well!  4 dumplings was $8 and then 8 wontons, a soup and the tea all added up to be less than $20.  Nom nom nom...
