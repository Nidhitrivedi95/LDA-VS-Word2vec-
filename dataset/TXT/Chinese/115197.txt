Food was good, standard Chinese, nothing to write home about, but it was served hot and fast. I had the shrimp and broccoli with a spring roll, and there was more shrimp than broccoli! That's a first! It wasn't a HUGE lunch portion but it was filling and I took half of it home. Quiet atmosphere, secluded on the side of a shopping center, lots of parking. A good option for Chinese in the area.
