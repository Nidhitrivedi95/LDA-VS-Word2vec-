LbeJgPgKKHw5qH0f02NHEQ I wanted to like it more, I swear.  I thought the mudslide was fabulous.  Sadly, the hot and sour soup, while good, was not spicy enough.  The Mongolian beef looked nothing like Mongolian beef I have ever had.  It was good, but again, not spicy enough.  Additionally, there were no sticks to eat with, no soy sauce or mustard or chili paste on the table.  The food tasted good and was cooked well (plenty of places overcook Chinese food so this is a very good thing), but it wasn't flavorful enough.  I am willing to go back and try it again.  The people were extremely nice.  It was a slow night so the service was a little slow, but helpful and very friendly.
