lxOmS254ZE3NcxPDI3Uv3g I got takeout and from the young lady on the phone to the lady at the cash register everything went really smooth. 
I got back to work and everything was prepared correctly and all the items I ordered were in the bag.
Good sized portions and you could really tell the chef cared about the product he gave to the consumers.
They have both Japanese and Chinese dishes on their menu so I got the hibachi chicken with mushrooms and rice. My friend got chicken tso (spelling?) With fried rice. 
For both of us it was $21 and we got a two liter of Mountain Dew.
I definitely will be going back for sure.
