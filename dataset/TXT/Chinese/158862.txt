U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ This was one of the few places without a line on a Friday night in the Chinatown plaza. One of the owners? was really nice and helpful. One of the dishes we wanted wasn't available, so she said that she would go grab it, it's just in a freezer off site. After we finished the meal, we asked another waitress if it was coming. She told us that they were out of that dish. so I said that the other lady said she would go get it. The waitress responded that the other lady did go get it, but we'd need to wait for it to defrost. Hmmm, I wish they would have said something to us. So we just cancelled the order.

The rest of the food was disappointing. But at least service was quick and there wasn't a line.
