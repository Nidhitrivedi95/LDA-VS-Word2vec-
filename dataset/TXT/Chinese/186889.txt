ydUqgWsF3F27TbauOyib0w Hello friends, 

This place was (only because I moved across town) one out my two favorite spots to go to. It seems before you finish placing your order the food is coming out of the kitchen. This was the main reason I was a fan of Pandas Den (PD). 

The portions are pretty big. The wings WERE big as well but my last visit...well not so much. They wouldn't dare let you drink be 1sip away from full. On my last visit, the corner booth was Rank!!!

Go enjoy,
TTFN
