lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA Food is mediocre. I ordered duck and most of it was hard tough with little meat. My partner had seafood curry which was good a little too much spice. Then I had the mochi ice cream. The rice on the outside was freeze burned and tough.the ice cream in the middle was gritty and tasted like chalk. Don't bother eating here. Prices are way high for bad food.
