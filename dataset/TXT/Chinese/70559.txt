f8R1qFYugdhQRR-ym8SUxg We swung by here to eat b/c my Mom told me they have a buy one get one free steam soup dumpling deal. The price for that is $5.50 for one order. Only allowed one per table (fyi)
- It was soupy, meat was uber tender, and the skin was a bit thick for my liking, BUT, I still enjoyed this.

Got the shrimp steam bun- OK

Fried Dumpling- OK

Pancake w/ Beef- OK

Fried Eel Rice- Not bad.

A. Veggie- Literally in chinese called 'A' choi. Nice veggie, but kind of pricey.

Service type is mind your own business until you need something then they come by. I believe their promo of the steam soup dumping is good still.

I may or may not come back b/c of distance.
