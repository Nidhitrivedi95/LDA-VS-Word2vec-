n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A This was my second visit. The first time I really wanted the Peking duck so the four of us order the fixed price menu. Way to much food for our group. The duck was great but came late in the meal after I'd eaten too much already. The second time there was a hard sell for the the fixed price menu. I knew we could not eat that much and opted to order from the menu. The glazed prawns were fabulous and the gamblers duck was just what I wanted. I will be back.
