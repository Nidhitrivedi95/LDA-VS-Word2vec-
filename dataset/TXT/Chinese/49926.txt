CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I stopped by yesterday for lunch and I'm glad we  found this restaurant.  We ordered chow mein and rice combination which included duck and spinach.  It was absolutely delicious.  

The decor inside is very modern with an oriental vibe of course which was nice :)
Staff was decent although I'd appreciate more smiles from them... it's simple customer service.

However I have no complaints about the food or the price for 2 :D
