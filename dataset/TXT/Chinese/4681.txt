_XmJ3Y-yGxG2BENWBnYWVQ After a second visit I am revising down to 2.25 stars.  They do chicken dishes pretty well but we have been disappointed in other things.  And their spicy is not very spicy.  I added hot oil to my spicy garlic shrimp.  I actually dipped my shrimp into the side of hot oil I requested.  That got 'er done.

I almost requested chopsticks so that I could repeatedly jam them in my ears and stop hearing the brutal Muzak renditions of such songs as "Yesterday" and "I Started a Joke".  My daughter even piped up with, "Dad, this music is really, really bad.  What is it?"
