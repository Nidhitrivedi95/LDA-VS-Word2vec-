ckLk2nQiTGeVgg62JxZGZg Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1630 with my husband. There was no one else in the restaurant yet we were treated poorly. We had asked for water and plates for our food numerous times. When we finally received our 1 plate and 1 fork they were dirty. So I ended up using the small plate the table was set up with. 

We ordered crab corn soup, beef with oyster sauce, shrimp fried rice and spicy squid. They were average however the beef had a lot of salt.

If you can't find another chinese restaurant in the area I suggest just get take out from this place.
