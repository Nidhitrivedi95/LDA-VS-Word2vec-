ZN8EHmoe4Xjy4q4Y8ROEfw New owners, new look. IKEA might have been a little emptier after their spree. It's been a long time since I've been here and was worried a little. Food was still delicious, and even some of the presentation of dishes was pretty instead of just practical. I got the bun with shrimp and pork. I've grown since my first review. So good. No diakon or chili flakes in the fish sauce but still good. Good ratio of meat and noodle and yummy veg. The BF got the pho filet which was good too. He didn't even finish. We shared the spring rolls and imperial rolls. Very good stuff. The place was empty mostly so some parts of the service could've been better, like asking for more water and later asking for a box. Not a deal breaker though. The two guys there were super nice and the food was delicious. Now open until 9. Woo hoo!
