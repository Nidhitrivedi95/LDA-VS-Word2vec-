8MXjK1lhVRhU3yGCUv9qsA I had two buns - pork belly and pulled pork. They were tasty, fresh, light and fast so I'm pretty happy. The price is a bit on the high side but for getting all of the above right, it's reasonable.

The location is a bit hard to find if you just go by google maps - it took me a minute to work out that it was deep inside a mall food court (maybe there is a more direct entrance).
