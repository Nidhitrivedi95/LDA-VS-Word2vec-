WbQOuI7mVST8XrJotWq9fA A truly unfortunate name for a restaurant. I still can't order the egg white soup here. 
You get what you pay for... but still not the worse in Chinatown.
Very reasonable compared to the rest of the over inflated prices of other restaurants. 
A great place for sad, lonely people who don't want to be seen eating by themselves.
