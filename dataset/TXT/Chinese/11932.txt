2meb5cwKh125tF5IwUiIJA Harmony my %^$!!!!!  Ok ok ok...this place definitely has some good quality egg tarts and other treats;  but the saleslady/owner is a jerk.  We came there when our dollar was only worth 98 cents canadian.  So we bought a few things to munch on, and it came out to $12 CANADIAN.  We, being stupid, arrogant American tourists, didn't have Canadians and decided to pay in US dollars.  As soon as the lady heard that, she told us because of the exchange rate, the price is $14 in US money.  Ok....I KNOW she knows how to calculate money, but I offered my help in math anyway.  " it's actually only $12.24 in US money" I said with a smile.  She countered with a smile also, but a bit more annoyed "no it's $14 in US, if you don't want to pay in US money, maybe you should go to a bank and exchange and come back here with Canadian money.  I traveled to the US when our Canadian money was much lowered than your american money.  So now it's all good for us that you come here when our money is much better.  It's like SWEET revenge."  WHOA..... I didn't expect all that on a Sunday morning.  I realized my disadvantaged of being an American surrounded by Canadians, who just came out from churches and hungry (did I mention they have ridiculously beautiful churches?), so I just shut my mouth, paid $14 and got the hell out of there.  I thought Canadians were supposed to be nice...oh wait... there WAS that horrible Canadian riot when our Bruins came to Canada not so long ago....
     Damn Canadians!!!!  Wait until our currency picks up again...you'll see!!!
