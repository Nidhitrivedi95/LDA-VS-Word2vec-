The food is your typical American style Chinese buffet spread. You have egg rolls, cream cheese wontons, chow mien, rice, BBQ pork, chicken on a stick, clams, broccoli chicken, Kung pow chicken, etc. There is a grill for you to make your own food. 

To me the food was lousy. Everything was really sweet. Too sweet to my tastes. But for the price and the amount it just filled me up. I couldn't find anything spicy or flavorful. So I guess it's perfect for bland tastes.
