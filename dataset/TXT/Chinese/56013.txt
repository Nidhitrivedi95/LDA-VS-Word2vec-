cykzJbkgweJvZsvkrHMR7g In the restaurant, there were two other tables occupied with 2 ppl each. My server came over to take my order, however I needed a little time since this was my first visit. During this time, 1 of the 2 tables emptied and I'm still waiting to place my order. I ordered hot tea and grilled chicken with rice noodles. I waited, and waited, and waited. Almost drank the whole pot of tea. Finally went to the counter and told them I wanted my order to go. I glanced back in the kitchen and there were two people (1 older female and male) besides my waiter. The lady who seemed to be doing most of the cooking was not wearing gloves and she plated someones food with her bare hands and then wiped her hands on her clothes. No one in the kitchen wore and apron, nor did I see hand or paper towels.  So that's another I will check off my list. My chicken wasn't half bad. Would just prefer more sanitary conditions.
