hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA I love going out to eat when it is just my wife and myself going. For the past few months we have gone almost weekly. Just the two of us. Today she and I were running a few errands and since she was driving, decided she wanted to eat at an Asian buffet for lunch.

We knew of the place Krazy Buffet on Sahara Avenue in Western Las Vegas and had been there before. So there we went.

I am still trying to figure out the "Krazy" part. Is the "Krazy" part the blatant mispelling of the word crazy in the name?  

The food was average at best. The servers brought us drinks, and cleared plates from the table but beyond that, nothing. Cost wise the bill for the two of us was between 22 and 23 dollars. Not bad at all considering we are in Las Vegas and buffets liter the city.

But even the fortune in my cookie was boring, "You are interested in public service and would make an outstanding statesmen." Oh really? 

Sorry, just another buffet in Las Vegas, nothing crazy or even "krazy" here.
