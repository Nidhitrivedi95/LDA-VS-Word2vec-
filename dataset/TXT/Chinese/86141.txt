HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA We got the pork belly and duck baos. They tasted good however I would not return because the wait for the food was so long! The wait staff are not organized. The waiters kept bringing over food that we didn't order. We corrected them and they still charged us for it. When we tried to correct it with the cashier and she had the audacity to just say "well some one must have ordered it because the waiter wouldn't just write it down". Service left much to be desired. 
Food not outstanding enough for me to return. I'll take my business elsewhere.
