xEIqG7Rq8ydAT9LxCVBOOg To start on a positive, the prices are great! The service is fantastic.  However, the sushi is mediocre. I would compare it to what you can get at the grocery store. So if you aren't a sushi snob, this place is worth heading to. If you are, come anyway but order something else.
