ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg Rather disappointing! Had scallop and tiger shrimp congee very bland. No seafood flavor whatsoever. And my friend stir fry noodle with beef was even worse. The beef is tender no texture and taste like cardboard. Instead of stir frying the noodle is piled up underneath the lousy sauce. It was overall an awful dining experience.
