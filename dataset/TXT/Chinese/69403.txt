eZQbDYQTZk0_cBroVxnPWg Siu Wok, Siu Wok, Siu Wok...how you disappoint me. I've been going to Siu Wok for quite a long time. The previous location was exceptional. Prices were decent. Clean dining area. Occasionally I'd be stuck with the lazy cashier/waitress but I reveled in the food so I stayed. Then they make this jump to the new place.
 Upon entering,  you are hit with a barrage of white walls that appear to have never been cleaned, I'm with company. We wait to be seated. The waitress sat us at a filthy table.  Oh yeah, greetings are non-existent here.The seats look like they've never been cleaned. Thus my irritation began. The waitress "forgot" us. We simply got up from our table to leave. I'll spend my money elsewhere. Staff need to watch that Seattle fish training video almost every employer makes you watch. You know, the one where employees act like they give a damn about something. I shall never return.
