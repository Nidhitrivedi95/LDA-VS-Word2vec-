yKuAM6kL5sSKtfoe9a3GpQ Hot Pot was average. Started off by choosing soup base (some are free while others cost extra). I got half satay (nice flavour) and tom yum (not spicy at all but sour). Filled out their little sheet of paper with the cooking ingredients and it came out promptly. Each order was given in small portions which is good and bad at the same time as it limits you from ordering too much when your eyes are bigger than your tummy but also bad because if you wanted more, you'd have to order again with a new sheet of paper. They don't allow you to write down how many servings you want but you're enforced to circle what you want and each order comes out as ONE serving - very tedious. The list of things you can order is typically limited with beef, lamb, chicken, pork, various balls, veggies and noodles - if menu is limited, I would have expected the quality to be higher. 
Food was so-so and price was unusually more expensive than other places for lunch at $17 per person. I've tried a few hot pot places around and there are definitely others that give you a bang for your buck with superior quality.
