X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg So I Always Go To Las Vegas For EDC Weekend But Do Not Attend The Festival, I Prefer The Clubs And Day Parties. Hakkasan Is Known Nation Wide And Has Become Popular. So June 2014 There Was An Event With AfroJack At Main Room I Paid $75 Entrance & Was On The Guestlist, It's Horrible How Hakkasan Does Not Associate With The Hotel If You Are Staying There. Either Way Got There At 10:30 & It Was Already Packed & AfroJack Wasn't Even There!! It Was Over Packed Or Should I Say A Fire Hazard Pretty Sure It Was Way Over Capacity, People Were Shoving. For The Biggest Club In Vegas At 80,000 sq ft the DanceFloor Is Small. A Bouncer Pushed My Girl But I Kept My Cool Didn't Want To Get Kicked Out! But Then There Was This Specific Group Of People Who Kept Going In And Out Of The Dance Floor And Kept Cutting In Between My Group I Was Getting Tired Of It So I Told Them To Go Around They Weren't Understanding So When This Dude Try To Cut In My Dancing Circle I Pushed Him Back & Redirected For Him To Go Around Us. If Your Not Doing Bottle Service You Should Down Your Drinks At The Bar!! Not Take Them To The Dance Floor & If You Are Hold Them Tight! This Girl Spilled Her Adios Mf All Over Us She Was Beyond Faded & I Had Enough! I Left The Dance Floor & Started Standing Around Waiting, I Had Enough Of People Shoulder To Shoulder And Shoving That We Just Went To The Ling Ling Room! If Your Not Popping Bottles I Don't Suggest This Club. All That Was Appealing Was Sound System & Lasers. Bouncers DGAF They Got No Respect, It's A FireHazard They Accept Way To Many Ppl. & You Have Savages On People's Booths Trying To See The Dj. Line-Ups Are Good Just The People That Attend Think This Is A Block Party. I Lived In Miami All My Life & Never Experience Something Like That
