qm7diuwiwwCWdL5V9s9hsA $50 worth of food for two and we weren't full after. Friendly staff however this is not a place you go to have dinner because you won't be full. The potato skew was a waste of money as it either get burn or doesn't cook all the way. The lamp skew is worth a try. The hotpot would be okay for one person, not the best but it's pretty decent.
