1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I was here two years ago and the food was good. The service was higher than Asia restaurants standard. Lol ! At the last two years, I have referred many friends, families and the people I know to them! Come here for dinner after my last visit two years ago and I guess thing does change after time! The parking lot is very busy. Very hard to find a parking 6 o'clock at the evening. This should be a good sign. Finally found a parking spot just in front of the restaurant. The first thing I saw is they have one table with two customer eating only. All the cars in the parking lot is for the other restaurants in the same parking lot! I normally knew this is no good! But because the good experience two years ago. I still designed to eat here. Big mistake! The service is bad! Very bad! The waiter (I think he is the owner) is very rude. When he come to my table to take the order. He want the numbers only. So I needs to look for the numbers on the menu. Instead wait for a second, he just walk away and not come back for a long time. I should be leave at this point. But because the foods was good two years ago. I convinced myself he is just too busy. Okay, we order a congee and a beef tender noodle. This is the worst foods I have in Vegas! The congee is look like mixing rice and water, no favors at all! The noodle is also so bad, the noodle is so soft, the soup is tasty like water. The beef is boiling by water. Time is very changing this at one time one of the best restaurant in Vegas for me. I will not come back or referring any business to them anymore!
