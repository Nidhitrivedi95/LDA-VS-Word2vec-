6XLvkFrnu0FJIw6i-7wPXw A favorite after-school place for Asian (and non-Asian) university undergraduate students at McGill.

They have rather good boba here. I didn't have the chance to have any of their food, but according to the group I was with (who frequents Cactus often, apparently), it's rather good as well. It's a very typical Chinese/Taiwanese(?)-run boba shop, with games, magazines, cards, a TV playing music videos.. Free Wi-Fi, and a great atmosphere just to hang out with a group, study, or talk with a friend.

Rating is subject to change once I actually taste their food. Good boba, but not enough to make me come back constantly, yet.
