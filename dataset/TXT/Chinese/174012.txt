WARNING: Anticipate angry tourists pushing each other as they hunt for low quality Chinese food. These tourists will FIGHT to grab chow mein, fried rice, and orange chicken that accumulate to a massive plate of grease.

ADVICE: Add diversity to your menu. Since the majority of customers are tourists, your menu should accommodate their inability to consume a dish that derives from only 1 ethnic culture. As a "buffet," the Chef should serve a variety of meals to eat (e.g. American, Italian, Mediterranean) instead of serving only Chinese food. After all, the Las Vegas Buffet is a buffet, hence the name.
