QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw Good place to have some togo food or just sit and do some hot pot. It is fun to eat in winter, not so much during summer season. The owner is 100% from Beijing and I enjoyed talking with him whenever I was there. Food quality has been trending down since grand opening, which is typical but also unfortunate. I have not been there for about 4 months now, so a revisit would help me get updates on this review.
