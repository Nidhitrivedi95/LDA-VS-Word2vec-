cxVp-a28Cp7lavjaPMvK5w I was at SocialHouse last night with 7 of my girlfriends for a bachelorette party. Our server, Sarah, was absolutely incredible. She was extremely attentive, lovely, great personality and was knowledgeable on every question we asked about the drinks, food items, and even some of the ingredients. We never were without water, always had our drinks replenished before they were empty & gave us appropriate suggestions. She's the epitome of an excellent server. Out of the 8 girls in the group last night, all of us have been or are still servers, so we know a good one when we see it! The food was amazing, beautiful and I don't think anyone had one single complaint about anything. I will absolutely return and have another meal here. The setting and atmosphere was lovely. Thank you for the fantastic service, drinks and food!!
