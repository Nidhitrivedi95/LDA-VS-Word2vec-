68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw This wonderful family owned and operated was so GREAT that we tried to eat there 3 times during our Weekend in Las Vegas. The FOOD and Service were spectacular, yet the prices were inexpensive. We tried the Chicken dinner, the fried chicken Bao, the wings, the  cooked
 organic eggs, the salad, the iced tea, and the wings. EVERYTHING was delicious. I especially enjoyed the BAO. They are closed on Sunday( DARN it), so we tried their other restaurant, FAT CHOY, in the EUREKA Casino @ 6th and Sahara. IT too was outstanding. We look forward to visiting Vegas soon and eating at Jenny and Sheridan's  Incredible restaurant.
