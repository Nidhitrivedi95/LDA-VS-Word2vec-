LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA Flo's is more of a Chinese/Thai hybrid than straight Chinese food.  But it was fantastic regardless of what I was looking for.  Loved the atmosphere and happy hour drinks!  In my party we had the Chicken Lo Mein, Katsu Chicken, and Teryaki Chicken.  All were outstanding.  The pot stickers and fried spring rolls were excellent as well. It was a little loud at times but that worked well for us as our party was equally loud.  Definitely recommended!
