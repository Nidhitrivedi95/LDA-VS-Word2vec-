ZZF5iqlKFBWJSGSZzWHMzA Went to visit after work and caught the 5-7 PM special. Ordered a few things on the menu to share. Overall, everything was just okay. It felt like they were going for the fusion but didn't quite hit the right balance. The two things that are worth trying are the  Nachos Koreano and the limade. The menu selection was quite small and a lot of the items were deep fried and quite heavy. Not many lighter options to balance out the heavy items. Wouldn't say it was a bad dining experience but we will probably not be going back. Would rather just stick with Banh Mi Boys.
