I cannot say for sure, bu I am sure the three people there are there all day and night.   While English is a t a premium their food is so very tasty.    We go there all the time and get a bunch of not that much.    Just try the buns off the menu (there are English translations to describe ingredients), and I've found all the flavors very good.   Of course, do not leave without getting some red bean buns to take on the road.
