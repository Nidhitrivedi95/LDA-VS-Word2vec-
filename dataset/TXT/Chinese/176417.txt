WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg If you're looking for a quick and cheap lunch/snack and you are downtown, try the Lanai Express in the Fremont.  It's served cafeteria style so you can see the food before you buy.  They have good turnaround so the food is fresh.  The prices are cheap.  Seating is good.  I love getting the spam masubi there.  They make it ahead of time and nuke it in the micro but it works.  The spam and rice come out with good consistency.
