rca1HN4qRsZfmpxmlFWNDQ I am aware of this place for the past 10 years. I rarely bought stuff here... the displayed cooked dishes looked ordinary.

I went for BBQ pork today. I asked the butcher for one pound of meat. I asked her to pick the lean meat from the stacks.

She made a bad mistake and not shy about it. Even though she has picked a piece already more than 1 lb, she sneaked in another leftover piece and charged me accordingly. Finally tally was 1.33 lbs.

I have seen butchers picked meat to make over the requested weight, but they never added more on purpose.

By the way, the cut of meat is fatty even though I asked for lean meat. I believe all the meats were fat to start with.

So shoppers, this is a dishonest behavior. If it can happen to me, it will happen to you too. Heed my warning. BEWARE!!!!!
