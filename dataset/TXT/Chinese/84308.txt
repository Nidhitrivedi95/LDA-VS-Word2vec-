HgL6gGEGoAUBKGrT6BXU4Q I love this place!! It has excellent food quality, atmosphere, and customer service. We ordered the jackpot chicken, rice for 2, baked mussels, winter melon soup, deep fried chicken skin and the coconut rum drink. Everything was great. My favourite was actually rice which was very aromatic, light and fluffy - the seasoning was fantastic as well. It's probably even better than some highly recommended places in Singapore I've tried. My only dislike is the fried chicken skin tastes like it's old ans definitely was not fresh. 
Laura, our waitress was so welcoming and friendly! 
Their coconut rum drink is served in an actual coconut and so refreshing and light! Never thought coconut and rum would taste so good!
In terms of atmosphere, it was very hipster and modern with great music! The lighting was a big dark for my liking but it was manageable. 
Overall, I would highly recommend coming!
