oWWLfYxmUpahdF-5FexnpA I love lamb on a stick and this restaurant is my go-to place for this. They have a wide variety of northern style Chinese dishes. I've been here a number of times and every tasted good, albeit on the spicy side. What really stood out was the punch they packed in their lamb skewers. They pack a power punch of spice and flavor, and you can't do better anywhere else in Mississauga.
