HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I went here w/ some friends for a social lunch thing we have been doing for a couple weeks. The lunch menu is pretty short but dont let that fool you. We all had something different and each dish look good, so theres plenty to chose from. 

I personally chose the Cheesesteak Sandwich, it had Shortribs, bell peppers and onions, and melted Provolone cheese. I chose this after another in our group selected my initial choice, the Grilled Cheese sandwich (both were incredible for the record, but the grilled cheese had shortrib too, just chopped I believe, I know what Im getting next time!!) there was also a bowl if noodles that I forget the name if but it was also delicious and had a bit of a kick to it, overall the experience was good, the service was good, and the food was better. Def worth a visit or a return visit.
