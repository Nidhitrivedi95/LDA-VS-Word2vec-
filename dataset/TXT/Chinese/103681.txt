Km0sT7E_dc2U1BkyRoy1xA Service was very rough! It took 40 minutes for our apps and 45 minutes for the entrees. They overcharged us for the beer and tried to tell us it was because we ordered drafts vs bottle. It did not state that in the menu. When we complained the manager came out with no apology. We had to find someone to get our check. This place is on the list.
