4kkh8Uj0jG7olKEocCASrQ The place seems really ghetto but surprisingly the food is better than the looks. You would find good skewers here, but definitely not the best. Opens to really late, so if you want a good midnight snack this may be a good place to go for skewers and beer. The menu is very detailed with good pictures, but the service so not that great. Although you get what you ask for, just don't expect too much for the waiters there.
