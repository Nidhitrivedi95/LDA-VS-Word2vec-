Q_Iia5C2quTUVfE5_8jObw I was once told that if you are looking to find an authentic Chinese restaurant, find out the number of Asians dining at the restaurant. Going by that standard, this one for sure looks like a genuine one. But you'll find more than just Asians here. I love the fact that this restaurant is open till late hours (1.30 am) on certain days. My wife and I watch a late night movie and then stop by this place. We always ask for a "Chicken Shrimp" fried rice as our order and they accommodate the ask. The dishes are good and the service is very prompt. The folks are efficient (believe in delivering fast than having a small chat) and also cater to take outs. The washrooms are clean. Overall, it's a good value for money place.
