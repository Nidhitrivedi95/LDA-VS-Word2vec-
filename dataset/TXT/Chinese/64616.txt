E8ugJa02FVCgfnjqV817iw If you are thinking of stopping there you better keep driving to the other side of India School to Da Vang. If you want Bad food, Bad service and an incorrect order well this is your place. It was take out, or I would of walked out of the restaurant. Lets start  unfriendly, no cutomer service skills very abrupt  I did not know the worst was to come. Food the worst Pho Soup I ever had .As I opened up the container it was 3/4 and a disgusting layer of grease floating on top there was enough that you could measure it. So in good faith I tried to soak up the grease with napkins.  Less than half a container later I made that second attempt but all I tasted was grease.  That order was out. The order of fried egg roles should come with mint, lettuce and parsley. NO mint. I requested an extra fish sauce for fresh spring rolls (which were rubbery by the way) in addition to the peanut sauce. So when I opened the fresh rolls fish sauce no peanut sauce. I asked for extra sprouts,well I am sure you can figure out the answer no did not get them. In short as I retreated the beginning keep on driving Da Vang is north on Indian School on the west side of the street

I have almost never have establishment a worse rating
