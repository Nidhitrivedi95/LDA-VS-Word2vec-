XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA There's a man pulling noodles right at the front and putting them straight into the huge vat of boiling water, so you are guaranteed to have the freshest noodles. It was busy when I went today and a good sign are the Asian aunties eating there. 

They have different styles of noodles, all written in Chinese and pinyin and you have to ask the server to describe them which is difficult. May be beneficial if they added photos. Their menu is simple, serving just noodles with small side dishes. 

Ordered a small ($9 with tax) for take-out and it's a lot of food! They give you thin slices of daikon and beef (if you love tendon, you'll love this). Was also given a huge container of broth and I only needed half. Broth-wise, I had expected it to be saturated with beef flavour but not at all. Quite bland with other seasoning.

Staff was very courteous.

Would come back.
