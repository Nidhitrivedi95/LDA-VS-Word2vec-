Overall ambience - The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. It is a very trendy and hippie place. 

Food - I had tonkotsu ramen and it definitely has the umami taste to it. The broth is very rich but sadly not as flavorful as I expected. The umami flavor was the main and almost only flavor to the ramen.
