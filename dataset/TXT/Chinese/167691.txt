Plenty of parking and very nice outside. when entering you get very cramped up when it's busy. anyways we were greeted by the front desk, but in a rude manner. Next the waitress at our table began to be rude to me and my family, making it seem like she didn't want to serve us..... so we minded our own business, however the waitress herself started gossiping about us to coworkers and I guarantee you I saw her. 

the food is decent and it will get the job done for lunch, but have had better experiences at a Chinese restaurant. idk about dinner. don't try they're egg wonton soup, it's not as good as others. Also, back to customer service they also try to rush you, so take your time. Most of the time they were rude and made this experience bad for me. I'm not sure if I would go back because of the poor and rude service they gave to us. If that doesn't mind you, then go get lunch ! because it's cheaper than dinner!
