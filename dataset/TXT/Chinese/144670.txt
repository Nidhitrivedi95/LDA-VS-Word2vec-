RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ The place looks a little jenky (as most hole-in-the wall places do) but my drink was pretty darn good. I wish I had had more stomach space and time to try more of the food but for the little bit I had it was A-OK. Would have given the place a 4 for the drink but the food brought it down a bit.

VENUE: Typical Taiwanese cafe vibe. Very casual. Good for a quick grabbing of a beverage to quench your thirst.

FOOD/DRINK:  Ordered the PASSIONATE TEMPTATION. Delicious! It had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Eventhough they make their drinks with syrup, there were passionate fruit seeds in my drink! Loved it. Maybe they use real juice for that. I'm not sure. I wasn't crazy about the tapioca boba as they weren't that sweet/flavorful. But they were chewy and were not hard so that's always nice.

My friends and I split the GREEN ONION PANCAKE. I don't know if I'm just spoiled and have had sensational Taiwanese food, but this wasn't all that great for me. I feel like this dish should be jam packed with green onions. Instead it was mostly thinly friend batter and a slightly too greasy for my liking. Maybe we just got a poorly made one but either way that kind of made me sad. The taste was okay and I appreciate that they serve it with soy saucy sauce and chili sauce.

SERVICE: Our server was very kind and friendly. He did his best to put up with our loud group of gigglers and I appreciate that.
