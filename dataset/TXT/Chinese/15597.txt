3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug Needed a place to take out of town visitors for a special dinner.   Based on Yelp and Chowhound reviews, decided on Omei.   Had the Lobster 5 ways, yellow-fin grouper 4 ways, a geoduck sashimi dish, plus S&S pork.  Some of the Lobster dishes were excellent as was the fish soup.  Some of the other dishes just OK and the S&S pork was mediocre.  Service was friendly, but spotty.  Seating was crowded and uncomfortable.  Price was just over $50 per person tax & tips incl which was expected and reasonable.  Glad we went, and would return but overall was not blown away.
