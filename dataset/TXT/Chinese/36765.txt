AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw We tried Chop and Wok for the first time on a Wednesday night.  It does have a dive bar sort of atmosphere but it was fun and lively.  Every employee we encountered was very friendly and a pleasure to deal with; they truly make you feel welcome.  That said the food was at best average.   We had two appetizers, the fried won tons (OK, but cooked to extra-extra-crispy) and jalapeno puffs that were good with a little kick.   Two of us had Chicken Kung Pao that had plenty of vegetables but was over saucy and blah, it needed more heat.   Another companion had Mongolian Beef that was really tough and hard to eat.  Over-all I hope things go well there, a good neighborhood feel.   I probably would explore other area options before going back.
