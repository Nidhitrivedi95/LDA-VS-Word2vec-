Not knowing what to order, we chose the 2 set of $4.99 lunch special: Szechuan Beef and BBQ Chicken. The food arrived quickly and tasted good, above our expectation. The portions were big and they also came together with milk tea + soup.

We went again the next day for afternoon tea (2pm to 5pm), and got the $4.25 set. Very good deal, as it included a glass of dessert (red bean+ice cream+coconut).

Overall impression: Quick service, varieties (korean, chinese, hk, ramen), value-for-money.

We didn't try the dinner hot pot. That's said, we're very satisfied with their lunch and afternoon tea sets.
