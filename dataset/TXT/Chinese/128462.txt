PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Read abouth the good reviews about this new dimsum place in town. And they were right we like almost all weve ordered like chicken feet, fish ball, pork siomai, congee, hongkong style fried noodle, pork bun, sesame ball. Also they have new item in the menu pork sung bun which is good too. Roti and taro cake is fine but not a fan of it maybe because we are not used eating these.
Good customer service, big space, parking lot is ok too. Will definitely be back!
