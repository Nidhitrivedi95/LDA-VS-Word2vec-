AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw First time at this location as I've always gone to the one at steeles. I mostly just order the chicken wing special $16.99 for 20 wings and fries. Hong kong style wings are the best! There are other specials after 1pm as well.

Their beef fried rice noodle is delicious! $7-8 And their chicken Portuguese rice is creamy and tasty. $7-8 Would definitely have both again. 

Service is a bit slow as the venue is bigger now but nonetheless same service of food. 

They charged us 50¢ for 2 takeout boxes which was lame. 

The place does take credit cards.

Went back again for breakfast. They have all day brekky Asian style -- soup based with eggs/ham on the side. $5.99 brother got the satay beef noodle and said it was tasty and pretty good. Comes with some bread but eat it quick while its warm cuz it'll become rock hard after (microwaved obvi)

I ordered the twins -- no idea why its called that. Basically pork cutlet with BBQ pork, rice, sunny side up egg, veggies, cream corn soup and coffee/tea $7.99 you can get other options too. Pork was dry but at least it wasn't oily? Definitely slather the ketchup on. Corn cream soup was delicious!
