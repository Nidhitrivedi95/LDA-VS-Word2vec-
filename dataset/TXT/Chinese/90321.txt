I tried this place on a Friday afternoon when it was quite empty so everything was served very fast. The staff is very friendly and gives diverse recommendation. The place looks clean and nice. There is a small bar where you can get 3 different types of drinks, approx 15 types of sauces, napkins, etc etc yourself. I don't mind getting up and getting my own things, but if you think it's your server's job to bring you everything, you might not like that. 
As for the food, it was not outstanding or amazing, it's rather ordinary. Nothing bad to say about it, it's just that I wasn't blown off by it. The food selection was average. I've seen a lot more diverse options at other hot pot places but it's good enough for me. 
One thing that I thought was unique about this place is that you have 4 different broths - at an extra charge though. 
Also... They don't really come reduce the heat when the water is boiling or come to pour some extra soup. I thought all hot pot places do that.
Desert (ice cream) was served free. 
One thing to take a note of is that 10% tip is included in the bill. I'm assuming they included that because people around this area don't tip enough... Personally I don't really appreciate pre-included tips. Their service was good overall and I think they definitely deserved more than 10%, but if that's what they think they deserve, alright. 
All in all, it was a good restaurant, just not amazing. I'm not a big all-you-can-eat lover so I probably won't be going back much, but it's definitely one of the nicer hot pot restaurants I've been to.
