773ovbZW7HvfaNy5laUznQ We go at least once a month and travel over 30 minutes just to go here. Susan the server is absolutely our favorite. The sushi is top notch quality compared to many Charlotte Restaurants. Every appetizer we have tried has been fantastic. I love that there is a small restaurant in this area that is producing some amazing quality cuisine!

Highly recommended!
