zfUQa2aPEoPjWLkvCfDhtg I've ordered from here a lot. The most recent time I noticed my portion of noodles was a lot smaller than usual - about 60% what it usually is! I called the restaurant and they said portion sizes have gone down due to their costs. They were unwilling to do anything for me despite being a frequent customer. Also, the guy who delivers is super sullen and once got pissed off at me for ordering via JustEat. I'll take my money elsewhere from now on.
