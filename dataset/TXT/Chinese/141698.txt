rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g This is the type of place that you probably wouldn't venture into unless someone recommended it. I'm from New York...and this is my "go to" Chinese restaurant. It's authentic NY-style chinese food. Cheap. Clean. And delicious! (The decor is plain - but who cares...) Fo'gettabout the chain restaurants and go here.
