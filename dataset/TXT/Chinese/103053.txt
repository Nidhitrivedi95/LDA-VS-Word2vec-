KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw Great price for great food! We're from Ncal and looked for a place similar to China Paradise back home and found it. This is as close as we're gonna get and let's face it Vegas does not have good Chinese food. Give it a try. The owner is a really a nice guy if you can just have some patience and also be friendly, you'll see it :). He's a Fremont native, and his food is fresh and good flavpr, give it a try! Typically we eat shrimp tempura at a Japanese restaurant but try it here, it's just as good! Tempura batter on point! I just tried this place and went back again!
