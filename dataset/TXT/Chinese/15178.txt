The Dandan noodle was not very authentic, but tasted OK.
The plain noodle was surprisingly good especially you wanted something simple after several days of heavy buffets.

The self choose malatang was the best and I noticed almost every table getting that. The price was well set. You could probably get one person's portion with $10. There were choices with no spicy and 5 spicy level. I got 3 which was quite good but I wish it had less oil.
I also wish there could be more options to choose from.

Two complains:
1. The restroom was very very dark!
2. The malatang was $10 minimum, and I got less than $10 but they should have reminded me or asked me whether I would like to choose more food to make it over $10.
