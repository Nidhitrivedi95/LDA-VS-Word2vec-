4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A I'm not a huge hot pot fan so I rarely go out for it. However, my friend's mom graciously treated a few of us to dinner and we decided on this restaurant.

We came here on a Saturday night and it was quite hard to find parking. I would also recommend making reservations because it can get quite busy. There was the seven of us so we got a large table. There were 3 pots in total and each pot had a divider so each pot can hold two different soup base. I chose the satay soup base and I can just handle the spice level.

There's quite a lot to choose from to cook. One of the more interesting item on the menu was the pig's fallopian tube...I have to say, I quite enjoyed it! My friend, Alex Y., ordered a seasonal vegetable (not sure of the Chinese or English name) and it had a very unique taste to it (just another example of their large selection).

The reason why I'm giving this restaurant four star instead of five is because they never give us exactly what we ordered. Also, I'm slightly disappointed that they don't have dessert. After this experience,I think I'm starting to enjoy hot pot!
