9ad0-8h-DRUheY9dF9rYjQ My family and I came here for dinner yesterday to try out their food and take advantage of their 20% off discount. The restaurant got quite busy soon after we arrived. Maybe it looked like there were a lot of customers because the restaurant is really small.

We all ordered various dishes, such as: the bun bo hue, pho, and vermicelli with fish sauce and assorted meats. I ordered my bun bo hue without the spice and they were able to cater it just to my liking. I prefer to put in the spice in by myself so they gave me some on the side. It was quite good and I would order it again the next time I'm here. My boyfriend and sister both had their pho and said they enjoyed it. They also said it tastes similar to other pho restaurants. My parents also enjoyed their vermicelli.

The restaurant was quite hot because the sun was shining directly into the restaurant. It made us all very hot and sweaty while eating which wasn't very enjoyable. But that's not the restaurants fault.
