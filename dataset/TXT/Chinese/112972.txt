MKviRVX2QxRgGS6juCEeYg I love this place. It's not a place for huge groups, but a small party of 4 would find a good fit here. The dishes run smaller than other chinese restaurants but they have more specialty dishes. Also, they have really good prices. $1 soup, $6.99 lobster after $20 spending.. 

I especially like their fish soup veggie bowls as well as the Fried Sliced Chicken with Pepper. 

The only negative thing I'd say is that the service isn't the best and there's always a wait. But for this price, it's worth the wait.

P.S. they're open till really late at night too!
