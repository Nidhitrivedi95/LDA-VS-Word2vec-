7Nz4kTghhicjsR23GYMlLg Excellent food. Rice was fluffy not sticky. General Tsos was moist, crunchy and tender. No old grease or msg. The vegetable fried rice was packed with crisp veggies. The crab ragoon, spring roll and egg roll were all fabulous. The icing on the cake was the superior service and ordering support.  So happy to find this place in the neighborhood... I only hope they learn to make Wor Su Gai. Can't find it anywhere in Charlotte.
