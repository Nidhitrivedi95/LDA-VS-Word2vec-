Upon closer examination, you will see torches, patio furniture, and diners enjoying delicious cuisine and beverages.

We started our evening with saketinis (the Lychee was especially delicious) at the sleek bar inside the small restaurant. After a brief wait for a table (there is limited seating, but without reservations on a Saturday night, we waited less than 15 minutes) we were seated on the patio where we enjoyed the lighted torches and wooden bench seating.

Umami offers a variety of salad options, featuring such ingredients as mushrooms, walnuts, cranberries, and fresh arugula. The Ramen options include meat as well as a vegetarian option. I had the miso ramen, which was rich and flavorful with green onions, thick broth, and slices of chicken. I didn't save room for dessert, but I'll definitely be back to Umami to try their selections on another occassion.

The food and drinks were delicious, and the ambience was unlike any other restaurant I've been to in Madison - understated, classy decor; spot-on service; and an overall upbeat, fun vibe.
