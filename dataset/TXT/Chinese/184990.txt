xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw I've been here a few times and I could never make my dish good. Recently though, it finally came out well and I've been returning ever since! We were waiting for our movie to start and decided to get a few drinks. Customer service has always been good to me. We ended up just getting some drinks, saki, and pot stickers. You can't go wrong with their happy hour its really not that bad. I can definitely see myself coming back here!
