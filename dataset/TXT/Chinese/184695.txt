xVP6vpI-LGJ4Y61gIb4LQA I have ordered from here a few times already. The beef lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, and rice is good.
I would give it 5 stars but I really like pot stickers and theirs are not so great. I ate one and threw away the rest. Their crab puffs are alright, very cute but taste wise is okay. 
I will continue to go here because the ladies up front are very nice and it's fast.
