Hds8SqhdxO1ZRFPT34NyEw The only good thing about this Chinese is the chips DO NOT Get the sweet and sour pork it's vile mushy crap in it and the delivery time is terrible better to place ur order the day before please if u call for delivery give detailed instructions on what u want as I have had to return it for wrong order my advice is stay clear overpriced shite there are a lot more other options for Chinese and they are really good this lot have become complacent do to their popularity once upon a time
