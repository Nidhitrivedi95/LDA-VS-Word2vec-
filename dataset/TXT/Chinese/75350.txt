FykLjv4tIq618q8F2pvTKg I didn't realize how much i loved this place till I moved to Utah (no AYCE crab legs here :-(). The food quality is pretty good but the real winner is their crab legs. The staff is usually prompt in refilling all the dishes including the crab legs. I usually peel the cold shrimps, crab legs, and use them as toppings on the average tasting sushi which then becomes amazing. Krazy Buffet also has the average AYCE dining price of around 10-12 dollars. Did I mention they have crab legs?
