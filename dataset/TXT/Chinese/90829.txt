IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Wasn't the best. The food was pricey for the quality. The most annoying thing was that we wouldn't understand a word our server was saying. We constantly had to correct her because she was getting everything wrong. If they want to give their Chinese place an authentic feel, that is fine, but hire people who speak English. It made such an unpleasant lunch to have to do sign language and correct the server because of the language barrier. 

The positive: The food came out very quickly.
