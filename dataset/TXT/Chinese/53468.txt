cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg I don't like to do this but this was some of the worst Chinese food that I have ever had. The Hot and Sour soup was bland. It literally tasted like chicken stock with some stuff thrown into it. The only thing that was hot about it was the temperature not the the flavor. The General Tso's was horrible as well. The chicken was gooie and not firm. It again had no flavor. All I tasted was corn syrup from the sauce. 

Anyways... don't eat here. We did because it was close and didn't want to drive. Huge mistake. Don't be lazy like us. Get in the car and go to a real Chinese food place like JK Gourmet in Gilbert. Now that is good Chinese food!

I don't understand how this place has 4 stars. Ya'll who rate this place high need to get your taste buds checked to make sure you have the sense of TASTE still. Salt, pepper, chili powder... you know all those great delicious things in the bottles in the cooking/baking aisle in the grocery store. Yeah, learn how to use them. It makes your food come out way more appetizing.
