WMj5Uj04pAqFxLMnJQcQqw Dear Panda Express on the strip,

I love you. You saved my life the afternoon after coming back to my hotel at 8am. I wake up with the worse hangover feelin like I was in the movie hangover and the last thing I wanted was some fancy Las Vegas restaurant food where I'd have to sit at the table with the whole room spinning than run to bathroom and throw it all up. I needed somethin to hit the spot and make me feel good!! And you were there panda. I turned to my girlfriend and said babe, I need some damn Panda. And as soon as we get back to San Jose were eating some!! And she turns around and tell me, we passed a Panda on the strip. You were too drunk to notice. I innmediately get dressed and stumble my way about a quarter mile down the strip and there you were. Right next to Mcdonalds lookin fly as ever! I opened your doors and it was amazing....only two people in line! You gave me great service and I stumbled my way back to the hotel to fall on the bed and open up my take out box full of rice, noodles, beef and broccoli, and orange chicken. Thank you Panda Express on the strip. You saved my life.
