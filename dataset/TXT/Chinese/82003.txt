H2RgkjPs3W-CxbyygCJJew Great value and great food in Ahwatukee! I was so sad when Abacus Inn closed, but I'm happy that a chinese/japanese place opened in it's location. The owner said he is from Burma, I wish he would add some Burmese dishes to the menu like tea leaf salad, samosa soup, etc.
The chinese chicken fried rice is a great value! It's delicious and a great portion for under 8 bucks! I get like 4 meals out of it. I always ask for them to make it extra spicy for me...so yum!
Their lunch specials are good value too, huge portions for under 9 bucks. Mongolian chicken is great! Sushi specials are good too. I've tried a few rolls and they were tasty. I always order for pick up, I have never actually dined in. 
I basically order here cuz it's great food for a good price.
