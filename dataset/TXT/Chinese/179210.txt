Unfortunately Hakkasan hasn't been that for me either of the 2 times I've been there. The extent of my experience there includes a table & bottle service both times, I spent the whole night in the venue with friends and being in and observing the atmosphere.

A consistent 90% of the interactions I had with the staff left me with the impression that they could care less about you (at best). Several interactions both as I experienced myself and that I observed, the security were forceful and bordering on violent in totally uncalled for senerios like telling people where not to stand ect. But then totally missed the boat in others, like failing to keep the random drunk dudes out of our table, and letting people smoke on the dance floor. 

The bottle service girls are okay, and I always had a good positive experience with the bathroom concierge so that was a saving grace. 

Over all, my experience with the staff was very unfortunate and contracted. I know that it's a hard job dealing with drunk people in a violently loud mess of chaos every night, but there are plenty of nightclubs that get it right. Save yourself some time and skip Hakkasan.
