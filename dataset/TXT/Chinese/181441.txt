xdphjWZymq-3dqOWmA_wwA How do I give less than one star?  Not sure.  If you are Asian and know Taiwanese or Chinese food, this is not the place to go.  Service is horrible and the owner of the place has an attitude.  Our food wasn't serve timely.  The main dishes came, finished, then appetizer still didn't show up.  Drinks are horrible.  Beef noodle soup was the worst I've had.  

Just don't come
