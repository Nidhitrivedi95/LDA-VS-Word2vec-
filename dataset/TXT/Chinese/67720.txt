eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g Yu Seafood is definately a higher end restaraunt. You instantly know upon entering the restaraunt and all the way to the branded sanitary wipes that were good quality. The service here was great and they were very attentive. We had the lunch lobster and turbot combo for $138 and a har gow and sui mai. I would have to say that the har gow and sui mai were great! The meal was great and you could actually taste the fish (magi) and lobster (deep fried tower) whereas other restaraunts you only taste the sauce.

Overall the restsraunt is great and definately worth the visit, especially for lunch!
