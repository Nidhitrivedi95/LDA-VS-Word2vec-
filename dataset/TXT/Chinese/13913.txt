3_STYcEwVsieJPo0GWjxLw Well first off let me say I don't eat Chinese food. Ever. Ever. We just moved to lakewood so we figured we'd do what any couple would do when they first move into a house... Order Chinese food! We saw all the reviews on yelp and this was the best choice. It took about 40 minutes for delivery. I was surprised there was no chop sticks and the food wasn't delivered in those Chinese boxes. It kind of took the fun out of the experience. The food itself was warm but not hot but not cold. I wasn't a fan of the eggroll but my boyfriend liked them and he liked that they were a good size. Not a tiny eggroll. The food came with soy sauce and duck sauce packets ... 2 fortune cookies. Umm overall I guess, for Chinese, it was decent. I give it three stars but my boyfriend gives it four and said he'd order there again :)
