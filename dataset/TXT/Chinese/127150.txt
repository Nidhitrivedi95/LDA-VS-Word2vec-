pAQwza9U8OLY65Q73pAnxQ Second time coming here and the service still hasn't changed. It's still mediocre at best and not what I come to expect from a restaurant that's supposed to be a Congee Queen doppelganger. I ordered another baked rice with white sauce this time. Sauce was not overpowering in taste, just right in terms of creaminess. The chicken was crispy, not Popeye's crispy which was understandable. It was juicy on the inside nevertheless, so this deserves points in my book! Also ordered a fried turnip dish that was pretty decent, though, I thought it was not fried enough. It just didn't have enough crisp to it when I took bites. Maybe I'm just picky with my turnip cakes?
