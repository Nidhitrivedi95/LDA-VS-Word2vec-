OaHJvi10dJbMIaQXg5e2Ag If you go here for Chinese for you're seriously missing out. The Vietnamese food options here are the best. I still can't believe I don't have to drive to Cleveland for good Vietnamese food! Can't say much about the pho (only tried it once), but highly recommend going for a com tam (broken rice) dish. The com tam thit nuong is excellent
