YjPWt-V5oMkakdRWrALb8g After reading Yelp reviews I showed up with my debit card. My wife and myself wanted boba tea. Total came up to be $8 . Too bad they have a $10 minimum charge on the card.  Wtf Honey Buns. This is 2015. Why are people still doing this? My wife made me order more stuff to get to $10 but they have lost me as a customer forever. And we drink a lot of boba tea.
