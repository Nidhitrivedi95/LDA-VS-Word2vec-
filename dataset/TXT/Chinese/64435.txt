e88VWa9xdHmSFdMZne9eLQ Went here looking for pho because I was having a huge craving for it. It's good beef pho and for a decent price as far as a big bowl goes, it was about $8 or so. 

Other than pho, they do have a lot of options and the ordering and serving is pretty easy. Be wary of when you order though. If you are somewhere in between lunch and dinner time, I've had problems with my friends and I getting a lunch portion when we wanted a dinner portion. But the portions are fairly priced so that's a plus.

But the staff is polite and the food is good and they even have dim sum if you have cravings for it like I do.
