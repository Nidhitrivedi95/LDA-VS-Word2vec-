X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I guess this place has replaced Marquee as the "Go To" club in Vegas... at least thats what my friends say. My friends and I bought tickets online to avoid the endless line. About $75 for a Saturday night with Calvin Harris. 

The place was POPPIN. It got sooooo crowded it became uncomfortable and suffocating. Calvin Harris killed it, but what also killed it was the overcrowding. No space to move. I guess its really "I feel so close to you right now" huh.
