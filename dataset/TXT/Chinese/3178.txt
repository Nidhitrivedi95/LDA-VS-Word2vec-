_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA I LOVeeeee the spicy noodle soup here!!!!!!! It has ground meat, fish balls, shrimp.....and fried garlic and cilantro (I think).....and other stuff I can't remember.....it's been awhile since I last had it.  The soup base is flavorful with just the right amount of heat/spicyness.  Other items are good too.   Always try to get my noodle fix here every time I'm in town.
