fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw I came here with my boyfriend for the first time because we were hungry & have heard plenty of good things about Fukuburger (and we were really hungry!). It's connected to F.A.M.E along with, I believe 7?, other restaurants and there was no one in line so we ordered our food and the girl asked us for a silly name for them to call out so I gave my silly name as Stargirl and my boyfriend's was Glue. So that was kind of cool, unique even. We ordered separately and sat at the table closest to their little section and waited. Patiently, might I add. But finally over 20 minutes passed and I still didn't get my food and i FAINTLY a heard Stargirl? Like she was unsure, so I went up and got my food. My boyfriend told me to eat because I'm a slow eater and by the time he gets his food, I would probably still be eating, so I ate. More people were in line to order and I heard their names being called out, well, I heard SOMETHING being called out, because their speaker where the cook calls the name out is completely muffled, and people were coming up to pick up their food. About 10 more minutes passed, I finished eating and I see food sitting at the register. I look at the girl and she hasn't said anything and my boyfriend says to just wait. I waited. Still, the food sat there, nothing was called out, so I came up to her and asked if that food was for the name Glue, because he ordered right after me and we've been waiting. She says I'm not sure, looks at the cook and asks twice if the food was for Glue, and he goes yeah, and she hands it to me. That's all. 

So overall, 1 star because my top bun of my burger was cold, I waited a long time for my food, he waited an extremely long time for his food, and the food was not worth the wait. I heard so many good things about Fuku but for us, it was nothing special and I'm not likely to return.
