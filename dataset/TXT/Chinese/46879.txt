bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q I'm sorry, the food was certainly sub-par.  My wife and I and a friend got a take out lunch of tofu vegetable, chicken vegetable and shrimp vegetable, all with egg drop soup, fried rice and a mini egg roll.  We only ate half of each lunch, having little taste and the egg rolls were soggy and the rice tasteless. The best part of the meal was the fortune cookie. The other reviews truly surprised me but perhaps the environment makes a psychological difference. No way could you get us to return!
