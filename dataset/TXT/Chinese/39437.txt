AVLj5MSJD1si-Rl6X6qTXQ Came here on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum. We were a table of 12 so we ordered a lot of different dishes to try. Came out to $13 each including tip.

Notable items: sui mai, har gao, beef tripe, fish slice congee. All of these were really really good, and stood out to me as being better than other dim sum places in the city. The buns and dumplings are good here too.

Wasn't a huge fan of: the turnip cake (not enough filling), meat in rice noodle (not enough filling), bbq pineapple pork bun (tasted like dough/flour - definitely wasn't in the oven long enough).

Regular bbq pork bun was just ok (the bread part was a bit mushy). The egg tarts were good, but maybe a tad too sweet for my liking.

Atmosphere was really nice, and deco was modern, spacious and comfortable. Overall, would recommend if you're looking for dim sum in downtown Toronto! Of course, if you want amazing dim sum, then Markham is the place to go.
