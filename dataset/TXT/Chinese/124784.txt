ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ We decided to try this place after being turned off by Dynasty's default 25% tip.  Overall, we weren't impressed by the food.  Too much sauce, too much Msg, Luke warm dishes left us very disappointed.  We ordered a jumbo dish, sticky fried rice, at $11, it was cold and tasted unfleshed, portion size was barely enough for two.  I find the portion size at this place to be tiny.  Overall would prefer dynasty to this place, but service was good.  Hence the two star.
