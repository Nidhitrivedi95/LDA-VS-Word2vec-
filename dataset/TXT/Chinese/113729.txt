mqiHZYNXnMLaEK87JZOzmA I was disappointed with the food I ordered from here. I ordered very simple items that include: won-ton soup, sweet and sour chicken, and fried dumplings. It was unlike any other sweet and sour chicken I've had before, but that was okay. The sweet and sour sauce had vegetables in it, which was unique, no complaints there, but the chicken had way to much breading in comparison to the amount of chicken inside. I probably would not order that again. The dumplings had way to much won-ton to pork filling as well. They were also not cooked all the way so the won-ton had a mushy but tough texture. I guess the won-ton soup was okay. I most likely won't go back for awhile or recommend.
