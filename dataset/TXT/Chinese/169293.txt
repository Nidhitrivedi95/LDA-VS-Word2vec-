vsoEZauF4lrADIqCYXySFQ If I had done this review a year ago, my rating would be much higher. Chopstix used to be my goto Chinese delivery spot on campus. However, for the past few months, my orders from Chopstix have been subpar. They've all been lukewarm and the meat unable to be chewed. Today I ordered Sesame Chicken, and I was only able to eat about half of it. The rest of the chicken was really tough, and contained cuts of meat that just aren't fit for consumption. Delivery times aren't so great either. It took a good 40-45 minutes for this past order around 9pm during winter break, so they can't be too busy. I don't think I'll be ordering from Chopstix again.
