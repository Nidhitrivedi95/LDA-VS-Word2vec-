We came here couple weeks ago for lunch but this place was packed, and customers were all standing at the doors, so we went to the next door HK style cafe instead. This time we went for dinner on a weekdays, and the place was quite empty.

We did not try out their fine specials on the wall because we would like to try their normal items on their menu first. The main dish came with soup and a drink. We ordered hot milk tea but it came at the very end after we finished our meal.
