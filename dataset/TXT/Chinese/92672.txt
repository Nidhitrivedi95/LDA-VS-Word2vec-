IS_IWMsFRJii__17LsP1Og Nice and clean inside, Thai or Chinese food, not trying to do that insufferable fusion menu that places trying to be too hipoften do, you'd be hard pressed to find Thai food this fresh and authentic made by real Thai people especially tops for bang for buck$! I'm coming back and might try a little Chinese next time, choices are good, and nice to not have to navigate through Spring Mt.! Staff was friendly and and asked my share of question's which they cheerfully answered.
