B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA Mr. Beijing does well to fulfill your craving for Chinese food. Cheap lunch specials- less than $6 for rice (fried, brown, or white) and an entree. Includes hot n sour soup or egg drop soup. Portion sizes are huge! Well worth your money. Vegetarian options are available. They also offer a large menu of boba drinks. 
The lady taking orders has always been very nice and pleasant. 
Located in close proximity to UNLV's Stan Fulton Building. They do deliver- even to Lied Library for students too busy studying to go get food :-)
