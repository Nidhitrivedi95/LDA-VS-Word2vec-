aqszoKRB4Ol9bpemt0_-GQ The service was good and the food came out very soon after we ordered. The menu is extensive and has many different options of Thai and Chinese dishes. The menu offers anything from soup to noodle dishes to stir fry. I ordered their spicy soup with shrimp and it was very good and actually spicy and had a lot of veggies in it. The restaurant itself is but small but went during the week and it wasn't crowded at all! I would definitely eat here again and it's very close to the arena!
