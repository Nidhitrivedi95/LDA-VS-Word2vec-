CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Went here for lunch.  Got the barbeque pork and duck dish which was pretty good.  Duck was a little fatty but pork was outstanding.  Friend got potstickers and sweet and spicy noodle.  Pot stickers were terrific, noodle dish was fine.  A little bit expensive for just your basic asian food place but a good overall quality
