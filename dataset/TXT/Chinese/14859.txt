3j_mvJHnT7nJd7su_7zazw I went here once when I was in Vegas with family (and we really didn't have an idea of what to eat). The food was okay. I had a kimchi stew, but I thought it was somewhat disappointing.  The amount of kimchi served was almost nothing...and they charged my mother two dollars extra for an extra serving when she asked. Most korean places would serve you extra for free. 

My mother and sister ordered fried rice. The portions were terrible and I thought it didn't even smell that good when it was delivered. It looked like something I could've easily batched up for under 2 dollars, though in much higher quantities. 

It gets even worse when they automatically add 18% gratuity when the service is virtually non-existent. Turned what was a 36 dollar meal in to a 50 dollar meal after gratuity and taxes. Terrible.
