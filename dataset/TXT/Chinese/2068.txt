-y1AYyWAhNr191A8sxoZNQ Lovely restaurant selling Chinese and Japanese food. The only downside to the restaurant is that if you are a Chinese food lover then there isn't as much choice on the menu for you as that of a restaurant that only serves Chinese food. However, what is lost on variety is more than made up for in taste. The food is lovely, from the chow mein to the sushi, I have not tried one thing in this restaurant that I didn't like. My favourite has to be the crispy aromatic duck - it's out of this world.
