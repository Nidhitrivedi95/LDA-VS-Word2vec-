f9ERQpAPOAMv5Ay0kyD3Yw I really wish I could give these people 0 stars. I used to work at SHANGHAI GRILL when I was 15, it was my first job so I was not aware of how bad their abuse was until I finally quit and got a proper job. I only worked there for a few months but in that time I was belittled and constantly harassed. I was called stupid and pathetic daily. I went home crying multiply times, and it wasn't until much later did I realize that not only were the abusing all of us who worked there, but they were shortening us on our pay and tips. Working there was one of the worst experiences of my life. It wasn't until after I left did I realize how bad it truly was. In my time working there I saw some tremendous health hazards. They would re-use rice from old customers, and I mean literally they would just take it from dirty plates that people just ate off and the management would but it back in the big pot. In thier fridge they put raw meat and cooked meat together. The cooks in the back were always covered in sweat and never washed their hands. They were just covered in grim wiping the sweat and continued cookin. And I would witness multiple times them dropping food and picking it back up. It was horrid. For the people who enjoyed the food here, I truly advise never going here again for the sake of your health. Im begging and hoping one day they get shut down by a health inspector. It amazes me that they are still open.
