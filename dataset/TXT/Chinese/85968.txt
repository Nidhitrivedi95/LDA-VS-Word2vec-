hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q I've been coming here since this place had opened as I find the sushi to be much better quality and size than some of the other more popular and trendy sushi houses. The sushi comes out in good sized portions and is always great tasting. 

Recently the establishment changed ownership and a few things have changed, but for the better. The sushi is still amazing but the food items on the menu have had the recipes tweaked and it's quite amazing. My current favorite is the pork fried rice. 

The new staff is very welcoming and friendly. The main hostess (Kelly) is very nice and sweet and always tells me the new items or additions they are implementing. Not sure if they have put it on the menu yet but they have some dumplings that are really good, I like the pan fried dumplings a lot. If they are not on the menu, just ask for them and they will bring me out. Steamed or pan fried, I prefer the pan fried. 

By far my favorite hole in the wall sushi joint . Much better than the over prices trendy joints.
