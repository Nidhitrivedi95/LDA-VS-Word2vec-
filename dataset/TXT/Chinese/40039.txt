aY-lZvoTHAFl9k6dcfcAxQ I was headed home from the mall and figured I'd stop here for a bite to eat. My first impression normal, the place is lit well and gives has a cozy feel. The staff was helpful and willing to answer any questions I had about the menu. I ordered the Almond Cashew Chicken, which came out in relatively quickly and came with a bowl of white rice. I absolutely cannot complain about the quality of the dish, and even needed a box to take the rest home. All in all great choice for chinese cuisine. 5/5
