K6AKMjAdCSe8xllsbyeL9Q Asia Tea House sucks. You're better off at Oishii Bento. Food is absolutely inedible -- DISGUSTING. I ordered sesame chicken and fried rice. The chicken is dark meat and becomes chewy in your mouth. It's very unnappetizing and you end up having to spit it out. Bubble tea is fine. This place is a waste of money and time. Schenley Park tourist trap.
