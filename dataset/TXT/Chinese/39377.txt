aVKBmuvdDmEOgOfqaSF_xA They have the best sesame chicken I've ever had. Yeah, there's tons of other good stuff, like the Mongolian beef or vegetable lo mein, but I keep coming back for the same thing almost every time. Prices are reasonable; you can get a meal for 2 for like $8. Is it in a crappy part of town? Oh heavens yes. But that's how you know it's legit. Don't wuss out, go out of your way to try a tasty, local restaurant.

Service is really nice, and they get your order out with haste. I just wish they'd bring back the 80s arcade machines in the dining area.
