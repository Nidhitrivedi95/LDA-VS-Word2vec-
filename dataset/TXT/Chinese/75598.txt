fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA Pretty good food and service.  Price seems reasonable.  You do leave with a full tummy!  A nice and fairly clean establishment to walk into.  However it can get a bit cramped if you're caught seated at a table in the middle of the place.  Close parking can be a b*tch to look for on a Friday eve or anytime during the weekend because of it being in the midst of First Markham Place.  Good luck folks!
