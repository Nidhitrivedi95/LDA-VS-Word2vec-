-_5dPMqd2-dZh8xSSmw3Ag Slow service!!!!! Every time I go to this location it's slow! Most times the portions are skimpy! I have noticed that a few of the hispanic workers seem to give larger portions if the customer is also Hispanic. This is an observation after dozens of visits here my son loves Panda. The food is good however service stinks!
