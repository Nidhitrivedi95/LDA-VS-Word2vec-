The place was clean, finding parking was effortless, the food was delicious, drinks were refilled frequently, and absolutely nothing went wrong. The server was friendly and even suggested a few menu items. For me, it was an A+ dining experience. My party tried 6 different dishes and they were all scrumptious. I think anything you order here, you'll be happy with.
