5GOrW-PkisP0eXlSxy4AFg Whoever thinks this is "NY style Chinese" has never been to NY or had Chinese food. Absolutely disgusting. Definitely don't get delivery, they don't provide sauces for the apps and our meal was mostly apps. But beyond that, the General Tso's chicken was beyond awful, cooked terribly, overly breaded, disgusting flavor, and we all feel nauseous. The egg drop soup both tasted and smelled like a barn. 
STAY AWAY - FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!
I've never said this but I wish I could give zero stars.
