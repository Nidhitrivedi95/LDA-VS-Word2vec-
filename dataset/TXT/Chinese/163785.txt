UrrMVWayfD_0NmCOateYhg If you haven't been to Taiwan (for which the food here is based on) it's actually pretty good. They have a decent selection of dishes and they sell the wonderful pearl milk tea which everyone must try. However, if you have been to Taiwan then the food is fairly poor. I'm fortunate to be married to a chef from Taiwan and the food we eat at home is more like the food eaten in Taiwan and way more delicious. My rating is a mixed bag. We've been there twice and the first time I really enjoyed the food. The second time we visited was after we went to Taiwan for the first time and it was really bland (even the pearl milk tea somehow seemed bland). The main negative was the owner. The owner/husband of the chef, whatever you want to call him, seemed to argue with his wife/the chef quite a lot and shouted at his children. Service times were ok (damn sight slower than in Taiwan but by UK standards average).
