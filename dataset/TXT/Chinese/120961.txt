O3PiNOj1vv5dCCywdw3_og I recently went through the drive through during my lunch break and ordered a bowl with general tso's chicken and half fried rice and chow mein, after stating my order back to me I pulled up to the window where they told me they were giving me a discount on my food! I was so overjoyed at the surprise, that I didn't think to check the bag! They ended up only giving me a bowl with chow mein and fried rice in it, and albeit they did ring me up for only that - it was not at all what I ordered or what had been clarified to me. So when I called the store to explain what happened the manager was a total jerk and told me there was nothing she can do if that's what I ordered because I got what I had paid for...even though it's not at all what I ordered!!! I was not happy with the service because clearly the staff needs to work on not only making sure their listening, but also making sure they didn't leave anything out.
