fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A We decided to get food here before going to watch Penn & Teller, we originally wanted to try the Buffet but after seeing half of Utah (and an hour wait) in the line we decided to find somewhere else.

This place looks swanky from the outside but is hidden by a wall of slot machines and despite you the fact you can't readily see it is actually pretty good. Our waitress was really amusing and was one of the best parts of the dining experience. We shared a whole Peking Duck between 4 and it was very good. Instead of the little pancake type things you get in the UK, this duck turned up with "buns". It was all very good and I can recommend it. We had a selection of chicken and beef dishes and again they were all pleasant but nothing amazing.

If you're not staying in the Rio or have a good reason to be there I wouldn't beat a path to their door for Chinese food. If you happen to be there then it makes a good dining choice.
