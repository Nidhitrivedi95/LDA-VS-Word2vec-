I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w Don't judge a book by its cover because the pages in this book is awesome. If you are looking for authentic Chinese food go no farther.. u have found the place.
I will say this is a perfect place for a group of people then you can try more dishes. first and foremost order from the picture menu!! The potion sizes are huge can easily serve a family of 4. The food is flavorful. I have nothing but great things to say. The service is good nothing to complain about there. I can't wait to go back.
