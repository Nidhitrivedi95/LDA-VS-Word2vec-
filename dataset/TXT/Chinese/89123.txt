i5KUubey8dD1M8hj6Srj_g Came here for lunch by myself today as I had to run some errands in Market Village.

The Roast Pork was really really good!!!!!

I used to come here for every single weekend for fast lunch with my family.. Standard order was soy chicken rice combo!! Chatted with owners, turns out they are new owners..

Looked around this time, the BBQ pork looked good..

Ordered my usually duck and BBQ pork rice combo. No house sauce but with onion-ginger sauce on the side.

Similar to the reviews posted by others, the duck was under portioned.. But it was tasty (3 stars)

The BBQ pork however was really good (as I mentioned previously). The skin was perfectly crispy and I had the option of how fatty I wanted it..

Rice was ok, 3 stars, not a generous portion of veggies tho..

Come here and get the BBQ Pork!
Considering to order a roasted baby pork if I need one in the near future, price would be $180 each..
