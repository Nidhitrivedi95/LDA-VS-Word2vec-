A1ailXV5E0e9RobODEJ2BQ Awesome meat like your standard Guangdong duck, chicken, and BBQ pork. A lot of people come here to take the meat to-go and the sauce is deliciously good! The BBQ pork runs out very quick so take advantage of it when you can! The food is so good and rice boxes simple and worth the money.
