2UaMR7lOJ3IcXizaDpv7KA Finally after 6 months of searching (with no luck) for an honest Chinese place that we can frequent, we have  found this place. Its a small, very clean, with amazing service and staff. The food is reallllly good and generous portions at a more than reasonable price. We were starting to think it was too much to ask for a neighborhood Chinese restaurant that we can frequent once a week or so. thrilled to have found Bangkok 9!!!!
