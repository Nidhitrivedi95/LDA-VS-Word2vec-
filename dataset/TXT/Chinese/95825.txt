JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA I come here for the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. It's flavor is fairly close to a famous place that has been around for ages in Ximen, Taipei.  Visually, the soup looks thin, but all the flavor is there.  There are veggies (baby bok choy) and healthy chunks of flavorful meat and tendon in the bowl. I usually get it without the shredded pickles, since I'm not a fan of pickles.

All the other food that I've tried is ok to good.  But if I'm coming here, it's for that Spicy Beef Noodle Soup.
