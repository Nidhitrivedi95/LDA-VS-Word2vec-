ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ My review is negative because it reflects the food. The restaurant itself is very nice. Well decorated and servers very attentive. Clean, good atmosphere. However, the food was very disappointing.

Shrimp Toast - breaded scallions with sriracha aioli. Very reminiscent of fried tofu with shrimp flavors underlying, which is definitely not a bad thing. Big flaw with the dish was the sriracha aioli. Tasted like pure mayonnaise. Completely brought the appetizer dish down. A shame. Good in concept, horrid in execution. Dump the sauce and just eat the "toast."

Wok Roasted Chicken Wings - Not bad, but not good. Wings were coated in a "Sriracha Hoisin glaze." The Hoisin was noted. The Sriracha was not. Lacking heat. Also, noted dearth of sauce. Good wings need a lot of sauce, its primary source of flavor. Positive points: wings cooked well and coated with a peanut crumble for textural dimension. Presentation admirable. Taste did not meet expectations. 

Pork Ramen - mediocre at best. Noodles were extremely good, very creamy and filling. Everything else in the bowl was not up to speed. The pork wasn't seasoned, difficult to chew, and overcooked. Bowl had pickled daikon, a welcome surprise, but not enough to elevate the dish. Broth lacked identity, very watery. 

Good Asian food in Phoenix is difficult to find. My review has been calibrated to the lower standards of Phoenix's Asian cuisine fare. 2 Stars means "I've experienced better." So yes, I have experienced better Asian food in Phoenix than the dishes at The Clever Koi. Very disappointing indeed.
