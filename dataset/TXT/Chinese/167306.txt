I'll get the negatives out of the way first. Shrimp cakes were...meh. Not terrible, but I wasn't a fan of the texture (this is more of a personal preference thing, but the cakes had whole chunks of shrimp in them, including those crunchy outer/end bits, and I like my seafood cakes smoother), or the rather one-dimensional shrimp flavor. Not bad, but not great, for me.

Hoooowever. The chips & salsa were awesome, as were the dumplings. Service, as mentioned in other reviews, really couldn't be better. The guys working were friendly without being pushy, we never had to ask for water refills or hunt them down for another drink, and they happily gave food recommendations. And the atmosphere is the best - very chill, very cozy, very authentic. Natt Spil knows what it is, and it doesn't try to be anything else.
