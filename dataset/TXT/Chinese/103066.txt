Not quite up to a 4 star, but pretty close to it.  I went to the restaurant and ordered take out in person.  I ran into a bit of the language problem Holly mentioned in her review but it wasn't a big problem.  We ordered asparagus chicken and Hunan beef.  I got the beef extra spicy.  Of course, my wife's was gringa--no spice to speak of in the asparagus chicken.  She liked her meal except the asparagus was a bit woody.  My Hunan beef was excellent and it had the extra spiciness I wanted.

I can see coming back here and now that I've ordered in person, I'd call and pre-order.  It's only a mile from home so it's no big deal.  The wait in person was about 10 minutes and I got 3 stars on two Angry Birds levels.
