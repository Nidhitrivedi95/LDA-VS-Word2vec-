wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA My husband found this place out of the numerous Japanese restaurants in Vegas.  we have been a long time fan of raku and still am but sometimes we gotta try something new ... and man we found it!!! 

got there around 10pm and made it in time for their happy hour! .. their wings were delicious.  my husband loved it .. esp their thai wings.  my favorite was the uni udon!!! it was soo good .. rich enough but not over the top.  it was by far the best uni pasta dish ive had. 

the pork rinds ... excellent! perfect w/ the touch of yuzu honey.  

i cant wait to come back to this place and try more stuff!!!
