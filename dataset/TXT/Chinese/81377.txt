GxzEsd-81hVP6C2h6wMvBw I was a little disappointed with this place after reading all the reviews. I ordered the braised beef noodle soup with the regular size noodles, and another time the classic version. The noodle texture was excellent. My issue is with the broth on both dishes.

People have different preferences but I think this place's broth is too salty. Is it MSG? I've tried braised beef noodle from various places and the flavor is always different depending on which region the owner or chef is from. Coming from this, I'd say there's a "range" of acceptable flavor for this particular dish. This is definitely the heaviest broth for this dish I've ever had. To top it off, the beef is not tender. It's wayyyy overcooked that it's tough. So I'd call this a failure. I can maybe give this place one more shot on their clear broth version but I wouldn't order the braised beef noodles here again.

Portion wise, I'd say it's on point. You could get pho if you really want bang for your buck. But for what you get, it's fair. $8.99 for large size and $7.99 for regular. 

It's a really small place with limited seating. They have a table outside but winter is coming. The vibe is like one of those street stalls that sells noodles. Service is surprisingly nice. They refilled my water without asking which is actually not that common for a Chinese place.
