c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ $6.99 steak and eggs.. I'm there.. and its on the strip.. I think their specials run from 12-6am... I remember this place tasting a lot better, but I don't know what changed... We stumbled our way here at 2am on a Friday morning and all ordered steak and eggs.. There was 6 of us and only 2 of us finished the steaks (because they were hungry)..it was horrible!!! My teeth hurt the next morning.. the steak was so tough and hard to chew..They only good part was the eggs and toast... I know when you are in Vegas you think of steak and eggs but avoid ordering it at this place at all cost.. Just do the $4.99 eggs and bacon/sausage deal - you'll be more happier..
