WcHMfQZzs3G5UVY_zBB2FA Hang on to your belts, friends!  If you like the Dragon Buffet like i do you will like Hop Hing that serves up American-sized portions that will take you for a delicious ride! They have the same menu because they are owned by the same family. Not a Fan of the white or brown rice like me don't worry subsitute for low mein nuddles like i do that what depends on what you order. 

  The Staff is awesome, friendly and helpful just like if your were to go to the Dragon Buffet down the street. Not sure what you wanna order or in the mood to try something new just ask the staff. Don't feel like waiting for your order stop by place your order then walk around the shops and when the 15 minutes or so is up return and your order will be ready. 

    If you never stopped by or had Chinesse food from this place you are so missing out stop by today and try some chinesse food.
