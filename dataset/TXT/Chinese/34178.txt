ABRgXNwdOX_JyqChNr8IYw We visited for late night eats this weekend. It was packed as usual and brusque and efficient was usual. Of 6 of us at table we each ordered something different and did not share dishes. One girl could not stomach the taste of her food and ate only two bites. The rest of us ate normally and paid the price.

I was kept awake half the night with stomach cramps. One guy got ballistic diarrhea most of the next day and two others in the group were also ill to their stomachs.

I leave you to draw your own conclusions. 

Swatow? Just say NO!
