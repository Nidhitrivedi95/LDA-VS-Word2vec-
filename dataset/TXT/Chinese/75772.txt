My family and I were waiting for a table for 4 for at least 20 minutes and the next table would've been our turn (our number is 68)
A man walked in with his family and asked what's the current number (67) . The man said his number is 64 and the hostess told him '"we've passed your number but I can circle your number back."  I looked down and saw on the list that his number is also table for 4. I immediately told the hostess that since it's already now 67,  my family should be seated next as our number is 68. The hostess did not say anything and walked away.

Another ten minutes gone by and a table was available. The hostess called up 64 and my family and I were clearly upset.

We told her that this is unfair as number 64 already left the restaurant and we should be seated instead.  Another hostess came over and tried to help out her coworker and insisted that the guy had informed them that they needed to step out and will come back for their table 

I said this is impossible because his number wouldn't be scratched out if that is the case. They then said someone made a mistake and scratched it. 

The people who were waiting (all the tables for 2) even said this is unfair because number 64 left and that my family had been waiting for almost half an hour (with 2 toddlers). One thing for sure is we will never go back again if that's how they run their business.
