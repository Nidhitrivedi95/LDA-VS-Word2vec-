T66oqkB_Bllsl0bz9Objdg Food was okay- not really fresh on most items. I thought the carpet was nasty and need to be clean, and the place is just dirty overall. My opion if the restaurant is dirty than what hell are you eating. I didn't eat much after looking around. Price was pretty good. ok if you're on a budget and don't have high standards!
