sVqV9lzvx98kWU39Fn4c6w Food is very good, nice trendy atmosphere! New restaurant location with meeting space. Min food charge required for using meeting space is unreasonable. We wanted to use it for an after church social (and likely would have hit their min) but we couldn't confirm that... so they missed out. They used the space for side work instead. There loss. Side work could be done elsewhere and until you build your clientele use the room for small groups.
