nV8mDMin6c964MgjK6JZgg Congee Town is in my old neighbourhood and I've been there a few times. It's spacious and clean and the prices are very reasonable.

On this occasion, we kept it simple by ordering a corn and tofu congee, Singapore vermicelli, and stir fried chicken with Chinese broccoli (gai-lan).

The congee wasn't my choice but it had more flavour than I expected and I had a second bowl. I usually order one that has some kind of meat and/or egg. The vermicelli was good but I could have used just a pinch more curry flavour. The chicken was tasty and the gai-lan was cooked properly, tender but still had a little crunch.

There's a call button at the table and the response time was very quick and friendly. Overall, it was a good experience and I would return.
