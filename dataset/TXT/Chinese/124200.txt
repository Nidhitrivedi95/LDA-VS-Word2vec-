oQg9JbKz7T1Zmm6GW1plrQ It's been four years now that I've been eating at House of Mei in Sun Prairie. The quality has been consistently good, due to Chef Susan, her husband, and her sister harmonizing the flavors in their menu. The food I gravitate tends to be on the saltier and greasy side (Mah Poh tofu always adds pounds to me the day after), but it's good and hearty, and not the greasy Americanized Chinese food that you'll encounter at places such as Panda Express.

I love the shrimp with lobster sauce, the mah poh tofu, the garlic eggplant, mooshoo pork/chicken, and their egg drop soups.  Their crab rangoon (rolling my eyes for its lack of authenticity the whole world over) is rather good and piping hot.

The prices are oddly deflated, it must be a factor of the Sun Prairie prices being competitive. 

I've catered from here, gotten take out, and eaten in with my family.  I'm a huge fan, and hope they continue to thrive here.
