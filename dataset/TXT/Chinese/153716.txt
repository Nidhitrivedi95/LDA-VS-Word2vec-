TbjAR4JMgBuPXiMUKsO9RQ We went for lunch on a Wednesday with a party of thirty people. The waitress was very rude and refused to seat additional people, even though the restaurant was less than half full. 

This wasn't the worst of it. As I lined up at the stir fry table, I saw a cockroach running down a pillar next to the area where the ingredients are located. Gross :-\ 

Will not be going there again.
