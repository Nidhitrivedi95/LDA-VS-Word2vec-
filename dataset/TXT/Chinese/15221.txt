3pGA9YGsDLRQ7HJLw5cwcQ Wow this place is awesome! 
So we did the make your own hot pot. We got their noodle, veggies, beef, fish balls and more stuff. They have a great variety so i think people will like it here. 
The spice level on there grows pretty quick, so you if you get a 3, be prepared. I was going to get a 4 but lowered it for my friend but turns out 3 was just right. And Id say i eat really  spicy in Asian terms lol 
The pot itself is really big so be prepared to ear it with a lot of people. Although my friend and I were able to finish one pot but that's because we eat a lot lol 
I thought it was a bit pricey though because our bill came out to $50 for just the pot itself. The meat so like fish, beef lamb, meat balls weight a lot because it was frozen I would say. They had ice on them. 
Overall pretty good.
