1uPQTz5XZSWr0ti7kUpaDw My wife and I went here twice.   Once we stopped in for lunch and had the pan fried dumplings and cucumber salad.   Another day we picked up an order of the steamed dumplings and took them up to our hotel's rooftop deck w/ a 6pack of beer.

The fried dumplings were quite good as was the cucumber salad, but in both of our opinions the steamed dumplings beat the pan fried dumplings hands down (which surprised us solely because the bulk of the people were ordering fried dumplings the day we ate lunch there).

The dumplings are made fresh on the spot, and you can see three women behind a glass window making them all as you sit at your table.     

When we went for lunch it was packed, and took quite a while to get a table, and then another very long bit to get our dumplings.   It was well worth the wait though.    Surprisingly when we came in to make a togo order for dinner, the place had several open tables, and it only took them about 10 minutes to make our order.
