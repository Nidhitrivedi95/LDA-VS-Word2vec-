jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw Love this place. It's my favorite dim sum place in Las Vegas. All the food is always steaming hot and fresh. Prices are reasonable and the service is good with carts coming around regularly. The staff speaks English very well here and can answer any food questions. I've never had a bad meal here.
