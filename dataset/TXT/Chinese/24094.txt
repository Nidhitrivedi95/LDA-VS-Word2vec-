6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ I was on this side of town and since there aren't much boba tea shops in old henderson I decided to get some boba over here. What a mistake!

I got a strawberry mango smoothie with boba and this smoothie tasted more like !WATER! than mango and strawberry. 
They do have a good veriety of drinks but they just put too much ice in them.

Also the boba was tastless.

I wouldn't recommend this place sorry but no.
