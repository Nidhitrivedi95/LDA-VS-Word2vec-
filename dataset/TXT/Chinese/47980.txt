C1JNZrYl3H-YzF1dys9SoQ My finace and I are devastated that we recently moved out of the delivery area for Spadina Garden. Best Chinese delivery in the city bar none.

Get the crispy ginger beef and the spicy peanut chicken plus a white rice. I could eat it at least weekly. Maybe their dishes are too saucy but it's Canadian Chinese food, that's how they do. Scrape some off or let the steamed rice soak it up.

We often got the Singapore noodles as well which were standard but tasty, had a nice curry flavour going on.

It's not cheap but we would always get at least 2 meals out of it so it's justifiable.

If you're in the delivery area - please take advantage for my sake.
