pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA We went there last night, as a party of seven. The dinner was one of the most delicious I've had in my life. Two of us felt that way. All the dishes were so flavorful and healthy too. The presentation, the fresh sashimi,  the cod, the biggest corn kernels  I've ever seen and the Waygu beef cooked on a hot stone were fabulous. It's a great place to go with a lot of people so you can try all the different dishes.

Disclaimer. To be honest, our party host  didn't order anything off the menu  but allowed the chef to serve anything he pleased. So, I don't actually know the menu name of anything we ate.
