Walking through the front door it was a bit confusing as a couple people were waiting but there was no one checking us in now anywere to put your name down. Turns out there's a ticket system out back, in the larger dining room. Once we got our number the wait was maybe 20 minutes, not bad for a Saturday morning. The line definitely grew faster after we checked in though. All in all, a delicious meal at a reasonable price!
