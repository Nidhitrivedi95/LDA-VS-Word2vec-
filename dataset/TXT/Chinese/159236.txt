u3q_fVU-qxgoGWLPVy4nMw Love this place ! A little twist to Chinese. Ordered the chili beef (great) , sweet and sour chicken (with real pineapples amazing) , fried chicken wontons (good) and short beef ribs (okay depends what you like) on the first visit! Came back and had general tao with fried rice (great), chili beef (again) and pepper chicken (not on the menu, special order was amazing! ) 
One thing I'll note ask for chili beef to be crispy ! 
Enjoy
