As usual, we had to order Crispy Beef in Ginger Spicy Honey Sauce.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  I just love the crispness of the beef and the blend of sweetness and spiciness of the sauce.  We also ordered Sauteed Scallop and Chicken in Chili and Pepper Sauce.  That wasn't bad either!

Still a fan!
