The crowd here is pretty young and pretty drunk. haha. The table sitting next to me was cackling the entire time, but I didn't mind. Anyways, enough about the ambiance and decor, let's talk about the food and mannnnn did me and my sister order kind of A LOT. The plates are kind of tapas style so you kinda have to order a lot.

My sister and I were overly excited about Sushi Samba being a Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian restaurant. We ordered a little bit of everything. So here it is:

- Chicken skewers with Peruvian corn and scallops: Very very tasty. Chicken was tender and grilled to perfection! Peruvian corn, who knew such a thing existed, but nonetheless like ordinary corn. I especially liked the scallops because they were lemony and the presentation was so pretty!
- Jumbo shrimp ceviche: way too sweet
- Tuna ceviche: tuna was fresh and soft, not too sweet, but not too bland. 
2 sushi rolls, but I forgot the name, but one of them included kobe beef, I think the Bobo Brazil... and that one was AMAZING!
- Tuna tataki: MUST ORDER. Good presentation, perfect balance of crisp and soft. Tuna was tasty
- Seared wagyu beef: the sauce accompanying this dish is so perfect. The beef and mushroom was so good. 
 
Also try the dessert!

We ordered more stuff, but don't wanna drag this review on. Just know that you should come here before a night of dancing and drinking because Sushi Samba is the perfect place to fill your belly and pre-game!
