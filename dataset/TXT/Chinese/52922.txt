Cl-xl1vTUwHeaGgBxzdTRA Got ours to go, but the dining room looked nice. We really enjoyed our dishes....the sesame chicken wasn't overly battered, and nothing was dripping in oil. It was a little more expensive, but I think you really have to pay for higher quality when it comes to Chinese. We will be back.
