Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA To say that I'll be back after today's experience is an understatement. 

My bf & I were a bit skeptical after having seen this place before, but I'm glad that even if we had been here before, we decided to try it one more time. 

We ended up coming in right around 12:30pm, a time where usually Thai restaurants are fairly busy -- but this one wasn't! 

We sat down, and without having to ask, water was served (always a PLUS). The prices on the menu are more than reasonable...I believe almost all of the items were under $10 -- and the menu is EXTENSIVE.

I ordered my favorite item, Papaya Salad (medium spice) & my bf ended up getting Kung Pao Shrimp. The papaya salad was AWESOME SAUCE. It was a rather spicy, probably more than medium spice, but it was delicious. The kung pao shrimp was very good too. I loved the black bean sauce. It was sautéed until the onions and peppers were tender. ALL THE BETTER. 

I'll be back!
