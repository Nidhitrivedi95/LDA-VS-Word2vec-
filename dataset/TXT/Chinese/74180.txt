fnaDx7UD4MiodQlgYHDwsQ Just went there for dinner with my husband, Sunday night, not too busy. Service was ok. We ordered dumplings and teriyaki beef sticks as appetizers, it was pretty good. Then came the entrees, pork fried rice was just ok (some rice not fully cooked at the bottom of the plate) Crispy duck .... $13 entree to get a bunch of pieces of over fried duck put on a plate, mostly fried skin and bones. They cut the bites with the bones in it, so you either have to pull the meat off or spit the bones chunks out as you're chewing on it... I was so disappointed after a good start with the appetizers. Won't go back, overpriced. Still on the hunt for a good Chinese food place.
