EQZPTDAy-lWijb0i8JpHNw I can't go a weekend without an Asian fix, so I stopped by this dumpling joint on my trip in Montreal. I was surprised to see them offer so many options for SOUP dumpling (usually it's just pork or pork with crab). I was skeptical, but ordered pork with leek soup dumplings to try. Mistake - pork and leek should stay being regular dumplings. The classic pork soup dumplings were very good - on par with some of the better places I've tried. We split three orders total between two people and left pretty full. I think this place was cash and Canadian debit only.
