-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ This place used to be my favorite spot to go to. But over the past few months it went downhill. They changed their recipes for a lot of the items on the menu and it just destroyed the quality of it. The food is not as flavorful as it used to be and now it just seems over priced for what you're getting. We just had a very bad experience with the waiter as well. He lied about how much money we gave him to pay for our meals and he didn't want to give us any change back. It's sad because like I said this place used to be our favorite place to go to eat at red rock. We are definitely not coming back.
