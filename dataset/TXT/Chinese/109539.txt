lOW5kH6nHVOYfmoAfpWvHw To all who love this restaurant, I offer an apology. 

It's been several hours now, and my ability to taste is just returning. We have been waiting four months to try this new Szechuan place, and now... well. 

The reviews were universally good, one might even say great. So we were excited that we found ourselves in Chandler and only a few miles away. 

We weren't starving, so we decided to order light. I spied the Spicy Wontons on the menu and thought they would go nice with the Hot & Sour soup. While my friend ordered the Beef Stew and Pot Stickers. 

First, bare in mind that Miu's idea of a small order of soup, is one that comes in a huge, one quart bowl! No way anyone was going to finish that.

I asked for some hot oil from our server and took some pictures. The soup was very good, though not very spicy. So I added a teaspoon dollop of the oil to my bowl. Nice!

As for the Pot Stickers, they were deep fried, not pan fried and somewhat bland. Next up was my Spicy Wontons. They looked very much like some wontons in hot oil. I tried a few and found the dish had an odd taste that I couldn't place. Saffron?  By my third wonton, I couldn't feel the inside of my mouth and everything just tasted like sand. 

The dish itself wasn't spicy, maybe a 6 on a 10 scale. But I haven't been able to taste anything for the last five hours. It was like a trip to the dentists office, everything was numb. I hope someone else might be able to identify the mystery spice or ingredient.

We may be back at some point, but it will be a long while before we do. Sorry!
