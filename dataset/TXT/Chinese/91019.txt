IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Vegas is expensive, but it doesn't justify the price that the 'Noodle shop' is asking!  I can't quite remember, but I think the pho was like $15...  It's just highway robbery!

The place has small portion, and below average taste.    One of the dishes we ordered was the House special fried rice.  The waitress told us it has dry scallop, when the fried rice came we didn't see any.  Toward the end of the plate, then someone found like 3 small strings.

If this place was in Bay area, it would never survived this long  If you must order, the Hong Kong style noodle was decent taste.
