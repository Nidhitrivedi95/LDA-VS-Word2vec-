ky5L-EfUwU9chSPcIeXM5w This place has outstanding quality food. The place is very clean and bright with both booths and tables. We had the Kung pao chicken which was very good but very spicy. We also had the string bean chicken which was very tasty and had big pieces of chicken in it. The food here is awesome.
