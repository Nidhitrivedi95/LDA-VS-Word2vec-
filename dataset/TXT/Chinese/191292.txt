Ysz-Xvo6QT9oaQDH4ephlw I was walking home and noticed this new place. Open for just 3 weeks now. Located at Jones on the Danforth. Looks like I get the first review. Checked it out on Sunday. Nice clean location. Excellent helpful service by the owner himself. When we wondered if we had ordered enough food he was honest to say that our order should cover us. Food was delivered to the table in a timely fashion. Tea provided on a regular basis. Lots of different things to order. Menu can be found on their Facebook Page as it would seem they don't have a website yet (at least I couldn't find one.) They do have a twitter account..

Enjoyed the Pancake Roll With Beef, Deep Fried Eggplant, and their specialty Shrimp and Soup Pork Dumplings. They flag that all their cuisine is homemade and it definitely tastes that way (Tasty). I was full by the time we left. 

Definitely worth checking out and a nice addition to Danforth East.
