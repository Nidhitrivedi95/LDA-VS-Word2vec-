kjx0Zq21nF9aAK9wpGkmng I've always wanted to find a dumpling place with decent tasting veggie dumplings. 
They are a small business that offers very reasonably priced dumplings. Conveniently located south of yonge and finch. They don't offer excellent service or decor but they deserve 5 stars for the price, quantity and location.
