RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw High quality Cantonese food at a reasonable price, which was the original source of nascent rivals (e.g. Congee Queen and Congee Star) as chefs left Congee Wong to start up their own operations. Unfortunately, I feel like they have fallen off their perch a little bit in the past few years after posting a conditional pass in the health inspection several times. This place used to also have a robbery problem as it always held a lot of cash at the end of the day, but that seems to have been resolved with the installation of cameras. In my opinion, Congee Queen has surpassed them in food quality, restaurant capacity, and ambiance. It's difficult to recommend dishes from Congee Wong because it all comes down to personal preference. Their soupds and noodle soups are good and their congees are excellent.
