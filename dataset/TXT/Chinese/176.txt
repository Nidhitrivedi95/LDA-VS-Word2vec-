-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg Had dinner here tonight after I walked past them and couldn't get the craving out of my head.  OMG, I'm going to have dreams about this place.  The food is just exquisite.  From the Bánh xèo, to the Cá kho to, there was nothing that didn't make my mouth water.   (Are you listening, Seacoast, NH?  Someone open a Vietnamese restaurant!!!)  

The service was also superb.  Attentive. Friendly. And they went out of their way to help us try to keep our overtired pre-schooler happy.  I'm going to need to manage another lunch or dinner before we blow out of Cleveland.
