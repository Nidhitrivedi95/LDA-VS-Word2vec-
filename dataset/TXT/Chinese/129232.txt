pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA On a recent trip to Las Vegas, we went out of our way to re-visit SushiSamba since we previously enjoyed it so much!

However, it seems things have change a lot since we were last there. The Sushi menu is drastically smaller now and is just filled with their premium priced "Signature Rolls". This was very disappointing to us because it was previously such a great value.

Also, our waitress could not have been more rude or off-putting right from the start. She was simply cold and not friendly during the entire meal. It was very clear that we were a huge inconvenience for her, since we were not ordering large quantities of food.

Needless to say, we ate our food and left as quickly as possible. So disappointing!
