zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Came for cereal milk since it was so great in New York. Small cup is very small, not worth $5. Would not repeat, unless I enjoy terrible service and attitude. NYC cereal milk was so much better and with much better service. I'm not told where to stand or explained the nuances between small and cup size. Apparently they don't have small size, they have cup size with a large serving of attitude (free!) and a small serving of cereal milk. 

Cereal milk is more for those who love the taste of corn flakes growing up. If you didn't have corn flakes growing up this will disappoint you. It's the taste of nostalgia and the flavour itself isn't so great. 

I'd rather go to a nice cream truck with good soft serve, fast service sans attitude

momofuku you have some growing up todo, but you already knew that. What are you waiting for?
