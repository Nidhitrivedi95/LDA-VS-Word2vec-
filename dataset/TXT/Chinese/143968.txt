rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg Came here during lunch and it was busy. It did not take long to get seated, but before, my party and I looked at the menus. I ordered the lunch special plate with orange chicken and fried rice. The orange chicken had a very good flavor and the fried rice was terrific! The egg rolls was very fresh! I was impressed with the food here and will certainly recommend this Chinese restaurant to anyone!
