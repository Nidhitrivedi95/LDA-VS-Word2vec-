5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ Such a cute restaurant inside of the Monte Carlo. The seating is comfortable and the decor is artsy.

I like the view to the open kitchen. 

The food was really tasty here. I ordered the Hong Kong Style Chow Mein - thin egg noodles, pan fried and topped with seafood, roast pork, chicken and vegetables stir fry. the sauce soaks into the crispy noodles and softens it up...delicious! The portions are ample -enough for 2-3 to share, but I will be honest that they were a little stingy with the shrimp - I think I had 3 total on my plate.

My husband ordered the Shrimp Tempura Udon. The broth was nice and light. Noodles the perfect QQ. Again, the protein was lacking...he only received 2 small shrimp tempura for his bowl - good thing I had plenty of chicken and pork on my dish to share.

Only giving 3 stars due to the lack of seafood protein in our dishes. Disappointing because the table next to us had a lot of shrimp in their "seafood" dish.
