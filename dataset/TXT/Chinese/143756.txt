rQ6C54q1N2iq9iDKSA3QGA I came here on a Friday with a coworker. We called an order in for take-out so I can't comment on the service for dine-in. My coworker got two egg rolls and a seaweed salad while I got a veggie roll, sweet and sour chicken with fried rice, and wonton soup.

It's located in this little blip of shops and next door to a burger place. I walked in and it looked like the mood lighting was set at 12pm on a Friday. It smelled delicious and it was fairly full. Our order was ready for us so we paid and left. I'd totally eat in at some point because it was inviting.

My food was great and it came in perfectly portioned packaging. It was one container with a space for the chicken and another space for rice. It wasn't smooshed together or in separate packaging, which I loved. Wonton soup was basic. My chicken wasn't dry and the sweet & sour sauce wasn't overpowering. Ohh and the rice. So good! I also loved my veggie egg roll. They didn't skimp on giving us sauce and I liked that part too. I'd come back for sure!
