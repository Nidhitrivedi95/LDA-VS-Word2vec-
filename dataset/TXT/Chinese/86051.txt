HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I had lunch here with a friend. We ordered short rib grilled cheese and teriyaki chicken rice and shared them. Both dishes were FANTASTIC! We also shared a red velvet cake dessert that was delicious.

Our lunch was at 11am, and we had no issues with smoke drifting in from the casino area. Not sure if it gets worse later on, or if that problem has been rectified. There were 4 other tables of diners and our service was also excellent. 

I highly recommend this tiny little restaurant!
