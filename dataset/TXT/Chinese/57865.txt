D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA This establishment should be closed. It took over 45 minutes to receive our order of soup & noodles. After the extensige delay they forgot to give us spoons which took another 3 requests and 15 minutes to get. Once we were able to eat the noodles they  weren't cooked all the way. In the end this was one of the worst dining  experiences I have ever had.
