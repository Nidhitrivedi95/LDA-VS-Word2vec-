kP2wC0luve3mT5fcdrA3nQ I have also gone here for dinner with my boyfriend.  The food and service was sooooooooo good!  I ordered the moo shu pork, and they served it to me after making the wraps at my table.  This reminds me of the Chinese restaurants in New York City when I was a kid.  I can't wait to take my parents here.
