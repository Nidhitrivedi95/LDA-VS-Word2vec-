7rh29SPJMkyeI2BJcjqzLQ Beijing is by far our favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. We'd tried several others in our search for quick takeout Chinese food restaurant and once we found Beijing, we stopped looking. I love that they have dinner specials that include an eggroll, soup and fried rice, most places only offer those during lunch. 

So far everything we've ordered has been great - wonton soup, pork with garlic sauce, lo mein, sesame chicken, chicken with vegetables, shrimp with garlic sauce (HUGE shrimp - not the tiny little shrimp you get at some other places), beef with broccoli - to name a few. This may seem really trivial, but we love their eggrolls. We moved to Houston for 4 years and couldn't find decent eggrolls anywhere (we like the softer skinned, "bumpy" ones vs. the hard, thin-skinned, overfried small eggrolls.) I will say their wonton soup broth is extremely brown, which was off-putting the first time, but it's delicious.

I also like that they have a website, I always find myself losing paper menus so it's convenient to be able to look it up on my phone and call in a to-go order.
