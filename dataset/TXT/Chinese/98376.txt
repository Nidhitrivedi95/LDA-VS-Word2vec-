jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw I ordered through Eat 24 for delivery. They waited 35 minutes to inform Eat 24 that they don't have a delivery driver. By now it is too late to order delivery from any other Chinese restaurant. It's extremely unprofessional that it took so long to let them know they couldn't deliver. Will never try to order from this place again.
