UPSzbM6D2SkarWAINq1I9A I love everything I end up ordering here. Some of my favorites (and I mean the best in Vietnamese food I've ever tasted - superfresh and authentic) are the #18 Banh Xeo (Crepes), #2 Guo Quon (spring rolls) w/pork, #5 Tofu Me, #9 Canh Chua Thai Tofu (spicy!), #20 Shrimps & Scallop, #37 Pho Ga (broth is incredible!), #63 Lemongrass Chicken, #66 Tofu Xao Gung, #72 Tofu Xao Dau Den (Black Beans), #78 Tofu Xao Ca Chua, #92 Bun Tofu Xao Cari, and #119 Orange Chicken. The Vietnamese coffee is quite good and strong!

If you are in a rush or have a large party call ahead, it does take some time but it's so worth it.
