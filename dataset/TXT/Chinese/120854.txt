O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw Pretty good dim sum, pretty mediocre service and atmosphere, pretty average prices. Get there early to avoid the crowds because both service and food go downhill the busier they are; 10:30 on a Saturday was a perfect time for us. I like the food and go here quite often because it's central. Oh, and the custard buns - SO GOOD.
