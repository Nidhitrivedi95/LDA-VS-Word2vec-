U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q On any other day I'd probably give this place a 3.5 but I'm feeling generous.

They seated our group of 7 right away, service was fast, and the food was solid. The wait staff and kitchen staff are mainly Chinese (something I look for at a Chinese establishment).

The wall decor and fish tanks are a little trippy and distracting.

Prices are okay, considering you're in Vegas. Make sure you bring your Total Rewards card for discounted pricing.

Dishes I liked:
Green onion pancake
Spicy cubed chicken
Congee w/ thousand year old egg and pork

Dishes that were decent:
Beef brisket noodle soup
Hainanese chicken and rice
