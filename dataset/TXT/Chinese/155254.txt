tiw8uPbxSMqx1Ox3JXGsEQ This review is based on my last time at the restaurant (6months ago). I really liked it and the food was really good... very much in need to updated decor (tables, booth, etc) an up-to-date look is very much needed.
A new menu wouldn't hurt neither...(menu looks old the last time I was there)

Having said that, the food was great at the time.
I hope most likely return in the future, but updates are needed ASAP... it's 2017
