RbuSogYZ06XHlUWDVaYyBg My Kitchen is the place to go for genuine Chinese food. I love this place and have been here at least 10 times, despite the fact that it's at least a 15 minute drive from my place. If you want some congee, rice noodles (Cheung fun) and noodles, I recommend you check out this place. 
The owner is a friend of my father, so we always get good service, but I see others get the same kind of attitude (that is to say, welcoming and open). 
It's a small restaurant, not with much seating, so if you want to come, either come early, or late. 
Personally I'm not a fan of congee, but whenever I need to eat something less greasy, I'm coming here. Their congee is perfectly flavoured, nice and light, and the toppings are to most people's liking. Just pick whatever toppings you like. 
The rice noodles are what people would call 'bae'. Whether you like the ones with the fried donut pastry (Sta leung), or the ones with the shrimp (ha cheung), or you just want the plain ones with nothing inside (I think it's called Jiu Cheung fun or bat cheung), you're going to get the best you can imagine. Perfectly rolled, with good portions. you can't go wrong getting one of these. 
Last of all, what I always order, the Cantonese fried noodles (gon dong chow mein) is packed with veggies and meat, and fried to perfection. You have a perfect ratio of dry and crunchy to damp and filling. This is mainly what leaves me coming back. 
Perfect portions, lots of choices, and genuine Chinese food. Whenever I get tired of the homemade Chinese food, I'm coming here.
