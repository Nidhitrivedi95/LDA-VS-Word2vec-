iT9KMTR8NqYwSCW-zMUOxw Paid $32 for three early bird specials - all three were beef broccoli. The meat, in every single one, was the lowest possible quality, to the point of being inedible. It didn't appear to be pure fat, but it had the texture of fat. Makes me queasy just typing it and thinking about it. It. Was. Awful! Never again.
