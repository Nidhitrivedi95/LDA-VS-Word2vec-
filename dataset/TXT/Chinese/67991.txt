ePCa7c2zvroyiwECOek5wA So I have ordered take out from this place... Because it's one that delivers on a day that I did not plan meals in advanced and actually want to eat something "Chinese". First off this is so Americanized Chinese menu so nothing ever appeals to me... But I decided to try my hand at some Mushu Chicken... They should change the description of pancakes to flour Mexican Tortilla!  Come on Hong Kong house, you've been using this atrocity for the past 6 months and nobody noticed or complained? There are markets that provide premade chpancakes if your that lazy.  At least you offered a refund, after we demanded it, but Now my husband has to drive over for a refund, we were hoping for a nice quiet Tuesday night in. smh.
