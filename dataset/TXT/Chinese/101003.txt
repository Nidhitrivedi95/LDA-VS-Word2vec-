K3J4zvnQ_G1d5xfffPf2Wg I had gone by this place to kind of check it out because I keep hearing about it and was brought in by wonderful staff and service. It's very unique style and culture is what brings together the amazing dishes.  I was welcomed by the cashier and all of the staff with genuine  consideration. Also, they taught all of what goes into the dishes. It was a very savory meal, I enjoyed with steak and brown rice with pickles, which was surprisingly the pop in the meal. I highly recommend and support this place very much, I would hope you would as well, for a healthy and savory meal. Thank you
