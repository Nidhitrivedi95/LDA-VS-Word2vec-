3pGA9YGsDLRQ7HJLw5cwcQ So far one of the best Chinese meals I've had since having relocated to Vegas.  Found this place on Yelp and I am so happy I decided to check it out.  Saw that someone had claimed it had the best Dan Dan Noodles he has ever had, and because of that claim, I felt it was my duty to the Yelp community to verify such a claim.  Needless to say, he was right. The combination of chili and sesame is balanced correctly in this delicious concoction, and not since China has such a fine Dan Dan experience been witnessed.  Other items that are worth noting; the Chili Wontons, Beef Noodle Soup, Fried Chicken with Chili and the Fried Fish with Chili.  They were all outstanding but be warned, all dishes here bring some sort of element of heat, to my delight of course!
