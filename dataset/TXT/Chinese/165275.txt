uytrX0s6etYPCcMVC07KJw I have been looking for a Chinese restaurant with a burst of authentic Chinese flavor on the west side and think I have found it! Ordered the sesame chicken and beef with vegetables, both were delicious and highly recommended. Very reasonable prices as well. Probably a restaurant better for take out since they didn't play music and we were eating in silence but the staff was friendly and got the food out to us quick.
