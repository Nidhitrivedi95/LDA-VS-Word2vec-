They had vegetarian "meats" and "seafood" as well. Our kids normally do not eat vegetarian meals also enjoyed it. Portions were large. We ordered 5 entrees for 6 people and it was more than enough. We even had left overs. Since it's straight vegan, there's a sign outside prohibiting bringing in meat or seafood. Overall, it was pretty good and we would be back.
