JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw One word...yum! First visit here and we weren't disappointed. We ordered the Dan Dan with hand pulled noodles and the Chicken and Mushroom, also with hand pulled noodles. Both dishes were fantastic. Excellent service...including bringing this non-chopstick user a fork. Another place on our must go to again list.
