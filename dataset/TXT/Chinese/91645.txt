Hot star does a pretty good rendition of fried chicken. Each order is made fresh so you can be sure that your chicken will come out piping hot. There are a variety of flavours (I have tried both the salt and pepper and the spicy which were both good - you can pick the level of spiciness). The coating is where most of the flavour lives and it is thicker than other fried chicken you may have tried. While the coating is still crispy there is also a chewy quality to it. I suppose it's a matter of preference whether you like this type of coating or not. 

The chicken comes as a flattened piece which makes it easy to consume with your hands, but as others have noted, there will be some bones to contend with which can be a bit of a nuisance. 

The location isn't all that large, but I have had no trouble finding a seat to consume my chicken the two times I have gone to this location. The staff have always been friendly.  There seems to be a good mix of both take-out and eat-in customers. Overall, I would characterize the experience as a snack vs. a proper meal. 

The prices are reasonable for what you get and overall, if you are craving some hot and flavourful fried chicken (and who doesn't absolutely crave fried chicken every now and again), I would recommend Hot Star.
