5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Very nice modern style Chinese restaurant. Food quality is above average although can be a little greasy (primarily speaking about the fried rice). Although this is a hit or miss, as the last time I was here, it was perfect. I am Chinese and have eaten my fair share of Chinese food so I know what is good. I have tasted better Chinese food in Canada, and this no where compares to the authenticity of the food in China. But overall, it is decently high quality with good service. You pay a premium to eat in the hotel, but you get a nice atmosphere. 

Nonetheless it can be fairly affordable--we paid around $120 for a dinner for two after tax and tip. Fried sea bass for $38, lettuce vegetable wrap $16, OX spicy fried rice $32. That's the prices off the top of my head. Could be worse considering the sky is the limit for high end Vegas food. Portion is good and is a convenient eat for those staying here. Primarily eat here because was comped credits.

Note: they offer if you want to take pictures. Probably don't want that. We did that once as a group, had two pictures and it was probably $50 or $100 for the pictures. They don't tell you the price. Don't get shocked, nothing is free in Vegas
