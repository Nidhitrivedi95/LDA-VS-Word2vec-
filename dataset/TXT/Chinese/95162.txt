jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg A little behind on reviews, stopped in here about 2 months ago for lunch.  I remember this place as being one of my mom's friends favorite places and I have been here before a long time ago.

We ordered a chicken to split and it was amazing, we also ordered the eggplant which was very good as well..

This place seems to be keeping up its reputation of good food, the service was a little slow which was surprising being it was past the lunch hour and there were not a lot of people in there.

I recommend this place as they have a good variety on the menu to suit anyones appetite.
