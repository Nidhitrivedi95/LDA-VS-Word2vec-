uTlDVK8-7VwpLhHnCRTCLg I had high hopes and excitement. I've been back a few times for dinner, each time with bland food and poor service from people who are disorganized and a tad rude. Most frustrating, I've attempted (failed) to order lunch to go twice unsuccessfully. With the lunch, my phone call was put on hold and forgotten about for over 5 minutes. I finally hung up. Called right back, and the SAME thing happened again! Uh no- this place is working to not earn business back. 
Food bland each time I went to dinner. I gave feedback each time and yet no fix. The chefs experience in this place was hyped, and it's just all bad- the food is bad. Please pull it together, I want good close Chinese. This place will close if they don't make some drastic change- nobody will put up with bad food and service.
