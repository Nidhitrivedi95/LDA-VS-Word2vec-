JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA This place was highly recommended.  Overall pretty good

1. Spicy beef and tendon noodle soup was awesome love it.  the tendon was good, beef was tasty
2. Beef balls - terrible :) we did not like it at all 
3. Chicken in pork roll skin - very nice

Overall I would say if you know what to order it is really good.  The ambiance was great.
