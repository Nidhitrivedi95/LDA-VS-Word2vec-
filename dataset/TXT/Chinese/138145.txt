Qn_mBXvKnn9VeOKym0Ussw Wow... just, wow.  This is our favorite spot for Chinese takeout.  After nearly six years of living in Las Vegas, we finally found a place that wasn't just okay or decent, but freakin' awesome.

The staff and owners are incredibly nice, the service is quick, and the food is amazing.  What's even better is they give you the option on how spicey you would like the food to be prepared as.  The sweet and sour is the classic red sauce, but doesn't turn into a gelatinous mold after you put it in the fridge, and isn't ridiculously sweet... just right.  

Favorite dish is General Tsao's Chicken, as I haven't found anyone else in town who does it better, and I mean anyone.
