xFCJqbDQu8YbHQoD1mODfg My parents called and said we are going to a new buffet come with us.  Ok, I was on the way home with leftovers in the fridge.  What the heck!  The buffet is located in a Sam's Club plaza.  A lot of car traffic!  Parked and waited for my parents to arrive.  They have a GRAND OPENING sign and flags everywhere... So ok, they are new.  This place use to be Bamboo Palace or Place, I never came in.  Not really a buffet fan, too much and I need to try everything.  The place is very clean and the staff is extremely nice.  They offered everything from sushi, hot dishes, cold dishes, dim sum, desserts and everything in between.  I tried a little of everything....  

Ribs - the flavor is too sweet, not good and the meat was tough
Orange chicken - OK
Steam fish - not enough soy sauce flavor
Fish steaks - pretty good
Chicken skewers - OK (Got another type of chicken - not on skewer, but tasted the same)
House chicken - de-bone chicken with a roasted chicken, pretty good
Fried Rice - the rice is sticky, not what I am use to but OK
Cheese Puff (or Fried wonton) - Good, I love fried anything
Sweet and sour chicken - the chicken was a little too hard
Chicken wings - OK
Short ribs - the flavor was good, but the meat was too tough
Steam bun (with custard) - the dough was ok, but the bun got hard from sitting in the steamer too long
Fried noodles - OK

That is all the things I can remember...  They have a large selection on seafood.  My parents said they are OK.  Not too good, not bad either.
