-oOKqZbYDt08zaWWyLZNIw The shrimp in lobster sauce I had last nights was actually pretty good. The woman who was nearly impossible to understand on the phone called it "shrimp with vegetables IN lobster sauce" it was close enough. It did however have a bit too much broccoli for my taste and the sauce was a bit watery, I'm used to a more viscose lobster sauce. The egg drop soup was also good, but the fact that it had corn in it threw me off a bit. Overall a good experience and I will definitely be back, a little further away that other Chinese places closer to my home, but well worth the drive. My only complaint is that the bottled sodas were $2 and you have to pay .25¢ for chili oil.
