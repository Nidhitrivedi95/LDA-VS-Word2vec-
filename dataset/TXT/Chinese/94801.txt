jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg First let me start by saying this place was pretty clean for a Chinese joint. Second the food was also good, they carved a whole duck table side. That deserves a star, and another for their service because it was good especially having to deal with a party of 12 sitting at different tables, with a language barrier, and the food came out in reasonable time. I would of gave them 5 stars but this place is a bit pricey. Try their oysters it's pretty bomb!
