The place is small and part of a strip mall, but it is definitely worth a trip. The food is made fresh and fast, and it is served piping hot. The overall restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly. We ordered crab puffs, hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, chicken lo mein, beef with broccoli (added mushrooms), and the house fried rice. All of it was delicious and I would recommend New China Gate to anyone looking for quality chinese food and great service.
