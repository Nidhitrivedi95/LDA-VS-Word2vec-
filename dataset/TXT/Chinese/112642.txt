MhnihE0alud0ereVInSt8Q 4 stars might be a little high, most of the things I've had were pretty....okay. Specifically, the Kung Pao chicken (my bellwether for Chinese) is average at best. The standouts so far have been the Hot and Sour soup (very good, I always grab a quart) and the Mai Fun. The online ordering system is very good and convenient.
