F3xksTtZUfanOcLQqJn0eQ Centrally located, just off Princes Street, Saigon Saigon caters to those with bottomless stomachs. This buffet-style Euro-Chinese eatery offers many different dishes and treats, but I have a sneaking suspicion that it is mostly re-heated mass-produced frozen food products.


 Service is efficient, and there is plenty of seating. Moreover, at 6 pounds per person, this is the PERFECT place to eat if you want to pay peanuts for an array of tasty food, and you don't give two hoots about MSG.
