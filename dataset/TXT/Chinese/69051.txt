EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ Another excellent meal today at Ocha Thai, we've been eating at this establishment since they first started in 1989, my kids grew up enjoying the different tasty Thai dishes that we have come to love from this restaurant. The service has always been great especially our server Sunn who always checks to see that we are satisfied.  You will not be disappointed with anything that you order from their menu and you have an ample selection of drinks and beverages to choose from, what are you waiting for head down now or call in a pick-up order the food is delicious.
