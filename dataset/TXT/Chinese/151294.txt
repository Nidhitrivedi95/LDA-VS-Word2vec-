szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A Ahhhhh. The great hangover destination. Great Wall is probably one of the only times I've ever been to dim sum, which I know isn't saying much, because there are many connoisseurs of dim sum, that all agree this place is just so so, it's not SF or NYC. I think it's in a bit of a rough area. I've also been to quite a few dinners here, which I prefer.... For hot pots and salt and pepper crab. Also, the walnut shrimp, that is extra heavy on mayo, and well..... I could eat that for days. 
They also have good tea. I remember some weird white flower tea that I really like.

They have a lot of events here (wedding receptions) I've been once or twice on Saturdays when they don't allow the public in, so try and call before hand or waste a drive all the way over there!
