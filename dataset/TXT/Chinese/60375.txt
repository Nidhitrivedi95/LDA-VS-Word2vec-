dN3-yXUI6ybiLhO-lF5oQg Tonight for dinner at work we decided to order from Tin Tin Congee. I have to start off by saying i like the decor of the restaurant. It had a very homey feeling. You can tell it is family run.

The food itself was pretty bland with not much taste. we ordered the following:

-Taiwanese Chicken 
-beef egg poached congee
-Lai Wei Congee
-rice roll and xo sauce

By far the best was the Taiwanese chicken. The taste was pretty authentic. The beef egg poached congee was given to us with chicken instead of beef and you could tell they used water instead of broth. The rice roll with xo sauce was very bland with little to no taste. 

I would recommend the Taiwanese chicken out of everything we ordered. You can not complain about the price though. Everything is well priced with great sized portions.
