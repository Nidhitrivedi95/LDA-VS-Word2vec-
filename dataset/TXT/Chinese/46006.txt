BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA Ahhhh dumplings--the perfect brunch meal.  I like to start with soup, each person ordering a plate of dumplings and then adding to the meal slowly.  By the time a few hours of tea have been downed and your tummy is filled, the sluggishness of the hangover is replaced with the somewhat more manageable sluggishness of dumpling dough in your stomach.

Mother's has more space than Dumpling House across the street and roughly the same quality of food (although I do prefer DH's fried dumplings).  They have some good soups, their beef roll is good, the green onion cake is good as others have mentioned.  I love both steamed and fried choices, and the soup inside some of the dumpling selections is pretty delicious.

I didn't find the place overpriced as other reviewers have.  The service is indifferent but sort of standard for Chinatown--you have to hail servers over but in the times that I've been there I've experienced no major mistakes.

All in all, it's a cheap, satisfying meal, and  I think I'm addicted to the dipping vinegar.
