yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA We usually go to Pho Kim Long for our late-night, post-clubbing pho fix - just like all the other Asians!  Expect a long line if you are in the mood for some after hours pho, but have patience and know that it will be the thing that hits the spot!

As a side benefit, get a decent table and you become subject to the droves of really, really, ridiculously good looking (Zoolander, hey!) Vietnamese ladies that are also getting their pho on.

As if that's not enough, just say Pho Kim Long really fast. Ha!
