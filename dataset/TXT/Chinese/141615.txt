rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g Flamingo Palace is the closest thing to East Coast Chinese food I've found. The house chicken is super tasty and they have really yummy rice.
Yes it's a little worn inside and that fish in the tank needs a bigger tank, but it's well worth a visit. Delivery was also very quick.
