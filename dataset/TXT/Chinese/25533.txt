7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ Stumbled upon Chow last night. We love Eat, so we wanted to give it a try. I was slightly worried when I looked at the menu and there wasn't much to choose from. The husband had Generals Tsos chicken, I had Crispy Thighs. 

We were wowed when our dishes came out. Lovely presentation, a perfect amount of food per dish. 

Vegetables were vibrant and still had a bite to them. Soggy overcooked vegetables are the worst, these were wonderful. 

The Crispy chicken on both our dishes was perfect. Great crunch, flavor and chicken. 

We shared dishes since we enjoyed both. He LOVED his General Tsos chicken. It was a little too spicy for me, but I loved pieces that had a little less kick. 

Service was great. Decor is fun. Quiet. Great date or group of friends place. We will be back.
