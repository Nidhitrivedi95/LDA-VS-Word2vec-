n5jTCFF6LqNIAz6Jx5-3tw I don't think I will come to this Pei Wei again. First of all several tables were dirty in the dining area. Second the ice machine was broken. Ok no big deal but they did not have a sign up nor were they telling people when ordering. People would walk over and be so confused why they couldn't get ice and had to walk over to employee to ask them and he was like "oh it's broken" well no shit. They should be at least informing people because I saw several customers goes through the same thing. I think telling people up front when they order a drink that if they want ice they need to get it for them in the back would have been a good way to handle this. 

My next issue. I ordered a Pei Wei spicy chicken. It comes with snap peas and carrots. I asked to swap carrots for mushrooms. After waiting longer than normal for my food it has no snap peas. Okay.. so I ask why. He says they don't have any. I then ask for side of broccoli even though I may have changed order had I known they were out because it one of my favorite parts of the dish. So I'm sitting here after I finish my food and see several dishes come out with guess what?! Snap peas. Not happy with this Pei Wei at all. They should be running things better than this. 

I go to leave and grab a fortune cookie. The bowl is pretty much empty and dirty with crumbs all over the bottom. Grab one of the few cookies left and it's stale and nasty. 

Yeah I won't be back here again. If you're craving Pei Wei head to the one on Sunset and Stephanie instead.
