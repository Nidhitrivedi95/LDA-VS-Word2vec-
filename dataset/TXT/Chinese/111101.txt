So these guys just opened a week and a half ago, so I'm not going to be too harsh. But on a Friday night at around 7pm, these guys got SLAMMED. And they HUSTLED (and to the obnoxious group who sat before the table was even cleaned, have some manners). It's not the fanciest place but I like the set up - there's some booths that they don't have at the Spadina location and yes, I don't have to go on the TTC for a half hour for my dumpling fix anymore (could be dangerous though!) 

I'd try to go on a weekday when it's not going to be as busy. The staff was hustling hard so be kind! 

And let's remember: there's a Mother's Dumplings on the Danforth!! Squee. 

I ATE
Pork and green onion dumplings. Yum. 
Beef buns (E1 or 11). Okay. Really doughy. I know it's the thing with the buns - but for $4 they're quite hefty. Not a lot of meat in them though. I wouldn't order it again. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Sometimes you need cheap and cheerful (though I don't know the hierarchy of pricing in dumpling joints in Toronto. There's just some things I'm really not going to excel at in life).
