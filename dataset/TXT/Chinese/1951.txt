-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ This place is not bad. But not great either. I ordered the combo fried rice. It's hard to mess this up. But I didn't like it too much here. The chicken was dry and the food was sort of stale. The food was kind of a mess on the plate when it came out too.. not very presentable. I might not come back here again unless I was very hungry or adventurous.
