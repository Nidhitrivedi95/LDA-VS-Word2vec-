This new restaurant is a cozy and fresh addition to the line of pho restaurants that outline Superior Road. If your taste buds are craving something flavorful and spicy, there are plenty of Chong Qing (<U+91CD><U+5E86>) style dishes to fit your needs, particularly noodle soups filled with various meats and delicacies (beef, pig intestines, etc.). No matter what dishes you order, make sure to get plenty of orders of the house specialty Soup dumpling (<U+5C0F><U+7C60><U+6E6F><U+5305>). This is certainly a real toasty treat in the cold winter months in Cleveland and very well made here. At 6 dumplings per bamboo bin, and $5 per bin, you just really can't get a better deal on something so delicious right here in Believeland. Will certainly be returning here for more dumplings as well as the expanded menu options - set to happen sometime next month, can't wait!
