bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg We went here last night for my birthday dinner.  After reading reviews on here I was a little apprehensive, but in the end I was glad we went.  The drinks were very good - definitely the high point of the meal IMO.  However they were really strong so by the time I was half way through my first drink I really needed something to eat, preferably a starch, but our food took a while to get to our table and none of it was very satisfying.   I ordered the duck and soba noodles, the mushroom salad, and the brussel sprout dim sum - it was all fine.  It wasn't great or bad, it was fine.  

The other thing was that there was a group of very drunk, obnoxious adults sitting next to us who were so, so loud - this didn't matter as much when we started drinking too, but it was off-putting to begin with.  However the atmosphere was great!  While the service was so-so, it kind of didn't matter because it didn't feel like we were in downtown Pgh, usually a sure sign of a great atmosphere in a Pgh restaurant.  

All in all, I would probably only go back for drinks before dinner at another restaurant.  I would not recommend it for its food.
