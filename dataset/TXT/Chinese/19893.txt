5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ I love noodles and saw this restaurant while walking through the hotel. The hostess was very nice, walked myself and my kids to our table and paid me a compliment  our waiter came shortly and took our drink and food order. I ordered the Hong Kong chow mein it was so good. We devoured it! My kids got miso soup and white rice. I would go back. Service was quick and everyone we encountered was friendly.
