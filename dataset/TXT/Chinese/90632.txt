IHt79wxZHkD7QSzlDRDivw The owners are the sweetest people ever. We went almost at closing time and they were kind enough to stay back for a bit to serve us. The portion of our takeout was really huge, especially for such a low price. The meat was also very fresh. I would definitely recommend this place for Chinese BBQ. One box of takeout is enough to feed me for two meals.
