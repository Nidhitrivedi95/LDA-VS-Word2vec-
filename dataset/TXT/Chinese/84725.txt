HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw Visited July 2015:  "Affordable prices for incredible food"

This restaurant is located in an empty shopping plaza, so the location would make anyone wary. Don't hesitate. The staff is friendly and eager to assist in your dining experience. The place has round tables, and wooden booths. There's pictures of their dishes through out the walls, along with a small TV up in the corner. The menu is vast, so do take your time pursuing it. We got the family style meal with 3 main entrees that included rice and vegetable lo mein for $35.00, They do not have fountain drinks, so be prepared to pay for an extra refill on soda. There is take away, but I firmly believe you get more food dining there then in the carry out. It is between light rail stops and near Mekong Plaza.
