_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg After reading an article on this being one of the best Chinese food places, and after a friend confirmed that they were good and recommended the Mongolian beef and fried rice, we finally tried it and ordered the Mongolian beef and fried rice, as well as the seaweed salad. We tried to order one of the three chicken dishes, orange, sesame and general tsos, but they were out of all three. I was not impressed with the Mongolian beef, it was bland, cut in large pieces and average sauce. The fried rice was bland and not as flavorful as I was expecting. The seaweed salad was delicious, but WAY too spicy, I couldn't even eat it. The few bites I had were full of flavor and crisp! If you like spicy, I recommend that, otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this place. I will add that we ordered items not from the region they are known and praised for, so those might be better.
