GdnLwnezKcZwoP-fnVtPNg I can see why they are 3 stars. The food is decent for the price but the the line server seemed to be a very disinterested employee. It was clear she was not happy at this particular moment. No greeting, no smile. The most disappointing part was when she got us Sweet and Sour sauce, she stood by her station and waited for us to walk back through the line, pass some customers to retrieve the sauce from her. Niambia E is the name of the server.
