CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw for this small little place i was surprised they were wheeling around dimsum and stuff.  i thought this place would be authentic because they spoke cantonese and had dim sum carts but its vegas and looks are deceiving.  alas it was only so so.

i got the dumpling soup with egg noodles.  we shared the mini bok choy which they charged us $14.50 for.  the big normal bok choy is $7.50.  the dumplings were ok.  not authentic at all.  the mein was ok as well.  i have had better.  the bok choy had dirt in it.

after a night of party soup noodles definitely hit the spot though.  we each had a bowl of noodles and shared the vegetables.  total bill $60.  god sometimes i hate vegas
