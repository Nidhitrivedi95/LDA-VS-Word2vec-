liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA We had the Shanghai rice cakes and Beef Noodles with egg sauce (subbed the shrimp).
The rice cakes did not taste fresh. Tasted prepackaged. But the flavour of the dish with the veggies and Chinese mushroom tasted very authentic Chinese. The egg sauce noodles were a little bland and under seasoned. However, all in all it was a good meal as unlike a lot of Chinese places now, Zine do not overload MSG and Salt into their dishes.
