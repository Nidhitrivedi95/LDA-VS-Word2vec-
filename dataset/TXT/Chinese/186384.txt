yAkaDc6MWX3dy8bnEcCrRQ What the hell is wrong with foodies in Madison, and how was this place ever voted "Best of".  WTF people.  Oh, I'm sorry...I didn't realize Russian Gulag Catering was a category.  In that case.  The food was bland, lukewarm and it had texture.  I can't say enough about the mystery meat since I'm not sure what it was.  It wasn't chicken, and it definitely didn't taste like chicken.  For everyone that gave this place more than one star.  Was there a roofie in your drink and you passed out before you ate?  Or, are you in a Russian Gulag camp, and does Putin make media day trips before elections to shake hands?
