PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ This is me and my Fiancé's first time here.  I literally could cry happy!  It's so good and knowing you have the unlimited choices of seafood?  REALLY!  LOL I'm in love because I love my clams and mussels.  ALL you can EAT!!!  Crab legs were nice and sweet.  Boiling in the spicy broth just gave it a nice touch.  The desserts were amazing!!  Thai style.  We are definitely coming back here for more.  Everyone was so nice too.  ASK the server for ICE CREAM!  They have it in the back :) I'm satisfied!!!
