naIri3sawHNvekftRyrasg Decided to hit up a near by spot for lunch with co-workers. Saw the sign outside for their Gamjatang lunch special which was the deciding factor. Came in around 12:15 during the lunch rush with a full house. The immediate vibe from the waitresses was that they were busy as a mofo. Order the Gamjatang which is suppose to be "soft potato soup" ..... was not the case. The one potato was under cooked, hard as F and the rice was dry. I understand that it is the lunch rush but you would assume they would be prepared for it.. guess not. I'm not a picky eater so I still ate the whole thing :p. Thanks for the meal but won't be coming back though! Cheers.
