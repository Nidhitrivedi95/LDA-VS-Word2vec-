MxGk2Pxy2M0fQUV0t4bsbQ My boyfriend and I went there for a quick lunch after I had a a job interview. And.... yum! Very attentive service, good wine (tad pricey by the glass, but that's to be expected) and the food was very good! All in all a lovely experience, I'd be happy to return. Oh and the food prices were very reasonable.
