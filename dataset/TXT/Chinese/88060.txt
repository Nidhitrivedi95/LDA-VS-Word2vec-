I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg This place is great. Didn't realize this use to be near where we lived previously until we were moving. Location is great, parking is so-so. Staff friendly, but definitely gipped me of my punch card. Some of the staff would only punch my card once, when I had bought maybe 4-5 drinks, when the card clearly reads items, not visits. Still have yet to try the signature "snoh" item, as Im writing based on my experience purchasing their boba drinks. Wish they could blend the drinks instead of just serving over ice. Overall good.
