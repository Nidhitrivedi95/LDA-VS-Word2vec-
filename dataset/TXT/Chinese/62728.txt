dVMP0_oELc7hf77NYCgudg The old Chinese restaurant, Yee Ching, is gone and replaced by a modern, brand spanking new Pearl Restaurant (same chain as the one by Harbourfront). 

They renovated the small space, and it's shiny, white and sparkly. Maybe it's a bit too modern for it's own good. The tables are small, and it's a bit crowded. The best seats are near the entrance (so that you can people watch and it's more open). The place is designed more for pairs than larger groups. 
The chairs are also hard and hurts my bum after 2 hours of sitting. 

There's something about the lighting in here. Although bright because of the white walls, its dark in the middle. Sitting in the middle of the room, the food in the centre was really dim

We came for Dim Sum on Sunday afternoon. I'm impressed that my parents want to try a new place (we usually go to Paradise), so this was a nice change. 
They have the basic dim sum options like har gow, siu mai, beef short ribs, tripe, curry cuttlefish, rice noodle rolls, (no chicken feet) :( etc. , no fancy twists or changes. The foods some of them came in huge portions (like the Leaf wrapped Rice), and some smaller. It tasted great, and more refined than than some other places. 
But I was told, it was more expensive ($5 each dish, as opposed to avg $3 - but see how you can get a VIP discount card!)

There's lots of staff around, but I find that they need more experience and trained. They all kind of look the same too, and in usual asian fashion, you need to wave them down. 
They seemed really busy, and no time for chit chat (nor is there room)

The bathrooms are downstairs, and kind of stinks (although the actual washroom is quite nice, and small). Better bet to go to the one in the mall. 

It's a great location, but I hope it can live up to the standards of the clientele in the area. Not sure if they are trying to cater to the Western crowd at all. Some Chinese folks may like it, but already my uncle complains it's too small!
