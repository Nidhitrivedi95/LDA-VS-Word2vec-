One guy spilt tea all over our table and didnt apologize and walked away. Another time another person just chucked out food on the table knocked a few dumplings out of its crate.

But hay, I leave that place completely satisfied in my tummy without having to completely empty out my wallet so that's all that matters.

On Chinese new year, my friend and I went and spent $90 on dimsum. We were at a communal table too so we got some surprised looks. We ended up taking 8 to go containers, while we munched down 8 plates in front of us.

It was a great day.
