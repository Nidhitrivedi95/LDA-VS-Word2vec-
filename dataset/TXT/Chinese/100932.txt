K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw A hole in the wall, is the most accurate description I can think of for this place. Inside there is a small table in front of the cash register and some along the side wall facing outside. Don't expect to eat here comfortably, it is not meant for that, but if you don't mind being uncomfortable for a little bit I promise the food is worth it.

I ordered a few of the chicken skewers, curry laksa, and some char kway teow. The chicken is marinated and grilled well and the peanut sauce only made it that much better. For $1 these skewers are above and beyond.

Curry Laksa is simply a spicy rice noodle dish with some tofu, fish balls, and some pork. The soup was well balanced, spicy but not too spicy that it was uncomfortable. Extra points for not having curry powder residue in the soup. Nothing worse then drinking a spoonful of spices that stick to your tongue. 

Char Kway Teow aka Stir Fried noodles tasted great aside. They let you choose from 3 different types of noodles or combine them all. The portion size was generous and it simply isn't all noodles. It had a good amount of beef, bean sprouts, green onions, and eggs. 

You can choose the spice level for most of the dishes.......don't kid yourself into thinking you can handle the spiciest level. I made that mistake for you already. If you never had Malaysian food, I think this is one of the best places to start.
