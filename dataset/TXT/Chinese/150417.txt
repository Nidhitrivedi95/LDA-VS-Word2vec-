SUktrYdNQD8k2vvkM4OpfA I have been getting food from this place since I was a child, and when I get a chance to come to C-U I try to come as often as I can.  I love love love their fried rice, it's the best fried rice I've ever had even though most places don't seem to put a lot of time into it like Peking Garden does.  I also recommend the Mongolian beef, the dry chili chicken, and the potstickers, which are the best my husband has ever tasted which is saying something.  In short, yummy!
