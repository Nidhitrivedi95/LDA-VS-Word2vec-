SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ I did happy hour here last night and it was not bad. We got the calamari which was very difrent. It had a spicy sauce on it that was pretty good. We also got the lettuce cups which I normally love but did not like this one. And I got a small chicken and rice soup which was good but not Hot. Service was excellent though. Would like to go back and try other items.
