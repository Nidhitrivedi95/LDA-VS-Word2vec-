BNeS_hZfmdQWsqewj-LuDA Fabulous food in a plebian strip mall. This was some of the best Taiwanese and szechuan food I've had outside Chinatown. Very minimal decor but our waitress was helpful and charming. Doing really well as a non native English speaker. The cheandong shrimp will.haunt my dreams, it was just shrimp and dry hot pepper with szechuan peppercorns absolutely delicious as was the double cooked pork belly and hot and sour soup. Well done!
