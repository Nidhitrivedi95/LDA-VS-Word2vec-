E9aC5bLfXdQVZ5csvLuLJg They are very friendly here and willing to accommodate your food order to your liking..only thing is the food was not all that great which we were kinda bummed about because it did look very good. Prob give another dish a shot. b/f tried the Mongolian beef and was not impressed at all. i had the orange chicken and no complaints really. 

if i don't go back for food.. i WIll and already am becoming a regular for boba drinks. any flavor you want. Im a  sucker for a coconut boba drink..yummers!!
