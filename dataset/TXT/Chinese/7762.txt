0VtWeDkqzj9CE3MF0geWYA I came in today with my family and it's will probably be my last time because they won't be around for much longer.  

We came today around 5:30PM and it was near empty (1 other table) .. and became empty as we were leaving (nobody had come in for that hour).  
The thing about this place is .. they seem to want to be a "jau lau" like a high-end Chinese banquet restaurant.  & I'm sorry PT but you are not.  

The food here is very mediocre and the food that was done well were disappointing in the portions we were served. 

For example, we ordered the hot pot rice with BBQ ribs and chicken claws .. the rice came out wet.  I cannot, cannot, cannot abide wet rice.  My rice has to be moist and fresh .. wet rice is the biggest asian turn off if you're not looking for actual congee. 

Another example is when we ordered the sweet & sour pork.  It was nicely crisped but I swear I could have finished that dish on my own without any help. 
Like I'm trying to have a family dinner and they're serving like it's for a person who just came out of jail (Chinese reference - somebody who hasn't "ate" for a long time). 

The restaurant seemed clean overall and the staff was attentive (but then we were the only table).  

It's a little disappointing because if they only gave a little more attention and effort they would be a lot more successful.

My recommendation is to try the foods along Kennedy Rd esp the restaurant on Hwy7 & Kennedy if you're looking for a Chinese fix (esp dim sum! yum :)
