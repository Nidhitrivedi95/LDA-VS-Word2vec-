UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ We had my father's birthday dinner here and we were not disappointed in the family style meal. The rice was light and fluffy. My son's orange chicken was incredible and he even ate it as left overs (very rare occurrence) the next day. I am not much of a soup person, but my family raved about the soup. A great place to celebrate my dad and a wonderful meal.

Very clean and great staff! Thank you George and Son's.
