Food: 4/5 Traditional Chinese dessert
Service: 3/5 Efficient and leaves you alone.
Environment: 3/5 Old with hard chairs.
Washrooms: 2/5 Small.
Worth it?: 3/5 Okay. Only go when invited.

Cash only. 

Ended up going here because the dessert place we planned to go to was very busy. We seated ourselves and the server came with tea. They have a decent selection of desserts but nothing stands out. The sweet tofu pudding was sized pretty big. I had the steamed rice noodle roll ($5.25) which was okay. 

Food seems to be assembled rather than thoughtfully prepared. The nice thing is the service doesn't bother you so you have time to chat and hang out. Down side if you have to ask for everything pretty much. 

I would come back but only if invited by someone. Nothing stood out as there specialty so nothing really to bring me back.
