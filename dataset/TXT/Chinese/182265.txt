xI4IId1ZXfSflFvfbAtTVQ We had the Bombay Chicken at the recommendation of the server, they may have a good lunch special but $11.50 for take out dinner puts it above-average in price. 

The decor was typical, the place looked clean and the servers seemed attentive while we waited. I also wanted to eat this in the car but they didn't provide any plastic forks or napkins on a takeout order, really?? Isn't that pretty standard? It was a very painful ride home as the whole car smelled like spice & everything nice.

Low and behold it was very spicy! I haven't had to drink a glass of milk when I order 'spicy' for a while now. A nice kick to the sinuses. The flavour was pretty good from what I could tell (with my mouth being on fire and everything). The portion size was huge, and it had a lot of chicken which I appreciate although I missed the caramelized onions that usually come in a dish like this. The rice was dry, how do you mess up rice? It's so easy! The chicken was also a bit dry, which is an obvious sign of being reheated (aside from the 5 minutes it took to "cook" my order)

All in all it was decent but unfortunately didn't sooth my melt-in-your-mouth this-is-why-i-love-hakka craving.
