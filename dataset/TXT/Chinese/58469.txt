DcVdJBjHumhDI1AoSbmoNA Real Cantonese in Montreal!! Sure, they have the fake stuff like General Tsao's Chicken and non-Cantonese offerings like hot and sour soupl favored by non-Chinese, but they also have some real authentic stuff like bitter melon, whole steamed fish.  Loved that they speak good Cantonese ;-) Will definitely go back next time I'm in town!!
