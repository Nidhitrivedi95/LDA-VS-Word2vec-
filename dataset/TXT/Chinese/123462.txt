OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA Can't say I'm a fan. I love Chinese food but I was turned when I had to debone the chicken I had on my plate. I also had the pleasure of the guy next to me spitting the bones from his duck out on the table next to me, lovely. Also maybe it's just my experience but if you're a tourist don't expect to be treated warmly, left for ages before order taken and ignored until they decide you are ready.
