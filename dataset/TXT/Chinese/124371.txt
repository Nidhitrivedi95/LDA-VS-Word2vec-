Staff have neat uniform. Good food, but not cheap. If you have an out of town guest, this is the place to bring for dimsum to impresss.  Staff customer service so-so (not much customer service). Tea costs $3.90 each. Before 11 am Mon to Sun, all sizes at $2.80; probably worthwhile during special hours only.
