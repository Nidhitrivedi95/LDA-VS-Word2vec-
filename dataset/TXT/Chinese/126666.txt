p2X4WdGMsi26t_6hN3Hz4w Their Vietnamese dishes are unreal.  so tasty so good so evil.  Also had the wonton noodle soup and the broth was cooked with love I can tell.  They seem to really take pride in their dishes.  Beef Chow Fun was excellent.  There Rainbow ice drink is the only place in the city I know of where it's on a menu.  Everytime I come to the strip for groceries and my vice, Rivers Casino,  got stop at Dormont even though the tunnel and bridge is a mess.  If you're local, I'm jealous but may be a good thing I'm not cuz I remember the good ole days of Freshman 15.
