If you're looking for a decent Chinese experience without all of the fluff, Sun Star is a place you might want to check out

Pros:
Food is pretty good
Prices are OK

Cons:
Portions are smaller

If you don't know about this place, chances are you will never see it even if you're driving by.  Sun Star is nestled in a little plaza on Finch between Bayview and Leslie.  I found this place because I frequent Maxim which is in the same plaza.

Sun Star is basically your typical old school HK diner.  There is nothing fancy about this place.  You come here to have a good meal and leave.  The food is decent to pretty good and the prices are OK as well.  This is a great place to have a weekly family dinner, but don't come here hoping to impress anyone.

Usual staples we get here are the steamed half chicken, spicy pork chops, garlic bok choi and the green beans.  Like I said, the food is pretty good.  You won't be absolutely amazed, but you will satisfied.  The steamed chicken is actually one of the better ones in the city.  I recommend you get that one if you come here. All meals here come with free soup.  I think once you come here enough, they give you a little something for dessert as well.  

One thing to note is the portions here are a little smaller.  When my GF and I go out for Chinese, we usually order 3 dishes and have more than enough left over for lunch the next day.  Coming here, we find we need to order 4 dishes to be able to do the same. If you're a big eater, you'll find you will need to order a little bit more yourself.

If you take out, they have a special where you order from a set of dishes and you get a better price in my opinion.  You also get rice and soup for free if you go that route. I've done take out  many a times because of this myself.
