0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA We have been coming here since the restaurant opened. Justina is always accommodating and fun to talk to. We have probably tried everything on the menu, but the green beans, crispy noodle cake, lemongrass chicken, egg rolls and spring rolls are our favorites. Of course you can't go wrong with the pho either. Today she shared a kombucha she is making with fresh ingredients from her garden, and had my preschooler guzzling it down! Go to Cyclo, it is worth a trip!
