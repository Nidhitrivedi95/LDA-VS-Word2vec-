ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ I was expecting it to be good.. but this was the most surprisingly great new spot I have tried in a long time. The drinks were amazing, we got the bowl for 2, the appetizers were all incredible. We had a group of 10 and tried almost all of them and they were all better than the next! The entree was stellar and service to match, not to mention the price was very affordable. Top new spot, definitely will be back often!
