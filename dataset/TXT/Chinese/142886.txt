rLyGCFULUSbLCt8J3U0_kA Yes, I know this place has a decor that reminds me of a run-down Cuban restaurant. Yes, I know the broken arcade games at the front can throw you off. But, this is probably the first place that will pop up in my head when I think about Peking duck. 

They have so many choices for eating the duck. You obviously have to get the traditional Chinese crepe, green onion/cucumber duck wrap. But then you will have a hard time choosing what to get after. You can choose from the lettuce wrap + minced duck w/fried vermicelli noodles or my recommendation of the Chinese styled pancakes + minced duck filling. Heck, you can even get a duck broth if you're still hungry.

The portions are big, and you could probably feed 3-4 people with one duck. However, some word of advice: Stick to the duck, it's what this place is good for. 

I know you see the table next to you having some stir fry vegetables or general tao chicken, but trust me, don't stray from the duck!
