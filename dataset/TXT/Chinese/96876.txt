joMyW9KcBEsHJxQuAMulaQ I had a fun time at Roll Play Cafe.  Sharing the sentiment of other Yelpers, this place isn't overly rammed and is conveniently located just a block north of Yonge/Dundas beside what was formerly known as the Worlds Biggest Bookstore.

They have a wide selection of board games for play and to purchase, but not quite as extensive as Snakes & Lattes.

Upon getting seated, you'll be welcomed by a Connect Four game where you can start the action right away with your friend(s) or peruse their collection at the back.

In terms of bites, their snacks are basic, but they'll get you by.  I ordered the hummus and spinach.  They also offer pizza as well, but I never had a chance to try that.

One touch that I liked was that they served La Fin Du Monde beer! You can easily get tipsy off of these 8% beers when you have 3 or 4 (okay, I'm at light weight!)

Hip hip hooray for Roll Play Cafe!
