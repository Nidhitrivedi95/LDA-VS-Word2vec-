U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Decor: Amazing decor. Modern and great lighting.

How it relates to Chinese food? Not sure. But I like how it doesn't go for "Orientalism" design that establishments can easily fall into. That's why I gave it a second star.

Food: If it wasn't for the Interior Decoration, this place would have gotten a 1-Star.

We ordered Jelly Fish, Yang Chow Fried Rice, Salt & Peppered Shrimp, Chow Mein Noodles, and Hot Tea.

1) Portions were small. I'm not sure if it's because they consider themselves a Gourmet Restaurant, if that's the case, then I should deduct points for presentation. 

Presentation? There is none... it's just served on a plate like a regular Chinese Restaurant.

2) Taste. None to Bland. Out of all the dishes we ordered, I only enjoyed the Salt & Peppered Shrimp. It was crispy, not too greasy, not really spicy.

3) Service was bad. Servers are as attentive and personable as a regular Chinese Restaurant. Which I don't mind, when I'm eating at family owned Chinese Restaurants. But I expect better service when I'm ordering plates that are $16 - $20 at the lowest.

- The Host was a young woman who didn't smile or didn't make us welcome... That's your job as a host!!! 

4) Price. Crazy!
I don't understand how they justify charging people for this place. The Thai Iced Tea is $6.99..... Yup, you read that right. 

I would seriously question the pallet of any person that gave this place more than 3 stars. My advice, just go to Chinatown and find yourself a family owned restaurant.
