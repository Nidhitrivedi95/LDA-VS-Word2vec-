bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg Went today before a show, which happened to be a Sunday.  We didn't know until we were seated that it was a "brunch only" menu.  Honestly, we're not fans of city restaurants doing away with their regular menu in order to ONLY make overpriced eggs and toast on Sundays.  We were inclined to leave, but stuck it out.  The bread service was delicious, however, even after informing our server that it was our first visit there, the bread service wasn't explained.  We were surprised when the tray came around. I had the frittata and my husband had the short rib crepes.  This is not a breakfast joint, so it comes as no surprise that the breakfast dishes weren't very good, and that's what we were afraid of.  The frittata was dry and bland; the crepes were tasteless and the meat was tough.  Please restaurants, please serve your regular menu on Sundays and make the brunch optional for people who really, truly must have eggs and bacon.  We would've much rather used that opportunity to sample your regular menu and get a feel for what you specialize in, since coming into town in the evening isn't possible.  Surely we are not alone in this.  Another thing we weren't big on were the hightop community tables.  Very few people like to share their space with strangers.  We made it through 3/4 of our meal alone at the table, but towards the end another couple was seated with us.  They were clearly unhappy with the arrangement, too, as I watched them make several awkward facial expressions and eye rolls - the universal sign for "oh great, we get to sit with strangers".  Unless we have our own private booth and a menu comprised of items other than eggs and breakfast meats, we will not be dining at G&G again.
