udKD_WVoQZYww1sDYdebPw If I could give this place zero stars I would. Should have yelped before going here and I feel so bad for anyone who doesn't. I paid over 33$ for tax and delivery for three combination plates! Overpriced and DISGUSTING! I figured for the price it would be good but it's probably the most disgusting food, I called back to ask them to take it back and give me a refund, and they started yelling at me! They literally made me cry my eyes out saying they went to check my food and the quality was fine and that I was lying! He yelled at my husband when he tried to call back to demand a refund, it was so absolutely disgusting... I've never been so upset in my life. The rice was undercooked and hard, the food was overly greasy, Kung pao chicken more like pepper chicken, it was absolutely disgusting!! I've never been so upset in my life! The egg rolls tasted like cat food, and the chop seuy had mushrooms which is odd and never actually used in a chicken cop seuy. When I call the man screams at me and tells me that he won't give me my money back they've been there for 30 years and I should respect them for that, I honestly wanted to go to his restaurant and throw the food at him! I couldn't believe what he had said to me, absolute ignorance, the customer is ALWAYS right, we are the owners of a very successful gourmet food truck and understand the value of customer service. This was just so disappointing, I bawled my eyes out.
