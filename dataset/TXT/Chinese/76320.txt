g7bVip6ncXJC5xzkQMjohQ My friend was having a DUMPLING PARTY and each of us was to bring dumplings and / or fillings and we could prepare and cook at the party. I tried on three different occasions at making dumplings earlier in the week and with not much success. So I went down the street to FICKLE to get some dumplings to take to the party. Which were fantastic I ordered the steamed shrimp and pork dumplings. And yes I told people at the party i bought them ! 

The decor inside is very cool - love the wall/ceiling laser cut metal panel / lighting effects. I've been here for lunch a couple times and it's very quite and the food ROCKS!!!! 

I've always wanted to go in for dinner, but every time I go by it's packed. It's only been open a couple months and hoping in the next few weeks I can push through the crowd and have dinner. 

The menu is fantastic, lots of Chinese and Vietnamese offerings. All of the staff were helpful and very friendly.

Glad this is only steps away from where I live as I think I will be here often.
