Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg The food was extremely underwelming. With some flavors being too overpowering whilst others very bland.  I had ordered the house made ginger beer, and when I was finished with it, the server came up and poured WATER into the same glass. So now I had ginger tasting water. Which wasn't too refreshing. 
Overall I don't think I would ever eat here again. But that's just me.
