LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA So Santa was very generous this past Xmas.. he left me loads of yummy eats gift cards including Flo's Asian Kitchen.. Ive been here once before and while I liked it, thought that the lacking service and typical dishes found pretty much anywhere else would stop me from coming back. Well can't disappoint Santa!

I'm not a fan of the dumbed down over sugared, over salted Americanized fluff supposed Chinese places that have been serving in our lovely urban sprawl for some time.. THAT place starts with initials. Flo's offers many different regional specialties done very well. For instance the Calamari with Chile's was just plain awesome.. simple and fresh, crusted calamari with chile's, no sauce, sugar, goop or glop.. just simple and delicious.  The chicken curry skewers we're so tender and flavorful with the additional taste of coconut milk.. oh how I heart coconut milk! 

Service was good and the Tiger beers were nice and cold.. will certainly return to Flo's soon! Also to be mentioned, while this place gets busy not nearly the noise level of Thompson Peak.. actually very intimate considering the size of the dining room. 

Thank you Santa.. I love you!
