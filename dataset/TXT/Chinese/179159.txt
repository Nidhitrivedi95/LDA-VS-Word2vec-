X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Just don't go here. They are the worst. We waited to see Calvin Harris for three hours, spent stupid money on the well drinks and then got pulled out of our spot on the floor for zero reason. Honestly, we are still so confused as to why it happened and every single staff member was less than less than helpful. We were all sober, had purchased full-price tickets and tried to get any rationale for what happened to no avail. Just don't go here. Ever.
