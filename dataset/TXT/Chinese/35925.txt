And not to be entirely unfare to Sesame Inn, but, it's just okay. The menu is extensive, comes with all the normal dishes you'd find at a good Chinese eatery. The basics, the specials, the chef's specials etc. it's good food, it's just not anything special. 

On a recent night I had the vegetable  fried rice and stir fried string beans. The rice had that smokey umami flavors we all love, nice chunks of broccoli, carrots, and straw mushrooms. The beans were crisp tender, again, the umami flavors we are accustom to from Chinese food shined through. But, again it's just not special. So why pay to park at Station Square when you can go to any Chinese restaurant with private parking and eat there?
