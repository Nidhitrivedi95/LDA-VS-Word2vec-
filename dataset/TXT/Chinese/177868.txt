wZvSsHFU0NdyQ03625kh6g Came here for dinner with a group of 12, ordered about eight different dishes to share and that was plenty of food for us. 

Two stars for big portions and the fried tofu was very delicious. Everything else was so mediocre I won't even mention the names. 

But the deal breaker was finding a long gray hair in the stir fried veggie dish. And no one has gray hair in our group so we are positive it does not belong to any of us. Gross!!! Does not recommend.
