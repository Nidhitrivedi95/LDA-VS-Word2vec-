8PutnU74XwbXxlzv0HAEfw Before I begin, I have to admit that I've been a regular at Nouilles Star for, what, almost ten years now? Like an ancient Chinese secret passed down from generation to generation, it was my ex who showed me this place first a decade ago, and I have since then passed on the torch and introduced some of my friends to it. 

Before 2013, the restaurant used to be named Soupe et Nouilles but it was re-branded Nouilles Star, around the same time it started charging taxes and they redid their interior design, taking down posters on their walls that dated back to a pre-2000 era.

The place looks like nothing much, just another low-key Chinese restaurant. The service is ultra-fast and the food you order will unmistakably land in front of you in a delay of 5-10 minutes maximum. Sometimes less. 

The waiters are generally not very expressive, so do not expect a five-star hotel service on that front; they are practical and quick however, and the food is very cheap, so it works in their favor.

Now, in regards to the food... I can vouch for the General Tao (Chicken or Tofu if you are vegetarian) and the fried rice section of their menu. They are, in my opinion, freaking delicious. My taste buds make a jig every time I eat there, and I leave feeling strangely fulfilled after every visit. Whatever else you order, it's at your own risk. You've been warned, Yelpers!

Nouilles Star is undeniably one of my favorite hidden gems in the city, but it's not for everyone. If you seek fancy food, stay the hell away. If you seek filling Chinese food that tastes good, go get yourself a General Tao. You're welcome.

P.S. This restaurant is cash-only. There is an ATM at the front door with a fee of $1.85 per transaction.
