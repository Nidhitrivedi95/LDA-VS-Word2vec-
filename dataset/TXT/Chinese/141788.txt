Rh2smrKvcamnP8VBUgMI0Q So, it's not fair when I review this place because I was the Guest of Honor at a convention and they took me here. 

And it was GOOOOOD!!!!!

The dinner was arranged, so there was no ordering, but the start was Peking Duck, which was spectacular, and then a diced duck that was amazing. I loved the pancakes that came with the duck. The abalone was unexpected, and while a bit chewy was BIG flavor! I enjoyed the Crab Rangoon-y thing (there was no menu I saw, so I am guessing at a few names) and the Tea-smoked chicken was the ideal! The dessert, a sesame ball, was amazing, far better than the Red Bean Paste versions that I love in the Bay Area. 

Great stuff, and the next time in Toronto I'll be going back!
