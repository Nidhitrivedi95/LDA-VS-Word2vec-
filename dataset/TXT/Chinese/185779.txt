Y1wzvTTI_rSAJOF1224LCQ Great place for Dim Sum! The price is great and the dim sums are tasty!

I like when they pushed the carts around and you can order whatever you fancy..and you can phased yourself instead having everything arriving on your table when you go to those that are steamed to order.

Even if you wait and wait and your favourite dim sums still does not arrive, you can ask the waiter to go and get them for you from the kitchen...

For dinner, my husband always go with his friends on Saturday night. I cannot comment on that since I never got to go!! Anyway, he told me it is best if you have a table of 10 and order from their special menu.
