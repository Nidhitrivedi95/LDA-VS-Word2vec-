8MXjK1lhVRhU3yGCUv9qsA First time trying a Bao in 6ix, or Tdot. I got the Jerk chicken and Siu Mai pork+shrimp dumplings. $8.50+tx not bad for just trying it out! I could use swear words to describe how friggin good it was, but I won't. Handmade Bao, hot and fresh, handmade dumplings, you could taste it with every bite and the balance was there too, just enough salt and spice, I was actually full after that tiny meal, but when I get that hunger again this will be the only answer. Peace out!
