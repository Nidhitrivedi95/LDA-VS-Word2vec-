2d-bG9IumvPOIwfr9Q4MKQ I've been going to Panda Express for almost 20 years, I'm normally a big fan. This was my first time going to this location and I was very disappointed! Even though there were only three people in front of me and three behind me, this Panda Express was completely out of Teriyaki chicken.

We were all told it would be a 15 minute wait for Teriyaki chicken! I said ALL because half the people in line wanted the Teriyaki chicken. I've worked in restaurants and in the fast food industry and you can fry up chicken in 12 minutes so why would Teriyaki chicken take that long at a "fast" casual restaurant?

I'm actually writing this as I wait, that's how long it took them to prepare the food. So now the rest of my food will be barely warm as I am given the freshly prepared Teriyaki. And did they offer a free drink or egg roll to the five of us that waited patiently? Nope!

It ended up taking 23 minutes! And when I got home the Teriyaki chicken was fatty and one piece had a bone in it. Upper management needs to come do something about this location!
