U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q My first experience was fantastic. I went for lunch on a Friday. There was no wait and service was excellent. We ordered chicken dish and the noodle soup with wontons. I would give that experience a 4 star. The second time we went, it was on a Sunday night at 9 pm and there was a 30 minute wait. The service was terrible and the food was not the best. I don't recommend anyone order the coconut curry or the chicken chow mein. Save a trip to a Thai restaurant for coconut curry and walk down and across the street to PF Changs( not kidding you- and I hate chains!) for the chow mein.  Not only will it save you lots of money but it will taste better and you'll get better service.
