oaTbZh8B-IVFEwbzJcIOBg While this restaurant offers cuisine from several countries - namely China, Japan, Thailand - the best eats for me (vegetarian) have always come from the Chinese dishes.  They have great Lo Mein and tofu/veggie entrees.  The waiter brought out a carafe after taking note of how quickly I guzzled the first diet pepsi haha
