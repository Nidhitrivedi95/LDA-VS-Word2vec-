S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ I come here for the 4 dollar sandwiches.  But I think this place serves the best avocado milkshake pearl drink. The food they serve on their menu is satisfying with the soups they serve. I love the idea that when a customer makes a order, they electronically enter in your order on a wireless device. I think the service is okay, sometimes its slow but it depends on the server.
