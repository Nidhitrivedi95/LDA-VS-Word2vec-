9prl00viUUFrEcPIpXZDOw Golden Moon is my favourite Chinese restaurant. Service is good and fast. Food is delicious and cheap. Their meal combo are so affordable. Best place to bring your family or big group as they have those big round tables that could fit 10 peoples. Their sweet & sour pork and Tofu & fish pot are the best! And I like how their meal always come with house soup and dessert. I recommend this place to people all the time.
