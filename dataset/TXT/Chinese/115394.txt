n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A I have heard alot about Mr. Chow.  So i was looking forward to trying it out.  Food was good, service is GREAT.  Waiters and waitresses have great hospitality.  There is even a show, where the guy makes the signature Mr. Chow noodles in front of you.  The ambiance and environment of this place is romantic and soothing.  Food was good.  Be prepared to spend some money.  overall great experience.  will dine again.
