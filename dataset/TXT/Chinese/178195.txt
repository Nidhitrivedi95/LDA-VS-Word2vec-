x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ I went to order to go and after waited 1 hour I got my food. I personally like Chinese food very much so I came here coz there are very few option for Chinese restaurant. I ordered hot n sour soup, lat mai kai, chicken 65, egg Hakka chowmein, chicken Hakka noodle, sweet n sour chicken, chilli garlic chicken.  Pretty much huh!! When I came home I saw that the appetizers are really small in quantity and doesn't taste that good.i took these items before and I loved those.though I like the chowmein and sweet n sour chicken.n think It ll b better if I dine in here next time.:(
