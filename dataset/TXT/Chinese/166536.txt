vctaNms-o_VDHWCAbldFjQ I came for dinner with a few friends on a Friday night around 9ish. Looking from the inside, it looked like a decent chinese place. We ordered chicken, bok choy with mushrooms, fried rice and pan fried dumplings. The food was cold, small in size and flavourless. Just a huge disappointment. Do not recommend.
