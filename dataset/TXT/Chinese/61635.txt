drIFrAyZnyismS1ArZlmAg Oh my goodness. That was one amazing dinner that I had here. I was torn between a couple of different dishes that had gluten-free options but I ended up going with the Royal Noodle Soup and I am SO GLAD that I did because that was perhaps one of the best noodle soups I have ever had in my life. Made with a mildly spicy lemongrass broth (I actually expected it to be more spicy since it was indicated to be so on the menu, but that was fine), there were plenty of rice noodles, oyster mushrooms, and tofu to more than fill me up. 

Seriously, that broth was so freaking delicious that I wanted to keep sipping on it forever, and I pretty much did until every drop was gone. I was so full that there was no room for dessert and I was glad I didn't order any appetizers because I either wouldn't have been able to finish the soup (which would have been very sad) or I would been so full that I would have been sick.

Yum yum yum yum yum.

Service was also great. I was seated immediately and my server was great with helping me to decide what to get. Definitely on my list to go back to next time I'm in Phoenix!
