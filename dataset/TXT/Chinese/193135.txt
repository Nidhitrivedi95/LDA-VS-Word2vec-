ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Clever in charging a lot of underwhelming flavors is what I got from my visit.  The crowd is downtown hippsters, who want to be seen. The bar and the drinks were probably the best part of my dining experience.  Staff friendly and helpful.   I watched one of the owners on 3TV mentioned it's not an Asian fusion place..however, the decor is very Asian not the cooks! Very confusing. Regardless Clever Koi is Asian "inspired" however the dishes are not very flavorful, over priced and need salt and other spices.   The ramen was $13 for a little bowl.  The broth is the key.    It tasted like beef broth with a little bit of soy, very tasteless and I would not go again for it.  Kimchi Fried Rice...didn't taste like Kimchi.  The turkey leg..meh.  The buns were the only thing that was "good"  I would only go for the buns and the drinks.  Keep working on your flavors and regardless if it's something new and out of the box, it needs to be tasty and Clever Koi isn't there yet.
