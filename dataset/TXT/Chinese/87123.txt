hRbUkwU9awUan32CD-mdHA Great dim sum - everything came out hot and quick.  Decent service and prices are reasonable for the area (Small dish is $2.40 for instance).  We came on boxing day and surprised there was no wait at prime time (12pm) for dim sum.

Highly recommend the deep fried octopus tentacles, siu mai, har gar, e-mein, spare ribs.  Overall a solid dim sum choice for experience and beginner dim-summers...!
