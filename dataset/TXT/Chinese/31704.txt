9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw I would give this place a good 5 stars why? Because they are reliable they open til 6 am every single day so when I get off work I can just come straight here and eat really good authentic Chinese food *drools* I looooove their soups too it always comes in a good portion size and it's always hot. But yeah place is big and spacious, the atmosphere is always so chill and so relaxing. Place seems pretty clean and the workers are very nice and service is okay. Definitely coming back here at like 4 in the morning hahaha
