xVHzCbDWCwmyavF5PgJRmg Maybe just being there once is too soon to write a review, but I don't think I'll return.
The place is small and doesn't look clean enough. I order beef noodle soup and dim sum. I can tell the way they made my noodle is just poured the beef to the noodle soup before they served it. I had to stir it to make my noodle. For my dim sum, usually it should have shrimp inside, but they have it on top, when I tried to bite it, the shrimp fell off.
Overall the food taste not bad, but they can be better.
