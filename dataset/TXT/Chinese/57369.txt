It came in a big bowl with fish balls, chicken, tofu and lots of noodles.  The price was quite reasonable for $10 a bowl.  I don't care for too spicy dishes, so this mild version was perfect for me.  My wife had their beef redang which was also very delicious.  The portions are very reasonable.  This place seems to be a local favorite and I am a fan now too.  For anyone who has a taste for Thai, come here and give this place a try.
