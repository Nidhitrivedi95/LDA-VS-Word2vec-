XtE1r4_JMBSV_YBXlo8RbQ I'm not sure that the reviewer above - Houston T. - understood the first reviewer's comments. Jonathan B was trying to say - I imagine - that although you can get americanized chinese food here, it also offers respectable versions of more traditional chinese dishes.

I have been here several times and have enjoyed everything that I have ordered. They don't hold back on the ma-la spicing - my lips are numb everytime I leave!

Here's why I like it:

-First of all, it surprises me. It's a quiet hotel restaurant that looks like nothing special, yet the food and service are both excellent. 

-Second, it is a rare opportunity for me to go out for authentic sichuan food and also satisfy other dining companions who aren't so adventurous. I can order Yu Hsiang eggplant or a hot pot while my friends order sesame chicken, and we're strangely both happy. We could go to Cuisine Szechuan to scratch my itch, but the my friends wouldn't be as satisfied. 
Plus the atmosphere here is better, with a nice view of the park across the street. 

Here's what I've had and enjoyed:

Dry-fried/Four seasons green beans
Cumin beef
dry-fried spicy beef
some noodle dish - maybe wuhan noodles?

I'm not going to say it was "just like being in China" but I think it strikes a good balance and delivers on the flavor.
