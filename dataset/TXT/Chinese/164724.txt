UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w For the price, 3.5 stars is fair.  The same weekend I went to the circus circus Buffy and the spice market buffet and it was def better than the circus circus buffet.  It wouldn't be fair to compare to the higher end Vegas buffets.  The had selections from Asian, Mexican, American...dessert.  The one time I stayed at this hotel they gave me 2 free buffet coupons, not sure if that's always how it works but if you are down on Vegas luck and need a good deal, it's a good option.  I actually like to gamble here a bit every trip since they got low minimum craps and roulette and there are never douche bags here.
