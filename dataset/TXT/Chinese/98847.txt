JtSNHDRRZffnHBEsJudW-g We have never had a bad meal here and their prices are spot on.  Affordable too.  The restaurant is a little bit small but nice.  Pretty view off to the east when the fountains are on.
Try the Pad Thai with steak, Pesto Cavatappi with chicken, Pasta Fresca, orThai Curry soup.  All very very good.  Oh!   And their Caesar salad has some of the best dressing around.
This is a 5 star rating for a cafe style restaurant.   I would not give it the same rating if it were more of a fine dining establishment.
