Three of my classmates and I came here when we got free coupons to try out their new Korean BBQ.

It was surprisingly good! However, it had that taste, the kind that screams MSG. I've had much better Korean BBQ in Seoul, Korea and in LA's Korea-town. The Korean BBQ beef here is American styled and not very authentic. The texture of the sauce is like Panda Express sweet and sour sauce. The price for this is under $8, but for that I believe there are better options. They should probably lower the price to $6. But despite all of that, it's still has the best Korean BBQ from any Asian chain restaurant. 

My friend ended up getting us some egg rolls, which was decent. However, the sauce they gave us tasted like I was dipping my roll in nail polish. It was awful. 

They do have cool machines though. Their the ones that that are digital and you choose your drink from the screen.
