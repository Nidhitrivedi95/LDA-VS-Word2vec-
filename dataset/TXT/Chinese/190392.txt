YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g We went the second night after Luckee opened.
Space was nice. Chairs not.
Music was irritating.  Not sure what genre was playing.
Server had some memory issues.
Menu enticing.
Noodle dish tasty and good value,
Spring rolls good,
Lamb meatball overpriced for 2 small balls.
Some of the other  dishes were small in portion
For the money,
Deserts were an odd selection and average.
We will try it one more time for the dim sun.
If this doesn't WOW us we won't return.
