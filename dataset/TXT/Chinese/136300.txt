QG56Fy7JQ_9XgAwtj7fhjw Giving this a 3 for the moment. We had king po chicken and also the dry spicy chicken with two portions of rice. Should probably have gone for the fish in the pot so will review this next time. Service was good, really nice waitress. I would say it was a bit on the pricey side
