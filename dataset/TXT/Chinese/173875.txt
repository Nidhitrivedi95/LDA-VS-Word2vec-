WAb6ox5RrBtF7m5Cb6p56Q So it was a nice and friendly establishment but as someone that loves Chinese food I actually couldn't eat my food. My brother and I both got an order of general tso and it tasted like straight salt. The sauce was unrecognizable, it didn't taste like anything I've ever had. I don't know if the batch got messed up of if that's their recipe but it was not good. (And generals is one of those entrees that are pretty standard from a take away place, so I figured it'd be normal, but nope). I'm not from here so I don't have to worry about not returning but just heed my PRECAUTIONARY tale, Scottsdale.
