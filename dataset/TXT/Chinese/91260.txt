iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A Yes. The food is good for the price. BUT. The delivery service is another story. I waited an hour and a half tonight for some food, which was delivered luke warm. I made a phone call and got "Driver is on his way". Although this never happened before, I can make sure that it won't happen again. I think it better I just go in and get what I need as I found that their delivery has slowed greatly this time around.
