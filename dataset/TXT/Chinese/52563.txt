cjatara6LkXRu2BXD_jxlA Came upon this Chinese styled yakitori restaurant which opened less than a month ago. Located right next to Destiny's Scarborough, same plaza. Open daily from 4pm -2am.

Right when you walk in, you can see their entire kitchen through a glass window. Get to see their chefs grilling, frying, prepping, everything !

Their booths for 4 are 'Asian-sized' which means they're smaller and tighter. There was only 2 of us so it was perfect. They also have longer bench tables for bigger groups. 

They have a variety of skewers and that's what they specialize in. They use the same sauce for pretty much everything and it's similar to the Lamb Skewer spices. Highly recommend the Chinese Bun! 

Each table has a stone tray where skewers are delivered onto. It's heated with 2 tea light candles underneath so your food stays warmer, longer. A small bucket for the empty skewers are on each table. 

They speak Mandarin and it seems that English is their 2nd language. But you're not eating rocket science so broken English should be suffice.

They're still waiting for their liquor license so no alcohol yet. But many of their dishes would be perfect with a nice cold beer.
