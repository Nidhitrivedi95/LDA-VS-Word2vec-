IOwTrStIy6NinyquhBrLZQ Let me begin by saying their honey chicken is great, but that's were it all ends.

The orange chicken and fried rice tasted over cooked and burned.

At $8.99 for a combo I expected better and I have had better at other locations.

This location dropped the stix!

Never Again.
