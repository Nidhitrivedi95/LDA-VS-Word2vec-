isXy5v7DINDu9Zg-FGCYFw Absolutely horrible place, can skip  !   If the rating system would let me, the place would get zero star. 

First off, expect you clothes (from top layer to under garments) to smell like the place when you are done, air circulation was almost non exist.  I was sweating all along and could not feel a single drop of AC, on top of that, be constantly prepared to fan off those pesky small flies that try to share your food.

The food was ok, we ordered 5 plates and they were all overly salty.  We had to warn a friend to watch her consumption, since she had issues with high blood pressure.  One thing I noticed about the cooking was that red hot pepper and green pepper were aplenty on every single dish. Even the sour vege and fish soup was chockablock with them.  

In addition, you better be a fast eater.  While we were trying to enjoy our food and half way through eating (but long before we were going to ask for the check), different waitress came around 4 times in less than 5 minutes to ask if they could take our plates away or bag them for us.  I guess it if were a busy night, then you can forget about spending time with your friends or enjoy the food you have ordered.   Yes, there were people waiting outside, but It is really bad customer service to try to rush your diners.  We got so irritated that we had to tell them to stop bugging us.  

One thing I know for sure, none of us are going back there.
