0It4d0eFPJ5UnQqe6g2Z3w China Buffet King is a good, traditional Chinese Buffet restaurant. It is located directly behind the Wendy's on Noblestown Road, so it is easy to miss unless your looking for it. Good food, good service. About what you would expect from a restaurant like this. Price is reasonable as well!
