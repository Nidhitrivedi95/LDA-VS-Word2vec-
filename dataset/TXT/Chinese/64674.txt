E9aC5bLfXdQVZ5csvLuLJg For waiter/waitress service, have a seat. For to-go, approach the front counter. My favorite dishes are the scallion pancakes and the beef rolls. The outer pastry's slight crunch complements its filling perfectly. I'm only docking a star because I feel the drinks are a bit too sweet and the seats and tables can feel sticky when sitting on them.
