SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ I was prepared to like this place. Really I was. Very attractive exterior and cute name.  What a bonehead I was - should have done better research.  Ling & Louie's is as if P.F. Chang and Applebee's had a love child.  The result is unfortunate - a "concept" formula made expressly for "franchi$e opportunitie$", and there's nothing especially good or unique about it.  Friends don't let friends eat mediocre food.
