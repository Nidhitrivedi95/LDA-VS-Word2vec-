Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA My family and I enjoy going to this small but quaint restaurant on the west side of town.  It is a family business who serves the best basil fried rice in Vegas.  We also enjoy their tiger shrimp salad with mango.  I am not a big fan of really spicy food so mild or even 1 star of spice is good for me, otherwise, you'll be asking for refill of water because when they say hot, they mean hot!~  It's a must try if you are feeling like eating Asian food.  As for the other items on the menu, they aren't bad.  Let's just so, I've found what works for me on their menu and they keep me coming back for more!
