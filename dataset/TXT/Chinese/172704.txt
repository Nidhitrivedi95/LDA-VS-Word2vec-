W6HgKXp-gXozKjOqGqIOXg We got delivery from this place last night, and honestly was the worst Pho I have tried.
The portion was so little, the broth was taste less, very little meat, tons of sprouts, little noodles. Super disappointed!
It was a very expensive Pho for the little amount and quality of food we got.
Never again!
