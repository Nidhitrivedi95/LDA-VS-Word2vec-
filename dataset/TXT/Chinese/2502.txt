_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg We went back to Hibachi Grill Super Buffet this afternoon for a second time to give it another try. We were greeted and seated immediately upon entering this time. I didn't see any of the messes on the floors, tables, or buffets that people mentioned in other reviews. Everything looked clean, and the wait staff were there to clean off our empty plates and refill our glasses. The food is typical buffet food - nothing fancy or especially delicious, just standard. As a vegetarian, I had the vegetable lo mein, some cucumbers/tomatoes and mushoom salad. Very tasty. I don't know what all my husband ate, but he ate a lot and said it was good. I also didn't see any small children running around sticking hands in the buffet this time. My husband says all buffet tables should be taller so kids can't play in the food haha! This second experience was much better than the first, so I upped my rating from one star to three.
