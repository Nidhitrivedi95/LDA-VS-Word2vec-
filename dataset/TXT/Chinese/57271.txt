We ordered the Mongolian Beef, Lemongrass Chicken, chicken & shrimp fried rice, spring egg rolls, firecracker shrimp, bacon wrapped scallops, and seafood Tom Yum. Everything was delicious. But the highlight was definitely the seafood tom yum. Never had it or heard of it before, and it was delicious. We will definitely be fitting Satay into our next Vegas trip just for the Tom Yum.
