L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA I've been coming to this restaurant since freshman year of college. It's cheap and the food taste great! What I love about this place is that you always get your food really fast! However, service could be better. The waiter didn't even bother refilling our waters!!! Plus whenever we asked a question, they wouldn't respond. I mean they would do what we asked but they would just walk away without saying anything. 

If there was a way for a 2 and a half stars, that's what I would give.
