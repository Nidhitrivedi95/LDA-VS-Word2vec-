eMTE-wqpk_YWaV3mf7Ii3A Was here for an Xmas dinner

The place was able to cater to our party of 20

Service was good...checked on quite frequently

Our server forgot a couple of orders but he would eventually come back and get them for us

Expected for a big party

Food was delish

Sushi and sashimi were decent
Nothing knockout but good enough

The kicker was the appys and main course

Lamb was off the hook

Korean kali platter was awesome along with the bukgogi platter

Mongolian chicken was quite tasty

Loved their fried cheese dumplings

We definitely kept the kitchen busy with our AYCE orders

Will definitely come back again and recommend this for work groups doing their Xmas dinners
