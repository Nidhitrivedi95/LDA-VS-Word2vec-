ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg We woke up too late to catch dim sum so we came here instead. We weren't disappointed, in fact we made the best and ordered a lot and it was really yummy! We had to go out for a walk since our tummies were so happy.  house special congee. salt pepper squid.  seafood udon. tomato and coconut milk rice and shrimp. bbq duck with noodle. 
server was helpful when we ordered two bowls of congee to share so we took her suggestion and only got one bowl since we got so much other food. 
We were here early for lunch and we were glad cuz even though the place is big, it still filled up fast! 
I would come here again!
