5FiuxRWs-indyk2Y9imkSg I'm happy to say that there is finally a Chinese place a block away from me -- no more having to schlep all the way to Windmill or wait for the delivery guy to arrive...I got my own!

There is definitely a dearth of Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas, so anytime a new one opens -- no matter how commercialized -- my insides perk up with excitement. This location is still ironing out some kinks -- their credit card machine was having some trouble, but that's to be expected.

They have good combination specials. On their grand opening, I got two of them -- yes I can be a piggy. I ordered the Shrimp and Snow Pea combination to eat there and the Mongolian Beef combination to-go. Both combinations came with fried rice, an egg roll and a fortune cookie.

The Shrimp and Snow Pea is pretty good -- light on the shrimp, but definitely heavy on flavor. I would definitely order this again. The vegetables (snow peas, carrots, celery, bean sprouts) that accompany the shrimp was really good!

The Mongolian Beef was okay. That's a tepid okay. I might order this again, but probably not. I was expecting savory and spicy, but tasted more sweet notes than anything. Once I accepted that I was in for a sweet ride, I realized that they really went heavy on the onions and bell peppers. I like the onions (especially the customary green onions) but would have preferred if they refrained from drowning my beef in bell peppers -- just because it's the right color, doesn't mean it's a welcomed flavor profile. Like the shrimp order, this was also fairly light on the protein.

Overall I like this place. For convenience sake I will be back here fairly often. Yay Chinese food!
