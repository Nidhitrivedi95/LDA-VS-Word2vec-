S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ Love this place. Everytime I'm in Vegas, I'll always stop by here for a meal at least two to three times.  The sandwiches are delicious, and the bread is really soft.  Noodles are good, as well as the Vietnamese appetizers.  I've tried a few other dishes as well but none are as delicious or as impressive as the items I mentioned above.  Also, great price.
