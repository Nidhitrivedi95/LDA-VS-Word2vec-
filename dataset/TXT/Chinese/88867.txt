I1pLg_ZjLMcie3g58I_GZA I love a chinese cafe that will put butter and condensed milk on your toast (with the crust cut off!). Prices are cheap and they have a wide range of things to order. Their all-day menu never disappoints! I love that each menu item comes with a different side of toast/sandwich - one may include toast with butter and condensed milk, another may include an egg sandwich or corned beef sandwich. Tons of variety!
