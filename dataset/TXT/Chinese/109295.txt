lmfyEVKm3CDGWg18LeRhgA One of my buddies was craving thai food so I suggested this spot. They seemed to like it. Let me see, I ordered the crispy chicken with spicy sauce. My friends got the yellow curry. It was all pretty delicious. The thai tea is also really good here. At the end of our meal they convinced us to get the mango with sticky rice and that was alright. Overall, pretty nice place all around besides the bathroom.
