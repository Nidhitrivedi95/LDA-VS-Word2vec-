pRfIJ6zurjEsWmJheDOP6A Along the strip of junk that is Route 51, among the strip malls and bad chain restaurants and worse non-chain restaurants, is this hidden gem.

Actually, it's tough to miss.  It's large, with a huge parking lot and lots of neon.  It just doesn't look like it would be all that good.

But you would be oh so wrong to think that.  You enter this odd 50s-look building to see a gleaming, well-maintained interior that's quite at odds with your initial impression.  The classy, attractive menu heightens your sense of anticipation.

The menu is unconventional, with several unusual dishes I had never seen before.  Prices were somewhat higher than normal, but considering the larger portion size, well in line with P F Chang's and other competitors.  

I had a sampler with their General Tso's chicken, Lemon Chicken and white-sauce chicken (the exact name of which slips my mind).  The various flavours were excellent, and complimented each other well, particularly the General Tso's.

Their Two Cup Chicken was also top grade, with first-rate ingredients prepared exceptionally well.

Egg rolls were easily the best I've had in the city, with a crispy shell and quality ingredients inside.

The dining experience was likewise excellent.  They had unobtrusive but friendly service, but the people were friendly when I wanted to talk.

It's a distinct pleasure to review a Pittsburgh restaurant I actually like.  This is easily the best dining experience I've had in over a year of living in this town full of awful restaurants.  It gains my highest recommedation - which is tough to get.

[Update: I occasionally visit Pittsburgh from my home in West Palm Beach, Florida, and I can report that as of November 2011, the food is still first-rate.  The beef portion of the "Black and White" dish is the best I've had, anywhere, with a perfect amount of spiciness.  So far everything I've had on the menu has been delicious.  This place continues to earn my highest recommendation.]
