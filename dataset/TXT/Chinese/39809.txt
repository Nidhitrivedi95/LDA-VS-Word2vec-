ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ Literally grew up here. The waitress know everyone by name, and the food is always great. My go-tos include steak with garlic sauce on rice for lunch, or their honey garlic chicken wings for afternoon tea. 
Trust me, there's no place that makes better Honey Garlic Chicken Wings.
