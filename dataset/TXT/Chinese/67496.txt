emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw For dim sum virgins/beginners, dim sum is equivalent to eating a lot of appetizers for your meal. The staff comes around with food carts and you choose what you want to eat. See below for a link to guide you. I've had a lot of dim sum in my life but this was my first having dim sum in Arizona. I'm new here and in search for good dim sum. 

They calculate all their dim sum size portions (A, B, C, D) the same price, $3.50. We ate a pretty good amount for two people and the total for each of us is $11.50. Dayummmm, you can't beat that price for their quality of food. 

Some classic suggestions if you're new to dim sum (I don't want to scare you off cause things can get a little wild ): baked bbq pork bun, steam bbq pork bun, and pork sui mai. 
For the rest of us who aren't afraid : chicken feet, shrimp fun roll, and steam soup dumpling (Siu Luhng Bao) 

C-Fu in Chandler was not disappointing but I wouldn't say it was good either. I would say I'm still in search of my go to dim sum place in AZ area.
