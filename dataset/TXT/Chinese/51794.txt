I've been eating at chinos for years and it always satisfies my craving for...chinos! The mix of Chinese and Mexican food may seem odd at first but once you check out their tasting/explanation of their food it will all make sense. You can take some classic and wonderfully prepared Chinese or Mexican food items, then add them to a burrito or quesadilla or just have them as is. And don't forget the rice and beans, my personal favorite being the black beans and jerk fried rice. 

The atmosphere is simple and clean, great for a lunch break or casual dinner but not "date night" or intimidate dining necessarily... unless your date is craving chinos! 

My favs, off the top of my head:
Jade red chicken(or pork) quesadilla.
Carnitas burrito
Emerald chicken
Diablo chicken burrito
Jerk chicken quesadilla with vegetables
Jerk fried rice!! 
And volcano cookies!! 
*Drools!*

Forgot to mention, not sure how this made it last, The cookies!! You get a snickerdoodle with your order. These are usually soft, large and amazing!! Even better, if you get lucky their weekend specialty cookie will be the chocolatey chewy volcano! (buy a dozen!!)
