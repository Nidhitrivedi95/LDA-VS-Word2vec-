vX-FwyJ7eINXn_Gn6CqMFg LHK is conveniently located near Nellis Air Force Base. I think they have actually very recently opened and I thought I could give them a try on my lunch break. You have the option of dining in, taking out and delivery. They have a lunch menu with most items around $6.50. I ordered the Mongolian Beef for me and the Kang Pao chicken for my husband. They both came with egg roll, vegetable fried rice and the choice of soup or salad. They actually have a salad bar in there, which is not too fancy and still nice. The food was actually pretty good or better than all the places I have been to in North Las Vegas. Since this place is so close to my work I am sure I will be going back there soon again.
