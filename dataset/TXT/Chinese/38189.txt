AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Friends and I tried this new restaurant after climbing all day in Red Rock. 

Awesome food. This is a vegetarian restaurant that does a range of chinese food dishes with fake meat (gluten). If you are a vegetarian that doesn't care for food that tries to be meat, then there are plenty of other dishes on the menu. All good. I'm vegetarian and don't miss meat but was curious to try things like crispy ginger beaf, lotus cakes, lemon chicken. Tasted great! My meat eater friends said that they came close to the real thing!

The staff are really, really sweet. Very happy and engaging! The owner check in to make sure you are happy. 

We were in vegas for three nights and ate there for two of them.

The decor and setup of the restaurant is very clean and simple. As you would expect for a startup restaurant with the usual startup budget.
