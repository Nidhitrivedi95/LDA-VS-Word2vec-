I didn't expect spectacular service, knowing that lack of service is kind of the norm for Chinese restaurants... and thus I wasn't disappointed.
Washrooms are clean. YAY
Food was delicious YAY
Portions were huge YAY
Prices were cheap (and some surprising specials) YAY
The best are the late lunch specials :D
I usually end up with enough food to pack home for dinner...  which is a huge plus!
