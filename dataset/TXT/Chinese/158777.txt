tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg The only place in Cleveland with legit xiao long bao, soup dumplings! If you've had din tai fung or Joe's shanghai soup dumplings, these will do to satisfy your cravings. Not quite DTF but still damn good. It would be nice if they offered ginger to go along with the dumplings but hey its in Cleveland so I'm happy they're here. And they make these fresh in house! I hope they will offer more variety with fillings in the future, as of right now its just pork. Would love to see a crab xiao long bao, and veggie one (like mushroom?)

The spicy beef noodle soup deserves a nod as well, very flavorful broth with the right amount of kick, tender fall apart beef, and although their noodles are not hand pulled, they import their noodles from Canada, it had the perfect amount of chewiness and tasted so fresh..would've fooled me if they said those were made in house too.

The service was excellent and quick. I did dine on a dreary Tues night and there was only 2 other parties. I hope they continue the quality of service and food as they get more popular, which I am sure they will with $5 soup dumplings! Let's hope they keep their affordable prices too! Great job LJ Shanghai, I'm impressed!
