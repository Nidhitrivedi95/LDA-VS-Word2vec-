zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ So excited to have a great Pho restaurant in the northwest! Our waitress was very pleasant and the food was great! They started us off with a complimentary pot of green tea, which was perfect for the chilly evening. We started off with an order of vegetable egg rolls. These were awesome! Nice and crispy with a great filling. The dipping sauce was yummy too. My fiance and I both got the rare steak bowl. They added the meat before bringing it out to us, so the steak was closer to medium by the time we started eating it. However, this did not bother us at all once we tried the broth! It is so flavorful that even my fiance, the king of seasoning, hardly added anything to it. We will definitely be back! :)
