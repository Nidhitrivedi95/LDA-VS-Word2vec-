-I7Vz5eDjc63xKmmt4Qx4g This place has the worst service. We got to the place at 3pm, confirmed that Lunch Special was still available, ordered but we got charged for the Dinner price. The reason they provided - the order was punched in 3:03 (though they flip-flopped between today being considered a holiday and it being punched in after 3pm). When we asked if there was a manager we can speak to, the answer was no of course and the waitress simply walked away and left us hanging.  I would rank this place 1 out of 10 to be honest.
