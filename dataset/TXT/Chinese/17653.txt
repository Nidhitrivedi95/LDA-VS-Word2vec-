4v_RbefzvGkixXXJkn-bzw I have been going to Szechuan Garden for 25 years.  I always get the same thing:  Beef with Broccoli and Shrimp Fried Rice.  I have never been disappointed.  It's a little bit more expensive than all those store front Chinese restaurants, but well worth the extra money.  I wish the parking situation was better, but a small annoyance for great Chinese food.
