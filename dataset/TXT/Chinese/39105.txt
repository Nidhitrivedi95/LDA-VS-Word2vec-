AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw I miss late night BK here! Prices are pretty good for what you get. $9 gets you 2 choices of meats, rice/noodles, soup and a drink (Before 7). The interior is quite nice and seems pretty kid friendly. Larges TV's which makes it a unexpected decent sports bar. I also tried the tomato chicken&ham twin dish combo, that wasn't good. Pretty bland. Stick with the Meat Combo/Short Ribs. Overall pretty happy with this place.
