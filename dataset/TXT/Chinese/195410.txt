zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Wasn't impressed. The only thing about my order that was warm were the Ginger Scallion Noodles, which were covered with cold ingredients. No broth. To their demise, the Brussels Sprouts were overly-drenched in spicy (sriracha?) sauce and disappointing. Service was great and friendly and the interior is interesting. This seems like more of a place where people think it's (self) important to "be seen" than it is to actually get a good quality of food in comparison to the prices. I'd skip it.
