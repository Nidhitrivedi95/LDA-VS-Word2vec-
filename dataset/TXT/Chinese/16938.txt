4IrX-f_4TqmrKhb7egiZag Today's soy milk tastes as though it is made with expired soy beans.

#83 Spicy fish soup is good though, not in the sense that it tastes the same as the traditional dish, but in that it gives off a delicate and yet flavourful smell. But could be even better without the hot pot ingredients inside: I could imagine a better dish with a more subdued and lighter taste soup.

Nothing good nor bad could be said of today's #141 noodle.
