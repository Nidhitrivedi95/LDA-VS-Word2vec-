S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg I've eaten the  Minute chicken with Cake Noodle, Crispy Gau Gee and Mongo Beef Lunch Special.  It reminded me of Chinese restaurants in Hawaii and it didn't give me diarrhea an hour after eating it so I'm ok with this place.  It's a little expensive and the portion sizes aren't as big as Hawaii, but I'll hit this place up if I'm nearby and need a little taste of home.  I would not drive out of my way to come here though.
