ZMCxAECs6KOhpcWpt8HBiw Old school push cart dim sum. Some items were good and other items could use some improvement. The one that really stood out for me was the coconut steamed milk dessert. I have never seen one of these before so I had to try it even though it was $5.99

I thought it had the prefect sweetness. The steamed milk was silky smooth. The coconut jelly was soft and tasty. Service was quick and items came strolling around pretty fast. The place is pretty big and spacious so didn't even have to line up considering it was a Saturday morning. I'm pretty sure most other dim sum places would have long line ups.
