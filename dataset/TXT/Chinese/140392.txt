r6WO_jkx4rkMMauvPvMDeQ I haven't found a good chinese place until my friend recommended China a Go Go. I ordered for delivery and I was very impressed. My friend and I got quite a bit of food. We got pot stickers, orange chicken, lo mein, general tsao's, and peach boba tea. They told me it would take about 45-50 minutes. It took only 30 minutes or so. They also gave us donuts on the house! The boba tea was in a slush form. I was use to a pure liquid form, but this was very good as well! The food was a little pricey, but for the amount and quality I got, I am willing to pay for it.
