szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A I think you have to be a Dim Sum lover to overlook the long wait and crowds at this place. But many people are! Went the other Sunday with a party of 10 and waited for about 45 minutes, The Chinese American Doctor who was our host actually visiting from Texas had enough and according to his words "used the old language persuasion" to get us seated asap! I am not such a fan of Dim Sum and this being only my second time was amazed at the speed in which the dishes started pouring out. I had this delicious shrimp and pork dumpling, sweet bean cakes etc and Chrysanthemum Tea! It was really wonderful and the veggies were so green and fresh--yumm, would certainly like to try it again if we get a very big party together. 
Beware! It's in the ghetto and Chinese / Asian service and crowds might get to you if you are used to Western fare. The Chinese / American people love it though--there were tons.
