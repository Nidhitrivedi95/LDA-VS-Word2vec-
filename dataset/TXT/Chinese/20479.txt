5zk3LxFzijmY2JipVZ7Xdg I love this place, the food is fresh and authentic. The gals that run the floor are the sweetest, friendly, and helpful. They always make sure that you are completely satisfied when you're dining in or even taking out. My favorites are hot and sour soup, singaporean mai fun, sesame chicken, garlic beef, twice cooked pork, their crispy and spicy garlic shrimp I believe it's called off of the house specials is really good too. Their fried rice is steaming hot and is not too oily/greasy. The portions are fairly big for the price you pay, plus they use fresh, never frozen ingredients. So you pay for the quality of the food as well.
