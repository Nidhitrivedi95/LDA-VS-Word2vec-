wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA Overview: Very clean, chair and table restaurant located a little far from the strip. A bit pricey (100$ for 3 people). Best for dinner with a small group. I would eat here again as well as recommend it to others that enjoy asian tapas. 

Ambiance: modern, medium lighting, played 90s alternative/pop music 

The best dishes I had: 
thai chile nam pla chicken wings - perfectly lightly fried wings with a very flavorful thai garlic fish-sauce glaze, good size wings

hamachi special - very tender hamachi sashimi in a light sweet ponzu-like sauce with a jalapeno slice and garnish on top (my favorite)

Dishes I did not like that I ordered were: 
vegetable tempura - not a fan of their vegetable selection; too oily and can get much better at a sushi restaurant; also eggplant does not taste good in tempura form

asparagus bacon kushi - plain, nothing special (you can make this at home)

shio ayu - very dry and plain (comes with a lemon and some blended daikon as garnish)

Other dishes:
age dashe tofu - beautiful presentation, good marinade. solid dish, like most other restaurants that offer the same dish

crab fried rice - very good fried rice. standard deliciousness

beef tongue kushi - very tough and no sauce. not a fan of beef tongue to begin with but they did a satisfactory job

shrimp kushi - (shell on shrimp with the head) miso butter makes it good and a little different

kara age chicken - tasty and juicy but typical asian fried chicken nuggets

half japanese street corn - very tasty corn covered in their special sauce. A must try if youre a corn lover. pretty presentation.

wagyu beef kushi - 3 pieces of steak, very tender and juicy

shishito pepper kushi - very tender squid, not tough at all (which what I was expecting). Comes with what tasted like a light sesame seed oil glaze
