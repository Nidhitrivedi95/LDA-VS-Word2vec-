GoOkCxPFM5i5lxHgFQMj1w I've been here a couple of times over the last two weeks and have not been happy with the quality at this location.

Food:
It's okay.  I've had better northern Chinese cuisine uptown, and it still doesn't compare to my favourite place, Ningtu, in Vancouver.  The portion sizes are small and especially disappointing when we order from a set menu for 10 people and it probably was good for 6-8.  The two lobsters looked like all the pieces weren't there.  Even the e-fu noodle dish was small and rice and noodles are usually fairly large in quantity given they're the "filler".  

The worst was that we ordered Peking Duck as a substitute, and when the lettuce wrap part came, they didn't have enough lettuce wrap for the whole table (i.e. less than 1 leaf per person seated and we were around 8).  We ordered more and they CHARGED US for the extra lettuce.  

Their red bean pancake was good though, but don't order the red bean in meringue.  They didn't turn out well (oily and dense vs. fluffy and light).

Service:
Restaurant wasn't busy and service was still slow and not attentive.  It seems they aren't used to doing "banquet" dinners because they were slow at clearing plates, getting drinks, cutlery, etc.

Needless to say, I will not be coming back here again despite its proximity to me.
