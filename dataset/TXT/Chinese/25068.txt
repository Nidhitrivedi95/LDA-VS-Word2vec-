76C_syxpetD-muSUe5_ABQ It's like a dodgy neighborhood restaurant you'd expect to find inside The Matrix.

Stepping into Hot Hot on one late weekday evening was like entering a sleepy yet distressed, surreal greenish-yellow tinted world.  I had expected Agent Smith to step out to greet me.

They had no Coca Cola, or any kind of soft drink, in fact.  Nor ice.  There was a choice of hot tea or aloe vera drink.  The latter would do just fine against the spicy that was to come.

For GBP 22.00 a head (looks like the price has risen) a guest can have AYCE sliced beef and lamb, whole tiger shrimps, fish balls, assorted mushrooms, seaweed, imitation crab meat, fish fillets, glass noddles, dried bean curb skin, soft tofu, cabbage, spinach, quail eggs and rice cake slices.  Pretty sure I've missed a few items more.  Four sauces plus chives were all inclusive in the price.

Come hungry.
