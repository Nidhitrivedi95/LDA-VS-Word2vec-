rXVLgV4Og3l98OTy6N2dJw There's been a few of these popping up all over town as of late. When they first set up shop out west (Sauga) it was my go-to place for a quick cheap eat. I am not going to say their food will knock your socks off but if you're looking for a decent quality, cheap and filling bowl of soup during the dead of winter then this is worth a try.

For some strange reason this location isn't quite as good as the one out west. There's something lacking about the flavours here or maybe it's just my emotional attachment out west. LOL

You probably won't find anything in this area that's more convenient for wonton noodles but if you dare to venture out west a little on hwy 7 then I would definitely head over to Jim Chai Kee instead. The latter is heads and shoulders above this place in every category except maybe variety. Though don't expect a textbook like menu of endless items.
