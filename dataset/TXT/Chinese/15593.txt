3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug My favourite lobster place so far! It beats Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant anytime. I just love how many different ways they cook the lobster as it is my favourite seafood. Got the 4 dish lobster combo and it was well worth the price and wait and very filling as well. They also have great dessert to end the meal.
Will definitely be coming back here.
