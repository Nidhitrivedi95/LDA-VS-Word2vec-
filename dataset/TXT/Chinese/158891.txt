U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ Came here on a Friday night, but the whole plaza seems very empty. Don't live here so don't know if this is normal. This restaurant had no one in there so we were a little concerned, but all the food photos outside were very yummy looking so decided to give it a try.

We ordered the stinky tofu, pork noodles (ruo gun mein), and pork chop rice. Since we were the only customers in there the whole time, service is good and food came quickly. The waitress (owner?) is very friendly too. All 3 dishes taste good. The pork chop rice came with some cooked veggies and 2 kinds of pickled veggies, as well as minced meat/sauce over the rice. Very yummy and a good sized portion. The pork noodles is tasty too, seems to have sacha sauce in there which is unexpected, but it's tasty so we didn't mind. The stinky tofu tastes pretty authentic too. I also had the plum tea, which had a good amount of tea flavor and I enjoyed it.

Did not regret coming in! Writing the review a few hours later and it's getting me hungry again!
