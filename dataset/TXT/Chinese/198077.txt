Im not sure why tho..
Everytime we go its very loud and filled with little kids.

-Decor. is cool
-Friendly staff
-Food is alright
-price is average

We ordered delivery a few days ago and it had NO TASTE! It all tasted very strange... it took over an hour to get to our house and we live only 15 minutes away.
