yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA When I'm not eating pho, my other options are chicken pad Thai which theirs are good and Hong Kong style chow mein (crispy noodles). Every dish I have tried has been satisfying, can't complain. This spot is great for after drinking with friend, just lately the wait has been approximately 20 minutes. Vegas heat sucks!!!
