NyGlEmuYcpZSKfk6IwJeSw 5 star experience- great location on the square with outdoor seating overlooking the WI Capitol building! Excellent customer service - very attentive server! Very tasty fries with a wasabi, ginger aioli dipping sauce. They use high quality ingredients like Nueske's bacon in their bacon & egg fried rice which was delicious. The 4 people in our group had a couple of small plates and shared two large plates for just under $40 (just water for drinks). We were satisfied with the portions received. We will definitely return to try some of the other menu items and to order some more of those tasty fries.
