yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA My friends and I ate here for two nights in a row after a long night at the clubs lol. I love how it's open for 24 hours, which is the main reason why we ate here. I'm sure other groups who have been out all night go here for the same reason. There are plenty of seats and we didn't need to wait long to get seated.

Both nights I came here, I had pho with briskets in it. I think it was #15? I'll have to double check. The portion wasn't too big, and I had more meat than noodles the first time I came here, which is fine but I'm someone who likes equal ratios of meat and noodles. It was pretty good, but just in general I don't like the water in Las Vegas, which didn't make this the best pho for me and I always feel queasy when I drink water outside of where I live, but it did its job of feeding me.

Overall I had pretty good service, food came out fast and the dishes itself were pretty good. I would still come here again next time I'm in Las Vegas. Hopefully I won't feel too bad from drinking Vegas water next time.
