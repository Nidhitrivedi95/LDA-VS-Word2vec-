1qTx9z8RMz7RIYKAfnpZ0A Stopped by the Noodle house while at the Golden Nugget. For the downtown Las Vegas Area, I was very impressed!

Waiters were very helpful and accommodating, answered many quested and also had some fine suggestions.  The food came out fairly quick, and the drinks were fast!

Had a decent selection of Sake and Beers, and I wouldn't say you should do there sushi tho.  Not much for choices!

All-around, a great spot to check out!
