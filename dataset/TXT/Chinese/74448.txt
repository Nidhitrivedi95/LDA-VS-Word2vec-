fnLiPkJL0ur4-pS99bgqGA Grand Noodles serves more than noodles.

Think Hong Kong Style Cafe + Noodle. 

There are selected combos available during lunch and dinner hours. Menu though small and limited.

Mustard Spicy Beef on Rice ($6.95) <U+82A5><U+672B><U+8FA3><U+725B><U+8089><U+98EF>

"Submarine" Baked  Pork Chop in Tomato Sauce  on Rice ($9.95) <U+5C1A><U+8247><U+7117><U+8C6C><U+6252><U+98EF> with interesting presentation as the ingredients were baked inside a baguette.

<U+61F7><U+820A><U+5976><U+8336> Old School HK Style Milk Tea
<U+51B0><U+9547><U+5976><U+8336> Ice Less HK Style HK Milk Tea

Pork Chop was amazingly tasty. The tomato sauce was well balanced. 

Overall, all the food we ordered were all above my expectations. A little twist to the classic items in most HK Cafe.

I would come back to try out their Grand Noodles! Hopefully that would be as good!
