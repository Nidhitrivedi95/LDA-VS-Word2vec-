2KOXNZVoxpcwen_JmIQdfA I was in the area and decided to give Pho Mi a try after hearing loads of good reviews from friends. I however didn't have Pho when I went, but rather something called a "Birds Nest", this is a chow-mein style noodle shaped like a birds nest with Chicken in the centre of it. This dish can fall along the lines of a Cantonese style chow-mein dish with a little variance to it. The dish I was served was quite good and was everything I expected from this type of dish, while I admittedly haven't had Pho at this restaurant, the party I was with who had ordered Pho were quite satisfied with their dishes. I would definitely give this place a check if you're in the area and want to have Pho.
