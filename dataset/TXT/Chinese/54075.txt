cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ It's a reasonably nice large chinese buffet restaurant with interesting furniture in a strip mall.  If that sounds appealing, you'll probably like it.  If it sounds terrible, you probably won't.

To me, this restaurant is very comparable to the Mandarin restaurants around the GTA, although I've been here with a couple of people who don't like the Mandarin and do like the Dragon Pearl.

The food is above average for a buffet without being spectacular. There are some relatively authentic chinese dishes and then some westernized chinese dishes and some western food (onion rings, etc), some soups, salads, desserts, fruits. 

There's also some sushi, which is not the worst buffet sushi I've ever had, but it's still pretty substandard for sushi.

The station at the front of the restaurant that serves house-made noodles and bits of 'dragon pearl' is a nice touch, but it doesn't really change the overall feel of the place.

The price is reasonable for a buffet, if you're a healthy eater. If you're not a big eater, I would question the value of going to a buffet restaurant anyway, since you can probably get a better meal for less in smaller quantity elsewhere.
