0J-QM0fIxBNNiSK_n19y9g This place is about 4 doors down from where I get my hair cut.  I decided I wanted something different for lunch after my hair cut this time.  For some reason I expected it to have some worn edges because it has been here so long, but it doesn't.  While being very plain, it is very clean and orderly.

I was the only one eating in on this Friday for lunch.  Two single take out orders also were processed.  It may pick up a bit later, I arrived right after they opened at 11.  I had the garlic chicken lunch special ($4.25) and an iced tea ($1.50).  The chicken also had onions and other veggies.  Even though the plate did not get served with chopsticks I would have expected the chicken to be cut so it could be, several pieces of the chicken were quite a mouth full.  What may have been not enough heat for some in a spicy dish was just right for me.  They note on the menu they can adjust the heat on request.  To me there were no off flavors and I left full.
