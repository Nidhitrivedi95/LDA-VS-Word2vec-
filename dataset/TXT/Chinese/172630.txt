w4EX3F0KjJIXL7O1fFWXJw I finally decided to try this place despite hearing negative reviews from those who visited here. The decor is amazing as they tore down 2 older units in the plaza and made it one huge restaurant. The wooden decor gives it an authentic Asian ambience that we don't usually see in Mississauga. And that's about where the good stuff ends.

We ordered the pan fried pancake stuffed with beef (pancake was dry and hard with thin hard slices of beef with little sauce), Shanghai style stir fried noodles (super oily and underwhelming), noodles in stewed spiced beef soup (this was actually quite tasty, the noodles were made fresh and had a nice chewy texture, the chunks of beef were flavourful and well seasoned, slightly on the spicy side), and an order of steamed dumplings stuffed with pork and Chinese cabbage (the dumpling wrap wasn't too thick and it was juicy and tasty). On a separate occasion, we tried their dim sum - the only good item was the deep fried shrimp dumpling - everything else was horrible (the skin on the har how was tough, the tripe was inedible and was way too chewy, the buns were hard as rock). We ordered a chicken fried noodle and they brought out a chicken fried rice. We told them to return it and make us what we ordered. Then the waitress comes back and says, oh if you take it, we'll give you a discounted price. Ugh!

They also have 2 columns of pricing in the menu - if you pay an annual fee, then you pay the Member price. How annoying! I might go back to this place to buy a bubble tea, but that's about it. I'll rather spend my money elsewhere for better food and service! Their waiters all look like they're daydreaming even though the place wasn't even busy!
