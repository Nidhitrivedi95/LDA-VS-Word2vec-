B3H60GaBic12F4VLBi7-9A What are your expectations for Chinese fast food?

I've been going to Pagoda since they opened almost 8 years ago. I'm not sure why someone said their food is not consistent. To me, it's been consistently good for 8 years. But I don't get wings there. To me, that's not really Chinese food. But then again, what Americans call Chinese food really isn't Chinese food.

They do change staff about every few months. But they are all the same family. Daughters and/or sons go off to school or go do other things. Sometimes they come back. I've known the main cook in back for 8 years and he's always been there. The people that change are the ones you see behind the register, not the cooks.

English language is....good enough. But, yeah, if you have a special order or want something different, be patient, because they really do want to serve you well and will try to understand. It may just take a few extra minutes.

Portions are huge. House Special lo-mein is excellent and enough for two. Shrimp Egg Foo Young is very good. All the soups are good. Crispy Scallion Chicken is very good. Egg rolls are not chewy like you so often find in Chinese places. They are crisp and fresh.

Yes, it is Chinese fast food. Want perfect rice? Cook it at home and eat it immediately. But this is very good. There are a tremendous number of fast food places in this area, and I could go anywhere else. But I've been going here for 8 years and will continue to do so. I've never once been disappointed.
