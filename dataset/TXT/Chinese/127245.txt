pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og We just had a mediocre lunch here. What made it bad was mostly the service. Not sure if they were understaffed but it really wasn't that busy. It started out bad when we had to wait about 5 to 10 minutes just to be seated for lunch. There was nobody in front of us, nobody behind us, and nobody to even acknowledge our existence. 

When someone finally said that he would be right there to seat us we thought he would finish up what he was doing and come seat us. Wrong, he proceeded to clear more tables and more tables before someone else had to come seat us. To me, that is not a good idea to keep customers waiting when you could do that after we sat down. It wasn't like they were busy or needed the tables. Just bad prioritizing. 

The wait for our food was terribly long. The food was mediocre. We also had to wait quite awhile for our check. We hardly saw our waiter during our meal.

I think this place needs to work on customer service more before they continue to lose customers. I'm willing to give the place another try just in case it was a bad day and hope things are different.

The restaurant does look nice and has some potential.
