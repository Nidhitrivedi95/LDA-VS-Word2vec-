cxVp-a28Cp7lavjaPMvK5w Visiting from out of town, had done research but didn't notice this place. I guess, because of the mediocre rating .

We walked by and were surprise on how beautiful this place was and that we didn't know about it. 

We came back later for dinner and happy we found it , as not much was open for dinner on Sunday night.

We loved it !  Our waiter gave us great recommendations , we had the Kobe wontons , Duck dumplings , scallop pad Thai and Rock shrimp . Everything was delicious.  It is small plates,  if you're starving you would need to order more , but I thought the prices were reasonable for the quality . 

Would happily come back ... even sorry that part of our party had left earlier in the day and missed it.
