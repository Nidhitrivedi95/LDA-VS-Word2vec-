Some are a bit scammy with practitioners with little training or knowledge. They bring the whole industry down. Not here though! The doctor is very sophisticated and gives nuggets of sage wisdom. I've had many issues effectively resolved by her. The receptionist is cheery and the place is always clean. You should definitely give Legacy a try.
