This place is horrible!
Overpriced, ($1.50 to pour a different sauce on the little dry ones) lazy customer service (no receipt or napkins offered)  and awful food!
I thought I'd give this place a second chance and I realize I was right the first time.
I had the wings (medium & suicide) they were little dried out & shriveled up, I also
had the sampler (zucchini mushroom and onion rings) all I can say is unflavorful.
My mother had the turkey club with bacon, she said it was OK.
I will not be returning!
