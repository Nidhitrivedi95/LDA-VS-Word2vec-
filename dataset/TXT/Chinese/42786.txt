beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw I ate at Chubby Cattle last night with family and it did not disappoint. This was my first time eating Chinese hot pot cuisine and it Kwan explained everything perfectly and recommended the original broth which was delicious. Sylvia was also extremely attentive and helpful as she knew it was our first time as well. Will definitely be back, everything was fresh and absolutely decadent.
