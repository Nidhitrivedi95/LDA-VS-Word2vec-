44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw I was not impressed by my 1st and last visit to Nee House. Both the egg drop and spicy soup were bland and could use work. The chicken in foil appetizer was chewy and looked undercooked. There was hair in the hot mustard dipping sauce cor the egg rolls. Gross! The cashew chicken was just ok. My boyfriend loved the sweet an sour pork so that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1.
