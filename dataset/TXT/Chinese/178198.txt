x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ So here's the deal with Inchin Bamboo Garden - the service on weekends is meh, partly because of the Indian mentality of not turning a guest (in this case a customer) away. American restaurants are very upfront about waiting time and solid about reservations, but Inchin on weekends? Not so much. I'm not sure if it is because they are brand new and trying to build a customer base or if it's a management problem. Either way, they should fix it soon because THEIR FOOD!

OMG! I think the Indo-Chinese food at Inchin might even be better than some that I have had in India. It was so good that we didn't even mind the can-be-better service. It was worth every minute of our wait. We got Veg Manchurian, Chili Chicken, Hakka Noodles and Burnt Garlic Fried Rice, and LOVED IT! In fact, we went this past Friday and I'm already craving their food. We might go back this weekend.

The place is worth checking out. If you are not up for a wait on a weekend, go on a weekday, but do go. Also, do let them know about the spice levels, just in case. Our food was spicy but we were okay with that.
