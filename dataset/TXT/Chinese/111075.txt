For those that eat dim sum regularly uptown in Scarborough or Markham. This place is considered very pricey.    4.19 for one piece of green onion pancake.   Even Asian legend or ding tai fung is cheaper. 

For the same price I can go to several uptown places and get 2 orders for the price of one.   Dumplings were on the pricey side as well.  But The food also took a long time to come out. But given they are new and the place was quite full.  I don't blame them.  

Dumplings tasted good. Da Lu noodles not so much. Very bland I thought. 

I find in dumpling places hot sauce is very important. They offer a chilli oil (not spicy and no real flavour). And siracha hot sauce as well.
