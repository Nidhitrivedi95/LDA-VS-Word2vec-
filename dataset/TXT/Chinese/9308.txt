1qTx9z8RMz7RIYKAfnpZ0A We were wandering Fremont Street with some out of town guests and decided on Firefly at the Plaza, only to find out it was closed. Yelp helped is find this alternative.

There are 2 distinct parts to this restaurant, the teppanyaki side and the restaurant side.  They really should warn you that if you want teppanyaki, you need to sit at the bar area.  And if you want to be able to hear the person next to you, you should sit as far away from the teppanyaki bar as you possibly can.  While I can appreciate coming and having a great time, the group at the teppanyaki bar was so loud and obnoxious, we couldn't even carry on a conversation with one another.

The food was okay, but for someone who has never been to china and is looking to try something new, the wait staff could not describe the food or how it was prepared (as bad as it sounds, it may have just been a language barrier. The wait staff was authentic and Asian, but we had some difficulty understanding what they were saying).  I ordered the Hong Kong Chow Mein.  In my personal taste, if this is what food tastes like in China, I don't ever want to go there.  The thick sauce was extremely salty, without much other flavor. It did have large pieces of white meat chicken and pork, which would have tasted great if the sauce wasn't so bad.

The price was average, but the food was below average. I am definitely willing to return and try the teppanyaki bar, as the energy and food produced on that side of the restaurant was definitely better than what I received.
