VU5btOpyINHmCfGajZJe0Q Old school tea/dessert parlor. Only a few tables and it's self serve (score! don't need to leave any tip puhaha). My dad ordered the grass jelly and the rest of us ordered the black sesame paste/soup. Super smooth and one of the best I've had. I guess, I shouldn't be surprised, it's Canada! It wasn't thick, or thin, but just right. Drool. It was a nice finish after a meal. 

Be warn, don't take pictures. Although I didn't try, I wouldn't chance it to ruin your dessert experience. 

This place is tucked inside a mall.
