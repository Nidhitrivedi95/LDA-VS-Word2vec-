ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg Very disappointed.  I've been to this location many times over the years, and have always had an enjoyable meal.  Not this time.  All of our favourite dishes have become mediocre (chili turnip, bbq pork).  We thought we'd try the chicken and chinese broccoli.  It was inedible.  When staff asked if we wanted to take it home as it was mainly untouched, we explained it was terrible.  No apologies, nothing.  It's sad, as we did enjoy coming here over the years.  Sad it's gone downhill so badly.
