mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA I had high expectations of this place before I went.

On a side street, hole in the wall, dated decor, and no crowds - GREAT, my kind of place.

The restaurant deserves 2 stars for not being in a casino and having a laid back ambiance.

The food, meh.  I ordered a few things just to sample them and they were rather bad actually.  The tofu was overcooked, the duck (I know I shouldn't have ordered at a place like this) was chewy and did not have a lot of meat.

Might be OK for a quick lunch but beyond that forget about it.  

Extremely unhealthy food.  Trans fat, MSG, and loads and loads of salt.  Well this stuff should make anything palatable and that was barely the case at Thai Vegas. 

The owners/staff were nice, it's not crowded, and the food is a pass - So 2 stars it is.
