D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw I'm just writing this review based on the chili fried chicken because it's probably the best fried chicken from an Asian restaurant I've ever had. Yes, customer service was great, and I did order mediocre honey walnut and shrimp and Mongolian beef, but the fried chicken is to die for which is why I'm giving this place 5 stars!!!! The texture of the chicken is so pristine; it's crunchy with every bite you take. The chili sauce adds to the chicken to give it an immaculate taste. I loved the sauce so much I found myself dipping my broccoli from my honey walnut shrimp into it and eating it. You guys need to come to the Bay Area because I for sure would be there all the time just to order the fried chicken!! I don't know how popular this place is in Vegas for locals but it deserves to get recognized for their amazing fried chicken!!

*request to owners: can you guys brighten the restaurant little bit? I wasn't a big fan of reading the menu under a dim light where I was seated. Thanks!
