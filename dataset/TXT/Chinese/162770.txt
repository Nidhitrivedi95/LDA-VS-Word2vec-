uO-jz7dBD1pzu17V_RIVLw Terrible. When I arrived at 6pm. There were 30 people waiting in the To-Go line and no one in the dine-in line. I was dining in. I noticed 6 cooks. I waited 30 minutes before receiving my food. The vegetable spring roll was greasy, fried and tasteless.  The coconut curry chicken was pasty tasting with cold starchy rice. I have been to other Pei Wei with better food and service. I do not recommend this restaurant. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain
