0QCmxnnuhv-imac5uDeVHw My fiancé and I just moved to Streetsboro a few months ago and were looking for a Chinese food place. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. If you think this is Chinese food, you've never had good Chinese food. The chicken and broccoli was pretty much bland slimey vegetables. No flavoring. Very unimpressed and will not be returning, which is unfortunate because the service was great. A waste of $22.
