NImT1XHwwUmoHaPEjIIwRQ If you're looking for good service or authentic Chinese food, go elsewhere. But if you just need to satisfy a craving for Chinese food that is a few notches above the food court, I highly recommend Szechuan Gourmet. 

That hostess is rude every single time. The waiters looked bored by your order. After the first few bites, everything starts to taste that sweet, brown sauce flavour. But no matter what, I start getting vicious cravings for Szechuan Gourmet if I hadn't had it for awhile. The heart wants what the heart wants.
