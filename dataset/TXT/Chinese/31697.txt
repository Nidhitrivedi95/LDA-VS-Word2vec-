Five stars for exceptional quality and freshness of the food they serve at an amazingly low price. Who would have thought that you can have an outstanding authentic Hong Kong cuisine good for two to three persons ranging only from $ 5.50 to 7.50 per order. No other restaurant serves this calibre of food at this price range. Not to mention the two friendly people who own this place working hard as servers, cashiers and managers all at the same time. No wonder they are able to manage, keep and maintain the prices of their top-notch food affordable. Instead of hiring and paying for servers, they do it by themselves with amazing efficiency. Lower cost of operation means lower food price. Make sure you go for their " Lunch Specials " which are priced amazingly affordable.Try eating at this place and you'll go home with a happy tummy and a smiling wallet! You cannot go wrong with HK Seafood Garden. If you haven 't tried this place out, you are missing out a lot! Hats off to the owners and Staff of this place for serving as top-notch HongKong cuisine at an incredibly affordable price. read less
