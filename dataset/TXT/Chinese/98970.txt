Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Very nice atmosphere here. I have never been in a restaurant where they bring out the food repeatedly on trays, nice and hot. I really enjoyed the customer service and the waiters were patient in their explanations of what each dish was (I didn't know what anything was). There is also a menu for those like me who are not up to speed of what each tray consists of. I recommend definitely :)
