EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ It was my first time trying Ocha Thai Cuisine and won't be my last. Food here was fresh and delicious as well as the service was attentive and courteous. The Laos Papaya Salad was the bomb it's so authentic and tasty probably the best in town! My new favourite place to eat from now on.
