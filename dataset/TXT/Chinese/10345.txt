1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I had heard a lot about Big Wong and so I wanted to try it out after attending a conference in the area earlier in the day.  My craving lately is for salt and pepper anything.  So I ordered salt and pepper chicken wings and bok choy.  

The server was very friendly.  From where I sat I could see directly into the kitchen and that entertained me watching the chef prepare the dishes.  Everything seemed to be clean, orderly and efficiently handled by both the server and the chef.

My food came out and was very satisfying.  The chicken wings had a generous amount of jalapenos and that made me happy.  The bok choy was generously seasoned with garlic.  It was good but glad I didn't have to kiss anybody that day!  I liked that the bok choy was very young and so it made it easy to eat.

As I was sipping on my tea looking around I began to notice a few things.  There are a number of brightly colored posters on the walls.  A suggestion to the management if I may:  I don't see your patrons going around and reading the posters.  The posters don't send a positive marketing message overall.  I think it would look better to take them down and either don't replace with anything or maybe a few pictures on a theme.  I also noticed that while the kitchen and the table I was eating on seemed very clean, the backs of the chairs were not clean and the floors and baseboards need a good scrubbing.  I hope management will think about my suggestions.

I was very satisfied with my meal and I look forward to going back to such a friendly restaurant.
