wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA Nice new spot with great potential. Like almost all new places, small plates. The items are well executed but could use some tweaking. If you order properly and get some noodles or something else as filling along with another item you'll be able to get a good ~$10 deal around lunch. 

Shrimp Shumai - best item I had. A bit more substantial than in other locations with almost a curry flavor running through the wrapper. Shrimp were not rubbery, light and flavorful. 

Chilled Soba noodles - served in a traditional bamboo platter, they don't cling to each other and are properly al dente.

Age Dashi Tofu - nice balance of savory tofu and a mild dashi.

Thai wings - Properly crispy, but could a little sweeter and spicier. Sauce needs to be amplified. 

Char Shui egg rolls - the sweet pork works well with the well designed wrapper. The wrapper was crisp on the outside with a toothsome chew through to the filling. It was served with a hot mustard sauce. The combo worked, but could be enhanced. The problem is the mustard, it is hard to portion onto a bite. Perhaps combining it with warm honey?
