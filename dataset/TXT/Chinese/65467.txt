EbgUkmDxPUa2fr0rc8EFJQ I tried PF Changs for the first time EVER a few weeks ago. Seeing that I love restaurants and Asian food, I don't know why it took me so long.  We had awesome service when we went, our server was training their new manager which I thought was cool. He went into further detail saying that new management has to shadow every job in the restaurant so they get a feel of all parts of the restaurant so they could provide the best service possible. Two thumbs up for that. We enjoyed cocktails such as the PFX (which of course I kept calling the P90X) X-RATED Fusion Liqueur, Mango Vodka and Pama Liqueur shaken with a splash of Sprite and the Lucky Cat Martini (Vanilla Vodka, Chambord, Pineapple Juice)which I will go back there again just for that.

We started off with the famous lettuce wraps. I say famous because anytime I hear someone talking about PF Changs, they always rave about how wonderful they are. They didn't disappoint. When our entrees came out, I didn't realize that it was a family style kind of thing going on but I like that. I always have food envy so I was happy that I got to try other things besides the Orange Peel Chicken that I  ordered. Everything was fabulous......except my fortune in my fortune cookie.
