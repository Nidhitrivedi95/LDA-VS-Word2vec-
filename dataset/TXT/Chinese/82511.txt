Ten years ago, this place used to at least be tolerable, but any more I can't drive past it without sneering and saying, 'oh, yuk.'

The meat is low grade, no matter what kind.  The chicken is fatty, the beef is tough.  Anything fried tastes like oil and not like the food it's supposed to be.  Their sauces are so thick they're more like glazes, and the sugary ones will almost send you into a diabetic coma.  The rice isn't cooked correctly and even the fortune cookie I got last time was stale.

Add to the fact that the people working there are usually not very accommodating or friendly and that the place is filthy, and there's not a thing in the world that would take me back here.
