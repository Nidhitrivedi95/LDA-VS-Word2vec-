Ever since Regal 16 (the dim sum restaurant replaced with Congee Wong) closed, my family has been looking for another dim sum place. We found this place and thought we'd try it out. However, we thought there was not a lot of choice but that was when it first opened. My family will probably try the dimsum place again once my grandma comes back but right now we are a regular at another dimsum place. 

The dinner service here is never a let down. Every time we've gone my family has always been pretty happy with the food and service.  The soup comes in a teapot so it keeps the soup hot and tasty. The soy sauce chicken is delicious. There's something about the added herbs in the sauce that makes it good. There are some orders in the menu (ie. Soy sauce chicken) you need to preorder ahead of time due to popularity. 
Last but not least, we finally had the egg white papaya dessert that has been advertised on the table consistently. There were times we've gone but they always ran out. The dessert comes in a papaya literally and they scrape out all the papaya and put the double-boiled fresh milk mix in. I don't know what they do with the papaya though. The dessert is super hot. Even when we were done eating it, it was still hot. It's only $2.80 on the weekends and $8.80 on the weekdays though. Try to get it on the weekend or public holiday. They do advertise the dessert as best for skin care beauty. I can't say it's the best for skin care beauty as my skin has not been the best lately lol.
