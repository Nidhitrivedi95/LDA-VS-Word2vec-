Q6tqrFKl9lnbhdo95ogSeg Was staying at a nearby hotel for a week and decided to grab some takeaway.  This place was nearby and seemed clean, white and bright in a somewhat well-worn part of town.  The menu is vast, full of vibrant photos of dishes brimming with ingredients.  So I ordered the spicy pork noodles, described as lean pork tossed with noodles, veggies, and a special hot sauce ($9.24).  

When I got back to the hotel and sat down to chow down, I was disappointed to open up a somewhat small container of extremely thin noodles, tossed with very finely ground pork "granules,"  some occasional traces of thin sliced green onions and a few bits of white button mushrooms (boo - no shitake?).

Whomever designed this dish is decidedly a fan of minimalism.  Well almost... hiding under and within my small toupee of hair-like noodles was a dozen or so chunks of semi-steamed tomatoes.  Very blah in effort and not the least bit spicy.  

Overall, it felt like a dish designed to imply volume but that skimps on everything but the cheapest ingredients.  To top it off, they neglected to provide and napkins or utensils, so I had to eat with a plastic teaspoon that happened to be in the room.  If near, skip it.  

Ho-Lee-Bow-Wow.
