IS_IWMsFRJii__17LsP1Og We went here for lunch today and both ordered their lunch special. We both had the red curry and it was excellent! I was very surprised on the quality of the food, it was delicious.  

We ordered the lunch special,  which comes with soup of the day (today was Tom yum), rice, eggroll, salad and the main choice (vegetable red curry). We also ordered a Thai tea, and thai coffee. Everything was prepaired very good, the service was spot on.

The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 stars is because the location and parking lot was kind of hard to get to, and a garbage truck was parked out in front of the restaurant for over 20 minutes because the driver was in the gas station next door.

This is a great restaurant, I would recommend going here. It's a great find, I will be coming back!
