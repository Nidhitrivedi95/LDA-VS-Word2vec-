AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw Came here for lunch and overall it was pretty good! Ordered the noodle with fried pork in black pepper sauce and washed it down with their passionfruit drink.  The food came pretty quick to the table. The fried pork was nice and crispy and very well seasoned.  Eating the fried pork along with  the noodles drenched in the sauce balanced everything out very well.  Will definitely  come back to this place to try out their other selections.  

The only negative thing if can say was that my guy friend had to use their washroom to drop a deuce (not because the food was bad  or anything). After several minutes, I got a message from him on my phone stating that he had no toilet paper.  I chuckled a bit and asked an employee for some TP and held  my breath to go in to give it to him.  Can you imagine if that was you and you didn't have a friend at the time?
