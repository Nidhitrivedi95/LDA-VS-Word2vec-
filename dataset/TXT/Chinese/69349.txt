eZQbDYQTZk0_cBroVxnPWg I'm giving Siu Wok 4 stars not because it's a gourmet restaurant but because the entire menu (as much as possible) is convertible to vegetarian.  I ordered the Szechuan chicken dish but they substituted the chicken for steamed tofu.  Fried tofu is also available.  I really appreciated this flexibility.  The food was great, spicy and plentiful!  Will def be coming back here.
