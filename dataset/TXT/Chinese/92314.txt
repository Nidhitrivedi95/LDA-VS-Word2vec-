IQnUxhO7oieEP7-5ZVJ4uA Ordered take-out from Siamese bistro looking to scratch that Thai-food itch and was sadly disappointed.

The Panang curry had no peppers or "normal" Panang curry trimmings... just curry-broth and green beans. So weird. Also the curry kind of had a sour taste to it and it was sooooooooo salty. Without rice to camouflage the saltiness this would be inedible.

The Massaman curry also really, really, really salty.

The silver noodles were decent, not very flavorful, but we still ate them.

The crab rangoons ~ always the star of the show. Cream cheese, imitation crab, wonton-ed and deep fried? Yes please. These gut busters were great, my favorite part of the meal.
