Rx_ZwOPb6pusIXeLLrBUqA Yes, yes, yes. I tried 3 varieties of dumpling the other day (all of them fried) and they were amazing! The skins thinner and more delicate than many other places, and the filling savory enough to come through in a somewhat smaller package. We tried the pork/pickled cabbage, poark/shrimp/coriander; and the pork/leek/shrimp/egg. My favorite were the ones with coriander, while the most subtle ones were the ones with egg. I would order any of them again, and ate all of the dumplings I plopped onto my plate - then stole one from my sister's. I'm thinking I might just slowly try all the varieties and work my way through the menu.
I'm kind of glad my go-to place for dumplings near Concordia shut down, I've discovered a new favorite!
NB: this is a cash only place, although they do have an ATM.
