Cl-xl1vTUwHeaGgBxzdTRA We ordered the crispy duck.  The duck was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The flavor was incredible.  Really enjoyed it.  Wish I could make it this good at home.  The chow mien was flavorful and had ample chicken.  Really enjoyed it.   For the price and the atmosphere this is now a favorite for Chinese food.
