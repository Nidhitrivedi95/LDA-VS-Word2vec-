wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA I came into Inyo late Friday night after the gym. Surprisingly we were the only ones in the restaurant. We started off with a salmon belly dish (forgot the name and didn't take a picture, we we're too hungry and devoured it!), toro and avocado (very good but I would of liked it more if the fish was colder). 
-Uni udon- so good! I just wish it came in a bigger portion. 
-Thai chili chicken wings- fail! I don't like how sour and sweet the wings was. 
-Japanese style wings- it was ok. Nothing special but it was better than the Thai chili wings. 
-Kakuni- braised for 5 hours and served with daikon. Also ok. 
-Grilled shishito peppers- served with 3 different kinds of salt. They weren't that spicy so it was easy to eat. 
-Oxtail fried rice- extremely salty! We sent it back and the server was very nice about it and we switched it out for crab fried rice. 
-Crab fried rice- way better than the oxtail fried rice! We told the server to make sure they lighten up on the salt, so maybe that's why it tasted so much better. Haha 
-Fried jumbo prawns- the prawns were huge! They were fried and served with a sour lime like dipping sauce. Didn't care for the sauce so I ate them as is. Not bad...but nothing special. 
-Street corn on a cob- this was very good! Corn was chard and served with miso butter. 
-Castilla cake with Mochi and green tea ice cream- the cake was very dry! Like it's old or been in the fridge for too long. The verity of Mochis were interesting... There was a red bean mochi, a brown sugar dusted mochi and another yellow mochi with some type of sweet filling. I wouldn't order this dessert again. 

Overall I had a good experience and the server was very attentive and nice.
I look forward to coming to Inyo again to try the other items on the menu. :)
