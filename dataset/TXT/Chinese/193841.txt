ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ I was just visiting Toronto and found this Chatime across the street from my hotel. The taste was exactly the same as the ones in taiwan.  I would say the Franchise was done pretty well for the quality control.

Although the price is about 5 times than the one in taiwan, I still enjoy having a bubble tea in Toronto.  I specially like the red bean flavor.
