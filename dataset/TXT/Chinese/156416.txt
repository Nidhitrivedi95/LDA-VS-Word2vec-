trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ Had dinner with some friends here on a weeknight.  The appetizers were delicious.  I ordered the burger which I thought was a bit on the bland side.  The restaurant is quite small but atmosphere was great.  Our server had a mix up on our bill and over charged us a few items we never ordered.  She was quick to fix it but came back and the bill was still wrong.  Great place to eat but maybe just double check your bill.
