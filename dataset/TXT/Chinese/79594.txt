gjPRvEiJ2WcUJg7Prv2kQQ Came here with a friend to try some of they specials.. The food is really good and tasty.. Menu is also very organized and with amazing pictures that can guide you..

Overall, The food Is good and fresh but is not a place that i'll come back right on the next day, the service is great too btw, even though we got a new waitress serving us but she did a pretty good job recommending and helping us decide..

If you like chinese food, this is a place you should stop by to try something different..
