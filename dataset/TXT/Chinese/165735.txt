V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA I always enjoy this chain because....duh..I love noodles :)  This restaurant is very busy at most hours of the day and evening.  It is well organized and runs smoothly.  The staff is friendly and quick with orders.  

My food always comes out good.  The breadsticks are always fresh and warm.  Never had any problems or issues.  Never much of a wait.  There is a patio outside, but many little birds flock around, which is not my favorite thing so I just sit inside.  The only compliant I would have is that it gets extremely noisy most always.  So carryout is maybe best at this location.
