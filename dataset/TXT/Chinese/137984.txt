QmNrHxN7UahtdliH_kAuUg Before I moved to California,  I used to live in Pittsburgh and eat at Ka Mei almost every week. After living in California for a few years...I have to come back to write this comment that Ka Mai is the best Cantonese/Chinese/Taiwanese food that I have ever had in USA. Miss it so much...
