QdganL5AW9E_fNoRVroLig Been here so many times. It became one of my to-go joint every time I go home from my clinicals. Love their Pad thai and Pho! The Pho is a little different in this place, its has more flavor in it than any other pho I've tasted, probably because of the celery. (Yes, celery) Best thai ice tea in town hands down!! I enjoy their Mongolian beef and Tom Yum soup as well! I love the service, they serve their food pretty quick. The only thing I'm concern about is the tray area is a tad filthy and they could've clean the area more often than leave plates their for some time. But who gives a damn... they got the best food ever!
