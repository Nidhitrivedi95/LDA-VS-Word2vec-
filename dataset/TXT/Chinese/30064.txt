966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA What a pleasant surprise! I wasn't expecting much but we've gone a few times now.  Clean casual restaurant, fast service (which is necessary with our young kids) and tasty food!  We liked it so much we ordered catering trays for a birthday party.  My only complaint is that the servings are too small and when my hungry husband comes here, he doesn't get totally full on one dish (and he's not a really relatively big man or eater).  It's our go-to place when we're out and about and want to stop somewhere for a quick lunch or dinner.
