The person that answered the phone was far from
pleasant but that was the end of the bad part. The food was of solid quality & quantity. We ordered the Sweet & Sour Chicken, Beef w Broccoli, Chicken Fried Rice & Singapore Noodles. All was tasty & they didn't forget the little extras such as soy sauce & plumb sauce. 

Think this is a do over or a re-order if you will.
