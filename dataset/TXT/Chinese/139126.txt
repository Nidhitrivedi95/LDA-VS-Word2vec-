Came here looking for something sweet after having a meal at New Northern Dumplings a couple doors down.  Can't comment towards their hot dish offerings since we didn't order any..but for a "cafe" my feel that it should be more towards desserts/coffee/tea imo.  Hot dish entrees seem out of place.

We ordered the D6 "Purple Sticky Rice Sweet Congee w/D. Fresh Mango for $7.00 & D10 Mango Tango.  We were really happy on the Mango Tango (wife and I enjoy most desserts with mango) order, however we sorta had mixed feelings on the D6 w/fresh mango.  My wife felt like that it might have been better if served hot instead of cold.  Also the D6 felt like a heavy dessert, considering we just had a semi-heavy carb loaded meal at New Northern Dumpling.  Next time might try the TofuFa.  Interested in the hand crafted mochi but too pricey for our budget (N23) @ $13.00/12 pieces.

The prices do seem to be a bit on the high side, especially considering the portion size.  In the product shot D10 looked like it was served in a much larger glass, yet when it arrived to our table the glass (in the picture I snapped) looked smaller.

Kinda new to the HK desserts mind you.  Anything with Sago we are willing to give a chance, along with anything with Tofu Pudding (Taho in Tagalog)

Their main entree combos : the product shots almost appear to look like clay pot rice dishes.  Also, the prices on their main entrees seem steep, might have to order one time to measure portion size of the dish to cost.  Curious to try : M1 - M5 (skip M3) some time in the future perhaps.

Likely to be back for a return visit for the D10 Mango Tango, along to try other desserts offerings.

Venue is a cozy and a place that people could hangout.
