W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g Very friendly and attentive service. I really dig the modern decor!

The pho tai is nothing in comparison to Southern Cali's 626 area but it comes close.  Good flavor. $6.00

Also got one of lunch specials which is orange chicken, brown rice, egg roll, and a fried cream cheese wanton. Mmm I gotta say man, I really liked their chicken. I'm so use to fast food orange chicken where the meat is covered in a bulky batter and then fried and sauced. This place'a orange chicken is crispy without a batter and covered in sauce. $5.50 lunch special.

Restaurant offers Vietnamese food, Thai, and Chinese. I'll come back when I visit to try other things :)
