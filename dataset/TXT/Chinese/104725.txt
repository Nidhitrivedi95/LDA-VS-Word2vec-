kpxUsRQ7i65ipQ4wLeZKeQ I was here last week because I had a craving for Chinese food and I was passing by...never again, or only in case of dire need. All of the chicken dishes had a suspicious soapy taste (due to decomposing proteins, according to culinary website), the ribs were over-cooked, the spring rolls were OK and the fried rice
too, but there were very few meat or poultry dishes that were edible. The customer service was good and the servers were cordial and polite, but the quality of the food was rather crappy
