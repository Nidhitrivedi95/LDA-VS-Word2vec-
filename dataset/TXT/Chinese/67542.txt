eMTE-wqpk_YWaV3mf7Ii3A Mehhhh mediocre food, nothing bad nothing great, it's like a of Changs, asian that's meant for non asian folks...prices are reasonable $10 for the curry pad thai veggie and $16 for the shrimp and kalbi


Portions are reasonable, service was a bit slow and nice decor

Will probably come back to check out the ayce
