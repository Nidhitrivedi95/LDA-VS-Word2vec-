SRYM6FaIF6LuXldcC1PY8w Roughly 2 weeks ago I ordered takeout from this location. Honey crispy chicken, chicken fried rice, and chocolate cake for my wife, 2 year old daughter, and myself. I do recall the texture of a couple of the honey crispy chicken pieces feeling questionable. Long story short at roughly 3am all 3 of us were awake, sick with food poisoning. It's the only meal all 3 of us shared. The next day I contact the manager to let him know what happened. He took my address, phone number, and order information but no apology, no sympathy for my 2 year old in physical pain. I assumed I would be contacted by phone or a apology letter sent since they requested my phone number and address... Nothing. Very upsetting. Horrible customer service. Food poisoning can happen but just disregarding what happened is unforgivable.
