zkU-WMio8g6dpRJ2Y2xqvQ I would give the dinner food 5/5 stars, everything from the Peking duck to the fish soup, to the lettuce wrap to the crab was all delicious! 

But the servers could really use some work. I don't think a single one of them smiled through the entire dinner, although they were pretty proper-looking. I would rate their service probably a 2.5/5. Sometimes their emotionless face gave me a rude vibe when  I asked for something. This kind of brought the mood down for the dinner. And I was kind of just sitting there enjoying the food instead of enjoying being at their restaurant.
