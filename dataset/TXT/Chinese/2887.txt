_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA This is what I expect from a Chinese restaurant nothing over the top but yummy filling food. I went here with 6 people and 5 of us ordered different dishes. Everyone was pleased with their meals and satisfied by the end. I ordered the bbq pork noodle soup and it was great (a little salty) it brought back memories of my local restaurant back home. I would eat here again when I'm in Vegas.

It is fully wheelchair accessible
