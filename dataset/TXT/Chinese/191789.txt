YWm5z2mu-C-pUuL86fcFxQ We ordered take out last evening from Best Wok.  We had orange chicken, hunan chicken, and sesame beef.  All off the selections were very good.  My selection was the sesame beef which was good, but I did not expect the beef to be breaded.   The menu didn't disclose that fact, but I did order that selection.  Next time, I will order another one of the spicy beef selections.  I am not opposed to returning again in the future, when I am back in town.
