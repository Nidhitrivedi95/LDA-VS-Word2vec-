Maybe it's the handmade noodles, or the authentic cooking, large portions, and low (read: extremely affordable) menu prices. Who knows. All I know is that I love this place. 

Delivery was fast, and I receive my food from an old Asian man, which is a good sign. That's when you know the food is going to be very awesome.

P.S. The pho here is excellent. Top quality noodles and broth. Coming from the west coast, I have unfairly high standards and expectations for good pho, and Wah Kee Wonton exceeded them.

The ja jang mein (Korean black bean noodles) is delicious, too.
