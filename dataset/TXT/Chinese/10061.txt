1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I made a special trip to Chinatown to visit Big Wong based on all the great reviews. It's a solid, cheap neighborhood spot. We tried the things that everybody mentioned: beef ramen and shrimp wontons, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Actually, the beef ramen isn't really 'ramen' per se, but it is a beef soup with noodles. Actually, that's all it is because there literally are no other ingredients. Same situation with the wontons - yeah they're fine, but I can get a fine fried wonton lots of places. And I can actually get a good one some places, too!
The main thing Big Wong's has going for it is the price - everything's pretty cheap. For 2 dishes and 3 drinks, our bill was like $10. Also, the service was very fast and friendly. I asked if they had milk for the kids, and even though they don't serve it, the waitress was nice enough to get a couple glasses for us for $1 each.
Overall, I'm glad I tried it, but there are a ton of better Chinese fast food places that aren't all the way across town.
