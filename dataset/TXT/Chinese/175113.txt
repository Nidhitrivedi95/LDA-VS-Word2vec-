wfWcE4K7vQX1Fjao9Q-12Q This is really a 3.5 star place but I would rather bump them up to four stars.

This place is a sushi bar, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese place!  I like the tables and chairs in here.  It was like going to your Asian friends house.  

I had the green chicken curry - it was tasty and on the spicy side.  I also have had a bento box here.  This place isn't an authentic type of place - but the food is good.  It's a better than your typical neighborhood chines restaurant.

The prices are very reasonable!
