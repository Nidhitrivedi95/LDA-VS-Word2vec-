zkU-WMio8g6dpRJ2Y2xqvQ My family just visited the restaurant today and we had the worst restaurant experience ever in our lives. we knew their food is not the best and most of the time the servers and the bosses give customers attitude. today we went back again because the restaurant next to it was full and we were down to this awful restaurant for lunch. we ordered a roasted duck as well as some other dim sum. they gave us a very ugly over-cooked duck that looked almost in complete dark red/black color. it was in-editable, especially we had elderly and young kids in the table. the worst was yet to come. we reported to the server/boss that we cannot take the duck. we didn't even ask for a refund or replacement, we just wanted to let them know this duck was unacceptable. they CANCELLED all of our our remaining orders and gave us the bill. they literally kicked us out of the restaurant!!!!!!!!! please guys, please don't spoil this restaurant and ever go there. if you are in the area, any restaurant is WAY BETTER than this so called elegant restaurant. totally ashame to have a Chinese restaurant in this neighborhood. don't waste your money there and try out how to get traumatized by a restaurant. please, just don't.
