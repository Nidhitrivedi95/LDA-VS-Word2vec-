JOrz9T33rVHDbusIKPj96g Overall Experience: 3.5/5
Had a craving for rice, noodles and congee and decided to give this place to try. Unfortunately no congee, but added a new Chinese restaurant to the rotation.

Food: 3.5/5
Food tastes good, portions are good and prices are very good. I ordered a noodle dish (which was very good... sorry, don't remember what the dish was called), Seafood Fried Rice, and green beans with minced meat (which was a little on the salty side). Overall the food was above average.

Service: 4/5
The waitress I had was great. She was happily willing to provide recommendations. After ordering a noodle dish off the regular menu, she suggested ordering it off of the lunch special menu because it would be cheaper and come with a drink... that saved me about $2. Service is quick, was in and out of there relatively quickly.

Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Restaurant isn't very big and seating is a little tight. Whether you like it or not, you can see right into the kitchen. The restaurant is quite clean.

Tips & Recommendations:
-Limited parking shared with many other businesses
-Lunch Break Friendly? Yes
