aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg Disappointing 30 min. Wait, small place extremely loud like a fast food cafe. Ordered pork combo $14.99 was like an appetizer size and cold and dry. We ordered 3 dishes one person got there food combo chow fun after other two people almost done eating and not much flavor. Service was not good , had to get up twice once to ask for spoons for our soup brought to us another time for our 3rd dish we didn't receive until other 2 almost done also asked for water and never got it. Also nobody ever checked on our table or if our food was ok.
