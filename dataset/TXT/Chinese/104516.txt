KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ I've been here many times and some meals were more memorable than others. The place is Asian but it does not seem very authentic to any particular region, maybe more Chinese/Hunan. The menu is large with many options.

The appetizers are great - spring rolls, hot & sour soup, lo mein all good

I have had some of the beef and chicken entrees and I remember the beef ones were good.  The almond crusted chicken is a specialty I believe and once I had it was so dry as if it had been sitting in the warming oven all night and dried out.

The desserts are ok and they have a good variety although I don't think any of it is made there, nor is it authentic Asian. The tea was a disappointment. They had only a few selections and they are all tea bags, no loose leaf tea options. The green tea was not really drinkable.

Lately they have had a tasting menu which I ordered and it includes soup, chicken, and beef/lobster. It was a very large portion and very tasty. I think I have had it twice now and one time I couldn't even finish it.
