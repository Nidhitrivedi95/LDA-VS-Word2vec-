PXjFfAdj7ZJ6M5Rm19lw3w Billy makes good dumplings. They include meats and sometimes spices, wrapped in flour served boiled, steamed, or pan fried. On the table are spy sauce, vinegar, chilli oil, and sriracha sauce. Small orders are around ten dumplings, large orders around 20.  Prices are reasonable, even low for the area. The first time I are there, a woman was behind a glass cage visibly making dumplings.

It's hard to find fault with this "what you see if what you get" dumpling house. You want dumplings, you order dumplings, and you eat them. They taste the way dumplings should.  One disappointment is that the pork buns were not great but - and this is a big but - why did I order pork buns at all?

If you're near bloor and Bathurst and you want dumplings, eat here. You want something else? Go somewhere else.

Oh one last thing. Not everyone likes to mix the soy sauce, vinegar and chilli oil together. I say go for it.
