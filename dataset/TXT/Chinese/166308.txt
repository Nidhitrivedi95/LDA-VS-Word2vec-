On 12/3/16 I had an urge for Szechuan food en route to Santa Fe Station. Being already familiar with the Chinatown region of LV from a visit to Yunnan Garden a few years ago, I selected its next door neighbor based upon the Yelp reviews.They opened promptly at 11 as advertised and I was the first customer in this clean and sparely decorated restaurant, the most notable decorations being the many blown upon accolades from Los Angeles and Las Vegas publications. 

A young lady brought a pot of green tea to my table. The tea here is exceptional. I really enjoyed it. Those who are unfamiliar with Szechuan and/or Northern Chinese cuisine should take the plunge here. I am familiar with those cuisines which feature great dishes like Mapo Tofu, Cumin Lamb, Fish in Chili Oil and my personal favorite, Sauteed or Twice Cooked Pork Belly with Chili Leeks.I chose the latter.

The Pork dish ($13.99) was very good, although not as good as versions I've had in Manhattan.The portion was extremely generous. The pork was nice and fatty. Szechuan Peppercorns gave the dish a pleasant heat and a nice afterburn., causing me to sweat slightly.There were plenty of Leeks in the dish.It came with a family size crock of white rice(which I had to request......more about that later).Fortunately, there was quite a bit of oily sauce to soak into, and make flavorful, that ample amount of rice.

While the kitchen was fast, there was no further attention paid to my table after my meal arrived, not even a simple "how is everything?"........and they charged me a buck for the white rice, something I have never seen done in my almost 50 years of eating Chinese food. What's with that?

Despite the foregoing minor carping, Chengdu Taste is a solid Szechuan restaurant to which I would definitely return.
