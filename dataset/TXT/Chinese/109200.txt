lmfyEVKm3CDGWg18LeRhgA Disgusting all around!!! You get what you pay for here. Filthy tables and dishes. Unsanitary food and drink handling. I'm surprised this place hasn't been shut down for to many health code violations. My coworker had told me this place. It used to be amazing but all of sudden went way way way down hill, he was completely right. I would not recommend this place to anyone.  However the hostess was very nice and polite. But do not come here, there's plenty of good Thai food places around. I'm scared I'm going to have food poisoning.
