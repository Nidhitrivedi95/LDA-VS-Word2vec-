rca1HN4qRsZfmpxmlFWNDQ Want Chinese take-out or a quick lunch spot?  Hong Kong Express might be your spot!  They have many pre-made selections to choose from and a menu that offers many quickly made Chinese favorites.  Despite this convenient quickness and good prices, the food is still pretty good!

I'm a big fan of their preserved pork and egg congee.  Yum!  

Hong Kong express is located inside the Chinese center grocery store.  

See ya there!
