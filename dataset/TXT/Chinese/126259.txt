Ozf92eEJSwwb3LbO50cvag My first visit here I wasn't impressed. I tried to order white rice, and the waiter couldn't understand me after repeating myself 3 times so he brought me fried rice. It was just okay. 

However, the second time my boyfriend and I came here we were quite impressed. We walked in at 7:45 PM on a Monday night and the place was empty. We were the only ones there. The waiter this time spoke and understood good English, which was nice, but he was a tad bit awkward. But that's OK. 

Every meal service starts out with complimentary wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce. We ask for a side of spicy mustard with them. Try it- it makes them taste a lot better! We ordered some crab puffs to start. Six of them come per order for around 5/6 dollars. They are quite small, so the price for the value is just alright. Otherwise, they're pretty good and are not overly cream-cheesy like the ones you'll find at other Chinese places. 

For dinner I ordered the string bean beef and my boyfriend ordered the orange chicken both with white rice. My string bean beef was exceptional. Not to mention the portion was HUGE (like 2 meals worth and I can eat a lot!) which made the price of around $12 worth it. I'm not a huge fan of orange chicken so I didn't try his, but my boyfriend really seems to like it and he is the pickiest of picky eaters. They also give you a really nice portion of rice which is cooked really well. 

Altogether, the meal with two drinks came to about $35, which isn't bad considering the portion sizes. Much better than Panda Express value. Perhaps my favorite part of the meal are the complimentary banana desserts that they give you that are wrapped in wonton paper and coated in a crunchy caramel like sauce. SO good!
