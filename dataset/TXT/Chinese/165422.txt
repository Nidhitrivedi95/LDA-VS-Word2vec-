Came here on a weekday morning and the service was extremely slow. Took almost 30 minutes from when we put in our dimsum orders to our first food. Service in general was also rather poor, we always had wait a while before getting any waiters' attention for refills/bill/etc.

Super cheap prices and even their "tea" price is very reasonable. The tea itself is rather poor quality and the water isn't that hot. The food itself is better than you'd expect, very, very warm and with our highlights being the tofu/vegetable rice noodle roll and the steamed tofu/shrimp dish. 

Definitely a good deal for the price you pay, but overall, service could be better!
