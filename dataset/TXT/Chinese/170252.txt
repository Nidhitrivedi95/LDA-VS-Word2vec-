VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q Good noodle soup selection and the service is usually pretty fast, so if you're looking for a hearty lunch or dinner, Deer Garden is a pretty good joint.

The price has gone up more recently - somewhere around $9.00+, but for what you get, you can't really complain.

The only real downside is the accuracy of your order. I've had a couple orders with ingredients that I didn't select, so if you're picky, take your chances. Your odds are good though... around 75%. 

If you're into spicy things, consider the Szechuan soup, just don't get those peppercorns down the wrong tube :)
