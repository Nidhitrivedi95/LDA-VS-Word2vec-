qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A What a great place to go eat! I have been to a few PF changs in IN and IL was my first time in this location. Amazing service and we sat outside. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. I had the Mongolian beef and they made it spicy for me not sweet. I will be going back again ;)
