VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng This is the best Asian buffet in Las Vegas. You can't beat the selection and price. It's about $10.50 for lunch with a drink and about $15 for dinner with a drink. They have Mongolian bbq (excellent), sushi (yuk, you need to cook that stuff, back home we call that bait) and 4 center hot buffet bars with food and 2 cold buffet bars with fruit and deserts.  I would give them 5 stars but they always seem to have a restroom problem. Time for a renovation and upgrades there. It will probably be a nightmare to do because they are always packed
