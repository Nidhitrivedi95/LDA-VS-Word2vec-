tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw Egg Drop Soup: it was nice and creamy - it was just ok. 

Vegetable Egg Foo Young: AMAZING! Fluffy, Crispy and the sauce was not too much and it complimented the dish perfectly. 

Kung Pao Chicken: We ordered it regular & it was bland. It tasted as if the chicken was cooked bland & separately from the sauce so when it was combined it did not have as much flavor as it should have been. The sauce wasn't bad, I was disappointed since this was one of my absolute favorite dishes and it just did not have much flavor. 

It was a recommendation how we found this place, at least the Egg Foo Young was worth it oh and the hot tea was not bad.
