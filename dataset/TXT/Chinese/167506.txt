VGxJbglGlx-a7Gdc55Q6jQ I love this place.. Fresh sushi delivered!! I can't get enough. Eaten here several times and tried a few things and im always pleased. Im a vegetarian and my fav are the sweet potato tempura Maki rolls. Today I tried general tso's tofu (I asked for extra crispy). It came deliverer perfectly done.
