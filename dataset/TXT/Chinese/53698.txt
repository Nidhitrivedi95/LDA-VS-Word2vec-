cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg Found out about this place just last night (thanks fellow Yelpers,) and "man" do they have a thriving business!  If you're looking for a dining experience, this isn't the place. It's small.  A hole in the wall?  More life half a hole in the wall.  I went to get take-out and had a heck of a time not getting in the personal space of seated patrons - though everyone seemed happy and content. Feeling too close for comfort I made a hasty order of sweet and sour soup and Mongolian Beef due to the photos here on Yelp.  Just "so-so" on both.  What I should have done was taken the menu and stepped outside to see the full line-up.  After looking it over at home, I feel I got cheated (cheated myself) out of an "experience."  Yep, I'm going back!
