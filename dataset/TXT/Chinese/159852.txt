U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q the only cool part of this place is the gold fish tanks and the interior of the restaurant. the decor is the only reason this place gets stars.. 

the food: gross... i mean seriously. they make only one type of noodle here and there is no way to have it any other way then the way it is on the menu. the portions are pretty small, so if you like noodles its going to suck for you, I love noodles and it was quite sad for me. the hainan chicken rice was decent. the dim sum shrimp "har gow" was good and very shrimpy. but for 9 bucks you better hope so.  the soy milk was okay a little bland, the watermelon juice was good. o the vietnamese coffee, dont get it. its not good at all... 

overall the noodles are good. i just wish it was flavored better. the tomato based sauce noodles was good and the mushroom one was kinda too grocery store frozen food for my taste. o yea.. the dumplings both fried and steamed sucked so do without those. 

haha.. good thing i didnt pay for anything. LOL i would have been annoyed even more.
