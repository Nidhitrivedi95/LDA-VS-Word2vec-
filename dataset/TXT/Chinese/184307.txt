xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A Walked in for some bubble tea and a snack. Ended up just getting the bubble tea to go. Place smelled dirty and oily, and seemed like it wasn't thoroughly cleaned in a long time. The bubble tea was the most artificial and watery thing I have ever had. Flavors were extremely fake, tea might as well have been water, hardly any boba, and we paid for extra fruit jelly but didn't get any. Total rip off with unfriendly service from the lady at the counter. Not worth the trip at all. Take your money elsewhere. Many good bubble teas in squirrel hill with nicer restaurants!
