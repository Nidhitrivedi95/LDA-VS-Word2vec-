The experience at Northwood is special, from the music to the staff and (most importantly) the drinks. It's the perfect spot for date night drinks, or catching up with a small group of friends. 

I can't think of anywhere else in Toronto that you get 2-2.5 oz cocktails for such reasonable prices ($11-14 for most), and they are some of the best drinks you'll have in the city. My boyfriend and I went recently and each had 3 cocktails, each better than the last. Our favorites were La Commune and Black Walnut.

The bartender we had last time was fantastic. She managed to get cocktails out to 30 people quickly, was able to answer questions about the drinks, and was really friendly. 

Can't wait to go back.
