Mv-15Zh_yzGZ8KbcN328GQ I am handicapped and a dialysis patient as well and cannot drive on days I have a session. I got onto the website and it said delivery so we ordered the items we wanted and then when I was checking out with the address and info it says NO DELIVERY.Put in a future date for delivery,What I am going to wait for several days to get my order. On one of the back pages it list the days they deliver Fri-Sun only as of right now the delivery is closed,That info should have been on the front page when I clicked on delivery.Thankfully (The China Grill on 75th Delivered)...Fortune says . We wont be calling back here anytime soon
