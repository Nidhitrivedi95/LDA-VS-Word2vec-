Stone Cafe is a new Hong Kong Style Cafe replacing New Broadway which used to be Broadway. 

The interior is clean and simple. The staff is super friendly and even fills up my tea cup! Service is excellent compare to others HK Cafe I been to. The waiters are from previous New Broadway..

Menu has a choice of HK Cafe staples and of course specials any time when one drops by for a quick meal.

Lunch Specials from $5.50/Afternoon Tea Specials from $3.50/All Day Specials from $4.99.. And of course they do have their house special Hot Stone Pot rice.

Cuttlefish Balls/Seaweed Noodle Soup with drink ($4.99) plus a side order of Veggie ($1.00) is definitely A-OK. Maybe a little on the smaller size portion wise but great as a light and healthy snack.

Free Wifi just ask for the password. And in my case, the friendly waiter just told me even before I asked!

10% Grand Opening Special. I guess I will be back for some cheap eats!
