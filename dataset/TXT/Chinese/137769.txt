QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw I love Mini Hot Pot! It's delicious! Great service and the owner is very kind! He always helps us pack our leftover broth home. The Thai sour soup is my favorite!  A tip I would give is to order a la carte and pick your own broth and sides, meat/veggies. I usually do beef, anoki mushrooms, and Chinese veggies. I can't wait to eat at Mini Hot Pot again! :)
