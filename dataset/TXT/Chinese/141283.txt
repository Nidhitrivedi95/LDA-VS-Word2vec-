rEAFZFziiOWxSLsOLohccQ My family and I went to Ann's for the first time.  We were pleasantly surprised at how flavorful the food was as it is hard to find a good Chinese restaurant in AZ when compared to Chicago where I grew up in the Chinese restaurant business.  I don't think there is a Chinese menu but the owner did come out to talk with us about the menu.  The place appeared clean and the ambiance and decor classy and contemporary (like a bistro) unlike most of the other Chinese restaurants here in the valley.  The servers were very attentive, friendly and polite.  I will certainly return as this is now my favorite place for Chinese food.
