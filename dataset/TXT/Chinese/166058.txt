vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw Food Express Chinese Restaurant is just okay Seems like a family owned restaurant I mean the price I would say was high for the quality of food we had received and also they do not offer delivery service I would rate this place higher if it had a delivery service will most likely never eat here again it's designed to be a over priced sit in Chinese food place not what  the public really wants
