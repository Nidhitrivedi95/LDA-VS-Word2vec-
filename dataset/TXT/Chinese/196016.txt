zkU-WMio8g6dpRJ2Y2xqvQ It has been a while since I dine here. The food quality had dropped so much. I loved the dim sum here before, but now I have to reconsider. I have a really high expectation when it comes to dim sum. You can call me picky and all. I ordered 5 items and I only ate a 1/3 of the food and packed everything to go. The only consistent thing here is the tea quality. It is still fresh and tasty. Overall, I wouldn't come back here unless I have to. Time to search for a new dim sum  place.
