The food was just OK. The selection was limited but had the dim sum staples. The har gow dough was a huge flop, way too doughy, and it was fishy. The Xiao Long Bao were over cooked, so much so there wasn't any soup inside. The service I thought was good. Everyone checked in on us as they walked past, and I didn't feel like any of the cart movers were too pushy. 
I could not get past the shady, dilapidated strip mall it was located in. Right outside the restaurant entrance is a large dirt area roped off that is filled with cigarettes butts. This is INSIDE the building. It reeked. I was genuinely worried about the safety of the building. 
Sadly, unless the building undergoes renovations, I won't be back.
