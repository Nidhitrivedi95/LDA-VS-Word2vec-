vU8-ATy2-MASm-bQXdhRaw I love Pei Wei. The food is delicious. The service is usually super fast. Only problem we had today was a stray piece of chicken in my vegetarian daughter's lunch... Oh oh!

Overall they have a lot of tasty options for carnivores and veg-heads alike. And you can order any of their menu options with vegetables and tofu, and I have to say, the way they prepare tofu is my favorite!

For relatively "fast" food, Pei Wei is an excellent option for delicious and healthy dining out.
