qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w I do love this place, don't get me wrong.  The star docking is merely because they do have some things that they can improve on. First of all, their food is great! I have been going there since the first day they opened and the quality of their food is always fresh, bright and delicious. Their lunch and dinner combinations are a great deal and definitely worth the money.  Their egg drop soup is one of the best I've had.  It's not filled with peas or carrots, nor do they put soy sauce in it. It's like good old fashioned soup. 

Now, on to what could be improved.  When I first started going there, their service was amazing.  No longer than two minutes after making my order, was my egg drop soup sitting on my table piping hot. By the time I'd finish my soup, my entree was on the table.  Nowadays, the service is not as quick.  Maybe because they are much more busy than they once were with to-go orders but I seem to do a lot more waiting in their restaurant than I used to.  This even goes with takeout.  Always add on at least 5 or 10 more minutes of waiting time than they say on the phone.  Needless to say, they are always super friendly there and like I stated earlier, the food is great.  I will continue being a loyal customer.
