T4JGbW9XEGQVrLpQcNFXtA My wife and I shared a great meal here. The food was delicious, the portions generous enough to feed two people and the atmosphere relaxed and inviting. The staff is very attentive and you almost had the feel like you were dining in your favorite aunts or grandmothers home where relatives go out of their way to make certain you are enjoying your meal. There are lots of great things to explore on the menu. If you are looking for an unpretentious Chinese place that is well kept and welcoming with really enjoyably tasting food the Sun Luck Garden is worth a visit. The prices are also very reasonable.
