The staff is one of the friendliest I have ever experienced in a small establishment like this, and the service is quick.

I had the Chicken Kon Bo, and it was exactly as it should be, HOT, spicy, filled with chicken and peanuts.  The rice was good, and the eggs make all the difference in the world when it comes to the sticky rice.

The portion size was perfect  making this location back on my short list of food restaurants.

Excellent take out option, very reasonably priced.
