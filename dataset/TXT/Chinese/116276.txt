Prices are considered to be cheaper than other restaurants of the same nature. 

They have a staggering amount of items on the menu but try to avoid ordering fancier stuff like the sushi and seafood. 

I would say the service is of typical Chinese quality. Lots of Westerners come so they are more English-speaking friendly than other places.
