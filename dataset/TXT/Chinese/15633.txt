I should have opted for a different dish (perhaps Mac and Cheese or sorts or some Italianish sort of thing). 

Despite the location being new, everyone seemed to have already been through the pains of being a new store.  Very busy too even though it was during the seasonal break (which was why we opted to venture there when we did).  Service was quick and good!  I will definitely come back, but the next visit will definitely not include Pad Thai!
