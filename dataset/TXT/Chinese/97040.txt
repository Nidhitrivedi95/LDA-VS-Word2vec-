JOsBOphWK14yjq7FC1zL5w When you have a Chinese food craving you are looking for something specific. Sometimes you just want to cure that hangover with something greasy or experience something finer. China A Go Go is that perfect place in between when you're looking for tasty Chinese food on the go. 

For a family of 4 adults and 3 children, we ordered quite a bit using the Yelp app's delivery option, Yelp Eat24. We easily plugged in our order, received a free Crab Rangoon in the process from a deal they were having, and added tip all at the same time. Using the app was so convenient, especially since our order was so large. End are the days of over complicating a take out order!

Within the hour our delivery guy arrived and our order was perfect. The only hiccup was that en route the Thai Boba Tea had spilled, but our driver surprised us with a return trip with a fresh tea at no extra cost. Talk about amazing and thoughtful customer service!

Overall our food was delicious and without any faults that I could note. The Mongolian Beef, Shrimp Fried Rice, and Combination Noodle specifically was so tasty I couldn't wait for seconds.

I couldn't rate this Chinese spot enough for their food quality and customer service! We were so pleased with everything from how easy ordering was to sitting down and enjoying our meal. Definitely they will be an establishment we'll eat from here on out while in LV!
