_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg $9.99 for dinner and even on the weekends is freaken awesome!!! Ok so this buffet doesn't have the typical crab legs and the sushi isn't all that great but their price is well worth it for their dishes.

The Asian dishes they have here look like normal buffet dishes but they are so much better! Everything tastes really good when u eat it.

They even have raw oysters here which I love! Before when I went here, their shrimp cocktail was peeled but now they have a different shrimp cocktail that has the skin on and looks a bit different. I liked the old shrimp better. Their sushi isn't authentic and you can tell its been sitting out for a while. I usually don't eat much of it.

The service is great though and they're very attentive. I like coming to this buffet often because dinner is only ten bucks and it includes great dishes, raw oysters, and crawfish which is worth it to me. They also have great low mien and american BBQ ribs that I like.

The reason I give it 4 stars is because I always have to ask them to refill some of their trays but that's the only down side. Everyone should eat here!!!
