fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA I ordered a trio of steamed dumplings - mushroom & spinach, pork & chives, and pork & chinese cabbage. the taste was ok & the wrapper was too thick - almost like a perogie or samosa wrapper & not the wonderfully thin wrappers chinese dumplings are famous for. I would never go back.
