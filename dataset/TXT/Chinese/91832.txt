iKzXIGPzUAuM2hs2RXEQFw I should have known better. I have never been to a good sushi buffet and this was no better.  The place seems clean and all the food is set up neatly on the buffet. But I had two plates of different foods and i couldn't finish any of it. I was excited about green tea ice cream, but even that wasn't good. The sushi was pretty but the fish didn't taste fresh. The Philadelphia roll was pretty good. I just can't give it more than 1 star because I thought everything tasted like dishwater. Some of my dining companions enjoyed it more than I, stating that the mussels were really good.
