RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg I am extremely furious at this place right now. I am nine months pregnant with a one-year-old we come here a lot I've never had a problem before. Today for lunch after I order I am told that that's a lot of food then about five minutes after my food arrives they come over take my play box it up and give me my check and tell me to leave. My son was not loud or distractive he was eating his food and they kicked us out and expected a tip. I will not be coming back to this place
