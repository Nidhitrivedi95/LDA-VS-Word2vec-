DQMaUSbKsRtB5lJD3egqxQ i placed a order online tonight night for the coconut chicken along with a few other things. I have never ordered food from here before, but i heard the food was great. after about a hour and a half we got our food cold at our home. witch i could look pass( they may have been busy or couldn't find our house) but when i got my food.( thinking i was was getting coconut chicken) it turned out to be mostly tofu with a little chicken. Now i don't have a problem with tofu at all. ha long bay has some great tofu dishes but the huge chunks tasted awful.  so i ended up throwing out most of my dinner just eating the rice and the few little chicken chunks in the dish.  good thing 90% of the dish is white rice otherwise i would have had nothing to eat. i don't think i will ever order the dish ever again. i may try something else next time with hopes it is better.
