2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w I don't come here very often and when I do, it's takeout. This time we sat down. I'm not sure how there could be a difference but the food tasted excellent tonight vs takeout! The sweet and sour combo (chicken, pork, and shrimp) was fantastic, especially the shrimp. We also had the pot stickers double pan fried for an extra crisp...yum. The egg rolls were crisp and flaky and were wonderful. I definitely left satisfied.
