fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ Emi and the waitstaff did an excellent job helping us coordinate our reception dinner for our wedding. We were thoroughly impressed with the way our banquet turned out. The party definitely loved the food. It was the best food at an Asian wedding that we all ever had. 

Emi was very responsive in coordinating my wedding dinner plans. We sent over 200 emails total between each other. We didn't have a wedding planner so I ended being it. She streamlined everything and it came out exactly the way we wanted it to. I am so thankful to have her be such an integral part of our wedding.

The waitstaff were very accommodating and friendly. Whatever we needed at that moment was taken care of immediately. I don't remember having to ask twice for anything.
