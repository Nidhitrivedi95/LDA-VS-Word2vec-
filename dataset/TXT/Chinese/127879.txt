pdy6EAcJvZks1hKogxOj6Q As decent Chinese delivery options seem to be sparse for those of us who live North of the 101, this place is pretty good. Ordered four different spicy dishes, though not as spicy as I or anyone else who was eating with me wanted, all the dishes had a good flavor. Nothing was over salted, the meat was a decent quality and unlike other places I've eaten and wasn't all fat and gristle. They also get extra points for not using that red sickly sweet, sweet and sour sauce. It was light pink and still a bit sweeter than I liked, but it was tolerable. The rice we had was a bit overcooked, but still for the price, quality, and quantity it's a great option for those of us in the North Valley and find it too hot to go out of the house or cook.
