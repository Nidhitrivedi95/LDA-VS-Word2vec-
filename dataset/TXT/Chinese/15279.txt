3PhF188adiC8ZutKRP9gyQ Great vibes here. Really great for a hangout with friends and you want a quiet area to chit chat. Also, the desserts here are not to sweet which is great. 

Items I get that I personally love are 
- Sesame Rice Balls with Crushed Peanuts: (which have black sesame on the inside) - tastes so chewy and they come out warm! 
- mango pudding: tastes sweet and creamy
- Tofu Fa: steamed tofu with brown sugar or syrup on the side - great dessert for sharing between 2-4 people. Also comes hot/cold. I love hot for those cold winter months 
- Durian Pancake: crepe on the outside with whipped cream and durian on the inside
- Herbal Jelly: you can get this bitter or less bitter. It's VERY strong but having one is great for your body
