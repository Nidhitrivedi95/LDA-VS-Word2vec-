6MhY_9EkUkKCvvN8rzXZzg Well worth the $. We will definitely come back. The only reason we didnt rate it at 5 stars is because of location and outside appearance, but the inside was clean and had a nice set up. When you first walk in you wonder what you got yourself into as the kitchen is right in the front. The food was delicious. We ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp, Beef Teriyaki, fried rice, egg drop soup and Crab Puffs and 2 iced teas. Everything tastes great! Our bill came out to $36.00. Be back again with the rest of our family! E&O
