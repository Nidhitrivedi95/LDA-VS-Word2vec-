AbgNPAnuq8X90DUw5FQ2sQ loooovvvee coming here... someone introduced me to this place recently and I can't stop raving about it. Their items and dishes are very similar to Hong Kong style food.

This is not your typical Cha Chang Tang as the restaurant offers a lot of dishes suitable for dinners. 

Their menu items are reasonable priced.. nothing is too expensive.. I don't think I have tried anything that I didn't enjoy at all from their extensive menu.
Also, their afternoon tea special is such a bargain.. you will be so filled up..   

The wait time for a table is not long too.. I usually waited max 10 minutes.  

Customer service: always prompt and no forgotten orders at all.   
Bonus at the end: you get a free mango tapioca dessert at the end :D  

Love their hot pot rice. (well worth the wait), their red bean drink, the mustard steak cubes etc.


The negative: 
 
no medium round tables for groups of 5 to 7..  so need to sit at a long tables.. which makes it hard to share food, especially when all the limited booths are taken 

so few big round tables

the entrance can be confusing as a lot of people think the entrance is the one facing on hwy 7 when you see the sign as you drive back but the entrance is tucked inside Chalmers.

closes way too early!! Need to stay open later ahh~~~!!

The tables at the entrance not very desirable since you are facing everyone while people walk by and  look at u eating.. 

no more BBQ roasted pork  :(
