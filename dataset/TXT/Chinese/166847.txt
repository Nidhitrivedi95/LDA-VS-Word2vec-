We came after a day at beach volleyball, a group of 10. We didn't have a reservation. It was between lunch and dinner time, so they were fairly empty and able to accommodate our group. We got about 7 dishes, a rice and a noodles to share. The food was delicious! They servers were fairly on point about spice levels and tastes and sizes, which was great. The best part was, splitting all those dishes amongst a big group, we ended up paying about $10 each and it was a large variety of dishes. AWESOME! 10/10 would return.
