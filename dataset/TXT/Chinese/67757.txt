eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g Have to admit, impressive decor the moment I arrived. I have been there twice for dim sum and once for dinner.

Dim sum - you will soon realize that the choices are very limited, about less than half of the choices you would get at a typical dim sum place. The reason why? They want you to order from the other page of the menu, which range from $15 plus for veggies, bbq ribs etc. the worst part about it, the servers constantly try to up sell you will already prepared crabs or lobsters. I am here for dim sum, not the leftover seafood from last night. The idea is that they lure you in for lunch and hopefully you will come back for dinner which can cost $100 per head. Get it?

Dinner - was there on a weeknight. They place was less than half full. Order the usual seafood stuff. Unfortunately, because the lobster was over 8lbs, the claws were uncooked from the inside. I did get an apology and explanation that sometimes it is too difficult to cook a giant lobster etc... So get this... They only took away the claws and the server said, let me microwave it for you. Honest, no joke. 

That was the last time I went there. I got invited to go there from friends and each time I just said "not worth it". You try it once and realize you can get the same food if not better for way cheaper.
