BCga5CbMqcZLCpxAuln57w Great food, not the most experienced staff.  EVERY TIME I order, they cannot seem to get it correct. EVERY TIME I order, there is no history under my phone number.  The staff cannot seem to take an order over the phone in less than 5 minutes and the most recent time I ordered, the girl commented to her coworker about how difficult I was/my order was BEFORE hanging up the phone.  As much as I enjoy the food, this last order will be my last; the whole point of ordering food out is the convenience and when the experience is totally inconvenient and difficult and the staff is rude, what is the point? Very disappointed.
