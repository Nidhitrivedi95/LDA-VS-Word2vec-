aShNnWaEy8QfXpgRAMFfjQ Probably won't be coming back. The food was below average for a hk cafe style. Which is disappointing because it's the only one around this neighbourhood.
For example, a common menu item is fried chicken wings and fries. Taste good at any hk cafe. At this restaurant, it was very bland.
