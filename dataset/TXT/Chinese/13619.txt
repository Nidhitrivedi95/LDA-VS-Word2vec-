Last time we had five dishes, and we like them all, big portion and very tasty . However, sometimes the quality of dishes falls to stay the same. 
I recommend spicy chicken, fish in a hot pot, cumin lamb, pickled cabbage pork stew, jelly noodle salad and sour&spicy potato slice (here are the Chinese names in case you know some <U+8FA3><U+5B50><U+9E21> <U+51B7><U+9505><U+9C7C> <U+5B5C><U+7136><U+7F8A><U+8089> <U+9178><U+83DC><U+7096><U+732A><U+8089> <U+51C9><U+62CC><U+62C9><U+76AE> <U+9178><U+8FA3><U+571F><U+8C46><U+4E1D>)
It can get very busy in the weekends. They also have delivery service and special lunch menu.
