DL7V1_chkWkZtyG4_xNYfw Ordered 2 Thai Dynamite with brown rice and extra chicken to go. As you can guess there was barely any chicken and the rice was white. It's like the chef didn't even read the ticket. The green onions that were in both dishes looked like they ripped the onion out of the ground and chopped off the green part. I have been coming here for a while and this was probably my last time. 

It seems like the quality and taste of the different dishes has gone downhill recently. Maybe they are trying to deter people because their parking lot is so small. This might work.
