CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Only went here because at midnight there's not much to pick from in the Bellagio. The restaurant has very weak reviews so I should have known better than to go here, just didn't want to leave the casino.

Not too many people even knew about this place and it was a little tricky to find. 

We had the Sweet and Spicy Noodles that were not really good. The noodles had chicken pieces in it but they tasted a little off. We had an order of the Spicy Cucumber which was the best dish of all. We also had the Sesame Chicken, it was almost inedible. It was dry and the sauce tasted like it had ketchup in it. 

This was thee worst Chinese food that I've ever had., honestly. I can't believe that the Bellagio hotel has this restaurant in its lineup. It has great decor and the service was excellent, that's why I actually have this review 2 stars. Will never even consider this place again. It probably won't last at a hotel this great.
