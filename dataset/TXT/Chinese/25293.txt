7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA Went there many times, and I still love it and have never been disappointed. As a person originally from Sichuan, the food served at Sichuan gourmet is absolutely authentic for me. Sometimes, I can even hear cooks talking loudly in Sichuan dialect. Advice for Non-Chinese: forget about the General Tao's menu, be more adventure, and ask the server for recommendation on the menu with Chinese if you have problem ordering. 

I would say, start from the appetiser if you are too concerned.
