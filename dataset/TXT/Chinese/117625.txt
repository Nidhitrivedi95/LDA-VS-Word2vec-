NFOj3uboFzeNF5X-dWUd_w Stop what you are doing and order the Fried Banana dessert.  O...M...G....! 

First, it looks amazing.  I had a brief moment where I didn't want to eat my food because the presentation was too exquisite...but I got over it and devoured my dish.  It was the best...and I mean...the best fried banana I have ever had in my life! The chef prepares it as ordered and it is AMAZING!!!!!!

Now, I didn't just have dessert but I needed to start with what really impressed me.  I ordered the spicy tuna sushi.  I judge my food by the look; it didn't look as appealing as I would have liked, but it was WONDERFUL!

In addition, I signed up for the Total Rewards card and received a discount on my order.

Overall, this has been a 5-star experience for me.
