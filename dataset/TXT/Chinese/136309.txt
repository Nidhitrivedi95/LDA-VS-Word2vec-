QG56Fy7JQ_9XgAwtj7fhjw I went to Delice Oriental for Dinner on a saturday night. 
We ordered the authentic Szechuan cold dish Fuqifeipian (lungs), the pan grilled beef, and a spicy chicken dish.

The lungs and the chicken were spicy, and my non-Chinese friends required a lot of water to swallow. Nevertheless, we all found it tasty and personally, I think it does justice to the traditional Szechuan dish. Definitely recommend.

As for the pan grilled beef and onions, the sizzling sound makes my mouth water as I write this review. Very tasty. Recommended.

If only there was less oil in all the dishes.

Overall, we appreciated the experience at Delice Oriental, and would definitely return, when the Kazu next door is full.
