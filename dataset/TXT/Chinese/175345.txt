wh44YZa9OCXjV-ziZ6gjNA I made reservations for Mother's Day, already knowing it will be busy but did not expect this level of unprofessionalism. 

There were many people standing outside of the store waiting to be seated and my family was one of them. Mabel, the hostess guided our family to unclean tables 15mins after our reservation time. The people who were cleaning the table rudely told us not to wait at the table even though Mabel directed us to the table and to be readied to be seated. Then, Mabel yelled at us not to wait at the table because it is pressuring them (even though she was the one who guided us to the table first??) I understand it was busy and workers are stressed by the high volume of people but the disorganization and rude behaviour we received ruined our whole dining experience and our expectations of the restaurants. 

We didn't get much service as food was ordered through the iPad and there is a self-serve salad bar at the back. Food was mediocre, nothing stood out even though they had some Chinese, Korean and Thai food on their menu. We didn't order any Chinese, Korean or Thai food so the menu was quite limited. 
We were left unimpressed by the food and the service we received.
