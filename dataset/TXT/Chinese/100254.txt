jyZqmlaziZKtPv8AVTzciw I've been here multiple times and ordered take out a few times since my initial visit and review. The food is always very good and authentic. Lobster is the cheapest in town and the ginger/scallion sauce is so good. Slobber it all over your rice. Other favorites include clam in spicy sauce, salt and pepper shrimp, beef and chinese broccoli. I don't think I've had a dish that was bad. 

Yes, the place can be dirty and/or smelly but the food is the most authentic Chinese I've had in Phoenix and definitely worth a try. It'll put all your Americanized chinese places to shame.
