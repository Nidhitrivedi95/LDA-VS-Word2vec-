oWM1ZEsqgJYMgvLbWUwuaw I hated this massage. Period.  At one point the therapist climbed up on top of me, straddled me from behind, and I felt really uncomfortable. There was also no sheet on the bed and I had only the blanket covering me, I hope it wasn't see through.  There was no music except for therapist's heavy breathing. Awful and uncomfortable.
