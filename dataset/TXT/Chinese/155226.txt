TIu83s4sWMdhbwimzdfzIQ Love the idea of a gourmet pork bun or "bao" place. Very casual atmosphere and standard pork bun price. Nowhere can beat china town pricing anyway or how. Interesting decor of the Chinese calendar zodiac signs as a mural on wall which is a great touch. Food is made fresh and has an amazing aroma. Everyone who works is quite good looking. Very conveniently located by ttc.
