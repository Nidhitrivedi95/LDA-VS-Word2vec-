egxK8E9T6MWLxJyD_iCIVQ The family went here on a Saturday night.  It's plenty big and roomy.  There is even seating outside.  The menu us extensive and they gave a no kidding sushi chef.  

The service was good and the food was okay.  Good but nothing to write home about.  Actually the tuna sushi was pretty tasty.  I had General Tso's chicken which was not spicy at all but it was good.  

Serving portions are big, definitely for two or take away the next day.

Kids found fried rice and cucumber & avo sushi rolls to dine on.  Everyone seemed pretty happy.
