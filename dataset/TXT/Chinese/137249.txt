qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA We came here very hungry on a Saturday and although the place was full we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. Yay! 

Even though they aren't affiliated I can't help but compare this place to Sushi Legend in terms of price point and similar offerings. 

The best part about this place is that the sashimi here is very fresh but everything else is a bit disappointing. Either the ingredients weren't fresh or the dish wasn't executed well. 

Things to avoid: The wonton soup? Absolutely terrible. One of my favorite AYCE dishes, enoki mushroom wrapped in beef was a bit dry. And the mango yogurt dessert? Watered down. The torched sushi had a bit too much mayo for my liking but this seems to be the case for every AYCE sushi place, even Kaka. 

Things to get: Cream of mushroom soup was delicious. The Kalbi beef was solid. The bacon carbonara was also yummy and something I don't see at most places.
