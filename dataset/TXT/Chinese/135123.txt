qAbXHsddBhmfQFegGiV7Dg Been here many times and the little old man is always soo nice.I usually order the orange chicken with steamed rice and vegetables.I don't like too much rice,mostly meat, so he gives me extra chicken every time at no charge.One of the nicest places to go because of the customer service.Always makes me come back for more.Love it!
