I try to get in and out the door as quickly as possible, they got no love for the round eye.


update just got back worst service ever never going back they got my order wrong and they said I ordered wrong I know what I ordered!!! left because I didn't want to get my food spit on and dropped on the floor. never going back to these racists fucks
