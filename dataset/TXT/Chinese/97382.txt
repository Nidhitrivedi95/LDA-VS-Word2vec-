I added in some chili paste they provide on the table to kick it up -- be careful, because it's legit chili and hot. I had not previously experienced Chinese noodle soup like this, it reminded me of Vietnamese Pho, and you eat it the same way: with a large spoon in one hand and chopsticks in the other. 

The service was excellent -- efficient and friendly, but not overbearing. The restaurant is spanking clean, and you can also watch the food being prepared in the open kitchen. 

My only suggestion would be to lower the sodium in the broth. It's pretty salty, but I will admit that I am not a huge fan of sodium. But I can't wait to return and try other items.
