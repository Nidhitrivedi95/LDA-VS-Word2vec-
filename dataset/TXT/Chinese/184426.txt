xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I thought I'd try to be fair and try this place again after a couple meh times in the past... what a mistake! I got the Pad Thai and a Taro Bubble Tea. Pad Thai: yuck! It was comprised of slippery, flavorless, greasy noodles AND they got the order wrong (tofu instead of chicken) even though I was the only person in the line to order. No amount of Sriracha could save how poorly made it was. 

Bubble Tea: worst bubble tea I've ever had. Hands. Down. The mix wasn't fully dissolved so at times I drank what tasted like straight pudding powder. Then the boba was hard, and there were hardly any in there! Honestly, I had to spit them out they were so bad. My advice: if on Craig Street and wanting Chinese/Taiwanese or decent bubble tea, go to Rose Tea Cafe or Orient Express.
