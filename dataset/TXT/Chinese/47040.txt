bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A The food was good, but the place looked very dirty. After I saw the dirt on the floor in the corners caked up, it kinda gave me a weird feeling about the food. Not that the food was bad, but seeing it cooked in a dirty kitchen was just kinda, well eww.. 
 
Not sure if we would try it again or not.
