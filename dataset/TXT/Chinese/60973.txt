Decor is nice (they still have their Christmas decorations are still up - yes to Christmas time all year round!) and they have a large selection of drinks.  Of all their drinks, I think their Very Mango Mango slush is their freshest one - it comes with mango chunks and star shaped jellies. How fun! My friend had a mango shaved ice that also has condensed milk poured over it - it was pretty good! I expected it to be really sweet but it was just right. 

My friend reserved a table for us and was advised of a $6.99/person minimum but we weren't held to this (apparently they were at the Midland location). We left around 11:30pm and the line up was long (as usual) so if you don't want to wait you can always go to Destiny's on the other side of Hwy 7 or west to Ten Ren's.
