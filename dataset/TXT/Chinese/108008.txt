LG6vpg5Qx_DstY2aT8-O4Q Checked out this restaurant for my first time this Wednesday evening. I was surprised to see that they are open late so I did some take out around 9pm. 

Two things that need to be emphasized... 

#1 Unbeatable price for the amount of food. 
#2 Below average quality. 

$7.60 for a take out order of the General Tso's Chicken. That was about the only positive part. The chicken wasn't very warm which made me question if it was made to order. No consistency with the chicken... some dry and crispy...some mushy and soggy. 

Overall feeling--- not bad. I guess I can't be too picky when spending seven bucks for Wednesday evening take out.
