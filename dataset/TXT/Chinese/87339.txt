HTAAMVDZ4P0VX5F9euJBoA The food has always been good.  The service...so so. It seems like the prices are going up and portions getting smaller (lunch and dinner).  If you have a to-go order, they give you a small portion of rice and get mad if you request more.  If you dine in, you get all the rice you want.  Doesn't make sense.
