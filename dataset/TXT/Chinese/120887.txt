O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw Yowsa!  Fantastic dim sum at a great price.  From outside, you might think it looks like a bit of a dive, but inside is clean, spacious, and well looked after.  I love how, after patrons leave, the waiters just grab the plastic table-cloth and scoop up all the dishes in one big bundle.  There's no cart service, but if you find cart delivery to be intimidating, that's a bonus.  

The har gau and siu mai are as good as it gets.  Try also the rice steamed in a lotus leaf, and the dumplings with shrimp and bamboo fungus (sounds awful, tastes divine).

Let's face it.  Dim sum is addictive.  Rol San is a fantastic place to get your fix.
