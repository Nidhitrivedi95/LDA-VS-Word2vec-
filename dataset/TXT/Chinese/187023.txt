yEZn1XpLsEC9uBa-X4xAZw I avoided Vua for a long time because it looked so much like a chain restaurant.  I was expecting the Vietnamese version of Thai Express or Sushi Shop. Turns out I was wrong and it's actually just an independent shop that clearly aspires to be the Vietnamese fast food franchise chain of note.

At first I thought I arrived in a convenience store (and in some ways it is), but they also have a deli counter where I ordered a Saigon style 10" Bahn Mi. Their ten inch sandwich was too much for me, next time I'll stick to the regular size.

My sandwich was ready mere minutes after ordering.  The staff don't slack, they can get really hammered during lunch time and at $2.95 a sandwich, volume is where their profits lie.

Most of the interior is lined with shelves and refrigerators bursting with an impressive assortment of ready made Asian goodies.  It spans from Banh Mi of course to Sushi and Bubble Tea, and lots and lots of imported snacks and drinks.  If you need an Asian fix, but Chinatown is too far away, Vua might satisfy your cravings. They even have a few tables near the entrance and a small terrace for customers.

I'm not really an expert on Vietnamese sandwiches, but I have had the real thing.  While not as good as the original, they do serve up a reasonable facsimile.  Is there better Banh Mi in Montreal? Probably, but sometimes it's all about location and Vua is in an incredible spot, and at $2.95 you'll not find a cheaper lunch in the area.
