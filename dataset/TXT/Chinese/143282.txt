rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g Yes!!! I am coming back here and recommend this to all you dim sum cravers and Asian tourists. The last couple of years when I visited Arizona, all I could find to eat were either  Vietnamese pho or Chinese. Now I can say that I've tried dim sum in Arizona! 

Yelped this place out and it was hard to choose from China King or Phoenix Palace but I had to make a quick choice because we wanted to eat and back to California so here we were, at phoenix palace.

Phoenix palace is located in a plaza filled with other Asian stores. It's actually across from LA fitness if you end up being in that plaza instead of the actual plaza (we got lost trying to find this place haha) 

Waiting? Ah yes... There was 10 minute wait but hey, better than 40 minute wait like the dim sum's back in Cali. That 10 minute went by quick. We did come here on a Saturday around noon, so the wait was nothing. Let the hostess or host know how many in your party, grab a number then wait for them to call it to be seated. 

Service? Hey! These ladies here who pushes carts knows English very well. Will know what kind of dim sum you are looking for if you, yourself know what you want and know what the dim sum contains. Quick with clearing out our empty dishes on the table, which is great!

Food? Liked it a lot. There were four of us and we got...

- fried squid (special order) yums. There's minced fried garlic, sliced jalapeño  and minced green onion. Eat it while it's hot! We all know how fried stuff would taste if we leave it out too long.

- Chinese brocolli with oyster sauce - it was our friend's favorite veggie. Good stuff. Still got it's crunch and not soggy! Awesome

- Seaweed - it's like a seaweed salad with pickle-ish underneath, and thinly sliced ginger hidden inside the seaweed which made it tasted even better. 

- sticky fried rice - there's eggs, Chinese diced sausages, minced dried shrimp and minced mushroom. tasted okay, but just needed a dash of soy sauce to taste better.

- sticky rice wrapped with lotus leaf or could be banana leaf - delicious. inside contains slices of shitaki mushrooms, dried shrimps and a chunk of Chinese sausage which made it tastes so good.

- shrimp paste on bell peppers - Light gravy sauce which was good. Have the lady cut it in half so you can share :)

Overall, this dim sum place is more than just legit. With the great service they provided, I will be coming back for their dim sum and on the next visit, I will try more of their special dishes! Thumbs up!
