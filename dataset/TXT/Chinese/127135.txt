PAJlmByrU8zAB3WsXxA30Q The food here is pretty good, consider going during lunch time. They have amazing lunch time deals! The food here tasted really good, also the staff are friendly and are always around so you don't have to wait. 4 stars only because they don't suggest good options, and sometimes they have trouble understanding you, but it's nothing big.
