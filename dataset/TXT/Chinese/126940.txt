P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg We (only two people) were sitting at our table for about thirty minutes and our waiter didn't even take our order yet. Eventually, we just walked out. There were many waiters there and it wasn't even busy - there was no excuse for the lack of service. Very disappointed with the service and we were really looking forward to eat their food too.
