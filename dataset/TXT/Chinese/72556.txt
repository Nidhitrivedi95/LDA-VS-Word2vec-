fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA One of mine and my husbands favourite places to go, the owner gives his hospitality in his own broken-English-charming-way!
The places is always packed and has the best dumplings in town, for a real decent price. 
Not a place if you expect the servers to hover over you tending to all your demands. No, go in, order your drink and food and stuff your face with goodness.
