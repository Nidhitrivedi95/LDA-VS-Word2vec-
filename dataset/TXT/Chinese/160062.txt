U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q they advertise hand made noodles but they need to advertise it more. the place was a little dirty to be honest and caesars mgmt needs to devote more attention to this place. the decor is cool as hell but the menu and execution sucks. they have the tools to do a lot more with the place but may be relying on the decor to do all the work.

i also asked for 2 desserts, one after the other was not available, and both were not available. 

if you go to a buffet you can probably find most of the stuff and in better quality

JEANS: OK by far
ORDER: waitress
