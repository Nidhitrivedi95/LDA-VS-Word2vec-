DIxgItsSI9QwX9H8lVptYg I ordered some chicken fried rice and some crab rangoons from here on Sunday. The delivery fee wasn't so bad, and there's no minimum (this is all on grubhub), which I really enjoyed. The fried rice was spectacular, very delicious, flavorful, and filling - it was also at a great price! However, at only a few dollars shy, the crab rangoons were pitiful, which is why I omitted the final star. The crab rangoons hardly had any filling, it was primarily just a fried shell, and a small one at that. I'm used to these HUGE chunks of crab rangoon, especially when they are priced at almost the same amount as an order of fried rice or orange chicken. 

Skip the crab rangoons at all costs. Delicious, but very pitiful, pretty much a rip off. Otherwise, great price, great speedy service, and great rice.
