6MhY_9EkUkKCvvN8rzXZzg I don't get some of these poor reviews.  The decor is spare but attractive, the place seems clean enough to me, the prices are good, and I've never had a bad meal there over the past 20 years.  My current favorite is the mussels, either ginger-and-onion  or black-bean.  The mussels are big and plump and plentiful, nicely presented and piping hot.  My friends have liked their dishes, too.  I've had worse Chinese food (including in China), but seldom better.  Just wish I lived closer, but I can always make an excuse to travel to a place I like as much as GHHK.
