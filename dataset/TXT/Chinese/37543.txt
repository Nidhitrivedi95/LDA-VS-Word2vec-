aPBTwoHvuVKHP2zkiKvwQQ Best in town! I've lived in the West valley for about a year and my husband and I have been searching all over for good Chinese food. While there are decent places out there (and some scary ones!) none of them was as good as Golden Wei! I was looking for a very particular style dish and they are the only place that has it (that I've tried so far). I ordered take out and everything was ready quicker than the expected time. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was so delicious! I can't wait to eat here again!
