1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w $50 lunch and it would have preferred Panda Express probably.  They forgot an order with our appetizers.  Our waiter only came to check on us at the end of our meal.  One of the soups delivered to the table was the wrong one.  By the time they brought the soup back, we were finished with our meal.  The wonton soup was really bland and only luke warm.  The service wasn't very good, considering we only had apps and soup it took 1 hour to complete the meal service.  I won't ever return to this location, and think I might give up PF Changs for good.
