I had a smile across my face as I walked closer to this place. It brings back so many memories as I sat down and ordered the guilinggao and tea eggs. The coconut sago was so refreshing since it felt like the first day of spring in April. The service was fast, place and tables were clean. 

Over all, this place is as authentic as it'll get when you're from NYC like me.
