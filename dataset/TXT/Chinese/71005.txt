fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ When arriving @winglei you will notice the open dining room with exquisite fixtures and linens. The open viewing  garden with several persimmon trees 100+years old including a dragon sculpture providing a perfect backdrop for the excellent hand crafted signature drinks including -edible exotic flowers, lychee fruit martini's and a large wine list as well. The appetizers, main course and desserts were excellent as was the service. A must try in LV for upscale Chinese dining.
