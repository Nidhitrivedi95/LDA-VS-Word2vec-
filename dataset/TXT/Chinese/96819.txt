JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w My friends and I were in Montreal for the weekend, and we decided to check out Montreal's Chinatown. It was around 5pm on Saturday, and after walking around for a bit, we decided we were hungry and wanted dinner. It was hard to tell which of the restaurants were good, since it was too early for the restaurants to be crowded, and some of them looked sketchy from the outside. We eventually settled on Mon Shing. 

We ordered spring rolls, fried wontons, yang chow fried rice (pork & shrimp), beef with chinese broccoli, mapo tofu (tofu with pork, scallions and spicy sauce) and 1L of the house white wine. The wine came out first, and was actually really delicious, and only $22. The food came out quickly and was good. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but definitely good. There was SO MUCH food. We finished the appetizers, wine and broccoli, but left half the fried rice and 3/4 of the tofu. It was all really delicious- we just couldn't finish it. With our check, they gave us 8 slices of oranges and 3 fortune cookies. Yummy! The meal took just the right length of time, and as we were leaving, there was a decent line of people waiting to be seated.

Definitely go if you're hungry and looking for solid, cheap Chinese food. With tip, the meal cost us about $20 each for a liter of wine and more food than we could eat!!
