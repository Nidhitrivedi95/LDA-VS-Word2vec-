1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA today i went to try their steam crab with flat rice noodle and curry beef. I needed to order the crab dish when I woke up. Then they went to a chinese super market to buy the fresh one for you. when I arrived, they show me the raw crab. I waited about 20mins. When it came, it looks so fresh, i felt the crab' soul was still there and begging me not to eat it, but i did eat it. Taste very good. The curry beef was not bad but i felt that it missed something. i didnt know what it missed, dont ask me. I perfer u and me cafe's curry. and the dishes are very cheap. so it worth to try.
