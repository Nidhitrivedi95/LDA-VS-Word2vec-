I have only been here once, but so far the only thing i question is how they can offer such great quality/quantity for the prices on the menu (low).  It doesn't seem like that can last...hopefully they don't read this and come to their senses...

I had the lunch special sushi roll (it's simply called 'A' on the menu) with eel roll, salmon and spicy tuna roll which  came with soup and ginger salad with great dressing, it was ALOT of food, and everything was great.
