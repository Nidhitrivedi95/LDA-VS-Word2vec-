aJR1iUWwNVBM692gq7adBA Get the orange chicken, like now. SO good. Other favorites: Moo Goo Gai Pan, House chow mein, amazing won ton soup, all the apps are delicious; crab puffs, egg rolls, all good. I think this is the only place in Phx that still serves those crispy won ton strips they call them 'chips'. They're like a $1, totally worth it, they go great w/ the soup or even just as a crunchy extra sprinkled on top of the moo goo gai pan. This is a family owned place and the same guy who I think is the father always delivers my food & he is so very kind & sweet. I hope this place never leaves, I have no idea where we'd get our Chinese food. It very much reminds me of one of my favorite Chinese takeout places when I lived in Orange County, CA as a kid....
