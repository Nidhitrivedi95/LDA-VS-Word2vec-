owV0aSgh4t_9aG56iPxGEw I got a coupon and it said a free plate when you buy one it didn't include sides a thought a plate was everything and the free food with coupon they gave me was like 4 pieces of orange chicken not enough to feed a 2 year old a sample they should of stated on coupon it was a sample and the food was bland bad no taste or maybe it taste kinda like card board this place isn't all that great unless your starving and its the only place close to you the cost is also high for the quality of the food its like generic Chinese made by teens not saying teens can't cook but they lack experience they are great cooks when you want pizza rolls lol well the manager did get back to my review fast that's great so service is good so this place is not all bad and its new so maybe I will try it again
