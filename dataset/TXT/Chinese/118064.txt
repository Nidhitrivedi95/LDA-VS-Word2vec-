NKHvmp19c6wrm0dZXcLtmQ Sugar Marmalade was a nice place and it is a fun place to go with your friends or family to chat and catch up. I only tried their dessert but they do serve food as well. I tried one of their parfaits and in my opinion, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I also thought that their prices were too high. There was also a line up and you might have to wait a long time. Service also took long. Nice place but not the best in my opinion.
