f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ Came here for dim sum this morning around 9. It was somewhat busy. Service was friendly and quick. The food served was warm. Not all of the dim sum carts were pushed around. Most of the staff spoke Chinese/Cantonese and some English.

I really liked their egg tarts. Even though they were small in size, the crust was flaky soft and the egg part was delicious. 

Environment was kinda crowded, most of the tables and chairs were close to each other, but I liked how there's a big window view of pine trees, it's calming. 

Overall, I recommend this dim sum place and their yummy egg tarts.
