And their ginger martini is super tasty - they make it with fresh ginger!  All the staff is very friendly and helpful too.  Not to mention they have great Happy Hour deals too - check it out!  Oh, that reminds me - their samosas (not that I'd typically order samosas at a Thai place, but they were on happy hour) are delicious!
