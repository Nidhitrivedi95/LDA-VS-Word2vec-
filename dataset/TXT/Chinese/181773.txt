XETJL05OGIi-WliFzgk7cg This place is a joke..  And the blame falls entirely on the staff and manager

Major problems we experience every single time we visit include

- Entrees empty, or mostly empty waiting to be refilled

- They have maybe 1 of your choices, which they package up for you, but then tell you it's another 15 minute wait for the rest of your options. So half of your meal is fresh while the other half is cold or room temperature

- They stop cooking at least 30 minutes before they close the store even though this is probably against head office policy. This location is run by lazy ass teenagers and they claim they stop cooking so early because they don't want to waste food

- Every time I've been here, they are making people wait excess amounts of time because they are completely confused or in the weeds

- Crap service, never an apology or coupon for times where I or other people have been forced to walk out empty handed

- Portion sizes are wildly inconsistent. Sometimes you get a decent amount of food, but other times, they are lightly "spooning" the food portion ever so lightly into the box to give you an absolute minimum amount of food, and it's most likely because they are trying to stretch the entrees out to feed more people without having to cook more.  Teenagers are the worst for this. 

The list goes on,.  It's a shame because if they could just get this location under control i would happily update this review

But I won't hold my breath.
