dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw Since Hubby thinks he's Chinese (I don't have the heart to tell him he's not!), we eat Chinese food on a regular basis. Tired of our usual spots, we decided to come here to mix things up. It's a little hidden as it's located at the back of the plaza. Despite its location, it was busy for a Monday night!

The first sign that a place is authentic is when 99% of its guests are Chinese. That was definitely the case here at Yunnan Garden. With one look around the restaurant, I knew I was in for some real Chinese cuisine! We ordered the Chicken Fried Rice and Sweet & Sour Fish. The fried rice was fresh and tasty with the right amount of green onions and egg. I did find the portion to be a little small for it just being rice. Our next dish, however, made up for the small serving. We were given a HUGE plate full of fried fish that had been tossed in sweet & sour sauce. The fish was so crispy which I loved since the heavy sauce can sometimes make it soggy. The flavor itself was nice and tangy! As delicious as it was, we couldn't finish all of the food so we ended up taking almost half of it home.

From its authentic food to its fast-paced service, this Chinese restaurant is all around traditional. That means you can also enjoy hot green tea during your meal. I did hear that Yunnan Garden is known for their Szechuan cuisine. As a lover of spicy foods, I am super eager to come back and try one of these dishes. So you can expect a check-in here from us very shortly!
