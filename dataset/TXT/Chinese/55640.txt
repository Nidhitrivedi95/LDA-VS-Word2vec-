cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw I feel weird about giving five stars to this tiny joint, but I can't give it 'only' four stars in good conscience. We live pretty close to this place, and have eaten here, easily, 30+ times over the past two years... possibly 40+. Not one time have we been less than happy as clams. The woman who runs the front (phone and restaurant... it's pretty impressive) always remembers us, is always nice and courteous, and super helpful. 

My favorites: 
- Thai Basil Beef with extra beef and medium spice. This is a dinner, a lunch and a midnight snack, easily. So, so much food, even without rice. I love that I can order as spicy (or not) as I want. When we followed paleo, this was my takeout go-to, and still is today. 
- Egg drop soup. It is so yummy! No weird stuff going on, either; fresh veggies and super-tasty broth, served piping hot. This is a great value, at $2.95 for a large. This easily serves four people as an appetizer... orrrr one really, really hungry person who is craving some comfort food. 
- Sweet & sour chicken. This is not your average S&S ck. The meat is completely identifiable and the breading is light enough to not weigh down the whole dish. Good sauce, too. 
- No longer on the menu, but the Thai roll with peanut sauce. I really wish they would bring sexy back. 
- BBQ pork fried rice, extra pork. Um. Yeah. Extra pork, because pork. Duh. This is a massive serving, too. 
- Online ordering. 
- The kid menu has pretty large servings, too. 
- Clean. 
- Great service, even if there may be a wait. (There's a wait for damn good reason, so relax.) 
- It's been a while since we have done it, but this place was BYOB. Suggest calling ahead to make sure this is still allowed. We quit bringing our own because beer just takes up room that is better filled with tasty, tasty food. 

My husband's list is undoubtedly even longer. We just love this place. Give it a try. DO IT!
