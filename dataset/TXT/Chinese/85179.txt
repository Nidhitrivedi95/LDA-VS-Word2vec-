hIqq6npOS-mSl58H7uyCkg Just came back from trying Oriental House and BOY am I happy we finally got to this one on my Yelp list.
There was no one in the place but I remained steadfast in believing my fellow YELPers.
It's a mom and pops and they are soooo cute! Place was spotless! Decor was adorable. Saw the cook washing her hands several times-very assuring in this time of "too many to count closures" in Chinatown and Asian restaurants in general.
Food was fresh and the choices were amazing!
I recommend stopping in and if it's empty-the service will be just that much better! Happy to say 4 more tables came in and all seemed to be enjoying it as much as we did.
