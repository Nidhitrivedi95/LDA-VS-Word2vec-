cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ So I found this place here on yelp and i must admit it was really nice. Ive been on a mission to find places that serve lamb for a min, so when i saw they had a free lamb skewer when u checked in I was like O TURN UP!! I was really happy lol. I went there and orderd sum lamb skewer with sum chicken fried rice. The place was nice and relaxing its a ideal place to go to with a friend or that speacial friend ;-). The people were really nice which was good. Ill def be back there
