X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Such a ripoff. We spoke with a promoter for Tiesto and he told us that he'd put us on the guest list to get in for FREE between the hours of 10:00-12:30. I even got a confirmation text that we should be good to go. We got there just before midnight and were told it would be $40 for men and free for women. We were already upset, not because $40 is a lot, but because that promoter clearly lied, even after I confirmed with him that we were still good to go before 12:30. After standing in line for about a half hour more, a security guy game up to us and said my fiancé had to change his shoes because he was wearing Nikes (and jeans and a button up). My fiancé looked at a guy next to us and said, "that guy is wearing Converse and you didn't say anything to him" and the guard said, "yeah Converse is fine, no Nikes though" so we just left and said screw it, hah.
