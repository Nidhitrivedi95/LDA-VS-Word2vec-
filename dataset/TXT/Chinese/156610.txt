trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ After 10 hours of international travel a seafood restaurant really hit the spot. Ambience was low-key on a Monday night, I got a corner booth to myself, and an excellent server named Spencer. This place has some great late evening deals, but I was just in time to order off the full dinner menu before the kitchen closed at 10. The pound and a half lobster with root vegetables followed by an amazing chocolate hazelnut gelato dessert was perfect. Since the restaurant only had paper napkins and I demolished my lobster by hand, Spencer brought me a dish of hot water with lemon in lieu of wet naps. First class service! I will most likely be back whenever I'm in Toronto.
