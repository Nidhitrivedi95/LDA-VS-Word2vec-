LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ My parents absolutely love this place because of great deals during the lunch hours. They have even enticed my aunts and uncles to come here and they actually do on a regular basis. Prices range from 4.99-5.99 offered 11am-4:30pm (I forget if its only on week days, but I know for sure Holidays are excluded). I really like the beef chow fun and we usually order the salt and pepper pork chops. The chow fun is definitely up to par, but I think other Chinese restaurants wip up a better salt and pepper pork. I think it's probably the batter, which is not as crisp as other places.  When I went a few weeks ago we also ordered the Seafood hot pot, mongolian beef, and fried flounder.  All of it was pretty standard and nothing special, but I guess I shouldn't complain because it could be a lot worse.  The fried flounder's batter could also be a little more crisp.  In my parents opinion inexpensive prices is what makes the food taste better. The service is pretty bad, but I guess I'm used to it because most Chinese restaurants tent to forget about customers after they place the food on the table. I also read on other reviews that they try to avoid giving you water, which is true! I've even heard this from my aunt who also comes here regularly.  We were 3/4 done with our meal and no one even checked on us. So finally after waving my hands in the air I was able to ask for water.  I feel like I should give them 4 stars, but after I thought about the bad service and okay food they definitely get a 3 from me!
