csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA I wanted to love it.  But, nothing special.  I'd rather go to a random "hole in the wall" Chinese place for a lunch that would be $2 cheaper.

I got the Bejing Noodle Bowl.  The duck was dry, the rice noodles angel hair thin, were bland, and didn't have great texture.  The cabbage wilted quickly.

Maybe I didn't get the right thing.  Maybe my hopes were up as I have eaten some amazing duck soups in major cities this summer.  Will give it another chance some time, but not in any hurry to do so.
