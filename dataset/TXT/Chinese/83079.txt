hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q My fav noodle house in Pittsburgh 

Loved this place.  I haven't been to a noodle house since I was back home in NY and this place was as good as any noodle house in China town.  The soup dumplings were sooooo good.  I had the beef noodle soup and a friend of mine had the crab dumpling soup bowl.  Both were really good.  I just wished it was a little busier because I was hoping to see them make noodles in the window but since it was slow I think they did put on a show like they usually do (but I did get so see one chef make dumplings so I was happy).  
The owner came up to our table and talked to us about the dishes when we told him it was our first time eating here.  He couldn't of been more welcoming and told us where each dish originated in China (apparently I like Shanghai dishes :)).
I couldn't of been happier eating here, I just wish I had more stomachs to eat everything :)
