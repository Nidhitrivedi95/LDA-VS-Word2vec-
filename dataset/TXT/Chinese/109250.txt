lmfyEVKm3CDGWg18LeRhgA Yeah, I dug this place. It looks like they've been here for awhile, and the quality of the food leads one to believe that they'll be here for awhile longer.

The menu had a lot of really nice looking offerings, and I look forward to eating here again. I haven't encountered a lot of Thai food in the area which rocked my socks, so this place seems to have promise.
