gtcsOodbmk4E0TulYHnlHA Bar Crawl #1:  Beau's Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale & St Bernardus Abt 12

Happy Hour Everyday till 7 pm! $2 off drafts and bottles/cans. Sweet!

Of course I have to start off with a pint: Beau's Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale ($5.50 with HH specials!) and my Yelp friend with a can of Howe Sound Lager ($4.5 with HH Special). And of course if you prefer some exquisite import: A bottle of St Bernardus Abt 12 ($28).

The interior is dark, dim and cozy. I like how Northwood is a coffee/beer/cocktail drinking place as that means I can hang out here the whole day. 

Too bad they were out of the 8oz Cold Brew to go. I guess I have to come back soon to try out their cocktails and coffee! And free WIFI!! Oh that means I can even yelp a bit!
