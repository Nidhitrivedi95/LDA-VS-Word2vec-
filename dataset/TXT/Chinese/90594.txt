IHt79wxZHkD7QSzlDRDivw WOW! You wanna know how I discovered this place? I was in New York and picked up a an American magazine and it was ranking the best Chinese BBQ in North America and I kid you not that this place was in there as one of the best and for obvious reasons. They do EVERYTHING perfect. My wifey drives me up here after a night of hard partying and we grab some of the greasy crispy skinned pork. I get a whole duck and eat it at home with lettuce and she does the bbq pork pieces. All of it is so amazing and fresh. And the price....oh lawd don't let this cheap brown boy go on about the price. Best deal Scarcity/Markham and a really nice staff who are only too helpful to give you extra sauce and a few tips on how to enjoy. A def must!
