I8TOosBLYKxZMAYNNyGEyg I have order from this restaurant quite a bit since moving to this section of Phoenix.  However after this last order this will be my last order, unless I am desperate or intoxicated.  Why? Because when I called back to inform the restaurant that the order was wrong, the gentlemen that answered the phone lectured me on how to order. Then the delivery person that brought my corrected order back to my home continued to lecture me also, this is no way to treat a customer or to ensure repeat patronage.  So, I'm done with "Tasty House" and have a nice day.
