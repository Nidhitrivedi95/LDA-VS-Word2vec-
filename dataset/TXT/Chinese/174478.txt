WEw08dCcOiwH3Sw1f_8DKQ First time visiting this place. Not very good experience overall. We sit close to the kitchen and no one seems to serve us... I have to call many staff to get someone to help with us with menu and other stuff. Price is a bit high and the quantity is too less. For the BBQ it's a little too salty and spicy for us.. we asked them get us non spicy ones in the second round but those have no taste at all.. seems to me they only have a spicy plus salty sauce combined. The dish is not as tasty as the other restaurant I have been in the city. However I do like their menu.. every single dish has a very good looking photo on the menu so it's very easy to see what you are getting. The restaurant is very clean and organized.. nice modern renovation with bright sitting area. The overall environment is decent. I might not recommend this to my friends since the lack of service is bothering me and a bit pricy compare to other places.
