6MhY_9EkUkKCvvN8rzXZzg There are only two reasons I usually go to Gourmet House of Hong Kong--I need cheap, fast Chinese Food that's not packaged in a panda logo and I want a place where actual Chinese  people are behind the counter. The food isn't bad. It's what you'd expect in a Cantonese style place. But whatever I order seems boring and uninspired. Last time I had chicken and vegetables (really weren't many veggies) and a side of fried rice. I was disappointed that it was just white rice with bits of egg. I thought there would at least be some onion or scallion. And the rice still tasted more steamed than fried. I think they are playing loosely with the definition of fried rice. Anyway, I was glad last year that they fixed up the decor. The peeling paint on the outside did not do much to whet the appetite.
