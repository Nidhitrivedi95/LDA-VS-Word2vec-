Xfod0UWr_9B-TOM6qxVIwQ This place is awesome. I always order here when I get the chance.

I think my favorite has to be the sweet and sour pork... and the mongolian beef.

Wait, I changed my mind. The katsu chicken and teriyaki chicken was AMAZING. Yep, those are my favorites. haha!

The portions are good. It does taste more authentic than some of the Chinese places around the area. And the fact that it's Chinese people that own the place kind of confirms it.

Good place for lunch. They also have some Korean and Japanese and Hawaiian style food here too!
