OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA It is one of my favourite Chinese food restaurant nearby my house. I love their chilly chicken and Manchurian fried rice. Since i am their regular guest they always treat me perfectly and super fast, but i noticed sometimes they are lack of costumer service.  The only thing i don't like about this resto is the restaurants setting. It doesn't look good for me, or even acceptable for a famous restaurant like Lin Garden. I just come for their food, but for place to talk it's not recommended at all!
