--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA I come here with my gf and her family often and they never disappoint.  The food is always served fresh and with typical Chinese restaurants the service is sub par unless you are a regular customer.  The decor itself is your usual Chinese bbq house/restaurant and is nothing to go crazy over, but it's the food that keeps us coming back here.

The dishes we usually order and are their top of the line choices include their steamed fresh fish, minced pork meat pie, bitter melon and meat, steamed chicken and assorted styles of cooked vegetables with shrimp paste.  The food is served fresh and hot and always comes out quickly.  

The take out and bbq to order is also very delicious and you'll have to get there early if you want the famous bbq pork or duck.  Make sure to call in advance if you want to book a table on a busy day or are looking for a special dish!
