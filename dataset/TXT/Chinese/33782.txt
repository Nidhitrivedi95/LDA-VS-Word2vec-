aa0uz1y1-ziTOveuE34HTw This restaurant is not worth going to. It's a scam. The manager is rude and irresponsible. Way over charge and price is not clear. They hit you with hidden fee. Complained but they don't do anything about it
Not like the food was any good. It was normal. I had other hot pot that are way better.
