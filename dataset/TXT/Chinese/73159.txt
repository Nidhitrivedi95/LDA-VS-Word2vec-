FIs33y1BVzzcfrDDHh8O5g Seven of us at work today each ordered from their lunch menu for pick-up. Total came to $32, not bad at all.

No one was disappointed. But no one was blown away either. Overall good. I thought the quality was good...maybe a few too many potatoes in the yellow curry...I'd rather have none.  

They do not accept American Express.
