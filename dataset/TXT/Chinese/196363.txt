ZlrHrg7jrbO6blqwfa0MkQ We were so excited to try this place for my daughters birthday. The won ton soup was lovely and light. Lo main was tasty and fresh. We really enjoyed the veggies with shrimp in the "white" sauce. It's just a soft light moisture to really let you enjoy the flavor of the veggies and shrimp not be overwhelmed. Could definitely tell the sweet and sour sauce is made fresh, because wow what a difference in flavor and consistency. We'll definitely return when we need more Chinese.
