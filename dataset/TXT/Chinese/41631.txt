b5VIe-VnkOOwiwkjGw071A Tried this little gem of a Chinese hotspot today! Its my idea of "Scottish Chinese"! It's a takeaway van in the middle of fort kinnaird shopping park Edinburgh which doesn't look or sound like much but it gives you exactly what you crave. Chinese classics cooked fresh in front of you, seasoned well and hot in a handy tray ready to eat! Perfect for lunchtime, they even have chopsticks and a few little wooden benches outside for you to sit on. I had the salt and pepper chicken with fried rice and a cheeky spot of curry sauce which was spicy and tasty enough to keep me going. Including a soft drink the meal cost was £6.45 which I thought reasonable for the quality of this fast food. Al la carte Chinese it is not, hit the spot lunch it is and would be the perfect snack after a night on the tiles!
