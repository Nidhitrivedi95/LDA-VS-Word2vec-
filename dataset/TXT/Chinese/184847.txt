xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw I usually have a hard time giving restaurants 5 stars. However here at GENGHIS GRILL that's not a problem. The meat options are the best in the state as well as the quality. They have pretty much every veggie you would want to add to a stir-fry bowl and the sauces are amazing. I always feel like I am well taken care of here from the refills to the way I am treated when I first walk in. GREAT JOB GENGHIS. You earned this five star rating!!
