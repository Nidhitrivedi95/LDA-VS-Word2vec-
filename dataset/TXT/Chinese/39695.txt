awZx3Y1PAwhCUpt3WGZhKg Kenny's is a legend in the area. It's along Steeles at the Scarborough-Markham border, but no other obscure Chinese restaurant can compete with the signature baked rice/spaghetti dishes at Kenny's. Proud to say I've been a regular customer for 10 years running. They are affordable and are open very late. Perfect for large groups of hungry people. You never feel rushed, scan through the menu and dine at your own pace. They give no hassle when splitting the bill and food is pretty consistent. They DO accept debit card payment with a minimum purchase.

What you should order:
- Crispy chicken or beef brisket on rice with Portuguese sauce ($8.50). Add cheese and egg for a small additional cost ($1.25 each)
- Crispy chicken or beef brisket on rice with black pepper sauce ($8.50)
- Rice with shrimps in bamboo steamer ($15.99)
- French toast with condensed milk ($7.50)
- Hong Kong style tea ($2.99)

However, order what you know - I don't recommend getting adventurous with the menu. Tried that 3 times and each time I was disappointed and wished I got the Portuguese sauce rice dish. Tea isn't great  either. Servers are mediocre friendly but very attentive. Love Kenny's - will always be back.
