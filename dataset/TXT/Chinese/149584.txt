sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg Horrible management. I used to love this place, but after going in and being gawked at by the cooks, I'm over it. One of the cooks even had the audacity to take a picture of me with his phone. I complained to the owner of the restaurant (who is frequently there) and all he said was that the cook wasn't taking pictures but just texting. Excuseme? I'm pretty sure I know the difference between someone texting and someone laughing, pointing and taking pictures. And why would you allow your cooks to use their phones while working? Ew. Never coming back.
