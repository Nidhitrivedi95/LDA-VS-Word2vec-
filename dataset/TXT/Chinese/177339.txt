WWZgzuTn1k7Yn9bJ_Pr0Kg Im not really sure why so many people have negative comments.  and the worst one is that Panda is better,., Dont get me wrong,.  I love Panda but Bamboo Grille is far and beyond Pandas Orange Chicken.  There is no comparison and I guess that is why some people dont like it,.   Its not all Fry Batter,,  its a light crispy Panko like outside with white meat inside and real orange sauce.,   I just ordered 2 Orange Chicken Lunch Specials for $10.19    If the price was $20.19  I still would have gone there..       

The Sushi  yes I am mad about that too but It is what it is..  Its hard to Keep a good Sushi Chef,  they arent cheap and I have seen this trend happen to more and more. Seems like the Sushi Only Places have taken that part of the market.  Ive heard that even Ah-So is getting rid of their sushi but that might not be true.  

Still Ive Never had a bad experience,  I would be upset if someone asked me to move my table so I can understand that.  But the food is always good,.  I love the atmosphere but miss the Sushi crowd otherwise I would give them 5 Stars.
