CGgUHkAKU0QBsdGvXxfMuw This is a total dump with average to bad food.  There is no personality to the service and the food was prepared so quickly that it had to be boxed or bagged food that simply gets heated and dumped on the customer.  Frankly it was a waste of calories.  

There are too many good Chinese food options to return here.
