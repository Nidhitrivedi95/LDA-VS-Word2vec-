wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw Delicious, authentic Cantonese food!  Their noodle and wonton soups are amazing!  They also have congee and bubble tea.  It's just like the food I had while in Hong Kong.  Most of their popular menu items are displayed with photos on the walls.  Just tell the server what number looks good and order it!

Some of my favorites are the salt baked squid, jade tofu, and Szechuan eggplant.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are quite large, so come with a group and enjoy! ^_^
