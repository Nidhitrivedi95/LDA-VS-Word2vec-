cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw First visit and I'm not trying them again.  I placed a simple order, fried rice, vegi egg rolls, tofu and broccoli and a sweet and sour shrimp.  The food had no flavor.  I was disappointed that the broccoli wasn't fresh but straight out of the freezer section and the tofu was OK.  The shrimp was the best thing, but even that was mostly batter.  They charge .50 for brown rice that tasted no better than what I make at home.  I over heard that they make everything to order and it shows.  I could tell what was prepared first as it was the coldest dish in the bag.  Even with big portions, at least for the fried rice, it's not enough to sway me.
