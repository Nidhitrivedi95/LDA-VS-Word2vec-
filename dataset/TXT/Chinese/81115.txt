Gx3mxDNDd4XX897CgsAYNQ We ordered a few appetizers to give them a try. We order the satay beef sticks and they gave us chicken instead. Very disappointed as it didn't even taste like satay at all. The shumai and crab rangoons were good as well, but I personally didn't like the pork dumplings. Quick delivery.
