KMA1sN-RlOiSEi_nmH26Sw This is probably my favourite dessert place in Montreal, desserts aside, the popcorn chicken rice is a must try. 

It was a busy night, but we still managed to get a table within a reasonable time, thanks to the excellent service of the waitresses. Will definitely visit again to try the Durian Mille-Feuille, it looked delicious as my friend was eating it.
