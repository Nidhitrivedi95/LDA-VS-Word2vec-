7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew So sad that this place has closed!  My co-workers and I went here at least once a month (for a while there, it was once a week on Thursdays) for lunch and/or dim sum.  The food was always fantastic and the prices were even better.  Best crab puffs I've ever had.  The staff was always friendly and greeted us warmly.  Best of luck to the owner, please open another restaurant!
