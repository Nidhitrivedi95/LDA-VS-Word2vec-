OiE0TLzbEATzIW8CbGWigA I can see why people may have rated this place so low. The service wasn't the greatest but at the same time I wouldn't say it was horrible. 
But my experience with the food was different. I really liked what we ordered. 

The pan fried buns were really good. One of the best I've had in this city. Meat filling was  a little small though, but very juicy inside and good flavour. Bottom crust is well done. 

Xiao long paos were good, I'd say there were about what I expected from your average dumpling restaurant. 

The crab meat xiao long paos didn't exactly taste like crab meat. So save your money and don't order these. 

The braised pork belly was delicious. A little bit on the sweet side but the meat was very tender and flavourful. 

Beef noodle soup was ok. You can definitely get better else where. Chunks of meat were small and a little tough. Noodles were good, had a nice texture. Soup was ok, but I've had more flavourful. 

There's this salted egg yolk yam. This was really good. I do like salted egg yolk though so I do have a bias here. I like that the yams were a little under cooked so they still have some crunch. 

I would definitely come back here. I guess just be careful of what you order!
