A new restaurant for me to go to in my neck of town!

Very tasty and reasonably priced noodle restaurant.
I had the beef brisket and Sui Kow (a larger version of the wonton) with dry loh mein noodles.
It came with a bowl of soup garnished with lots of spring onions. Just the way I like it!
Price is $6.50

The only drawback is I may get sick of the lack of variety. You have a choice of soup or dry noodles with one of half dozen different toppings and that's it..
