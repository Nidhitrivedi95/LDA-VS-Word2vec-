Hm2YntlJzqP4reNZRlkCEA Looks they they totally revamped the "previous" Woodstone with new owners.  Totally renovated with more modern and rustic look.   The only thing the same from the "old" is the name.

The seating is comfortable and service is very good!

The menu is creative and offers many of the typical HK style items in conjunction to a a few different offerings.   

The food is very good and tasty with nothing over/under cooked and is fresh.   Definitely a must try place but you may need wait since there was a small lineup (and this is still a "new" place).
