bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Went there on a recommendation for their chop suey. Called up ahead for pickup. Ordered the American chop suey and the General Tao Chicken. 

The good: The chop suey was delicious. The flavours were fantastic. Chicken / shrimp were nicely cooked, soft. Fresh rice. Ironically not as much heat as I would've liked but I'm accustomed to that! The general Tao chicken though bloody hot.  

The bad: The amount of chicken / shrimp in the chop suey was barley any. The egg was horrendous. Looked and tasted horrible. The vegetables (esp broccoli and carrots) were super large. An way too many onions. Almost cried in between. The general Tao chicken though was over cooked tremendously. Nice flavour but didn't look all that appetizing. 

Gonna give this place the benefit of the doubt for now and try something else next time to make sure, considering the reviews.
