DncR06kFZ_u2O4NlbPPE4w I really really wanted to like this because I keep trying to find some authentic Thai food up north. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the mark for us. We tried four things (but one item in our to go order turned out to be the wrong thing).  

Good:  The green curry was spicy and not bad. Heavy on coconut like it could have simmered longer maybe but still not bad. The Pad Thai with shrimp was ok too. I'm used to wider rice noodles and some egg in there but this had thinner noodles with an array of cilantro, bean sprouts and cabbage on top. Light on the peanuts in general, very generous portions. 

Not so good:  The other two dishes - a chicken basil dish and the Bok Choy (which was supposed to be spicy eggplant) were way way way too heavy on garlic. Thai food does not prominently feature lots of garlic so it was really out of place and made the dishes bitter. You could see big white cubes of it all over the dishes. We ended up throwing most of those two out. 

Finally, maybe this is a tiny thing but I just don't want to get fortune cookies with my Thai food. It seems to suggest that either they think - or they think I think - all Asian food is the same (or even related at all to the American fortune cookie invention).  While I have nothing in general against a nice crunchy fortune cookie, I love Thai food and the Thai culture too much to make that mistake.
