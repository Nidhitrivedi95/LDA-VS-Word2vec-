It is a little loud. They seem to move tables fast.  Our waitress was OK.  She did explain one item when asked but just seemed to be in a hurry.  Our food did come out fast but not all together.  One person was done when the last meal come out.  I get that most share and we did share some items but the last meal received was for someone that was not sharing.  We were given some take away containers before being asked and before being done...I guess we were at the table to long! Ha!
With so many reviews and pictures will keep this short.  The potstickers and Soup Dumplings we had were very good.  We had the drucken chicken to start and it was a little to cold from sitting in a cold refrig. We were there on a Sunday when they are suppose to have Shrimp w. Loofah Soup Dumplings but it was not available...we were there for an early dinner so not sure if it was available that day or not.  We had some steamed broccoli with the minced pork sauce that was cooked perfectly and very good.  I am a fan of the food but the rush to get you out and the lack of any real service was strange!  So do take out!
