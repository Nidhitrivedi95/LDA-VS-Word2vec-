fxZ8B05ROM1BSAdlh7p1MQ Every single time I come into this place, I get horrible treatment from one of their employees. It's not just me, it's everyone who walks through the door. I haven't gotten her name but she def needs to be fired because of how rudely she treats customers. My visit a couple of months ago was the last straw with me. I had placed an order online for pick up for me and my hubby. I arrived 2 minutes after the time it was scheduled to be ready. When I approached the "pick up" counter, guess what employee decided to help me.... so the rude girl asks me for my name and I tell her, so she looks it up on her computer. She can't find it so I show her the receipt on my phone. She looked through that email for what felt like 10 minutes and was scrolling non stop trying to make sure it was legit. and then she handed another employee my phone so that they could confirm that my receipt was in fact for that date, time and location. I was so embarrassed because they made it seem that I was lying and trying to get free food. So finally after like 15 minutes the rude girl tells me that I have to wait for one of the entrees to cook because they had just run out. I had to wait another 25 minutes for the food to be ready and not once did I get an apology for the inconvenience. The point of ordering online is so that I don't have to wait there! I was here waiting for more than 40 mins! I love Panda Express but I will never set foot in this specific location ever again. (Unless that rude girl is fired lol)
