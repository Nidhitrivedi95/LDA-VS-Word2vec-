WWyiaVsJusbRRdpTP5gomQ One of my favorite Chinese restaurant. 
We reserved a big round table for 6 people. We had six dishes plus a big rice. Good portion. Finished all. Each person 18$. Great value.
I recommend spicy fried chicken boneless, chili fish, cumin lamb on hot plate, Northeast 3 veggi, tomato beef stew and etc. Love most their dishes. Especially dishes number start with D and H, standing for Dongbei (northeast area) and Hunan province.
The service was quick and attentive. This place is spacious than other restaurants near by. 
Will come back.
