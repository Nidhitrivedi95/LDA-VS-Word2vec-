adI5BlJCtvWq2uAwmyndXA Service is a bit bumpy, but very hearty.
The food is good, but what they serve as large is a bit pidding. So everything togehter I think the prices are to high for what you get, where your are and how you sit.
If they imporve a bit it could really be a place to come twice.
P.S. 
Hot means hot ;-)
