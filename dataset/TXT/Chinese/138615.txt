QpOAv584eb-ecG4TLEm95g Always spot on. Ive done dine in, delivery and pick up and they've always been superb. Even when it's a crazy busy night at dinner when Im calling for delivery oand their phone is ringing off the hook, they give me courtesy and professionalism as they take my order. The teriyaki chicken, Kung pao, bbq pork fried rice, whatever you get is delicious especially if you have special requests like no onions! They do great work, consistently! Love it! The staff rules too!!!!
