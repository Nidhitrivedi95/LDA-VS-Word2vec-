5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Been to Blossom for several times and never get disappointed. I personally think the high quality of foods and spectacular services they present make them the best Chinese restaurant in town. Peking Duck is my personal favorite dish at Blossom. I have been to Beijing and had the chance to try this traditional cuisine there, and I think the Peking duck at Blossom is just as authentic as the Peking duck in Beijing! At Blossom, they peel the whole duck into thinly pieces and wrapped in a special flour made paper with sliced cucumber, scallion and special made sauce. Besides, it's all happening in front of you so you can just seat tight and watch the magical moment to happen and enjoy the delicious dishes!
