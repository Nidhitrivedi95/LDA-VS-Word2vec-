-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg Stopped in Saigon in search of PHO!  It was icy cold out.  The place is super nice and the service was great.  I had the salt and pepper shrimp extra spicy. and the summer rolls.   Delicious !  The menu was way extensive.  I'll be back to try more.  Go with a few people  if you can, that way you a can order away and try a few items.  Enjoy. Friendly vibe. 


The cocktail menu looks really tasty. Sadly I had to pass. Next time I will indulge.  Green tea Martini sounds interesting!
