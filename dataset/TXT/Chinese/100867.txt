K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw One2Snacks may be the longest I've waited to try a place that I was desperate to get to within the city.

I split an order of Laksa and Char Kuey Teow with a friend, which was a great way to try a couple things.

First off, the place is small and you won't be guaranteed to find a spot since there's about 8 seats. BUT, you can't really complain, especially when you see the price and value of the food. Virtually everything is right around the $8 mark. The portions are massive and nothing is cheaped out, like little meat for example.

The Laksa is as easy a 5/5 to review a dish that I've come across.  I rarely invoke the "I've been to this place, so I should know...", but I honestly did spend a few months in Malaysia and this is KL-style Laksa measures up. The coconut milk-base broth is delicious and I can't keep it off my mind.

The Kuey Teow didn't reach the same heights, but was still very enjoyable.

There are a few items on the board that they no longer serve and have no intention of doing so in the future, so they should probably remove it - such as the roti canai unfortunately. Still, it would take several more variables in order to pull down this rating as it's such quality food at phenomenal value.
