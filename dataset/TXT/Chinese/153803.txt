tbMAjldMYhvDUS2gG5Fdxw I have lived near this area for over 10 years so I know this restaurant very well. We go there often and the owners are so nice and friendly! 

They have the best lunch special and they make it very quick which is nice when you aren't wanting to stay too long. 

You can't go wrong with any dish because they are all so good! My favorite dish is orange chicken and vegetable fried rice with chili paste on the side of course haha.

It's just great Chinese food.
