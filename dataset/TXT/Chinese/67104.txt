ElqLoKM__uU7DcYzRnMpNw We come here twice a week! The staff is amazing and super accommodating- My fiancé is vegan and the staff knows this and will warn me when I order something that I think is vegan but has something in it. There is an older guy who usually is the host-he cracks me up because he wants you to have a great experience- if my drink gets half full he will yell at someone to fill it up. There is a lady who seems like maybe she's the manager- she is awesome, too. She will come over and chat or grab a refill if needed. The food is great. Good portion sizes for the price. My favorite is walnut chicken, it's breaded and fried with a sweet honey sauce. It's usually pretty quiet, I think cause most people get take out.
