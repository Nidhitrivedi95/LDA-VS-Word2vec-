sePTDv1dGHPID7kwuNzXaA This is my all time favorite Congee restaurant in all of Toronto.

Every time I step foot into this restaurant I feel like I am in Hong Kong.

It has a very traditional vibe that makes me feel at home in a weird but good way.

The menu is geared towards Congee and all of the other Congee food goodies that you would expect from one of these type of restaurants.

My favorite that I always order is the plain steam rolls and a beef and preserved egg congee.   The plain steamrolls are perfectly steamed not too soft and not too overly deemed to the point of being too hard and thick to eat.  The Congee has the traditional beef that is mixed with rice and is rare so you would need mix it in with the congee to cook it once you get it.

I always come here whenever I feel like I need a bowl of good congee.

At certain times mainly lunch it gets pretty packed but the tables come and go pretty quickly so you'd normally don't have to wait that long for a table.

Try this place!
