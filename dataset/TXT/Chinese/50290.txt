cEFnJrDaz7BLO0xOCJlF6A I'm amazed some places can stay open for business for so long despite being so clearly consistently horrible. Why oh why didn't I check the Yelp reviews?!

This is the worst buffet I've ever been to. The worst Chinese food I've ever had. The food has clearly been sitting out for hours. Multiple items are unlabelled and the ones that are labelled are pretty much done with Sharpies on a greasy sneeze guard. I've never seen so little effort put into presentation. I'm still having nightmares about the chocolate pudding just plopped into a metal insert. I don't have to tell you what it looked like. Chinese sticky buns (dessert) placed beside meat items because why not, I guess?

And that doesn't even touch on the food. Oh, the food. If only my party had listened to the voice telling us "Something seems odd about how this tastes..." 2 out of 3 of us were throwing up within the hour. I will say we both felt MUCH better after this.

The only good part of our dining experience was how much we were able to laugh at how ridiculous the whole place was. Reading terrible reviews from fellow Yelpers got us through part of the night.

I will say our server was quite nice and attentive. Yay.

For the love of all that is holy, stay away. In a busy and bustling Chinatown, we somehow chose this place. Don't make the same mistake.
