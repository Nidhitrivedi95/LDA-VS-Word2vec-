YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g I am not usually one to go for dim sum our Chinese food in general, because I feel like the quality and taste is so hit and miss. But seriously, luckee does it right. The chef special appetizer that night was a cold noodle and tofu salad that was the best tofu I every had.. Gobbled it right up. The dumplings were, of course, divine. In fact, there was nothing we had there that wasn't good. If I'm ever in the mood to splurge and for Chinese at the same time, I know where I'm going.
