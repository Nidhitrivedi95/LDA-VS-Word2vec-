Chicken and abalone congee - I found the congee was a bit too thick. Tasted okay though, especially when accompanied with the deep fried dough sticks. (I have no idea what its called in English but deep fried dough sticks is the best description I can give :)

Rice rolls we ordered tasted okay as well but they did not taste like they were freshly made. Not as soft and silky smooth like they should be.

The egg yolk custard bun we ordered was also okay.

I think they have way too much to choose from on their menu. Food is decent but would not go out of my way to come here.
