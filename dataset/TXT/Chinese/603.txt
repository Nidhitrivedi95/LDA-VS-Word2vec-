-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw I don't even want to give chatime half a star. I bought honeydew milk tea with aloe Vera jelly and it was disgusting. My drink looks and tastes like regular tea even though the label says honeydew milk tea. The aloe Vera jelly was also disappointing. The customer service was horrible. I was hoping to order my drink in the super cup and instead of explaining that I am unable to order certain drinks, I was given a vague answer. I had to find out why by myself through the internet. It would have been much more convenient to the paying costumer if they could at least explain or answer my questions. The music was so loud making it easy for the employees to dismiss me. This place is not worth my time and money. I will not be coming back.
