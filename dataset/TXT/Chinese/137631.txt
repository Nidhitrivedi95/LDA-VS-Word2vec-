QKCu3cKjMAOOZI7tEfv0zg ordered delivery, they said about 45 minutes, not bad considering it was dinner hour on a saturday evening, food got here in about 30 minutes.....food got here, and it was pretty delicious tasting.  only complaint i had, which i cant even really complain about, is that when i called to order, it was very difficult to understand the lady on the other end of the phone due to her thick accent.  but my order was EXACTLY as i ordered it. and got here pretty damn fast!
