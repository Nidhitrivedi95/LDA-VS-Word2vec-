aS4t4ee3xqQXgNHNxi9gAA Definitely not the best Chinese food I've ever had. It's was decent enough for takeout (it curbed our cravings) but I've had way better in Madison. We also ordered both of our dishes extra spicy and they were both sweet. They don't put much spices in their food and the pot stickers were soggy.
