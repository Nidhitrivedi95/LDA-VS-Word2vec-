Lv9wzkvPrVG-VdPGcw53_A We went here yesterday for lunch to celebrate a birthday. Our group consisted of 6 adults and 3 kids who were 5 years and under. I wasn't sure what to expect because of the mixed reviews on everything from service to cleanliness to price.

I am happy to write that the bad reviews were all over exaggerated. Our waitress was attentive and ready to take our order when we were ready. Your seafood is weighed and you are told exactly how much it weighs so you know what to expect. Basically, take those prices on the menu and use them as a base + amount based on additional weight of seafood.

The food was delicious! Many of those in our table had previously gone to the other lobster restaurant down the street and all of them preferred the food from here. Our lobster and crab were cooked 4 or 5 different ways. In the end, our bill was under $220 with tax and tip already added on. 

We will definitely come back!
