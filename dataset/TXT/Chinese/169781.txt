vU8-ATy2-MASm-bQXdhRaw I'm not sure why everyone is so put out by Pei Wei, it's a fast yummy take out when you want to watch a movie at home or in a hurry. The cashier was super nice and when she overheard my boyfriend and I debating rice(since he doesnt like the brown) she offered to give us a side of brown on the house! We had the Carmel Chicken which was pretty amazing for a quick Asian place. We've also tried the mandrian Kung Pao and the Thai coconut Curry, both satisfied :) The only complaint is the tofu has a strange taste. 
If you're looking for a nice Asian meal go to P.F. Chang's but this is the same quality food for half the price!
