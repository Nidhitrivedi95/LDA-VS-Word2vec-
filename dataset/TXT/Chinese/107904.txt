lEtpTFWetCf6xnzeImLiHg This place is pretty good from the dishes I tried, but I was clearly not as impressed as other people.  I suppose I was expecting more for the price point of this place, but it is certainly good food.  I had their orange beef, and also had a couple bites of their Lo Mein.

The orange beef sauce was delicious, and a slightly different take on it than I have ever had before, but the meat itself is the typcal frozen, thawed, and deep fried meat that I have come to expect from mediocre takeout places (Or at least it tasted like it if it wasn't).  The rice served with it was perfectly cooked, and the portion was extremely filling.

From the bites I had of the Lo Mein however, it tasted exactly like the Lo Mein from Magic Wok.  That is not to say it was bad, Magic Wok is still probably the best chinese you can get for the $5 - $10 price range, and they deliver!  I was expecting it to have a distinctive taste, or at least fresher ingredients for the around $20 price point.

Overall not a bad meal, well cooked, and good service if you dine-in.  The quality/freshness of their ingredients do not match their price point if you ask me though.
