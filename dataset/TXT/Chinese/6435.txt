0It4d0eFPJ5UnQqe6g2Z3w I recently went to the China King Buffet, because my parents kept saying how consistently good the food was. This could not be further from the truth and in fact, it was among the worst dining experiences that I've had in over a decade. This has to be among the worst Chinese buffets in the city. Listen to the others reviewers, the food is awful and your money would be better spent elsewhere.
