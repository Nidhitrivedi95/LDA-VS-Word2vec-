QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA This is a restaurant I have been to umpteen times and thought of reviewing just now. Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant. Though admittedly, i havent experimented too much here, i have found what I love and stick to it. And that special list includes water boiled chicken, green beans with bacon, spinach with garlic, fish in black bean sauce. Order from the chinese menu, dont go with the cliche of kung pao chicken when all of these yummy dishes exist.
