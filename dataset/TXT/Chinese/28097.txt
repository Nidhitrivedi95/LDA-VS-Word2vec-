8keN8Z2sylAEXgMCJMQpDg One of the best New York style Chinese food Restaurants I have ever been to, outside NYC. The Chicken with Broccoli was spot on, brown sauce was full of flavor and broccoli was cooked to slight crunchy perfection. I thought for a mention I was back Downtown. Don't pass this restaurant by it will not disappoint
Have to add fast, friendly and courteous service make MY HOUSE a new favorite spot for me.
