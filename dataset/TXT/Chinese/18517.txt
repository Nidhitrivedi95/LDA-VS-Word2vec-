5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A I used to live in the Henderson area and randomly saw this golden find. Happy to say that trying it once landed me a go-to place for my Thai fix! 

Thai House Restaurant is a very nice, intimate spot. I would consider it almost like fine dining (wine-type glasses for water and cloth napkins), yet with affordable pricing. Thai House is the first Thai restaurant I tried when I moved to Las Vegas in September 2014, and it is so good that I refuse to waste my time trying anything else! I've had their papaya salad, yellow curry, and pad thai-- all amazing. Plus, on top of high-quality, delicious food, their customer service is outstanding! I've been here five times and within every visit, I'm seated immediately with water served/drink orders taken right away. The food comes out very quickly too, and they check on you multiple times to make sure everything is ok, then are quick to replenish your needs (as all great servers should do). 

Side note: most of their entrees are spiced from 1-10. I have a very low tolerance for spicy food, so if you are like me but want a tiny kick, a 2 should suffice.
