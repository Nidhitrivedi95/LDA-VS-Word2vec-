From the moment I ordered the food, we ordered 20 pieces of salmon rose sushi. But everything came and we even ordered a second batch of foods, and the salmon rose sushi still hasn't arrived. We tried asking waiters but not a single one responded. Finally, a waiter come and we told the waiter to check on the order after we waited for an hour and a half, and they gave us only 15 pieces from the original 20. So we reordered 10 pieces of it, and it didn't come, so we had to check on it with the server. But after waiting some time they still gave us 9 pieces, one short from what we ordered. Don't know what make these salmon rose sushi so precious.
