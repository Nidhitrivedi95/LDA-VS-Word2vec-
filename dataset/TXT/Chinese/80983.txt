GWNmYFQw3WitfTPt5uGMvQ I really hate the fact that I have to give this place only 3 stars. It's getting 3 stars because the guy that helped us was really nice and the food was really fast (take out). With that being said, our food was a big disappointment. The only entree that was a little decent was the orange chicken, but even Panda Express could have done better. Our egg foo young patties were burnt so they were bitter and had a funny metallic taste to it, vegetable lo mien, no flavor at all, bland, pork fried rice, also bland. I don't know how all of their food can be bland, it was like they were watching their sodium intake there. Really sad and disappointed because we were hoping to find a decent Chinese food place.
