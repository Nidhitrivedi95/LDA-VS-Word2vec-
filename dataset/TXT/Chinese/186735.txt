yBxzqKXHhvNVaFnEOd4f7Q If you are broke but still need to take someone out to dinner, Great Wall might be the just the place to get away with it. It's definitely a hole in the wall, but that just makes it intimate! Portions are so gigantic that you could probably split an order... and I don't think there's a single item on the menu over $10, and that's for dinner prices!

Menu has plenty to choose from, and some standouts for me include the won ton soup, the Great Wall egg foo yung (shrimp and bbq pork), and the double mushroom beef. My guy and I argue over whether the gigantic eggrolls are any good (he says yes, I say no), but we are united in disliking the lemon chicken dish here- the only thing we won't order again (breading is way too thick).
