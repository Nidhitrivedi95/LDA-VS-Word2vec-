PTPd2xamYtUCH00NqML-YA Great place for traditional chinese food!

Came here for my birthday. Had the King crab dinner combo. Got a ~9lb king crab, steamed crab legs with glass noodles. Fried crab body, crab shell soup and crab fried rice. The meal also comes with steamed fish, stir fry pepper pork and another veggie dish. Can definitely feed 8 people! And a good value too for 388!

The service was great I also got a special dessert for my birthday. The place needs a bit of updating, I think they just kept the previous decor from the restaurant here before. But it's now under new management and I am quite impressed with the service and the food quality here. It hard to see the resturant from the street, so keep an eye out for it, its under a bowling place.
