X4YG1pu1MDVSi07S3i4YCA This was the first place I ate at when I moved to Squirrel Hill, it was WORTH IT! Affordable, quick, and above all delicious. The inside of the shop isn't pretty, but don't let that fool you (it's take-out, who cares?). The man that owns the shop is also incredibly nice and polite- he'll be the one answering the phone and cashing you out. Highly highly recommended.
