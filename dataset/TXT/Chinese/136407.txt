qGLEE1yA1bK0YdlGI-S39A If you want wonton soup...this is the place.  Order 3 topping noodle soup with shrimp wonton, dumpling and beef brisket with a side of vegetables w/ oyster sauce.  Broth is steaming hot and savoury, noodles taste fresh and wontons are big and tasty.  Just an overall good wonton soup.  Very fast service for a quick meal.
