-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ Came for lunch today and it was as expected. I ordered the yummy bbq mix and my boyfriend had the short rib plate with fried rice. Food was excellent but docking one star for not being able to substitute bbq chicken for katsu on my mix plate. I usually go to LL bbq and they always accommodate. Next time I wanna try the Chinese and rolls
