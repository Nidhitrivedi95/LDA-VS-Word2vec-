Kw06PxDkF8gNMVWntmBKTw When I have craving for dumpling soup, I come here since its close to my home area. You come in, simple service, simple food. Grab a seat, you serve yourself water or tea. I got two items with shrimp wonton and fish paste meatball. I put some chilli oil and flakes in there to make the broth stand out better. ($6) its alright of a deal. The shrimp wonton is nice and plumped, and the fish paste meatball is not bad as well.

I did inquired how much it would cost to purchase a pack of their shrimp wonton, and the lady mentioned its $11 for 10 dumplings or something. That's pretty pricey I think, but then again, shrimp price has increased in supermarkets...

I would come back when I have the craving, or I can always go to Brimley Centre Mall up-stairs for that too.

(btw they close at around 7PM, so if you are wishing to come for dinner, you have to come before that...And I believe they only accept CASH!!!)
