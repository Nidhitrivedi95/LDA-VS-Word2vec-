OaHJvi10dJbMIaQXg5e2Ag Let's start with the restrooms. Extremely dirty. Learned long ago that if this area is not kept clean the kitchen is likely to be the same. My bah me was good. But my wife ordered egg rolls. These were the same as the microwave ones from the grocery. Fried rice was below par. The sweet & sour sauce was just sweet and it was thickening from being too old. Vietnam food very good but Chinese food was mediocre. All the customers were younger men. No women. No lunch rush. If desperate for Vietnamese food stop otherwise eat elsewhere.
