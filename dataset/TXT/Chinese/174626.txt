WF0I9AwErfaqkPPXM98ywQ If you think all chinese bakeries are dirty, fly-infested, and filled with underwhelming and underfilled pastries, you clearly have not been to this one. Lucullus takes a Western elegant twist on Chinese bakeries and really elevates the pineapple bun into something more.

I am an absolute fan of the decor. Holy BLB. It's just so quaint, and dainty. I feel like royalty just standing under the brightly lit chandeliers and gothic style coffee machines. Really great atmosphere for any time of the day.

Now for a quick review of all the pastries I tried:

Matcha green tea white chocolate croissant - this is amazing you must try 5/5
dark chocolate croissant - this is really good but tastes like costco chocolatines (4.5/5)
Apricot and raisin bread - this looks fantastic but it's just bread with apricot drizzled on top and raisins (3/5)
Pineapple Bun - if fresh (5/5), if not (3/5)

They also sell entrees which I heard are pretty good. Rice + meat dishes with tomato/cream/curry sauces. Typical HK style cafe food.

I've been several times at night time too, but they don't do quick sale discounts which is sad. I don't really like paying full price for almost-day-old bread.
