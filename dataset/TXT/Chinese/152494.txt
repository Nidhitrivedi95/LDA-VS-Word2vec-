T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw Poor service!!  Food was mediocre and spare ribs over cooked.  Lazy food preparation.  Broccoli in sautéed vegetable stir fry had whole crowns!!  Do you expect us to do your work for you?  Tables around us left un-bussed the whole time we were there.  They never even bothered to refill our glasses of water.  We had to constancy request for our waiter.  Never coming back here again!
