H94fBucKEuNKsjbSy7WODg I reather enjoy this place.  The food is overall pretty damn decent and it's not expensive.  The crab puffs are really good.  I wanted to crawl inside of it, camp for three days and eat my way out like a tarantula wasp larva, but I had work....

It goes without saying, but the service is incredible.  Everyone mentions it.  The lady who works there gave me soup on the house simply because my girlfriend ordered a meal with it and I didn't and didn't want me to be lonely and without something to eat.  That's rad.

As I was leaving she also gave us free cookies.  Fuck yeah!

Each time I've been here, there've been loud-as-hell people for some reason.  One time I went and there must've been, a World of Warcraft convention in town or something because there was a table full of kids with plastic battleaxes telling jokes with such punchlines as, "Wookie bowcaster," and "Purple light sabers!"
