YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g I'm surprised by people who come here shocked that it's going to be more expensive than the whole in the wall up the street.  This is Toronto, where people are more than happy to pay $15 for bacon and eggs because it's called brunch. 

Here's what you get for the slightly elevated price:

1. A chance to see Susur and tell all your foodie friends.
2. The ability to have a burnt orange manhattan with a spring roll.
3.  Dim sum served both traditionally and in contemporary fashion.

The best dish was the Shrimp Cheung Fun (which I didn't order initially but the waiter highly recommended).  The Char Siu Bao (pork buns) were pretty disappointing.  Otherwise, most of the dishes were average to above average.

The layout is really not conducive to Dim Sum as there are a number of tables the cart can't reach.  Other than that, it is a clean and pleasant atmosphere with solid service.

Yes, I'm sure you can get cheaper and probably better Dim Sum at many places just up the road but I'd have no issues coming here again. It's easy to remember.
