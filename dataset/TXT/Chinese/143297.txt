rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g I have been here several times and I definitely love their shrimp noodles sauce since it's quite similar with the sauce that we have back in my hometown. Their dim sum is not as good as the other place such as C-Fu but since I am in love with their sauce so much, I came back every time for dim sum. However, their service is just horrible. The people delivering foods can hardly even speak any English. In addition, their attitude towards customer was unacceptable. I used to be a waitress so I know what should be a standard service. When I asked for some extra sauce, they clearly give me a disgusting look and roll the eyes over me like I'm not even their customer. They even speak in Chinese to the other employees and I can realize through their tune saying bad thing about me and my friend. What's wrong with you? I go to a restaurant and I certainly can pay for any extra cost for the sauce. If it's needed to be charged, I'll pay for it but just don't give me that dirty look especially when you work at a service industry. I'm your customer and I should get at least some respect. It's even horrible that they ask for tip when I don't think they deserve it. They try to make tip a mandatory thing when it's optional. And I strongly don't feel like they deserve it. It's horrible that they think they treat customer like that and still get paid for a good amount of tips. It's non-sense. I don't know how good your food is, but there are tons of restaurants out there that might have the same or even better food quality than you guys. So be cautious about how you treat your customers or else you guys might be out of business soon for such attitude.
