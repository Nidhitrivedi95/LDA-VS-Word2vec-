D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw I've been coming here for two years, when I'm in town, feels like 3 (been here at least 6 times). Looks like they've updated the menu with nice pictures. Beautiful atmosphere, with hookah lounge outside, great staff. The food looks great and taste better. Awesome Thai Iced Tea. Had Yellow Curry, Pad See Ew, Tom Kha (sp?) soup, and Samosas. Delicious. Highlight meal of the trip. Hidden gem just off the Vegas Strip.

The only negative I can think if is there was not a lot of noodles with the Pad See Ew. More chicken than noodles, but most may like this.
