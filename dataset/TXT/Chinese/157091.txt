TSGBM2z5BTeJvYQAznz8Fg My wife & I, along with another couple, dined there at 6:00 last night. I had been there for Lunch once before and enjoyed the quality of the food and prompt service, so I thought it'd be worth bringing the bride back to get her sushi "fix". 

I sampled small portions of a variety of dishes: roasted duck, a couple crab legs, garlic shrimp, Mongolian beef, Lo Mien noodles and a fried chicken wing. My wife focused exclusively on their sushi- Rainbow Rolls, California Roll, Regular & Spicy Tuna Rolls. (Note: A previous reviewer gave a poor review because it didn't automatically come with wasabi. My wife hates wasabi, so they get kudos for that. Different strokes.) Also, she wanted me to make sure I mentioned the WIDE variety of sushi, and that each time she returned to the sushi bar, the chefs had added more sushi to keep selections abundant.

Nothing was dried out... or cold... or spongy, and there was plenty of dinner conversation that could've resulted in that effect. The entire restaurant is clean, well lit, and stocked with such an impressive variety of dinner choices.

My only reason for not giving 5 Stars is the absence of any crab crackers for the patrons to use to open their crab legs. Perhaps that's done on purpose, and they really want to make the customer "work for it". Also, there's much too much salt in the melted butter.

In closing, contrary to the 1-star "whiners", we did not experience any such problems. This is a buffet, people, and a pretty good one at that. We'll be going back, this time during the week when their discount pricing saves an additional $8.00 for dinner!
