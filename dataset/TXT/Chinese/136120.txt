QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA My experience here this past weekend was mediocre at best.  I arrived at the Chinese Cultural Center at about 4pm, after Dim Sum had ended at the Golden Buddha, so I decided to give this place a try with my Taiwanese boyfriend and visiting family.  The prices were a bit of a rip off for the portions that were served.  I order the vegetarian chow fun for $1 extra than it would have been as "chow mein."  I'm assuming we just received the American menu, but who knows?  The service was conducted half in English and half in Chinese, which is typical when our mixed race party shows up at a Chinese restaurant.  I sampled the lemon shrimp my father ordered.  The sauce was a bit too sugary, like lemon drops, and the shrimp itself had such a thick, hard shell of batter that it was hard to taste the shrimp.  No drinks were suggested; we were left with only the water that was refilled every 5 minutes.  When we boxed up some leftovers, they did not give us the rice to take home, which makes me wary that it is being re-used.  A child was with us, and there was no kid's menu, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The food overall tasted alright, but I have definitely had better (and better service too!)  Nice try, but I'll stick with the Golden Buddha or something closer to Chandler.
