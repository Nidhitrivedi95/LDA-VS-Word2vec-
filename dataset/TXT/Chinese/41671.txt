B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ One saturday afternoon, tired of  weekend errands, decided to drop in Bamboo garden for buffet at North Olmstead. Honestly, had no big expectations, while walking in, and was pleasantly surprised. Did not have to wait more than 2 minutes.  Our main concerns are delicious food, cleanliness and attentive service. And they scored well above our expectations. Hot soup was so delicious , did not even want to go to the main course, buut we did.  We are vegetarian and have difficult time finding the right place for us. My hubby was so happy to find such a great variety of vegetarian dishes and that is tasty too.  

Decor is India-Chinese inspired and wall are painted red-yellow warm colors. I would rate it average, but who cares as long as I get delicious food in reasonable cost . I live like 45 min away but we are going back soon.
