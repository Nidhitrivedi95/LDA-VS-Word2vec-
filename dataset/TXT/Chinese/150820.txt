swfdlAMXwV8OjYD5nkA6nQ New owner sucks...not the old China Place that I have been to many time no longer owned by MIchael C.

New owner closes at 10:00 while sign on door clearly says open til 10:30.  Hostess, leftover from old crew was rude.  Much like the reason she was never the hostess under previous owner.

Did enjoy it before sale....I'll never eat, or attempt to eat here again, and is only 1.4 miles from my home.

Totally ignorant to customer arriving  1/2 hour before closing time.
