VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q Went there with a couple of friends and their daughter. It was a great noodle place. The concept is that you can created your own noodle dish. You choose the soup base, the noodle, and the toppings. They put it together and bring it to you. It is a really cheap noodle dish (I think, I didn't pay so I don't know). 

My recommendation is the instant noodle, the malay soup base, and the toppings are your choice. I was not a fan of the vermicelli, but my wife got the instant noodle and it was very good. 

The ingredients seem fresh (well, obviously the instant noodle can't be fresh), and it tasted really good. The only thing I didn't like was the service. It was the first time I was there and the lady didn't explain how to order. I asked, but she ignored me so I needed to get my friend to help me with it. I guess I was just a little bit slow. I always thought it was like every other location. The dishes are pre -made. 

Overall, I like the location and will most likely go back when I get the chance.
