vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Food is good, serving is proportional but i find it still 
Expensive. Service was fast though they were busy, they have alot of staff. The staff in general are not attentive to your needs, not friendly. We literally have to chase the host to give us our seats when we were just right in front of her. She didn't greet us, didn't even smile, like what the typical host would do. Server didn't bother to visit us if we need anything or ask us how the food was. Place was clean, says in front they're grade A. Except the host area's shelves have cluttered stuff in it. 

Our cheque is already on our table yet we were not done yet, i feel rushed because they're starting to get busy. 

Will go back again because of the food but hoping to experience good customer service
