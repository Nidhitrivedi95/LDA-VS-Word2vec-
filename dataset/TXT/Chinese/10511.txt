1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA This a great place for cheap food that taste better and is more than unique than food court offerings. Almost everything  on the menu is less than $10. Food quality is much  than what you would expect for the price. Service is fast. You have to like a restaurant owner that argues about pricing with his food supplier, while he is busing tables, and then shows the food the supplier the product they claim is better product it a cheaper price. The supplier than asks how he can get the product so cheap and he tells her he drives to LA to get the pricing. This actually happened while I was eating lunch. Let me be clear, you aren't going to have the Chinese meal of a lifetime, but you are going to get a great tasting meal at a great price. FYI: parking gets dicey on the weekend and at night. Lunch is the best time for me.
