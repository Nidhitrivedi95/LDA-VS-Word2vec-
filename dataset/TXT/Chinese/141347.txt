rEAFZFziiOWxSLsOLohccQ I give Ann's Asian Bistro a score of 4 for the food and a definite 5 for the service. So that is 4.5 stars overall which is not an option on yelp so I rounded up. The service stands out for numerous reasons.  First they offer a small egg roll appetizer with yelp check in which is always nice when a place does something. They are also extremely prompt with service from being attentive to take your order, water service before you need it, and taking finished dishes away. At one point we asked for more rice and they were happy to do so without charge (I kind of expect that but some places will charge you which I think is silly but thankfully not an issue here). On Mondays they even give you a free sangria with your entree which is a very nice touch. 
     They really care about service here and it shows. Things just kept getting better. Despite my husband's advice to order 4 Entrees, I decided to get 3 Entrees and split them among our party of 4. After we finished the 3 Entrees I decided I wanted another one and it was now near closing. The owner sent out a large bowl Chinese soup with vegetables and pork for the table to enjoy (On The House) while we wait for the additional food to be prepared. Fantastic Service!  It was my fault for not ordering it in the first place so they definitely went above and beyond!
    Additionally the atmosphere is nice and they also hold cooking classes occasionally (which I haven't tried) but it is an interesting feature. Finally, this is a small family business which I always feel is a good thing to support.
