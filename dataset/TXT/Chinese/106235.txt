A decent selection of bottled beers and wine are also available.

Chino Banditos's is an impressively unique place to chow down on your midday lunch hour. The portions of food you get for around 10 bucks will take your hunger and beat it  in the face with a nine iron. However, I wouldn't say that everything on the menu is 100% perfect, but what they do make well, they make phenomenally well. For example, while their re-fried beans may not be anything special, but their black beans are sweet, tangy, and absolutely delicious! I've tried just about everything on the menu and the jen red and hengrenade chicken items are fantastic and bursting with flavor.

Another great feature of the place is how well they guide newcomers through their menu and ordering system; attributing to their fine customer service. Free samples are all available on request for just about everything on the menu, so "try before you buy" definitely wins this place some brownie points too since it'll help determine what you might like the most to make that first meal there AWESOME.

All in all, the food, service, and generous portions all contribute to a solid and DELICIOUS work lunch. If your feeling a little adventurous and want something totally different, but just a tad familiar, you can't go wrong with Chino Bandito's.
