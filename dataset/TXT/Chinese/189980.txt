We came for dinner today.

The decor is nice and modern. As you walk in, there is a bar on the left and there are two rooms, not sure if both are karoake rooms. 

We sat at the main dining room. The food was just average. It is not your typical Chinese restaurant that I think most Americans are used to. Their menu is on an iPad.  I started to write down on my phone what we want to order cos ipad was not very user friendly. We ordered
 
squid claw
bbq lamb
duck tongue
fried chicken neck
Spicy shrimp
fried chicken skeleton
fried chicken wings
mapo tofu

and Strawberry green tea

The food was just ok. I felt most of the items were salty.

The service was good and the waitress spoke english.
