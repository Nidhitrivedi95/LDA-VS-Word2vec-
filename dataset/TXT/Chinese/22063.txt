6gF-m1csJtckBSJEmIpsTg Tried this place for lunch for the first time today. Had the crab crunch roll, the chicken and shrimp spring rolls and a chicken kata roll. It was all SO good and made fresh when I ordered. The crab crunch roll had pieces of crab stick instead of the shredded crab "salad" most places use. The waiter was very helpful, explained what things were and what he suggested. I am taking a class nearby and will def come here again.
