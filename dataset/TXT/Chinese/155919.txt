tnvZOd2vNCLPQS1KEZxqog I absolutely love that I can now have dim sum at any time of the day and in the evening! In addition to dim sum, this restaurant also offers Sichuan dishes and noodle soups. 

We stepped in here on a Saturday mid afternoon and ordered a few items from the dim sum menu: Shu mai, pan fried beef bun, scallion pancake, and xiao long bao. All the items are cooked to order but they came out in a short amount of time, piping hot. Out of all the items my favorite was the shu mai. They were four huge pieces and the ground pork was tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The xiao long bao were large too and had a lot of delicious broth but the dough was a little too thick and gummy for my tastes. I also would have liked some soup spoons to eat the dumplings with so that I could capture as much of the broth as possible. The pan fried items were fried to perfection, and the beef buns had a lot of juicy broth to them as well. The scallion pancake, with its crispy outer fried layer, was a little too thick and dense tasting for me. 

The selection for dim sum is a bit limited compared to the big restaurants with carts and a bit more expensive but I think this is the trade off you get. Less variety and more expensive but fresher product vs. more mass produced taste with more options.

Service was impeccable and the ladies that own the restaurant and work here are so friendly. 

I'll definitely be back to try more dim sum and to try some of their Sichuan food too.
