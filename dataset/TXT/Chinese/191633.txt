yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A This is our new favorite place to eat!  The lemon chicken is the best!  We have excellent service every time we go there.  The price is the lowest we paid in years.  We now are regulars and eat at Flo's at least twice a week!  Thank you to the staff and Kevin who manages a great place!
