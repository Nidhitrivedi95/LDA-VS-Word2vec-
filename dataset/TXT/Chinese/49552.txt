CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I'm as surprised as other reviewers about the variance of ratings here. My guess would be that your experience depends on how busy is the place. In my 5 days in Bellagio, I ate there 4 times. Two soups and two main courses were the best I ever had in that style. For the first time in my life I asked to thank the chef personally. It's not a what you call a 'traditional' Asian cuisine, if there is such a thing, it's more on a fusion side of things. And it is priced like it is in a very busy hotel in a middle of Las Vegas strip, which it is. But compared to other food joints in Bellagio, it's almost affordable.
