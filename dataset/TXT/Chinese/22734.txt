6oyUUtgIqBEnMnB9B7-O7A Yelp rarely steers me wrong, but this time it happened. I ordered take-out and was so disappointed. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. The crab puffs were some of the worst I have had, weak and soggy with no crab. The mu shu chicken lacked flavor and I honestly think they used tortillas instead of crepes (I couldn't taste any sesame oil). 

The pricing was a bit high and the place was a dump. I'll stick to China Chili in the future.
