BHX0ghpo_r4lVxGRPEBIQw Always find myself coming here for the same thing: Steamed Dumpling 5.99 for 15 pcs. and Beef Noodle Soup (5.99), and their 7.99 Hotpot Vermicelli special. Good value for the food. Also tried their Beef roll and Green onion pancake before which was actually quite good and very reasonably priced. Have yet to try other dishes but pretty happy with their food and service overall.
