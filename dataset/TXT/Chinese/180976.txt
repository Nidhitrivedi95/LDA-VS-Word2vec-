x9SL1nCaUYM4JP91UrVkxQ Tips for Maple Yip:

- Order the winter melon soup in advance.  Otherwise, you'll be sad to see every other table get them, and not yours.  You'll recognize it by the GIGANTIC winter melon they bring out to each and every table with a ladle

- Lobster at $11.95 may seem cheap.  But when you factor in that the smallest one they had was 5.5 lbs x $11.95, you better REALLY want to eat a lot of lobster

- Speak Chinese, or bring friends who do.  Otherwise, confusing ensues, and you may have accidentally, in the confusion, lose your reservation or winter melon soup

- While it's not the BEST Chinese food ever, it's REALLY DARN GOOD if you're visiting from NY and miss good Chinese food direly

- Yay for little bowl of green bean dessert at the end. Yum.
