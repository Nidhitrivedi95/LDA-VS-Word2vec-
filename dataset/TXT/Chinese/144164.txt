Rth816SKdZHKMpU4vYpfeA Ordered via Just Eat. Even though it's cheap, it's not worth your money. Most Chinese food places load up on the main item, this place gives you a TINY SLIVER of what you'd normally get. The food is BLAND - my ma po tofu did not have any sauce whatsoever. I asked for spicy, they load it with black pepper. Disgusting. The fried rice is the same - bland and no wok fried flavor whatsoever. Their hot and sour soup tastes like cough medicine. Their Manchurian chicken is decent, but you won't be full cause you'll get only 4-5 tiny pieces worth. Sorry Song, we're not ordering again.
