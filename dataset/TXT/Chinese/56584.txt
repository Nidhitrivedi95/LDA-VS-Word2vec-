czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA Come here for their lunch specials! & they deliver  love it! I got the Hot Garlic Chicken lunch special with crab Ragoons & a Thai Tea! Nomnomnom I always come for takeout & I love how their Ragoons aren't greasy & they don't forget to give me sweet & sour sauce! The Thai tea is extremely good not too thick not too watery & just enough sweetness!
