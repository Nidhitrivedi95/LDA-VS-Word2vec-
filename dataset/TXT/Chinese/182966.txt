Food: we ordered the seafood fried rice, two double lobsters (black bean & ginger), and the water cress. Food was alright, but definitely not worth the price. I used to go here years ago. The restaurant has changed a lot. Lobster does not taste fresh, tasted like frozen lobster. Watercress and fried rice was alright. 

Service: decent service for a Chinese restaurant LOL

Parking: lotta parking lots around the area.
