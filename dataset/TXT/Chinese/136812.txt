Aha..I can challenge you on that! One of my friends has actually literally NEVER been to PF Changs so after hearing that blasphemy I carted her away to this location  for her to try the wonders of massacred Chinese food. 

PF Changs is not Chinese food. It's American food. I don't even think they are trying to elude that their food comes from the Fujian or Yunnan provinces. It's just food that tastes good. And for that, I like this place. It's dependable with it's dark woods, lightings, concrete-looking horses, decent service and reasonable prices. 

I get their Ma Po Tofu but instead of steamed broccoli that usually comes with the dish, I substitute with eggplant (yes, the same eggplant in their spicy eggplant). It's like I get 2 dishes but don't have to be a glutton and can practice portion control! Voila! Also, they don't charge me extra for this ($8.95). Their side dish options come in 2 sizes. The small sized options (about $3) easily satisfy 2 people. I enjoy the Crispy Green Beans, Spicy Asparagus and Shanghai Cucumbers. So when me and the hubs pander over here, we get the Ma Po Tofu (note eggplant sub) and 2 small sides. Cost of meal? About $15 bucks. Ummmm...for a sit-down place that's relatively nice, that's a steal! And our tummies are always happy after!

There are more "interesting" places around and yes, it's not independently owned and really a blasphemy for true Asian cuisine. But it's my guilty pleasure...good food, nice surroundings, sensitive to people preferring smaller portion sizes and impeccable service. '

And I'll even admit that after getting denied entry due to the size of our group at our favorite Austin, TX restaurant, PF Changs was the site where my bachelorette mayhem began. I'm not going to be pretentious today and admit that I like this place. Lots!
