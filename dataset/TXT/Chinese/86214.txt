HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Lunch. The food was good--I had the wonton soup, duck bao, and potstickers.

From the posted pictures it looks like the same vegetables go into several dishes--broccoli florets, julienne carrots, sliced mushrooms, green onion and sprouts. It's understandable, but I was a little surprised to see the julienne carrots in my soup (at least the florets were whole). Good flavor, nice plump wontons. Came with a bowl of fried wonton wrapper slices.

The duck skin in the bao was crisp, but the meat was a little tough, and the dough was a little dense. I still enjoyed them. The potstickers were pan-fried, not deep-fried, which I always appreciate, were flavorful, and had a good sauce.

The only negative was the service, which was really slow (they did apologize).

Commenting on another yelper's post:  I'm sensitive to cigarette smoke, and I didn't notice any while I was dining.
