And if you've read some of my other Chinese food reviews before, you'll know I'm not a big fan of this type of food. But they do serve up a pretty good menu with all of your Chinese food favorites.

I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the names of Chinese dishes, & heck, I sometimes have no idea what the difference between Chinese & Japanese is. But if you're unlike me, which most people are, then you'll love the food this place serves up. You can never go wrong with rice, broccoli, & chicken, covered in some sort of sauce, so that's my usual choice. Everything I've tried here is pretty good, considering by disdain for Chinese in general, so you can't really go wrong in the food department.

It's a stand alone restaurant, which is unheard of for a non chain in Gastonia. Usually, stand alones are left to only the large franchises in this town. The place can get pretty crowded at your usual dinner hours, but nothing crazy.

Golden Palace hits all the key areas for a decent restaurant, being that it serves up tasty food for a good price, all while in a good atmosphere. There really isn't anything special about the place, but this is coming from a Chinese food hater.
