2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg @Robert K. and I needed some quick Chinese before the Yelp Elite event at Augusta House (nbd) and stumbled upon this spot.

Seated as soon as we came in at a giant table and got our noodle soup with vegatables and shrimp wontons very quickly. It was acceptable. What I liked was how domestic beer was only $3! I splurged and got an import for $4.

Soup could have had more veg (I think it was only lettuce and three slices of carrots)- other than that, t'was nice.
