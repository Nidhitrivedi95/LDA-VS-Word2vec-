IAqyeVG1ZMrv7hiV3FAB6Q I haven't lived in AZ long, so I haven't been to many of the chinese buffets here yet. But so far this one is my favorite. The food was good with a good variety. My only complaint is that they only had a few crab legs out at a time, it seems they didn't keep up with that one dish enough. Other than that it was very tasty, my wife especially loved the sushi here.
