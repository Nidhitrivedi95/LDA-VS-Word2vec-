u46kIZVn9W6L2eWkuDjW9Q I ordered the Manchurian chicken extra spicy and it barely had any spice to it, it also tasted so salty that I was not enjoying the food.

I also ordered the chicken pakoras and tried to ask for it to be extra spicy as well, and they could not accommodate that. I was a little confused by that. The flavour was good however, it had a bit of a tandoori taste to it which was nice, but in its entirety, was just okay.

I would not come back here.
