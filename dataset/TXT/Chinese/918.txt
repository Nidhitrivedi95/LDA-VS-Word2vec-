-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ While we stayed at the red rock we ate here it was super good I loved it!!! To start we had the salt and pepper chicken wings and egg rolls yum delicious! Then for an entree I had the five spice beef noodle soup let's just say amazing brisket super soft and broth super tasty!! My bf had the spicy shrimp noodle bowl he loved it! and he wants to get it again and mother in law had the fried rice bowl she loved it as well!!! We will definitely will return no doubt about that!!
