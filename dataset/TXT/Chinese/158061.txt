tWtuHpIFtQHMQq8q8DG3dA this is a perfect place to eat lunch fast, even if there is a line out the door.  the staff  deals with huge crowds everyday without missing a beat and the food is comforting and delicious!  the lime-aid that they serve compliments everything i have ever eaten there and i am always happy to see tofu on the menu.  i am such a fan of the rica-rica sauce, whats in there??  only wish i could get my hands on this for dinner!!
