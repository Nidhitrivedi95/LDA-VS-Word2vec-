DIxgItsSI9QwX9H8lVptYg Went there last night, we ordered the General Chicken, sesame chicken, organge chicken, and chicken chow mien. All was excellent!!!!  Crab rangoons were also delicious.  Only thing we didn't care for were the egg rolls, they weren't horrible by any means.  We will be back for sure. Staff was great, fast and courteous.  Glasses never were empty.
