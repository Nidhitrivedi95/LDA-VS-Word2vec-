ITjc4ng0BYGuNKx-LodG4A I usually love Panda Express but I won't be coming back to this one! The two ladies working were really rude to both me and my husband and were slamming our food and drinks down on the counter. One lady barely  put any chicken on my plate. I asked if she could put a little more. She said "I can for $1.50!". To top it off they barely spoke English. Ive never had an experience like this at a panda express. I won't be back here that's for sure!
