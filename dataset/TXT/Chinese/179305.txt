The layout of this place is awesome. When the elevators door open and you walk into the main room its POPPIN'.  We ventured into the different rooms and had a blast in the hip-hop room awhile. That room was small but the music was so fun and oldschool and brought me back many memories! 

As the night progressed we met up with our friends at a table upstairs looking at the DJ. We could see the entire club dance floor and had a perfect view of Calvin Harris. Sitting at a table is nice in here because it gets super packed and I was able to rest my feet and enjoy the cocktails/show. There was confetti and smoke blast galore! I tried to dance on the main floor once but it was too much for me...but I expected that on labor day weekend. Another big plus for me was the ventilation of this place, I never felt too hot! 

If you're in area I think it's worth trying..
