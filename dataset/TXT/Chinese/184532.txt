xVgBhNzlnSmNY5MwqgBrCQ My husband and I tried this place for the first time two nights ago. He had the bourbon chicken and I had the curry with chicken both definitely could've used more sauce. It was surprisingly tasty, the place was very clean and we didn't have to wait long. Will visit again soon
