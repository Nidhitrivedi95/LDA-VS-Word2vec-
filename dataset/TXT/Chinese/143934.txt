rsQAS-k7GldsJm7UAtVyYA I come here fairly often if i can't make it to my regular pho place. But when I'm introducing someone to regular pho for the first time i usually bring them to this place. The service is always quick and the staff are fluent in English Vietnamese and Cantonese. I remember my mom used drop me off here when i was a kid and i would order and eat within the time it took my mom to pick up some groceries at the place beside. I personally prefer eating their vermicelli dishes over the pho but regardless of what you order; 90% of the time you will not be disappointed.
