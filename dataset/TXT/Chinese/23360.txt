6TLIuls4SiG9VFf2U42p1A I prefer the Pho here to all the other pho places I've tried in the area as well as in China town. The Pho was served piping hot, which is only notable because I've been served too many luke warm Pho's at other places in the area. It's very clean, the noodles were well cooked, and there was a decent amount of beef.

I agree that the broth is somewhat mild, though I find it preferable to places that have too much cinnamon flavor, or are too oily. The portions aren't as enormous as a lot of other pho places, so get the large.
