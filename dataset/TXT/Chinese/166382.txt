VbY4yD6UmA9jKKxHscrxvg So happy I found this place! From the moment I walked in the door, I was greeted with a warm Asian welcome and a friendly smile, but that was just the start of good things to come. I ordered the Buffett all you can eat, but this buffet is not your average Buffett, it's Buffett to order off the menu and I took full advantage of that. I ordered a number of items starting with soft shell crab spider Maki, Avacado roll, sweet potato Maki, shrimp tempura maki,  American Dream Roll and Miso soup.  

Not only did I leave full, I left very satisfied, not just with the food but with the entire experience. Hats off to the entire staff for being so friendly & nice and making sure my food came out fast and fresh. 

Note to the owner: You've got a beautiful restaurant and I wish you much success! 
Keep up the great job!
