4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A This is my go-to hotpot restaurant.  

Unlike other newer hotpot restaurants in Markham/RH, this restaurant still has free soup bases available, with unlimited refills of lemon tea and plum juice.  

Prices are very reasonable, at $20.99 for adults on a weeknight for the AYCE.  It's recommended you get the seafood price as it's only $2 additional charge and you get a plate of oyster, shrimps, salmon, enoki mushroom, mussels and scallop (the seafood is not unlimited).  There's also cooked food and dessert included in the price.

They did miss a few items, but overall most arrived with not too long of a wait.  

Of all the places I've tried, I will continue to return to this one.
