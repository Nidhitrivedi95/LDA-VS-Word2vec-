m9x3lP68vCe9EOB7EcA1lg I came here because I was in the mood for some Chinese. Oddly enough I thought this was going to be like an Asian noodle type place, but when I walked in and saw the menu realized it was just another Chinese takeout establishment. To my surprise the food was good. I ordered chicken and broccoli and an order of fried chicken wings. The chicken wings were fresh and hand battered, I loved them. The broccoli was especially yummy too. If I'm ever in the area I would definitely come back again. Too bad I live about 15 minutes away and that's just too far of a drive for me. Check them out.
