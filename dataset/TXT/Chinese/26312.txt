7Ry-hEfZwaDXe8u-n6v15A This place is officially my favourite Siu long bao destination. I've tried so many other places and none can compare to Shanghai  Dimsum. They updated their menu and the atmosphere is much better than before. After a movie on date night I would definitely stop by! 

Order all silk skin siu long baos. Pork and crab, just pork... get it all! 

And remember if youre looking for your usual dimsum place you wont get it .. this is a different kind of style of dimsim-no hai gao or siu mai here. 

That blogto article on the best siu long bao places in toronto/gta is complete BS and written by an experienced writer who didnt do thorough research.
