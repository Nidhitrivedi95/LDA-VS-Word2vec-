eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g We ordered the Lobster & BC crab set dinner. The lobster & crab are oil deep fried then poured on with tiny fishes & veg for decoration. Same cooking method for both dishes & who created the menu? They were over cooked in the deep fryer, very dry without taste. It completed destroyed two excellent shell fishes. The fish also deep fried & pretty dry as well.
The service is not up to standard for such high end seafood restaurant. It took a while to get a glass of water & a bow of rice. They also using appetizer plate instead dinner plate & servers were slow to change the plates.First visit will be my last & not recommended.  One star is for plating only
