n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q We have visited AJK several times now and are very impressed.  Fresh produce / food, good menu selection, reasonable pricing, nice atmosphere, friendly staff.  My wife has tried several items and has really enjoyed them all, I really like the General Tso pork (yes pork, I had only seen chicken before).

Be sure to look up when dining for your dinner under the stars!

Keep up the good work down there at AJK!
