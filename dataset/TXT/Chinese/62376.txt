DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA This place is horrible. We should've checked the reviews before coming. We ordered wonton noodle soup in which the wonton came out completely raw. Asked for a new soup without wontons and it was the same bowl of soup. They just took the raw wontons out. Pan fried noodle with beef again completely raw.  I will never dine here again. Overpriced and the part that wasn't raw taste awful.  

Service is also horrible. Looked my server in the eye to get his attention and he ignored us. 

Avoid this place!!!
