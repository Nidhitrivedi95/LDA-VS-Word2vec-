N_ML37GOTOLtGKWqRnbJRA This place is amazing. It's clean, the staff is friendly, the food came out incredibly quick. We got the teriyaki chicken, sesame chicken, Mongolian beef and hot/sour soup. All had its own taste and it was flat out amazing. For those three dishes, 4 bowls of soup and 3 drinks it was $30. I will be going back.
