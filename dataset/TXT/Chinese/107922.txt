lEtpTFWetCf6xnzeImLiHg Oh Mr. Chao...you really let me down.

I decided to order from here on a very important day. I was sick.

When i'm sick I want spicy, hot, asian food. It's what i crave, it's what i need.

Knowing that Panda Express just wasn't going to cut it for this craving, i went to my fellow yelpers for advice. I knew i wanted realllllly good Chinese good, i didn't care how much it cost. When i'm sick, i want what i want, and nothing else matters. However, i needed a place that delivered or i could go and pick up ASAP and Mr. Chao's was it!

I ordered:
*Extra Spicy BBQ Pork Fried Rice
*Beef & Broccoli (boyfriend)
*Steamed Rice (b/f)
* General Tso's Chicken-extra spicy

The rice was overcooked. done, done, and done again. The rice kernels were almost stale tasting, just looking at the pork made me sick, and I'm pretty sure i said extra spicy...and there was none. Very bland

Beef & Broccoli was surprisingly good--but it wasn't mine, so boo hoo, moving on

Steamed rice--average...but how could you screw this up?

General's Chk--Much like the rice actually. WAY overcooked. The chicken was extremely dry, and the breading had been BURNED. Also, where the heck was the extra spice i asked for? And lastly, did i order chicken strips? boneless wings? because i got chicken tenders, not chunks. 

**I would also like to mention, there was NO language barrier that would cause the mess-up of my order. Unless you consider high school kids to have a different language than us adults--which is entirely possible**

$40 and few dollar tip later, most of it ended in the trashcan, and i ate toast instead.

I won't be back
