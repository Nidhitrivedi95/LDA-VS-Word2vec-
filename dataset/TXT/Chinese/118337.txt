nl_gkvVXtsIlhGE0sP0qFw It's Friday evening  and no one is here. Not exaggerating. I was wondering why there were dozens of tables and at least 6-7 buffet tables and no one here.  Flavorless food.  As I sit here the waitresses are yelling back and forth in Asian language and laughing, oblivious to how rude and loud they are.  The staff is more busy trying to clean up and leave, than be certain their guests are satisfied.  We just returned from m living I  Japan for 2 years.  The Sushi here :questionable.  I was scared to try it.  Baked salmon, again questionable.  I tried a nibble and spit it out.  Vegetable delight?  More like they thought the found  way to use vegetables that otherwise would have gone in the trash.  Anyway, ever been to a nail salon where the employees just won't stop talking loudly during your nail service and pay no mind that you are in there spending money? Yep.  That's what it feels like now.  My family and I need to yell to each other to talk because the girl employees are so loud.  Sigh.... Anyway, I don't think I'll return.
