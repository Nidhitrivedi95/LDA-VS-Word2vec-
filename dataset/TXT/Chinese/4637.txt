I came with 7 friends and we got the 25lb lobster mountain. It was truly a sight...it was HUGE. I guess for $64 a person, it was quite an experience. The taste was pretty good but quickly got tired of it after having 3-4 of it. It's quite oily and you will feel it afterwards. However, their other dishes are also quite good. Soup was hot and flavorful, the veggies were also great. The fried rice portion was a bit skimpy but it also tasted very flavorful. I also enjoyed the dessert which was a cashew Chinese porridge.
