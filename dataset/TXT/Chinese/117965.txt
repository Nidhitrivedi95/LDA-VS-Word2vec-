NJyTPOukXuLK8vabKw7nvA The best sichuan restaurant in Toronto easily and at very good prices.  I come here all the time: the staff are friendly and there's quite a bit of variety in the menu.  I should mention that even for people who love, no, need spicy food regularly, the Chunking dry-fried chicken is pretty, pretty spicy.  The fish and flower tofu in chile oil is another personal favourite and their dandan noodles and yi bing oiled noodles are the best in the city.
