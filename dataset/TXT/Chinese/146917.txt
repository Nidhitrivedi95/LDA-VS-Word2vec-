S9cc8kQLJYizT6Ql4L9vgQ Gurkha Brigade is not the most obvious eatery on Leith Walk, but is certainly not the worst.  It's predominantly a restaurant with plenty of clean and spaciously laid out table with a clean and friendly environment.  I went for their takeaway menu which, although quite expensive in comparison to other place in the area, was varied with plenty of different sauces, emats and vegetarian options.  I ordered the pork sungur which had incredibly tender chunks of meat in a spicy tomato and garlic sauce.  This, along with plain boiled rice and a coke came to about £10 which seemed steep at the time, but the food's quality made up for it without a doubt.  
My friend ordered two starters of different pakoras which looked and - apparantly - tasted great.  We both agreed that it was worth a shot again, maybe next time after we get our student grants in though!
