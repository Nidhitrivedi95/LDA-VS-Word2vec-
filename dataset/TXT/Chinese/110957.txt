LZvA9pglGyUWQ0sZJiOzXg Let me honest here, I placed an order for delivery and it took quite awhile for the food to arrive. I'm going to assume they were busy. When the food did show up, it was cold (ok whatever.. I'll warm it up). My husband and I ordered the Cantonese Noodles, general Tao, spring roll, peanut butter dumplings and a few other small side dishes. I personally think I botched my own experience with Wok du Chef by ordering the Cantonese noodles. The squid was extremely chewy, the crabstick was non-exsistant and the shrimps seemed rare. I had a hard time getting my plate down to be honest with you but I will blame myself for that one. 
The peanut butter dumplings were great as was the general tao. 
I would definitely give this place another try!
