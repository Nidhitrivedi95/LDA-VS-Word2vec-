X3pGY4ZUXtWnr9NBW_m3PQ One of my favorite Chinese restaurants! Been going here since they opened used to go at least once or twice a week when I lived close. Sushi is amazing and made on the spot. Best crabmeat Rangoon's I've ever had. Egg rolls are always amazing and I have never been disappointed with my food choice!
