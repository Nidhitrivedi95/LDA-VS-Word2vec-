FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ Went here today for dim sum.  Dim sum here is a bit different... no push cart service, just order your dishes off a menu.
The food is ok... what stands out is the presentation of their food.  Food quality itself is average... for dim sum.

Service was quite slow and it only got worse when there was a power outage.
No one came by to see if we needed anything. 
The restaurant staff seemed a bit disarray and kept to themselves.  It was a weird experience.

When we asked for containers for take out... that came quickly... however to pay the bill was a different story.  They said that they can manually calculate it... we were fine with that and we were able to pay cash.

30mins latr we ended up going to the front and asked for the bill again  URG... they forgot about us.  We could have just walked out and no one would have noticed.  Sometimes being honest does not pay.
