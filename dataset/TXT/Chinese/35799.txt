ag8gM2YKZkjndCvl2ti7kQ Have been looking for another good dumpling place outside of chinatown and I think I've found it. Ordered the pan fried dumplings, boiled dumplings, and shanghai stir fried noodles. They were all very good. Just the right size for the meat and dumpling skin.

Would definitely be back. Prices are also average (i.e. not high).
