FanQrSh9QTDytonKHt9C6Q This is my second time here. We came back to try the All-You-Can-Eat buffet. It's available from 12 to 3. They gave us a paper menu were you mark what you wanted. We had no problem with any of the plates. They were all delicious! They brought them very fast and the waitress was very attentive. 

Still can't figure it out why both times we have come there were only one extra couple eating. Is quite great for its price. $17 each person of the table. 

Highly recommended!
