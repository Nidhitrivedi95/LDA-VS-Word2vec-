Chinese food. Decor is classy, you can see the fountains if you sit by the window. Ate here for Chinese New Year. Food was good, the dishes we had pork belly and string beans and satay oxtail were good, fried rice was tasty. Wait staff was attentive.  Overall good, but not great. I was expecting something beyond what I could get anywhere else for the high price but in the end not worth the cost. For the prices, I expect great.
