8f9Tl2gq78wqjtrToOTo7A The newest Pheonix Restaurant <U+91D1><U+9CF3> just opened in Bridlewood Mall.

The menu is identical as the other 3 locations so if you are frequent customer like myself, you will feel right at home.

Breakfast, Lunch, Afternoon Tea and Dinner Special.

The interior is spacious and nicely decorated.

The patrons now is more a mix of ethnicity as there are definitely more non Asians mall shoppers giving Phoenix a try.

You can access the restaurant through the inside of the mall or direct access at the back right next to Metro.
