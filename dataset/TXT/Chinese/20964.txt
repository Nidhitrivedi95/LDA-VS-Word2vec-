68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw I visited Flock and Fowl with my entire Vegas party of 6 people on my most recent trip. First off, the service was excellent and we were not the only party there. Jenny was amazing and couldn't have been nicer. On to the food - we tried a few things off he menu and everything was fantastic. Flock and Fowl is known for their special Chicken hainan dish and thus the restaurant is aptly named. If you come here you must order it! Or at least a try it if someone else orders it. It's amazing. We also had some Szechuan wings and those were fantastic as well. Make sure to check their hours before you come in as they are only open for lunch. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Sin City.
