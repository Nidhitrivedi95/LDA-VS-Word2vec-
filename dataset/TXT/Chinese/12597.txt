2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg My cousin travels a lot for work and this is one of his spots for a Chinese food fix whenever he returns to Toronto. He invited me here after I helped him set up his new TV.

It was busy when we arrived around 8:00pm but we found a table near the back and were presented with menus right away. Wow, big menu with hundreds of items, plus a separate menu with dinner combos! I left the ordering up to my cousin since he was familiar with some of the good stuff.

We shared a platter of roasted pork, soya chicken and BBQ duck over rice, spaghetti with black pepper beef, and an order of snow peas leaves with garlic. They started us off with complimentary bowls of their house soup, a simple pork broth. Surprisingly, there was a good chuck of meat in each bowl. They do this for all diners? Cool!

The rest of the food arrived pretty quickly and the portions were very generous. The meat platter, while not the best I've had, was tasty and the pork skin was nice and crispy. Ordering Chinese style spaghetti was new to me and it was alright. My cousin said it's usually better. The veggies were cooked nicely, with just the right amount of garlic. We had enough noodles and veggies for leftovers.

Overall, it was okay. Would I come back? Maybe, but I would be tempted to explore some of the many other other choices nearby. After all, this is right in the middle of Chinatown!
