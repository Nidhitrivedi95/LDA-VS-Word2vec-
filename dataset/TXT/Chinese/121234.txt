O7_rXHN_-cFp0TgiMaNulw The food and the atmosphere are excellent. This is actually the third restaurant that we follow the owner Tommy, to.  It also has very good sushi, our favorite is the crusty crab roll.  

My favorite is the General's, but each of my kids have their own. The soup bowls are very big and filling, we usually have leftovers. The entryway is tight and the place isn't huge, which is one of the things I look like about it.  It has a couple of tv's for the littles, but not really geared towards small children, better for kids that appreciate good food.
