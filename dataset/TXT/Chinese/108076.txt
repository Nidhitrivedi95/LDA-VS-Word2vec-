LGZPjmhEg2QYeGZ2PKnpQw Yesterday dim sum today geoduck.   Yesterday dim sum for har gaw was amazing. Chicken feet and siu maai was really good. Worth the price and service was good. Then we saw the geoduck 3-4 person meal and it was good they did geoduck right.  We had a geoduck over a bed of beansprout and it was perfectly cook.  Then we have a lobster with noodles and it was nice and tasty even the noodle had lobster taste.  There was a veggie which was good and finally the soup rice with geoduck ends.  I have to say if i could give 10 stars for the geoduck with soup rice i would give it bc the soup was perfect and the meat was soft n not chew. In the end this place for dimsum and geoduck is great
