bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg Wonderul! What a great contemporary take on Asian dishes.

I recommend:
1) Starter: Karage style chicken wings
They're perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. They're spicy and sweet, and the dipping sauce is a great complement.
2) Entree: Dandan
It's not the soupy kind of ramen, rather resembling a stir fry of sorts. But the flavors are excellent. Very pickle-y.
3) Dessert: I don't remember what it was called! But it's a butternut squash purée(mousse?) with a ginger snap crumble and salted caramel. It was just so decadent and delectable. Absolutely perfect.

I'd definitely go again.
