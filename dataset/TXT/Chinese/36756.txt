AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw The 5-stars are for the food, the willingness to modify/cook a dish the way you may be used to it or would like to try it, and the staff!

We stopped in early Saturday afternoon based on the reviews.  We almost left simply because the appearance and darkness of this neighborhood bar just did not mesh with a place that could have such great food.  We didn't leave because, well, we are tavern folks.  We are more at home in a place where you know, even as strangers, they will make you feel at home.

We have never been able to find a good place in Snobsdale - relax, we live here - for good Chinese food until now.  Outstanding.  Before we ordered we asked questions such as can we get white chicken in this, could we sample this before ordering - kind of what some places might call difficult customers.  But here it was not only YES, but let us bring you out a bite to try if there is some ready, including sauces.

The food was VERY good and there was plenty of it!  You can easily share a dish or dishes as a couple.

It's definitely the place to come for Asian food or just drinks.  Well done Chop & Wok.  We will be back and we will tell others.
