vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA This is my favorite authentic Chinese restaurant.  It's located in the Gold Coast Casino and every time I've eaten here, I'm the only customer ordering in English.  This is authentic!  You can order off the menu or eat Dim Sum off the various food carts being rolled around the restaurant.  Personally, I think it's better to skip the menu and order whatever looks good on the carts.  We ordered all kinds of items off the carts with beer and our bill was only $50.  Everything was delicious, except the fried chicken feet, which even our waitress said she did not eat.  You don't want the chicken feet, but everything else we had off the carts was delicious.  Be prepared to be a little overwhelmed when you first sit down by the various food cart servers pitching you with all kinds of different food choices.  Just choose whatever looks good and pass on anything that doesn't, and stop ordering when your table looks like it has enough food on it.  Authentic Chinese restaurant ambiance-5 stars, Food-5 stars, Service-5 stars, Value-5 stars.
