079CV1EE5WLdQqVEVYFeHQ When you think of Phoenix and lunch what's the first thing you think about? If you answered "Who could eat in this heat?" then you're exactly right? After you've gotten past that you then think what? Exactly, Chinese food. Nothing says Arizona like Chinese food. And surprisingly nothing says it better than The Prime Chinese Restaurant. At the recommendation of my friend Wendy I took my wife and two of our children to The Prime. We walked in at 2pm and were seated immediately. I should add that there was only one other couple in the restaurant at the time and it was 2pm and it is 110 outside and it is Phoenix. But I digress. The service was very polite. We ordered two of the lunch specials. I had the House special. They brought a soup to start, because once again nothing says a Phoenix summer like hot soup. It was tasty and I finished off the tiny bowl. Then came my special. The House special was not tasty. I got one bite in and decided to have something else entirely. At this point you'd think "Oh no this review is going south quick with no hope for the future." But then they brought me a safe meal, sweet and sour chicken. It was in my opinion the freshest sweet and sour chicken I've ever had. Seriously I was sitting on a three star review just now and then bumped it to 4 for that last sentence alone. Add to the freshness some pretty tasty, not your run of the mill fried rice and a very kind wait staff. Let me add a word about the wait staff. We brought a 2 yr old and a 4 yr old and they were so nice to them. We asked for a sprite for the kids and they brought two cups with lids to split. When our meals came out they brought extra plates. These people were awesome. What more can I say, how bout... Ka Pow! Pretty decent lunch.
