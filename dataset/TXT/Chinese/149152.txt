sOaeX1zQWuqbPcclvjtdeA My family went to PF Chang's and really found the food of poor quality.  Excellent service but the service could not overcome cold dumplings, unseasoned fried rice, huge bowls (volume wise) of wanton soup with only 2 wantons, and unevenly cooked orange chicken.  The price was relatively expensive but the quality of food was poor.
