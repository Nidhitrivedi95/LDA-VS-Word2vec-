Kw06PxDkF8gNMVWntmBKTw Fast service, like less than 5 minutes to get food after you order fast. Their wontons are absolutely huge! My favourite wonton noodles in the city, chewy but not raw. I would recommend this to everyone, the service is always nice but don't expect too much, it's basically a fast food place!
