Jean dway (mochi-like, red bean filled) rolled in sesame seeds and fried in oil - not what they used to be.  These did not have the desired crispy outer shell and were soft and oily.  Disappointing.

The mochi-like rolled in coconut (filled with peanut or red bean) were good, peanut version better.

The sponge cake wedges - the inner frosting had a salty and unappealing taste.

Disappointing.
