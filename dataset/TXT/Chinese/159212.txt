u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ We went here for their dim sum this weekend and it was great!  We have been to a lot of dim sum places around town and this by far takes the cake!  They have a good selection and the place is decorated beautifully! They also have a great variety of food and the carts are always coming!

This is my permanent go-to dim sum place in Las Vegas~~
