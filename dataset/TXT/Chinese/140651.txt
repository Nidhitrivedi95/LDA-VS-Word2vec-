R8Mw0iFenJ3nwXuZb7Ql4A Once in a while whenever in Times Square when looking for Chinese dessert, we will come to this place.

We order durian on smooth bean curd - very strong smell of durian.  Walnut paste is not smooth as expected and it can be more sweet.  The taro in the Taro purple rice dessert is still hard and not blended well with the purple rice paste.  The best is the stewed egg white with milk in Papaya.  The papaya chosen is the best brand.  It is fresh and sweet together with the smooth milky egg white is one of a kind - highly recommended
