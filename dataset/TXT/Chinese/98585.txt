js0ZzxVEDAkTdczCMT1emw I sat at the couches and it feels so dirty in that area. There was a spider creeping the table. The menu had an ice cream milk tea with an option of about 6 different ice cream flavours to choose from, but when I was ordering it, I asked from the coffee flavour, waitress says they don't have it, I ask for green tea?, nope. Okay so what do they have? just vanilla. 
The only decent thing about this place is you can stay there and play games or chat for as long as you want (closing time is about 2am).
