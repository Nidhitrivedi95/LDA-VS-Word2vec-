TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ Earl was craving for homemade noodles so I yelped and found positive reviews for Liang's.  We dropped by on a Friday evening for dinner and there were only two other parties there...which made us hesitant on whether this will be a miss vs a hit.

We sat down at a table where I am facing the big screen that was showing Tawainese Karoke music videos while Earl sat facing the tv screen that was showing the basketball game.  Ambience: CHECK.

The staff handed us three types of menu, the food menu with some pictures without prices, the menu list with the price, and another beverage menu with the different smoothies, etc.  Earl and I chose the thin noodles with fried onions, topped with a fried egg, and also the beef tendon soup with the fat noodles.  The first was delicious.  It was simple, yet, so satisfying.  We got the essence of the homemade noodles.  The second was meh.  I had better.

We also got the green onion pancakes.  These were nicely fried, though, we couldn't eat too many for this can easily fill us up.

We enjoyed our food and the ambience, so we will be returning patrons.
