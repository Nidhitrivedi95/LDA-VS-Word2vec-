LbeJgPgKKHw5qH0f02NHEQ Chinatown Inn is the BEST CHINESE RESTURANT I have found in North America! HUGE FAN! and have been supporting Chinatown for over 25+ years. I can't say enough about this restaurant. I have had lunch in , dinner in and have had take out numerous times over the years. Chinatown has NEVER disappointed me once. I love the Shrimp Eggs Rolls, Chicken & Broccoli in the white sauce with steamed rice. I live for the Won Ton Soup !! it is so unique that they shred the pork on top of the soup and not inside the wrapper, I love that. I always get a medium bowl and a medium steamed rice on the side. After I eat the won ton, I put the rice in the soup and enjoy two soups from one bowl. Won Ton, and Chicken and Rice. The Jumbo Egg Roll is a meal in itself. Everything on the menu is good. 
True the downside to Chinatown if you do not live in town is driving in, street parking is not a problem for pick up, and there are many parking garages near by. A visit to Chinatown is SO worth it. Lucy is a fantastic server and I look forward to talking with her every time I visit. I Highly Recommend and will continue to support Chinatown Inn.  

Just as small side note: The actress that is the voice of Mulan in the Disney movie, is Ming-Na Wen. Her step-father and mother and younger brother have owned and operated Chinatown for years and will continue too. You can find her photo on the wall near the register.
