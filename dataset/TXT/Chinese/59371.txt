dj2KhjtZBC3Y1IrAsDXYng Looking back on my reviews, I'm usually strictest in my critique when it comes to pricier restaurants. I think it's only fair to readers that restaurants be held to the promises their positioning makes. With this in mind, Le Gourmand is one choice that does not disappoint. I enjoyed salmon tartar that was balanced better in its flavors than any I've had in the past. The recommended white whine pairing (the exact name escapes me) made a pleasant meal divine.
The cherry on top of the sundae was the view of the fireworks, to which we were privy having sat on the terrace. It almost felt selfish enjoying my girlfriend's birthday as much as she did.
