There wasn't too long of a wait even with our reservations.  I didn't like that they sat 6 guest at a long table where we faced the restaurant instead of each other.  

The sushi was ok, I've had better.  I thought the Brazilian & Peruvian selection was very good.

Service was ehhh....

It's pretty pricey so be prepared for a big bill.
