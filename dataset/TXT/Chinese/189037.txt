yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Late review, but better late than never!  Visited Vegas for my first time in the beginning of August!  We've been eating out everyday for every meal, mostly fried oily dishes and I wanted something homely.  Asked a friend where there's some good pho out in Vegas and she recommended here!

Although it was a hot 110 degree day, I wanted some pho!  Glad I came here cuz the chicken pho was good!  Didn't care much for the chicken, but the soup and noodles hit the spot!
