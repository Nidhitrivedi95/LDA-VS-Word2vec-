yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Okay I can't help being a bit immature here.  But try saying the name 5x really fast and see if you can suppress a giggle.

The good:
- Huge menu variety, they've pretty much got everything.
- Pho tai.  Delicious tender meat and rich savory soup broth.
- Spring rolls.  Baby you da you da best, best I ever had...
- Cool decor.  Aquarium at a pho joint what??

The bad:
- A bit off the strip.
- Waiter confused our orders.
- A bit pricier than I'm used to.
