fACUiSmM2sq1VTYVFUagRg I have been to this little spot many times and have had consistently good Bubble Tea and service each time - which is great because you can expect a certain standard!

I recommend the Taro Chiller and their house milk tea "Bubble Kitea" (it is a little sweeter than most but does have a distinct original taste). 

I've ordered their beef and vegetable patties as well as their dim sum. The food is not top notch but they specialize in Bubble Tea so I am not disappointed.

Overall, I would go again and again. It is a much better environment than the other crowded, overrated bubble tea spots in Mississauga and it is worth the price point. There is a much more humble and welcoming vibe at Bubble Kitea.
