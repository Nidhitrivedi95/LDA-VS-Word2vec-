dCX6CvWGn8oiPSD_yxrm0Q Delivery was fast!  Placed an order at work for the office so a few dishes were ordered.  Beef Chow Mein (was ok but a little dry), Boneless Spare Ribs (flavorful but a bit chewy), Fried Rice (was great), Steamed Rice (was great), Won Ton Soup (was good), Hot & Sour Soup (was ok) & Spring Rolls (were good).  

Was a bit disappointed that with this delivery being made to an office, they didn't bother to give us any forks, chopsticks or napkins.  For the whole order, we were given 3 soy sauce packets.  All in all...it was okay and the prices were decent.
