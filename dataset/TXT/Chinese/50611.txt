CGgUHkAKU0QBsdGvXxfMuw WOW!!! What a find!!!! This place is awesome... We were at bookmans and craving chinese food. There are like 15 places and not sure what took us to this little tiny 4 table place on the dark corner of a shopping center but we have been back there about 6 times. The hot and sour soup is the best Ive ever had hands down. The house lomein is loaded with chicken, shrimp and pork. We always try something different everytime to see what is best. The only thing I didnt like were the steamed dumplings. Not the dumpling itself, they seemed very fresh and nicely done but the dipping sauce was alittle bland and no duck sauce here. VERY friendly people for sure and very reasonable. Not alot of eat ins but we are 15 miles away so we are staying. Countless pick-ups and deliveries while we were there. As bad as some of the places weve been to lately this one is a gem! Worth the ride in my opinion! Plenty to take with you too!
