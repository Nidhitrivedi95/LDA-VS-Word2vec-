lEtpTFWetCf6xnzeImLiHg This is one of our go-to restaurants when we want a special night out. The food is delicious and always good. We order the sizzling rice soup as an appetizer and have always been happy with the entrees. The boyfriend's favorite dish is the honey walnut shrimp and my favorite dish is their spicy basil chicken and abalone (mushroom).

The ambience of the place is very nice and we've always had great service. My only complaint is that the last two times we drove to Ahwatukee specifically to eat at this place, they were closed for special events. We've been a bit gun shy about driving back the last few months. :(
