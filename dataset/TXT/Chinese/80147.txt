gOhiq0tL76I9bXMDWWsL5Q Really good food. This restaurant is in a little strip mall and the restaurant is a little outdated but the food was excellent. The server was pleasant and the food came quick. They have more of a take out business it seems but there were a few tables occupied. The smell of the food was nice when we walked in and the take out customers were coming in often which is a good sign.  It was a little warm inside but I guess it wasn't air conditioning season yet. The guy there said he would turn in on for us, but we didn't ask. Over all. Great food! Good price too. General Tsao chicken was awesome. Couldn't get enough of it! Eat in or take out, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
