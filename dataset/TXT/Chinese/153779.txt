tbMAjldMYhvDUS2gG5Fdxw This is one of my favorite places for lunch! They give you egg drop soup, an entree with a huge portion of rice on the side, and two crab puffs all for $5.25! The food is super fresh and tastes amazing! The servers are super nice and even put your food in the To go box for you! Definitely would recommend
