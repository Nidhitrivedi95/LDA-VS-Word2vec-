kP2wC0luve3mT5fcdrA3nQ These have got to be the friendliest and most jovial chinese restaurant employees I have ever encountered.

Most chinese restaurants always have efficient and courteous servers, but not here. One of the gentlemen even continually makes jokes with you while taking your order.

And after all these years, as I have indicated in my tip for this place, they have by far the best sweet and sour whole fish in the valley!

It is a personal treat for me to come here during those special occasions that are pertinent to me; such as a birthday or other significant events.

Today was no different. We just received excellent news, and my wife wanted me to treat myself, and she already knew where that would be. Yes, we can eat anywhere, and have visited many places all over. 

However, until there is another place in town that serves a whole sweet and sour fish that is as scrumptious as this; this will be our go to place. It's been that way for as long as we have been married.

We ordered other things with it as well, such as the house special chicken, the chow fun noodles, and the house special fried rice. Everything was delicious, as always.

They even gave us coffee cake for dessert even though we didn't ask for it, and it wasn't bad.

The only bad thing was that they had a broken soda dispenser, and the diet pepsi was atrocious.

They kept asking and verifying if we were sure that we wanted the whole fish, and what size we wanted as they have a small, medium and large whole fish. Ours was a medium and ran $24, and the large one is around $36 or more. Make sure you call ahead an hour or more beforehand, as it takes that long to procure and prepare this delicacy.

All in all, you won't be disappointed with their offerings.
