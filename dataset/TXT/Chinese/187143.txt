YfeTH4jtz_gpWz0QRYJFnQ Stressed is just desserts spelt backwards!

This cafe serves modern revisions on old chinese classic snacks and sweets. There are plenty of choices to flip through, from hot to cold, fruity to nutty, or sweet to savory. Multiple drink options also, if you don't feel like eating. 

Unlike western desserts (which comes in cake, pudding, ice cream, or a hybrid of the three), eastern desserts trend towards 'dessert soups'. A large portion of the dessert menu are various combinations of a soup base and the additions. The soup can be from coconut milk, fruit juice, beans, nuts or ginger. The additions are thrown in for substance, which can be fruit, jelly, sweet dumplings or various forms of starchy spheres. Some translation may be needed for those not use to the nomenclature. Like what is black pearl? sago? pearl delight? I think they are all spheres of different sizes and density. Be adventurous and do some exploring. If soups freak you out, there are always the traditional parfaits, puddings, and cheesecakes.

The space is small, with tables placed close to each other. It quickly gets crowded on Friday and weekends so be prepared to wait, especially if you come in a larger group.
