2Guys, 12 beautiful London girls walk up to Hakassan inside the MGM Grand.

1: Complicated rope system and less then personable body guards make it a formal and dry introduction. Guest service line is inconveniently placed around a different bar in the MGM casino with no sight lines. Not the biggest deal.

2. Very high pressure to get you in quick, split our party and made it an extra 20 mins while we waited to regroup. Good luck asking them to hold the elevator while they triple check ids.

3. Once inside literally had to shout at a whispers distance and still couldn't get a clear sentence out. Table service was granted to the girls for #1 (yes I know I have good taste) while me and the partner were told 1500 or we could visit the bar. Not allowed to sit with the girls we brought not comped, basically a sorry apology and the owners are coming through so "It is what it is" so why can't we sit with the party again?

4. Took some action to join another table because we wanted to treat our 2nd group of 6. Almost got a great deal by just asking fellow table holders however they were removed because they were "out bid". Now removed from two tables with a strained relationship of 18 girls because this club doesn't know what it's doing.

5. Re-entry was nice and easy and confetti plus light show was impressive. Bottle service and guest service team can and will make it an expensive time and did not earn my service or my return.

Tip: I'd rather revisit Omnia or spend that $300.00 with Vic at Dream Cars Las Vegas. Very poor business, poor hospitality and overall an expensive headache that could last longer than the table you buy.
