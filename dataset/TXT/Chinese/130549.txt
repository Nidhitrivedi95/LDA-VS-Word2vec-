We ordered a few dishes for happy hour here and found some hit and miss. The wonderful ceviche with came topped with a fabulous salad. The salad dressing was heavenly: light sesame oil and just a hint of spice. The crunchiness of the salad balanced well with the slightly cooked fish.

Besides the ceviche, the other dishes were not very unique. The sushi was uninspired and the squid was okay. Everything presented well.

Try: Ceviche (They have several kinds)
Skip: Sushi
