What a mistake!  Got talked into the lunch buffet. We should have checked it out first. Absolutely pitiful. Dishes had zero flavor and most were lukewarm at best. Selection was terrible. And most items were pretty close to empty the entire time. Keep in mind this was at noon!

Gave 2 stars due to fine service. Other than that stay away!!!
