8BBcTUOmXT0dJ33hYtLUAw TERRIBLE!! DO NOT EAT HERE. I had the Szchechuan shrimp and shrimp fried rice. It was bland and not spicy whatsoever. The rice was bland as well. I'm not understanding how Chinese can be flavorless. 

I gave this place another chance I thought maybe it was the particular item I ordered. NO!! I ordered pepper steak I've never had an issue with pepper steak. In fact I do a good job. I never thought that pepper steak could go wrong. The meat was funky and tasted so NASTY! The peppers and onions tasted like water. This had no flavor whatsoever it's like it was just cooked in water and not seasoned. I didn't see any seasonings or taste any. It just didn't taste like steak or smell like steak. I had to throw it away.

I won't be returning and I will call them to let them know about it. WASTE OF MONEY!
