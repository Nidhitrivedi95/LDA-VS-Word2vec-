yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Was excited to see that there was a pho kim long here in las vegas. I did question whether it was the same owner as the one in San Jose, Ca. One perk is that this place is open 24 hours. It can cure anyone's hangover from a whirlwind night of drinking and partying hard. 

The menu was probably comparable to the expensive las vegas area. The bowls of pho were a little on the pricier end in my opinion. 

I thought that since this was supposedly the best rated pho restaurant, I would have very good pho broth. There were limited options for pho since they serve other things on the menu. You only had 5-6 pho combinations to choose from. Although, I did not bother asking whether they would change anything on the menu to your taste. 

I was very disappointed that the pho broth was VERY VERY watered down. I felt like I was just drinking a bowl of salted water with MSG in. The broth was pretty much almost clear and without color in the bowl. Must be because they couldn't keep up with the supply and demand of pho and watered it all down or this might just be the quality of the pho broth they had. 

I was so disappointed that by the time I got home, I went home to make a gigantic pot of pho broth. I'm Chinese and I feel like my pho broth was even better than theirs. At least it looked like pho broth by appearance. It may make you reconsider going out to eat pho ever again or especially at this place!
