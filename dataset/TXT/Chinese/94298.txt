JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A I've experienced better. 
Food: we ordered a few dishes (7 dishes) including kalbi and spicy seafood soup, pancake, squid, bulgogi, black bean rice, and the hot stone pot. Kalbi dish was over burn a little bit but last time we were here it was good.
It's Friday night and there was only 1 server but that wasn't much of a problem.
Our dish took a while to come out so speed rating would be around 3/5, could've been faster.
Server was friendly. 
Overall, only negative thing is that it took a while (30-35min) for foods to come out even though the restaurant wasn't busy.
Food: below average - average as compared to other korean restaurants in the area.
