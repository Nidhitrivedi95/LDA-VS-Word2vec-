JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw Shang Artisan Noodle was decent! I've been here a few times and wasn't super impressed to the point where I crave their food. Despite the noodles being homemade, I was actually a bit disappointed with how tough they were. Maybe I just like my noodles softer but I preferred the homemade noodles at Noodle Man more.

My favorite dish was actually the beef pancake appetizer! It's $5 for 4 pan-seared pancakes and beware of how juicy they are! Definitely try to poke a hole before biting or cutting into it - don't say I didn't warn you!

I've tried the Shang Beef Noodle and the broth's flavor wasn't memorable for me. I do like the portion size and the amount of beef that they give though! The beef was quite tender and fresh. This dish is probably the best bet here for me. 

I've also had the Dan Dan noodles which I was disappointed with since Shang's version doesn't have the classic peanut flavor. To me, the combination of peanut + spice makes the dish. They got the spice part down though! The dish also includes ground pork but the dish as a whole wasn't enough to make me full lol. I wouldn't recommend getting this.
