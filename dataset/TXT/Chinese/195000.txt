zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I had been avoiding this place based on the reviews but decided to give it a try at lunchtime during Summerlicious. 

The offering at that time was a bun, noodle bowl and dessert for $18.

I opted for the Pork Bun (with hoisin, scallion and cucumber), the Momofuku Ramen (with pork belly and shoulder, fish cake, egg), and for dessert the Coffee Crisp Panna Cotta.

My husband went for the BBQ Pork Bun (with mayo, slaw and sweet pickle), Momofuku Ramen and the Cereal Milk Soft Serve.

The buns were awesome and flavourful, though I could see how people might complain about the regular price as they weren't huge (though standard bun size I'd say).

I loved the ramen! There was a depth of flavour to the broth and garnishes and the pork was amazingly tender. The portion size was just right for me, though I could see how people who are accustomed to mammoth ramen bowls might be disappointed (though how often do they actually finish those mammoth bowls?).

Also a winner was the panna cotta. Sooo good. Perfect consistency, great flavour and much larger portion than necessary (but I didn't mind ;)). The cereal milk soft serve was alright...not my thing methinks.

My only major complain would be the price of drinks... Everything was a few dollars more than you'd pay elsewhere. Wine for example was $10-$13 for a 4 oz glass.

Service was polite and helpful. Interior was gorgeous, though loud.

For the parents out there, I did note that they have a stack of highchairs available.

Overall I was pleasantly surprised by my visit and would certainly consider making a repeat trip.
