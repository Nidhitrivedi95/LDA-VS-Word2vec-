BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA BOTTOM LINE: Best homemade dumplings in Downtown, Toronto . . . and now with a newer, larger and kitschy-er venue!

Cost:
-$10-20/head (tax and tip included)

Atmosphere/Decor:
-It went from a hole-in-the-wall basement gem to a much larger unit with crimson red walls and kitschy romanticized paintings of the orient.  So bad it's good.  Best part: their framed fan notes thankfully made the transition too!

Ordered:
1. Steamed juicy pork bun: Best item on the menu, though not the best 'siu leung bao' I've had.  Still, delicious and a must-order.  I'm generally a fan of most of their steamed dumpling offerings.

2. Pan fried pork and bak choi dumpling: Skin thickness just right, with the right amount of char for extra taste.

3. Boiled dumplings (any): I know they're boiled, but I found them too soggy, the skin too thick, and the taste a bit bland. Could be just a personal preference though.

4. Beef onion roll: Best non-dumpling item on the menu, but a bit too salty (just wipe some of the sauce off).  Would recommend sharing because it's a pretty large portion for one person.

5. Green onion pancake: Not so good.  Too doughy and bland.

6. Pork and vegetable steamed buns: Not so good.  Even though they were supposedly freshly made, the bun was stale and chewy instead of fresh and fluffy.

Service:
-Bare bones and functional.  No complaints.
-Can get very busy and food can take a while to come, but you know it's freshly made!

Conclusion:
-Delicious and affordable homemade style dumplings that's best shared with a group of friends.  Good to see these guys are still retaining the quality of their food since expanding to a larger and more convenient location.
