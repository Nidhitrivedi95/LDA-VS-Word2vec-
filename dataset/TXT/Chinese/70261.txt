f2FfutZhb4F-m1Ob0EdYaw Chinese food for white people. 

You can tell they have some skill in cooking, and the ingredients tasted fresh... but it's extremely Americanized Chinese food. The flavors taste seriously wrong to a Chinese palate. 

If you're white and prefer lighter/less oily psuedo-Chinese fare, it's one of the better places I've tried.

3 stars because I'm Chinese.
