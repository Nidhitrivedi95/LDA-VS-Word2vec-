qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A I've not had anything bad or poor quality at Chang's. This visit and location included. 

This trip I decided to munch on the lettuce wraps, pork dumplings (steamed) and some new happy hour tacos. Fortunately one order of the tacos were wrong and I got them free. I had shrimp and mahe-mahe. While they were both of good quality, both were skimpy on size and flavor. In fact, they were quite plain. I would avoid these fill you belly with something good and flavorful. 

The dumplings and wraps were as good as ever. 

We had the "great wall of . . ." chocolate cake. It's a multi-layered piece of dense chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, and chocolate chips (which I could do without). It's served with delicious raspberry sauce and berries (blue, ras, and straw). Delicious. Make sure to share.
