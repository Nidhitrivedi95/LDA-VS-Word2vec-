6z-T_jIFrRQ4c6-BIvVBvA My first Congee place experience. GOODBYE CONGEEGINITY!!!!! I will not miss thee.  The location is big and it was pretty busy around lunch time on a Wednesday. Lunch specials for $7.50 and you get soup and spring rrrrooolllll = yummy. 

We had the deep fried tentacles, some kind of rice with mushrooms, chicken and bok choi (one of those green things that people steam?) and it came in a hot bowl so that the rice at the botton was sticky and crunchy at the same time :D Also had the vermicelli that's part of the special, congee with surf clam, choy sum with oyster sauce, hot and sour soup, my friend has the cheung fun and rice roll with duck in it, and rice cake with cabbage and some pork.

Rice roll - amazing. would have a thousand of these, it was so gooey and delicious!
Rice with mushrooms - no. i don't like this. i don't really like rice that much and the chicken was bland. 
Squid tentacles - i want to marry these tentacles. I want to make sweet love to them and have baby tentacles. THAT good.
Vermicelli - dry and meh. wouldn't order it again. 
Rice cake - no. i don't like rice cake. this wasn't Korean style when it's sliced fat and juicy, this was more like rice cake medallions?
Hot and sour soup - yes, i love this stuff.
Spring roll - standard, pretty big.
Choy sum - yummy! soft and i love the oyster sauce on errytang.

Keep in mind that I had to ask one of my trusty rice minions to spell all those names for me....


Service sucked a**. They never came around and it took us like 20 min to get the bill after we asked for it. The portions are BIG, just the way I like it, and the bill was pretty decent - I think for all that between 5 people we paid around $65. I'm pretty much taking away that star for service, and the fact that i didn't enjoy the rice dishes or the vermicelli. NOT SPECIAL ENOUGH!

But I would most definitely come back here again for lunch if i'm in the area.
