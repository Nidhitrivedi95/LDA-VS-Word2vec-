Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA The best Hot and Sour soup anywhere. 
The owner takes pride in his cooking Always consistently fresh and very flavorful. Mainly a to go place but there is room for several people to eat in if they wish. Don't expect much atmosphere if you stay. People are always nice and work hard. Give them a try. I don't think you will be disappointed.
