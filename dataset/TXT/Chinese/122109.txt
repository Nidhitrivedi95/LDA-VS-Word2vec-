odfX0wO7fOyqa8oobxh96w My favorite Chinese food place that delivers to Mt Washington went out of business this past year (ABC Garden), and after living on pizza for several months, I finally gave in to my craving for Chinese and ordered from Fu Lai. It's not that the food was awful. It just doesn't taste good. 

My palate runs from I'll eat and enjoy almost anything to being a foodie. ABC Garden was bad-for-me food that I thought tasted really good. I ordered the same sampling of things from Fu Lai, and enjoyed none of them: 

General Tso's chicken - nothing overtly disgusting and it was edible, but just didn't taste very good. 

Shrimp in lobster sauce - the shrimp were overcooked and probably are like those frozen ones you get in a big five-pound bag at Costco - only much lower quality. The lobster sauce was very gelatinous and had little flavor. It wasn't inedible, but it wasn't good.

Fried Rice (plain) as an accompaniment  to the above - very dry, and little flavor.

Crab rangoon - the filling tasted good - how can you mess up cream cheese? - but the deep-fried crust that wraps it was overdone and tough. ABC Garden used to serve theirs with a tasty sweet red dipping sauce, but no sauce with the ones from Fu Lai.

I also ordered fried dumplings and the wonton soup, but haven't tried those yet. I almost always order enough Chinese food to last for three days, so I'll try those tomorrow. 

I will probably throw out what is left of the General Tso's chicken, the shrimp and lobster sauce and the fried rice, and I can't remember ever not eating everything I've gotten from a restaurant, either as delivery, take-out, or left-overs. Again, not because of anything awful or disgusting, but simply because eating more of it would give me more pain than the pain of throwing out the food I paid for.
