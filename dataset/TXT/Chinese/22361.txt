6li0hNHDg5kuiEw9nXkedg So good I forgot to take pics of the many many dishes we tried! Unlimited iPad ordering, pop and tea included, Avocado pizza, mango salad, maki rolls, salmon teriyaki, noodles and deep fried banana drizzled with chocolate to name just a few of my favourite! 

We didn't have one specific server but the wait staff was great and very accommodating to the many special requests we had... Will definitely be adding this into the rotation!
