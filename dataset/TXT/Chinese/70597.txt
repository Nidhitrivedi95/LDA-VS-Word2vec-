f9ERQpAPOAMv5Ay0kyD3Yw The food was very good I had the  garlic chicken house specialty...I also had an egg roll and hot & sour soup.  We were waited on by a new waitress and we tried to be as patient as possible but we never got refills on our water or soup until we flagged down the busser...this was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars...we watched as it appeared to be 3 new servers running around as the manager decided to sit back and never get involved...why?  Good question!  We have been here several test and the food has always been good...the service usually better...we most likely will be back
