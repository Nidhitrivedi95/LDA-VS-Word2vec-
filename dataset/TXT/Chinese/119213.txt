NSGFzlDGs71v43Y7a1XH0A Loved it! Went on a Friday afternoon for lunch and not too many tables seated. As we ate, more people came in. I would totally recommend!

The staff were prepared to take orders, were not too pushy and also gave us the right amount of attention (asking for more napkins, catering us by filling our soup bowls, letting us know their specials, refilling tea kettle, etc). It came with their house special soup and oranges as fruit at the end. Their bathrooms were spacious and clean too.

We got the:
1. ROAST PORK - super crunchy skin, abundance of sauce on the side, quite a thick layer of fat which you could bite off or separate, enough to share for 3 people

2. 753 CANTONESE STYLE FRIED NOODLE WITH SEAFOOD - super delicious! the noodles were not too soggy or greasy, there were tons of veggies, seafood and chicken strips. The portion was more than enough to share since the dish was pretty big. Would totally get this again.

3. 785 SHREDDED DUCK & SPICY PICKLED CABBAGE VERMICELLI - this was my favourite dish of the three. It comes in a deep bowl with a giant spoon. It wasn't messy to eat and the pairing of the duck and cabbage was super refreshing.

Then when you spend $20 or more, you can add any of these dishes for just $1: deep fried tofu/spring rolls x2/deep fried chicken wings x5 - we got the chicken wings and they were so good! Not too salty not oily - the classic asian diner-style wings. 

Planning to go again for dinner on Tuesday :) Way to go Kung fu chop chop
