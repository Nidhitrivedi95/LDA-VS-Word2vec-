joMyW9KcBEsHJxQuAMulaQ I came with a party of 9 on a friday night and they weren't taking reservations. Understandable as that seems to be the norm for the other board game cafes, but they did say that if they were to take that many people they would've required us to do this under a corporate event with a $20 minimum per person. 

We did choose this place to celebrate two people's birthdays due to the reviews, but we did bring our own cake and hostess told us that to serve the 'cake' we would've had to do a $20 plating fee (I even brought the disposable utensils, plates and the cake was already cut!). She was really regretful, but it was not her fault. I believe to compensate, they also let us stay a lot longer without buying more drinks/food.

I felt like this was a step down from Snakes and Lattes. Food was good, but a bit pricey. We didn't really need very much instruction as we were fairly experienced. But the selection was a bit lacking and for sets like Dominion, they only had one base set...but multiple expansions. Meaning, if somebody took the base game, there was 0 ability to play any of the expansions. It was also really uncomfortably hot inside, which doesn't seem like it was the problem with others here.

Atmosphere was good, there was a lot of excitement. Decor was great and very modern/clean. Service was good as well and they were attentive. This place is good provided you have somebody who knows the game and is interested in playing. Do not expect the waitresses to teach you how to play the game. The only reason why the rating was lower than a 4 was due to the problems with accommodating the group.
