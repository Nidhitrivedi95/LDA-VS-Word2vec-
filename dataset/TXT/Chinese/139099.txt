QTYA1yCbsCjRU6BYDdQJuw Randomly tried this new place. I was very surprised to find they have a range of desserts and meals. I tried the leek and potato soup which was awesome. And I also tried the vanilla bean cupcake which was also really great. All in all, this is a new neighbourhood place that I'll be coming back to regularity. The staff is great, it's very clean and the menu is good for any mood. It's also cozy to come by yourself because there's a bar/stool section. I don't normally like eating places alone but this was a quick bite and it was comfortable. It's a must try... I'll be going back!
