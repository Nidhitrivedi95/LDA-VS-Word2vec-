8MdMBYTVavXF-smJapxrQA Came here on a Saturday for lunch. The place was vey busy but we were lucky enough to get a seat right away. 

Pork Cutlet bun $6.50 - the pork was very lean, juicy and tender. 

Pork cutlet on rice $9.75 once again the pork was as the pork bun described above. Portions were very filling. 

Spaghetti bolognese $9.50 -  Not very saucy in terms of tomato sauce. It was more like spaghetti with ground beef and cheese. My mom didn't like it much but I thought it was pretty good.  

Fried sticy rice $11.25 - no complaints here. Its a simple dish and it tasted good.

All meals came with soup and milk tea except for the pork cutlet bun. 

Service was really fast. Everything tasted good and the pork was amazing.
