cI7k9zqs_pl3byUDE4cpdA My boyfriend & I ordered pick up by phone. We got two wonton soups. The wonton was flat instead of cone style but still tasted good. The 2 soups were large, we could have ordered 1 to share. We had the fried shrimp which was amazing! I dont remember what mains we ordered but they were good too. It all came out nicely in a box to go with chopsticks and fortune cookies!
