9WAnQD1nj1j3zLZ7ONtvfQ We came here on our first night for dinner and while the service was excellent, the food was just OK.  It's not that it was bad it was just not that exciting, I guess I expected more out of a Vegas restaurant.  The shrimp with the rice noodles were HUGE but a little stringy and the salmon was a little strong tasting but the seafood dumplings were yummy.  The dessert, some molten chocolate thing was dry and the ice cream with it too hard, we kept banging the plate with our spoons and it was flipping all over the place (is that too nit-picky?? if so, ignore!)!  Sidebar, don't you feel like molten chocolate cakes are over now?  I mean you can buy these at the store already made and just microwave them, think up another way to serve chocolate cake already!! (ignore also the fact that we ordered it!)  

A friend I was with was very impressed that the moment he "looked" like he needed service, he got it, so that was a plus.  Overall a decent place, I just wouldn't recommend it since there are so many other places to go.
