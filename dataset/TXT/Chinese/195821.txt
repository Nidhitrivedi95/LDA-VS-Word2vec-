ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg Speedy service, many genuinely-unique dishes (some pics attached), most dishes are delicious coming in at all flavours, spacious table room, cutlery is standard and good.

Overall, it was a good experience. I would recommend coming here. Just be warned many dishes are fairly expensive.
