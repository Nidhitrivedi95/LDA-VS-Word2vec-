It's a good place to order take-out or dine-in for a fast, quick, meal to satisfy your hakka food needs/cravings. Service was good of all the times I've been here. If you're expecting stellar service all the time, I wouldn't count on it. Maybe go for the take-out instead; still pretty good portions to go.

It's my go-to Hakka restaurant for a quick bite. Parking can be a nightmare though. There's more space in the back, but it's a tight squeeze in the front.
