IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Despite peeking at the reviews beforehand, my family and I went to the Noodle Shop since we wanted something light (after having buffet and steak the 24 hrs prior). We were promptly brought to a table. A lady took our drink order, but seemed to be a bit impatient when my dad didn't decide what drink he wanted right away. All of us ended up ordering different things and only my sister was pleased with her dish (seared sea bass), though she was the one who refused to go after I told her about the subpar reviews. My dish had crispy noodles and seafood. It was bland and the texture was sort of uneven (?). My mom's Vietnamese noodle soup was bland and my dad's Pad Thai had no sauce. The Thai tea was good and the service was kind.
