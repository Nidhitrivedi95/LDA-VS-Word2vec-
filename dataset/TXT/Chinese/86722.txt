Their noodles are great in texture, a little chewy but soft still, thats what good noodles are. Their beef tendons and brisket are well cooked, it's soft since it has been slow cooked. The portion size of it are fairly big, one bowl is enough to make you really full. 

I also ordered the stinky tofu, it is not as authentic because I guess if they did serve it, it would be extremely stinky and not much people would be able to eat it. It is nicely fried with a sweet sauce on top.

I have been here more than once so I would recommend to my friends if they were looking to try something different. Only thing is they don't have a big menu to choose from so not a lot of variety.
