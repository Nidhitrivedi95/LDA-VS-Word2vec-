pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA My husband and I celebrated my birthday here on a Saturday night! Great atmosphere ensured we were in for a fun night. We loved the cocktails and the service was amazing, all of our recommendations were amazing!! Take note of what we ordered as it was a perfect menu - we ordered all share plates, tuna tataki, yellow tail ceviche, yellow tail tacos (a must order), wagu goyza (get these), the rock tail shrimp and a tuna crunchy roll. The food was amazing - I am getting hungry just thinking about it. We had desert as well and based on recommendations from our waitress we ordered the banana & the pumpkin cinnamon donuts!!! So good - go here it was a great experience!!!!
