s5fGo1Nieiy6M-fhk_Ywnw Simple menu and pretty good food.  Well at least what I ordered.  Got the Mongolian Beef, Lemon Chicken Bowl and the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken (mini).  Mongolian beef was a HUGE order and pretty spicy, but was good.  The Lemon Chicken Bowl wasn't the best.  They give you the sauce on the side, which I prefer, but wasn't the best on the taste buds.  It reminded me of that drink Tang, lol.  But the actual chicken was good and crispy.  And the Hawaiian Chicken Bowl was Y U M !  Great flavor, wasn't over cooked and the mac salad was on point.  Will be back to try more items.  Until next time...
