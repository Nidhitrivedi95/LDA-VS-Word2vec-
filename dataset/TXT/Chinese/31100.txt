We walked in and i breathed a sigh of relief at the lovely orchids and bamboo. While it does look like a German restaurant on the inside, its tastefully decorated and cosy with plenty of seating. We are during lunch and there is a separate menu for lunch. Both lunch and dinner are very reasonably priced. Lunch comes with choice of soup/ salad/ spring roll. I ordered tea and soup with my tofu and curry. It says spicy, so while it didn't knock my socks off, i could actually taste the spice and or was beyond a typical German spicy heading. The food came out quickly and perfectly timed that i finished my soup before my meal arrived. I ordered green tea which was also hot, plentiful for 1, and promptly served. 
My colleague's and i were all very happy with our service and the meal. Definitely worth a return visit! 
***sidenote: their menu states they also accept dollars. We paid in euro, but it was on the front of the menu***
