6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag We've had China Mama on our list for a few months and finally made it over there last week.  Ordered the Steamed Juicy Pork Buns and Dry Fried Beef Noodles.  (That's 2 dishes if you are counting).

Some dumplings arrived and I thought to myself that these do not look like the XLB I was expecting.  However, they were delicious and we enjoyed them.

Next arrived the Dry Fried Beef Noodles.  Do not order this.  The "dry fried" refers to the Beef, NOT to the noodles.  Not flavourful and half the beef was dry-fried fat, not meat.  (Do you not SEE that you are serving a chunk of fat?)

Next, a different waitperson stops at the table with another dish.  (wtf? 3 dishes?).  I told her we only ordered 2 dishes and that they had made a mistake.  A few minutes later, the manager (older, matriarchal lady) comes to the table to explain that they had served the first set of dumplings in error and that the second plate of dumplings was the correct order.  I told her we had enough food, but if they were going to waste, we would eat them.  She countered by assuring me that it was not too much food (for 2 people) and she set the dumplings down.  (This is a cultural thing, I think, and I didn't take it as her being pushy)

The XLB were, by this time, luke-warm and, while edible, they were not anything I'd go out of my way for.  The first set of dumplings (the Shanghai pan-fried dumplings) were excellent and flavourful and they are the reason I gave CM 2 stars.

When the check arrived, I was shocked to see the Manager had CHARGED us for both sets of dumplings - the ones we ordered and the ones we had not.  Outrageous.  I'm kicking myself for paying the full amount as I would usually set the matter straight, but I guess I was a little shocked by the ballsyness of this place. 

This entire experience left such a bad taste in my mouth that I won't be back.
