wKI0q-WkPi0N3Mk_T3frmQ You want real Chinese food?  Go to China.  On second thought, that might be a little too exotic for the faint at heart.  In which case, what you want is the American version of Chinese food.  So if you find yourself at Red Rock on a Wednesday evening and stop hitting "Repeat Bet" long enough to realize you're hungry, a trip to the food court may be in order.  And that's when, faced with an array of less-than-exciting choices, you could decide to dig in to Panda Express's offerings.

Sure, you could pay a few more bucks and get the same - or better - quality Chinese food at the buffet, but then you'll pig out and hate yourself in the morning.  Or sooner.  While Panda is overpriced for what you get (Note:  most of the food court places seem to have raised their prices recently), you can choose to eat less of it.

I used to order the two-item combo plate, but it really was too much food for me, so I've switched to the bowl.  Last time I got a new item - Angus steak and shrimp - and it was actually pretty good, though I didn't notice that it was a buck extra because of the shrimp.  So that little bowl of food - with way too much rice, but enough of the main, was over $8 with the tax. 

Still, it was a passable alternative to starvation, and the diversion actually saved me a few bucks at the machines.
