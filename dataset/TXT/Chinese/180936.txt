X9ftU-exKhTMOjtr3B52rw Not too much seating at this place.  It didn't matter for me today as I went after the  peak lunch period. 

I ordered the signature noodles with wonton, fishballs and beef for $8 plus tax. It was brought out to me instantly.  Initially the bowl looked a little small.  However, I quickly realized there were two huge shrimp wontons and two large fishballs under all the noodles. There was also a
decent amount of beef.  The fishballs were good, as was the soft, tender beef. But what I enjoyed most were the shrimp wontons!  They were so yummy!
I could've eaten five of those.  After finishing my signature noodles, I felt full. 

Overall, I enjoyed this dining experience and look forward to returning again.
