QpOAv584eb-ecG4TLEm95g I've been to about 3 china a go go's around town and I can definitely say that this location is one of the better ones. It's next to the Von's on windmill and Bermuda, across the street from bachi burger.
I came with my husband during his lunch break because I was craving cheap Chinese lunch specials and this location was the closest. We went in and the waitress was kind and told us to sit down anywhere. I was quite impressed that they had booths and looked like a cute little restaurant since most other china a go go's look like only take out locations. There was only one other table but within, no joke, about 10 minutes, the place got packed!
They bring you crispy wontons with sweet and sour sauce, and egg drop soup (only for dine in) as you wait for drinks. I ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special for about $6, expecting something small and greasy, assuming you get what you paid for.
It comes out in to go boxes and that box was FILLED! My husband and I looked at each other in shock at how much food they give. We could already tell that we weren't gonna be able to finish it. It comes with both chow mein and fried rice and the food was piping hot/fresh.
I love Chinese food and I grew up eating authentic Chinese food so if you're looking for that, this place isn't it. But if you're looking for really decent quality Chinese food for dirt cheap, then this is definitely the place to go (especially this location, really clean).
