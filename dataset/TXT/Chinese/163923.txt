USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw Pleasantly surprised! Arrived on Sunday around 11am for dim sum, and the place was dead... Like two other small tables. They only had a few carts going around, and a smaller selection than what Li Wah would be pushing. There also did not appear to be a dim sum menu, which makes things difficult for patrons who have never had dim sum or do not speak Canto/Mando. By noon, the place was filling but there was no wait line to be seated. 

Usually I find dim sum to be on the greasier side, but Bo Loong was on point! No excess grease except for maybe on the salt baked squid. My favorite was probably the dou miao, which is a green leafy veggie sauteed with garlic, or the har gaw, which is a shrimp type of dumpling.
