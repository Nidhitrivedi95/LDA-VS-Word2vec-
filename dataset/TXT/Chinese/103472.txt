kLiMrnkcV_dfVpejfRlhSg Disgusting, raw mushrooms, old (brown all over the ends) vegetables and totally flavourless..except for super fishy flavour of the fake shrimp wontons! I can't believe they would send me a pile of garbage and call it 'food'. My first experience with UberEATS, and I'm so grossed out. I feel really stupid for essentially throwing $30 in the trash. I love actual Chinese food and have eaten in tons of restaurants downtown since I was a child, I would not write a bad review unless it seriously sucked.  STAY AWAY!!!
