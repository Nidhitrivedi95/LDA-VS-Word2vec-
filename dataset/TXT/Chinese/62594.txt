Ordered takeout based exclusively on the Yelp photos: won ton soup with spicy pork and the garlic pork spare rib dish. Didn't glance at a menu prior, surprised my total was $25. Other reviews state that prices have risen in recent months, and it certainly doesn't make me want to rush back.

WON TON SOUP WITH SPICY PORK: Generous portion, boxed with noodles and dumplings separate for at-home assembly. Spicy broth with plenty of cilantro and pork, tasty dumplings and generous portion of noodles.

GARLIC PORK SPARE RIB: A little underwhelmed by this. I'm a huge garlic lover and the plentiful crunchy-fried version in this dish was sweeter and more understated than I expected, it's used more for texture. Did not finish this dish.

Service was typical for the area. Location is clean and organized. Other reviews mention the tour bus visits being a regular occurrence, which would be a deterrent for me. I might return for a dine-in visit another time to try different dishes.
