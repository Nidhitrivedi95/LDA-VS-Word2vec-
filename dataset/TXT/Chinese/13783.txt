3-HFGxmbzSax-NySJ_LzDg VIP is our go-to Asian restaurant. The food is always on-point and the price is right. You can order from three different, well-rounded menus: the Japanese menu, the Chinese menu, or the real Chinese menu. 

The Japanese menu has great sushi options. We have tried almost everything and have never been disappointed. Order what looks good to you! The seaweed salad is always a nice, fresh accompaniment to the meal. We have tried a few other appetizers--tempura crab, scallop salad--but usually just stick with the seaweed salad and a bunch of sushi. All you can eat sushi on Sundays is dangerous! 

The Chinese menu has everything you'd expect like General Tso's, sweet and sour chicken, etc. We have had the hand-pulled noodle soup and west lake soup. Both good! The west lake soup is massive, so order with a group or plan to have leftovers. 

And finally, the best-kept secret in Madison is their real Chinese menu, which is only written in Chinese. You can ask your server to translate. Everything on it is authentic, so be ready for bone-in meats and tons of flavor. I'd recommend the hot pot and pork belly, which are the only things I've tried from this menu. But the steamed DIY buns look delicious, so I'll be back to try those. This is definitely a menu to try with a group. It's like taking a trip to China!
