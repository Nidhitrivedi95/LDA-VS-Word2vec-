-M9S1wlZTvv6T9EOo5X2Yw - Waiter spilled half the soup on the table serving us

- Preorder a wintermelon soup which they don't have at the time of dinner

- Peking duck was small, even smaller after it went through the kitchen

- Served corn and fish fillet

I don't eat that much but I still felt I could eat more at the end. Its not like the taste is bad but the cost for the meal seems to be way off.
