Pu7GTgTzdjbxAhr8A73zGA I've eaten here a few times. Pretty good food, great service. Some new staff the last time I went. Our server (Jersey?) was really good. Personable and funny. My shrimp egg foo yung was yummy. Tea was good too. 

I'll eat here again when I'm in the area and in the mood for Chinese food.
