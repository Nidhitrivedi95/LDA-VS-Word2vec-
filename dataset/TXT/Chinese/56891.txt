The decor is minimalist modern but is nicely done.  The dining room was immaculately clean too.

Everything we ordered was very tasty.  Kung Pao chicken needed more peanuts but the seasoning was excellent.  Hot and sour soup really was both hot AND sour, something that most places miss on.  An eggplant dish was very good too.

Friendly, capable service.  If you are in the High Park area and want a nearby non-authentic Chinese fix, this place should serve the purpose.
