pIB-Js9drl27qrrSjKK_eA The dishes served here are from the north-western part of China around the city of Xi'an. I was fortunate to have gone there last summer so I'll try to compare and contrast. The pork bun/Chinese hamburger was decent. Probably one of the better ones I have had in Canada. However their noodles are a bit lacking. It was really really oily. Although many Northern Chinese food tend to use more oil/grease/fat, these noodles were definitely on the upper limit. The oilness overpowered all the taste of the noodles and toppings. 

There are only 3 small tables in the store. So I would recommend take out if you are visiting during lunch/dinner hours.
