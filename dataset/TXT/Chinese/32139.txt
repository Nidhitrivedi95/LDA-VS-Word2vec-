9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw My Mongolian beef looked<U+200B> delicious but tasted terrible. I was excited to try this restaurant but I don't think I'll be going back or if I do I definitely won't be ordering anything with beef. They apparently use a low quality beef if you can even call it that it's more like pieces of beef fat. I couldn't even eat it so it was a total waste of $10
