EMh5InDTEfGGCowRy_pJZA We were hungry or at least I was hungry and it is past 10:30 pm, Shangri-La Hot Pot Restaurant seems to be a good option for some AYCE hot pot action!

Grand Opening Special 10% off but they added 10% Service Charge to the bill. 

Since the Chinese name <U+9999><U+934B><U+91CC><U+8FA3> of Shangri-La is Spicy Hot Pot (there is no direct relation between Chinese and English), I decided to order one of the spicy broth to try for a surcharge of $4.50. For the basic broth without surcharge, they only have the plain broth. Spicy is not that spicy at least if you can eat as spicy as me. I would opt for extra spicy next time. 

Though the choice of item available is a limited, but they all prepared well. Canadian AAA Beef and New Zealand Lamb on the menu which were pretty good cut. I like the home made wontons too. The vegetables was fresh and washed properly Whole shrimp with heads on was good too.

We were the only table here so we got good service. The lady checked on us frequently and even brought out free refill of plum juice in a jar for us without us requesting.

Shangri-La is not a bad option if you want some late night hot pot since it is open till 2 am especially on a cold wintery night!
