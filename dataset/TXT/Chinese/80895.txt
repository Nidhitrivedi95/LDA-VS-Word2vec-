gvur69cXFtawJnJbNzFuZQ We haven't been to the Pearl in years. It hasn't changed much. I'm not sure that's a good thing. The food is good - but uninspired. After the delightful greeting, the service is attentive but not up to the standards you'd expect in 2016. 
We got tempura veg and shrimp. Average. 
Sushi and rolls were good - but pedestrian.
