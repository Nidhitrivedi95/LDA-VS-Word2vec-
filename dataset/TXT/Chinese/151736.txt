T_qUbVZV7EFUg95SpRxO8w I swore two years ago that I would avoid restaurants with warming trays .The last time I ate at a Tiki Ming (two years ago)..I was disappointed. Today, I decided that I would give them another try and would simply have vegetable fried rice. I was sure no restaurant could screw up vegetable fried rice..it was a safe bet, right?..
Wrong! Tasteless.. and I will attach a photo showing the amount of vegetables in my vegetable fried rice.. what a laugh!
