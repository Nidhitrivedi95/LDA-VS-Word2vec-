DiCWSyoaBkIpOVUdIO7Jlg Wow, this meal was so bad it caused me to finally sign up for yelp, while I was still sitting in the restaurant!! Ok, first thing first...there is barely any thai items on the menu. I asked if they made pad see ew and was told no! Most items appeared to be chinese of panda express quality. I ordered yellow curry and my boyfriend general tso chicken. After 10 minutes the waiter returned to tell me they didnt have any curry! Its on their menu?? So I ended up just ordering potstickers and a thai tea. My boyfriends chicken came up first and it looked like it was covered in a thick, jam like sauce. When you picked up a piece it actually had strings of sau e from it like a thick syrup. Gross! My boyfriends ice tea sat empty on the table the entire time and my potstickers finally arrived 10 minutes after his meal. We had to remind the waiter about the thai tea which was honestly the best part of the meal. The pot stickers were average at best. The fortune cookies were good... but the fortune really was a good metaphor for the meal...see pic attached Bottom line dont expect thai at this restaurant, and better yet just stay away.
