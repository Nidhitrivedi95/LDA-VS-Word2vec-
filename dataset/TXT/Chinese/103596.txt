KLvpdtFYUi1I0LNsmIqeJw I like this place for a quick Americanized Chinese food fix. You can either pick-up, eat in or they deliver. The menu is huge and I really like the  Egg Fu Yung. Things come in several sizes depending how hungry you are or if you are feeding a family. The people I have dealt with are very nice and personable and my food is always ready when I call ahead for pickup. Price is good too.
