GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g The restaurant looks amazing, but besides that I didn't get a wow on the food nor did I on the service.

I usually expect alot when I dine in more upscale restaurants in Vegas (when it's not the regular buffet or 24 hour cafes). The food was on par, maybe because I live in a Chinese part of LA and have tasted way better dim sum and Chinese cuisine. Service, yes they were nice but none out of the ordinary.

They actually opened bottles of Fiji water for us and expected us to pour it ourselves. I wasn't to happy about that.

I wouldn't say this place is horrible. But I guess if you are really craving Chinese in Vegas this would be suitable to hold you out a little bit longer until you get to your favorite.
