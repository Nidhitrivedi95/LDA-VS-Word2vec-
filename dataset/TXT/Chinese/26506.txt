Visited ~7pm on Saturday right after Black Friday and stood in line for what seems like 30mins. It's definitely not worth the wait but overall was satisfied with our noodle soup and sides. The server was helpful w/ the menu, "crossing bridge" means the noodle and ingredients are separate from the soup and you add it all in yourself vs. the regular which has it all prepared inside. The waitress recommended tomato or the spicy sour crossing bridge noodle soup but she's from Szechuan so her taste profile may skew on the heavier spicier side. She also recommends adding shrimp which I say is not worth the effort since the shrimp isn't peeled! I actually enjoyed the simple broth from the braised pork bone instead since the delicate taste of braising the bones are more apparent, unlike the tomato version where the tomato overwhelms it. 

Ordered - w/ ** marked for recommendations 
- Signature Braised Bone in Pork Rice Noodle Soup  **Recommend over tomato version though very skimpy on the protein so you might want to add meat. The soup broth here really sets itself apart from other places. There's a reason why it's called signature! 
- Tomato Flavoured Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup with Beef Slices + added shrimp - Tomato kind of cover the taste of the braised broth and only ~3 pieces of shrimp are provided and needs to peeled 
- Deep fried Pumpkin w/ red bean paste - **Recommend chewy and absolutely delicious
- Egg Tofu - Interesting texture reminds me of a mix of a mushroom and tofu with a vinegary sesame sauce
- Deep fried Durian pastry - It's okay it doesn't seem like they added sugar as it's less sweet than I expected for dessert 
- Salty crispy chicken - Good no complaints here
