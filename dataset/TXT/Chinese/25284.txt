7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA Authentic Chinese Squirrel Hill. I personally was not a fan of the pepper used however the portions are large enough for 2 and the food is served promptly. I was slightly disappointed that many of the items on the English menu were out [which is fine for the authentic Chinese menu]

The Tea served could have been of a better quality, however, as I was severely under the weather at this point of time, I was happy it made me feel better.
