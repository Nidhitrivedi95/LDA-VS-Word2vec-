RAKSBqeNb-p_ZABwAWH_jA Koishi is located in an old Pizza Hut, but they have done a great job with making the best of the space. Being open until 10-11pm every night is also an added bonus for the neighborhood. I highly recommend the Ichiban Roll (tempura shrimp, eel, avocado, unagi sauce) - it's a great spin on the Caterpillar Roll, but the added texture & flavor of the tempura shrimp make even the most novice sushi people happy. The Hot Lover Roll is also a personal favorite (scallop, masago, tobiko, sriracha, and spicy mayo sauce), though I am a scallop sushi aficionado, so am fairly biased. I tend to stick to sushi when I order from Koishi, so am not sure how their Chinese/Pan-Asian dishes are.
