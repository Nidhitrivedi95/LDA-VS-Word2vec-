mQCT1psNh2pJT38ohSQDHA Came here for a sushi dinner. I definitely will not be coming back. First, we did not receive the appetizer we ordered (it was left on the bill and we had to have them remove it). Second, the service was incredibly slow and it wasn't even that busy. We were there for an hour and a half. It took 40 minutes for our sushi to come out. And lastly, the sushi wasn't even that good. If you're looking for a sushi place, do not go here.
