Pj9DDbTmjBEKXezLb0qmTw I don't usually write reviews. But today was very curious. When we came in on a Saturday afternoon there was no place to sit. Not because the place was packed, but half of the tables were full of dirty dishes stacked from previous customers. We had to push away these dirty plates to make room so we can sit. I have never been to a restaurant when that happened.

The floor was equally dirty with food droppings.... What a mess.

I ordered a chicken curry dish. I wish the curry temperature was hotter. The chicken pieces were tough. The taste of the curry soup is good. I wish the chicken were more tender.

 We also ordered chicken wings appetizer. But those did not come until we finished eating after we reminded them a couple of times. The chicken wings were fried ok, but taste ...just so so.
