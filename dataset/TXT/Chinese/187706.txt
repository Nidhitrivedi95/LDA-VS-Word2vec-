This is pretty obvious by the fact that it was FULL and had a 30 minute wait for lunch time on a Saturday. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was what you'd expect out of a busy restaurant in Chinatown. The pho was delicious. We also got egg rolls and spring rolls to share at the table and they were all very good and fresh. Looking forward to returning here in the near future.
