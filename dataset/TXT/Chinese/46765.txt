bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q I recently heard of Singing Pandas through word of mouth. My cousin was raving to my mom about how good the food was, so I went there tonight along with my parents and my grandma.

I was not expecting actual singing, lol, but everybody enjoyed the entertainment.  It's a fairly small restaurant which, along with the intimate lighting, gave it a cozy feel.  Overall, a nice-looking place.  But the strong whiff of deliciousness coming from the kitchen is what reeled me in.  Also, the servers are very courteous and attentive, not a single staff member was without a smile.

We had quite a variety on the table.  I ordered the green curry chicken with steamed rice.  My dad ordered moo goo gai pan (which isn't on the menu, but the chef was able to prepare it).  My mom ordered chicken egg foo young and mu shu pork to share, and my grandma had orange chicken with the sauce on the side to keep it crispy.

We sampled each other's dishes, which were all tasty.  When I got to my green curry I was floored.  The flavor  of the coconut milk-based sauce was smooth, herbaceous and mildly spicy.  Bathing in the sauce was tender chicken, crisp bamboo shoots, just-cooked green beans, green bell peppers, eggplant and a touch of Thai basil.  Spooned on top of fragrant jasmine rice, the dish was an instant favorite at the table.  I even tried it on the fried rice - so good.

The servers ensured that our food arrived promptly to the table, hot and fresh.  They were on top of it all night.  Even the owner, Sherry, visited our table to see if we were enjoying our meal before and after ascending to the stage for a performance.

Although it was a busy Saturday night, the great food and excellent service made my family and I feel like we had the restaurant all to ourselves.  I can't wait to come back and try more of Singing Pandas' dishes.  I've got my eye on the pan-fried noodles next!
