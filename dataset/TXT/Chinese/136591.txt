QHZw2L6LV1qmExNJbfhIsQ I was interested in trying a new place out as my parents recommended it. After arriving at 11:30am on Sunday, we waited 2 hours waiting in line with others irritated with not enough waiting space to the point where people were spilling into the dining area. When we finally got our table it was the one everyone would hate, closest to the door. As we were starving by now, we took it even with people standing around surrounding us waiting to be seated still. 

After we sat down at a dirty table, 5 minutes for them to clear it only to set a fresh set of still dirty dishes.  Another half hour before they came to take our order. At least they gave us tea which I guess we should be thankful for. A server kept bringing out food asking if we wanted some at least 3 times. After asking each time what it was he was trying to sell he just walked away. 

While dropping food off at the table another server slammed her tray into my chair almost dropping everything into the floor. The food quality I would say is average. It's what I would expect from a place like this for dim sum. The bbq pork rice looked good but a little on the sweet side as it was covered in sugar making it excessively sweet when you expect savoury.

From what I can tell from a service stand point. They simply don't have enough waiting staff. With the size of the establishment i would expect at least twice the amount of staff in order to get orders to customers to quickly turnover tables as fast as possible to generate maximum revenue.  

Overall I liked the steamed yolk egg bun the most out of all the food we ordered out of a table of 5. Even if the food was above average here, it is greatly over shadowed by the lack of support staff.
