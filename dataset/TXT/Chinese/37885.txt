as5StqV9pbDhUM0AYP_j9g The buns are okay, not great.  The pineapple buns were dry and a little hard.  Go to Markham or Richmond Hill for better baked goods.  One big complaint is the Hong Kong Style tea with milk. When the lady mixed my tea, she poured the tea out of the glass pot and heated the tea in the microwave.  I wonder how many days the tea has been sitting in that pot.
