Very friendly service, and all four items - Chinese chicken salad, shumai, cilantro dumplings, and Yang Chow fried rice - were great. The salad was dressed perfectly and had lots of chicken. The shumai might have been the best item. The fried rice was prepared without soy sauce (as the menu indicated) so it could have been bland but we liked it a lot. Last visit might have been ten years ago and I remember thinking the salad and dumplings were not as good as my first experience decades ago in Studio City. This time it rocked. We will definitely stop by next time we're in Vegas.
