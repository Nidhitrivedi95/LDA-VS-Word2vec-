Hm2YntlJzqP4reNZRlkCEA A hard place to find something to eat for a pescatarian.  I came for lunch and expected to be able to eat at least a couple of things on the menu.  Sadly, there were barely any options for me to try. There were some things on the brunch menu that were pesce-friendly, but since it was after 11:15, they were no longer available.  

I ended up grabbing the popular Bbq Pork dish (basically bbq pork baked in a cheesy rice dish), giving in to momentary weakness.  I took a bite of the pork and decided against eating the pork.  It was fatty and not worth breaking my pescatarian diet.  The rest of the dish was very heavy and cheesy. 

I also split the Calamari dish with a friend.   I did not really care for the breading of the squid. 

Summary: stay away pescatarians!  Limited selection for you.  All they have is pork and chicken options.
