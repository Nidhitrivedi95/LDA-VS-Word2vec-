q7jC-6uH7IieKu8PcT2gBA We are travelling and arrived 30 mins before closing. Though I try not to arrive to close to closing time at any restaurant, restaurants usually have no problem staying open while folks finish eating when they've arrived prior to closing. 
We ordered a large order of Sweet & Sour Chicken with white rice and two spring rolls. The woman taking our order asked if it were for here or to go? We planned on eating in the restaurant, but knew we wouldn't take long. She told us that they leave at 10pm. Not that they close at 10pm, but that they LEAVE. Ok... We'll make sure to eat fast, I guess. Now, they have the back door open, and one of them is smoking outside, so the stench is coming all the way to the front of the restaurant. Not cool.
