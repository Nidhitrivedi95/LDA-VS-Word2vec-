X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg If you're only going to take one thing away from this review, it's don't go to Hakkasan and try the other clubs the strip has to offer like Marquee, XS, or Lights!

My friends and I have had a multitude of terrible experiences at Hakkasan. I know why do I keep coming back right? Because they have the most popular DJs I'll give them that, but also because I unfortunately, trust too wholeheartedly. 

I contacted the promoter, Peter Nguyen (avoid this promoter like the plague), and he was willing to help my friends and I get in for free with table service. However, we showed up on Friday night and he said that we would be found. The catch was he didn't even know what we looked like. We ended up being packed in like sardines on the dance floor, while guys were shoving and punching us! It also took us DAYS to get on and the same amount to get off. 
Then on Saturday night we went back because he apologized and promised unlimited table service. When we texted him that we were here, he said made up some bullshit excuse that he couldn't come get us for another 2 hours, so we waited. When the clock struck 12:30 am, we texted him and he failed to reply. We were left feeling stupid yet again.

I gave both Ling-Ling (bottom hip-hop floor) and Hakkasan a chance, and needless to say, I'll most likely not be coming back to this terrible and overly crowded club. Also girls, the whole club is built with angled walkways and this really gets to your toes in those heels and cuts off all circulation to those poor little piggies. Avoid having to walk up and down these treacherous walkways by avoiding Hakkasan!
