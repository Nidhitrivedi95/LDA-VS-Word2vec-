Hearing complaining about tips is a HUGE turn off in my book. Upon entering Autumn Court the server/bartender was complaining to a man sitting at the bar that the last customers that she served did not leave her a tip. (To be honest, I would have considered stiffing her too after these comments.) She then had the audacity to ask the customer if she should go out and ask them for one! This is all while we were waiting to be seated. The customer said "I wouldn't" and she made a dash for the side door heading to the parking lot. The customer turned to us and said he had never seen anything like that before. Wait...there's more. We turned around and left to find a different place to eat and I made a call to the manager to let him know what had happened. He listened, but offered no resolution and took my information to pass to the owner. Five minutes later my cell phone starts ringing and it is the server (seriously!?) we called about asking why we thought it was not right that she did that and told me that she had the RIGHT to tips because she was not paid hourly. I briefly spoke to her about the rudeness of speaking to customers about other customers and all she could say was that she would not get fired over this. Babe, if were my restaurant you would have totally have been gone for this. Tomorrow I'll try and contact the owner direct because we are never going there again and my phone number should not have been passed out like that. Time to find another neighborhood Chinese restaurant.
