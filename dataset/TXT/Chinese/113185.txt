mmt2tfx6HkMPVJs2Ecr-Sw Whenever my folks would be in town, my dad would go out on the hunt for seafood. While buying a king crab in Chinatown, a man suggested we come here because it is said that this place knows their seafood. WOW!!! It was out of this world!!! We got the fixed king crab and lobster meal. Prepared in many ways, our family had the best time savouring our food. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly! The good kept on coming and by the time the fish came out (the last dish) we were already in food coma mood! It was so good that my dad placed and order for the crab in four days lol! Everything was delicious! Can't wait to come back!!!
