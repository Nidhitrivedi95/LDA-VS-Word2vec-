cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw Was not happy with this place at all. Took my nephews, who are locals, for lunch here, and was sorely disappointed. I order the shrimp with sizzling rice, and got a very mediocre and slightly slimy concoction, but it did sizzle. 
We ordered a pu pu platter, and it gets very mixed reviews. the beef sticks were good, the fried wonton tastless, and the ribs looks so dehydrated, we didn't even try them. 
The sevice was worse than the food. First, they do not include steamed rice with their entrees, so we ordered 2, which never came even after we reminded the waiter we ordered them, but of course were included on the bill. 
They basically dumped our food on the table and then ignored us. We even had to literally get up and get our waiter for a bill when we were done after waiting 20 minutes to see if he would come around on his own. This place wasn't busy, only 2 other tables with diners at them. there was no reason for the bad sevice except the waiter was more interested in his cell phone then serving his customers. 
There are lots of other places in Chinatown, give this one a pass.
