M0A8RFdN1UqSd-tIqXFEBQ I was so excited to find a Chinese food place near me and by the yelp reviews I thought this place is worth a try. I got the combo lo mein, orange chicken, crab Rangoon and egg rolls. The lo mein noodles were very tasty but the chicken, beef and especially the shrimp were not very good. Lacked flavor and the shrimp tasted really fishy. The orange chicken had no flavor and the tempura coating was soggy. I will say the crab Rangoon was delicious and the egg rolls were tasty as well. Unfortunately although the guy working there was nice I won't be returning here. My search continues!
