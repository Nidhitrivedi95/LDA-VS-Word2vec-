zKJ4KcZAfTNBIM7OvkVv3A A delicious Chinese restaurant that is somewhat puzzling, since it is owned by the same people who run the Li Wah restaurant in the same building... and has overlapping menus, and sometimes, it even seems like the food comes from the same kitchen!
The food can be authentic or it can be disgusting, very hit or miss. Some of the items did not taste fresh. Maybe this is the place where frozen leftovers from Li Wah get reheated and served? The sweet and sour tofu was obviously very Americanized-style, excessively sweet and glazed in layers of thick sauce, worse than even some take-out places. But the mildly sweet tofu pudding was nice. 
The interior of this place is nice, although somewhat incongruous with the large screen TVs in one corner having ESPN on and the other corner with a Taiwanese soap drama.
Overall, this place is not bad, but has potential in improving the quality of the food.
