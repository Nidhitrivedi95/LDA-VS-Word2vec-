The bad: We got their a few minutes after they opened, and the table we sat at was dirty. That means it had not been cleaned since (at least) the day before. I looked around and other tables were dirty as well. My mom asked for a rag to clean the table, and the employee didn't even offer to clean it...he literally handed the wash rag to her, and she had to clean our table! 

Also, since were dining in, I think our food should have come in something a little more sturdy than the styrofoam to-go packages their take-out comes in. 


The ugly: The bathroom. Just gross. My husband had to hover our toddler over the toilet so as not to touch the disgusting filth on the toilet and in the bathroom. 

There were tons of boxes piled high that weren't broken down; they were in the dining area and completely visible to anybody who walked in.
