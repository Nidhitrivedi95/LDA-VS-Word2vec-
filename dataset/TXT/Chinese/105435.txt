kWbCj-QDpzV2MieHMrEICw I come here a lot for lunch, who can believe a buffet that has plenty of pork, fried chicken wings, even fish is at Lunchtime for only $5.95?
And there is soup too. 
I love the fact you can just walk in and sit anywhere, or even just start grabbing a plate sit down and the staff will quickly ask you what your drink is.
It gets a little busy at lunch but seating is no problem.
The place seems clean, and I hope the kitchen is good too.
The little TV's can be loud at times, but no matter--I like to sit by the window.
 You can do take out as well if you don't sit down.
It's a little easy to miss even though it's on 7th Ave. If you are going North on 7th Ave. right between Indian School and Camelback right after the bends you will see a big yellow and red sign on the right hand side just before the canal crossover.
