TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ I had the sweet and sour chicken, and I asked for fried rice instead of steamed rice... didn't happen. I walked into the place and it was busy. The one gentlemen in front of me had a mix up with his order, and one sir was unpleasantly waiting for his order. So I told the cashier working that I wasn't in a hurry. When I brought my food home I was hoping they didn't mess up my order, and they did. Steamed rice instead of fried, it didn't really taste like chicken but, "how was I to tell".  All in all I would not go here again, I have had better Chinese food.
