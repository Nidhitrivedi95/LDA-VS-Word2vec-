x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg Updating my review for this restaurant.  Was back here on a Friday night and was surprised that parking was plentiful and the restaurant was not packed.  So it was a nice evening for a meal (my mom's birthday).  Service was excellent and the food was, once again, very good.  I was so glad that the place was not crowded with people and the noise level was to a minimal.
