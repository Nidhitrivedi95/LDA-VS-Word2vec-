bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg What a great experience!!!  This is somewhere that I will go back and recommend to others.  My best friend and I came here for dinner and our service was spot on.  We made an reservation and we were greeted promptly at the door, seated immediately and it got better from there.  Neither of us had been here before so we were not sure how everything worked and our sever was patient and took us through the menu.  Also, we were clearly not in a hurry and we were not rushed.  Very nice wine and drink selection and we both liked everything we had.  Try the dim sum - we had pork belly bites, beef tartare, and confit chicken wings and we loved every bite.  We also had the short ribs and duck confit small plates.  I had the poached halibut and it was perfect.  My friend had the roasted pork ramen, again, perfect.  And make sure to save room for coffee and dessert.  A great time.  I am sure this is not the place for everyone though.  The menu is smaller and they do not have the largest selection.  But the menu is online; check it out before you go.  Also, price does not scare me.  I have lived in a lot of places and I think people from Pittsburgh forget how affordable the city is.  I read a lot of reviews that it is overpriced. I am not afraid of a $20+ entrée.  I will be back, and I am excited to come back!
