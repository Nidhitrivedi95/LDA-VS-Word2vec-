zkU-WMio8g6dpRJ2Y2xqvQ I went for weekday dim sum and the food quality is definitely there. 
$1.50 /pp tea charge. The tea is actually decent. (oolong and po lei)

My only apprehension is that portions are small vs price; it's up to you to decide whether or not the added quality is worth it. But definitely give this place a try. 

I can confidently say that all the ordered food items were tasty and no missteps.
BBQ pork bun - I judge a restaurant by this dish. 4.5 stars. 
Goose web, pomelo skin and beancurd - tasty but... small portion
steamed chiu chow dumpling
steamed taro (cake?)
Shrimp spring roll wrapped in rice noodle - tasty play on 'ja leung' (dough stick wrapped in rice noodle)
Mango shrimp roll - this was pretty good. nice crunch from the tempura like batter
Meat Rice dumpling
