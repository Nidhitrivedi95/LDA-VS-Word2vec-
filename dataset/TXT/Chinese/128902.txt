PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Hands down, some the best dim sum I've ever had! The food was absolutely delicious, an amazing blend of fresh flavors that dazzled my taste buds. The restaurant has both traditional push carts and a counter where you can choose from an array of delicious made-to-order items. Customer service was great and the owners are super friendly. Too bad I don't live in Vegas, otherwise I'd be eating here regularly!
