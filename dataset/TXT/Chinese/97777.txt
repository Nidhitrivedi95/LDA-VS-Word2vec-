JQrh2cmndqRKwTpVveHPDg My Friends and I like coming here for the peking duck and with a group of 6 we can order two orders. There is a pricier one and a cheaper one, we do one of each, mostly because the pricier one is more photogenic. It has more of the side dishes but really isn't necessary because we all just like the basic style of eating our peking duck. Wraps, Duck, hoisin sauce and onions, done! The rest of the duck we do the soup option, this soup is super flavourful. 

The signature sliced boiled fish in chili oil is also quite good if you like the Sichuan pepper that is really numbing. The sprouts soak up all the flavour, but I find the fish won't be too spicy. It looks more frightening than it is for people who don't eat too spicy, just try it! 

They have a rice in the rice cooker, and you pour sauce in and it is definitely a crowd favourite. It is also very filling in case you have friends who have bottomless pits for stomachs. 

They also have a member system, you pay for the membership and they price items with the normal price and member pricing right on the menu. It is worth it if you plan to come often and with groups. 

Service is usually pretty good. It can get hectic here so make reservations.
