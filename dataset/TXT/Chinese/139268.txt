qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA Ate here last Friday night as the sun was going down on the outside patio and I have to say, it was a lovely meal from start to finish. Maybe it was the company. ;) Our waiter was responsive (maybe too responsive with the drink refills ?) and helped us custom design our favorite desert just the way we like it. That chocolate dome is freaking amazing. So rich! We both shared the desert and made it a little more than half way through before admitting defeat.
