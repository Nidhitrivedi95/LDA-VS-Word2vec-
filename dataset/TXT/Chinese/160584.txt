u9iy3hyA9HpETKi9qns__A This review comes a little late due to other circumstances beyond my control. Being from Seattle and my home town Singapore, Asian food is a must where ever I go. I think I ate at this restaurant twice (and a to go order) when I was there visiting my sis in Scotland. Their service was great and their food as close as you can get to Singapore/Malaysian cuisine. Delicious! I will eat here again when I visit my sister next year but until then, stay awesome and warm you guys! Lots of foodie love from Palm Springs (Indian Wells) California! J
