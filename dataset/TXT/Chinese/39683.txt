aWu1homxB6lciXU6-ZlpSQ Came here for dinner, and tried their combos for $5.99

I got the roasted chicken leg, and my fiance got the crispy chicken combo.

The popcorn chicken was tasty. The roasted chicken was fall off the bone and tasted great!

Service was fast, you get to pick 3 sides to come with your meal. Serving size is pretty fair, and the combo comes with a drink which is great. It's a good deal.

Over-all a pretty solid Taiwanese place. Personally, I prefer the roasted chicken leg over the popcorn chicken.

I will come back again to try more of their combos.
