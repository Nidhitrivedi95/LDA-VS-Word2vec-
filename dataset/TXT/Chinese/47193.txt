Service: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Recommend: obviously the ramen dishes
What to expect: Toronto has many Japanese ramen places, which has egg and rich soup. Chinese ramen is lighter, and you could try with beef, lamb, or different variety.

I went to this place for a meetup lunch event. I had some ramen back in China, this place is pretty good, more like a non-fancy warm-your-stomach home-cooked ramen.
I had ramen with beef and sour cabbage, which I really liked. The sour cabbage gives extra favours.
The waitress is pretty friendly and the place is considered to be clean in Chinatown.
I would probably come back again with my ramen-enthusiastic friends.
