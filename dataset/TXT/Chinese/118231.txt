NKYirjjTpzezUi4Rhj64bA Came in for pho.  Not sure if we happen to get the bottom of the pot or something but it was way too salty.  And I'm not saying that cuz I'm older and that I complain everything's too salty.  I verified this with the young person beside me that the pho broth is indeed way too salty.  I should have asked for some boiled chicken to dip in it.
