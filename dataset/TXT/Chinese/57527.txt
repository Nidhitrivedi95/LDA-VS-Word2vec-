Satay has a clean and cozy ambiance to it when you walk in. I came with a big group and unfortunately that probably contributed to my overall experience here. We attempted to wait for  everyone's dishes to come out but that was a bad idea. All of our food got cold because it took a good 50 min for everyone's dishes to come out after the first person getting theirs. Eventually we stopped waiting but all those who waited already had cold dishes in front of them.

Aside from that, my food and the flavors itself was not really anything out of the ordinary. I ordered chicken pad thai, a pretty basic and popular dish that really cant go wrong. Mine came out pretty bland unfortunately. I don't really see myself coming back here on my next visit unless its for happy hour or something.
