kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A Cute little place, place was packed so I had high hopes.  Wrong.  Started with the Mongolian pancakes....took one bite and had about 3 tablespoons of grease spilled out onto my plate.  Yuck! Next we had the pork/mushroom noodles, some sort of knife sliced beef soup and a chow mien.  All were just about  inedible!  So salty I can't even describe it!   Oh and FYI...no refills on the tea.
