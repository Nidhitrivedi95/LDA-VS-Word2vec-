SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ I've been to this asian fusion resturant a couple of times and I love that they are not your everyday Chinese or Japanese resturant.  They do have your favorite flavors done in new creative ways.
The last time I was there I had the Green Chili Curry Macaroni and Cheese off of their limited March Noodle Month Menu.  It was creamy and cheesy with some red pepper and chicken but definitely packed some heat.  It was not something you would find any where else and I highly recommend you try it before it's gone.  My dinner companion had the Tom Kha Gai soup.  It was delicious with a coconut base, green curry with mushroom, chicken, lime and Thai basil.
Our waiter was great, very helpful.  We were seated on the patio and started to get a little chilled, so he lit the patio heater right away.
