pdy6EAcJvZks1hKogxOj6Q This place was recommended by a co-worker when first moved to Phoenix. 
At one point I was going there 2 times a week. Food is EXCELLENT considering the prices. It's inexpensive, quick, and delicious.
I recommend the ASU Devil Chicken... Their stir fried veggies are good too. I have not had anything that was not good. Their crab puffs are really good. A bit on the sweet side but I am not complaining.
