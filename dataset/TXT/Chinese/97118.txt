JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw I had this noodle joint bookmarked in my archives courtesy of local yelp associates Norm K., Nicole S., Philip T. & Stefany V.  We were coming back from a hike in Red Rock and wanted to grab a late lunch (off of the strip), and a quick scan of bookmarks led us to Shang Artisan Noodle.  Here's the bullet point skinny on this restaurant:

Situated in a strip mall
Logistically on the small side (small tables and a counter)
Casual dining  
Very good customer service
Every time I looked the way of our server, Liliana, she came to our table
The food was served fast
Meals seem value priced
Food for two (including an app and drinks) was $28
I had the pork rib noodle soup with hand pulled noodles, which was tasty
I'm no noddle expert, but I'm a fan of Shang Artisan Noodle
