rEAFZFziiOWxSLsOLohccQ Based on the reviews on Yelp, we tried this tonight as take out.  The calamari salad was excellent and very different.  We loved our vegetables with scallops.  We will definitely be back.  As good as it gets in the west valley and NOT a chain.  Hard to find something that is not a chain out here but to find one that is good, is wonderful.
