YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g Went to Luckee for a Sunday brunch. The selection is great between traditional dim sum items and the ones they've modified with that Susur Lee touch. The environment is great with prompt service and a traditional dim sum cart coming around with off the menu items. May be disappointing if you are craving that traditional flavour for all items, but their ingredients are definitely better than your typical Chinatown restaurant. Would definitely recommend shrimp cheung fun and deep fried black pepper beef bao, both had fantastic texture and tasted amazing.
