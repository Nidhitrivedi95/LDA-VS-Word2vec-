0c6PQILCLwRZ8FIB4AEsGw I have been to this place multiple times and I am honestly not a fan. This isn't a traditional Chinese restaurant, of course, but at least make an effort to make it taste like food. I ordered a large tray of chow mein. As we were eating, I had happen to find a random rubber band in the noodles ... Mhmm. Also, the food is a little too oily. Anyway, at least the servers are patient and kind when taking orders. Just my opinion.
