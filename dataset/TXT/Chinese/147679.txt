SbwUKzeMlSZs-mQt0lOGQw This place has good quality dim sum that uses more higher end ingredients than other dim sum places. I believe this place is associated with Casa Imperial on Warden - as the dishes are similar.

There usually isn't a wait on the weekends if you come before 10:30am. They don't do the set prices before 11a.m. here. All dim sum range from $4 to $10 - depending on what you order. 

This place is on the pricer side when it comes to other dim sum places but you can taste the quality.

One dish that is my favourite is the fried bean curd roll, wrapped in rice noodles. You don't see this dish often and Casa Victoria does this dish very well. Other notables includes the glutinous rice pouch wrapped in a leaf, the preserved egg congee and the siu mai. 

The service isn't as great as Casa Imperial but you can't really expect a lot from Chinese Places. 

For a group of 5 - we spent approx. $80 for about 13 dishes so this place is pricer than most.
