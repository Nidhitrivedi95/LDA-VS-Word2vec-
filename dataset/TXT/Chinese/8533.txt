1h8aXynUKXUJM6Q4ZXcwyQ We enjoyed a Mother's Day feast at China One.  We were a party of 8 and every dish was a standout.  As previously reviewed, the Eggplant Dumplings are wonderful.  Chicken Teriyaki was surrounded by steamed broccoli, lovely Green Curry, Pad Tai, Egg Foo Young (large and plump)---all were outstanding.  This is a restaurant worth a special trip.  If traveling on the Turnpike, it is very close to the Butler exit.
