WUiDaFQRZ8wKYGLvmjFjAw Ew. Honestly. This is the first time I've gotten a to-go order from a buffet (I was working), so I don't know if it's normal to charge by weight and include the price of the box, but I thought that was strange to pay for the container my food was in. Also, there were two girls working up front and one of them had an attitude with my friend who was with me and had me wait AFTER she ran my card to see if the new girl rung our orders correctly... My friend was happy with her food, but I pretty much did not like one single thing I tried and I put about ten different things in my box. Yuck.
