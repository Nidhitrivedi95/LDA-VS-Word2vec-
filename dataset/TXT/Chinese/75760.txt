fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA Honestly, when you eat here you have to look at it in a perspective that it is a dim sum place. Though, my thoughts were that I could of eaten somewhere better with a lower price and not that long of a wait. We waited 45 minutes for a table, though the dumplings were good but you can find a place similar (aka Asian legend). The chicken fried rice was really salty and was not worth the price. The chicken was rubbery.The sweet and sour pork chop was good but the portion was too small but for almost $14 is too much. The soup dumplings and fried dumplings taste exactly like the ones at Asian legend but there more expensive at Ding Tai Fung (this is where you have to look at it at the other perspective in which this place is specifically for dim sum which makes it expensive).
