csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA We were really excited to try Noodletasia because of the VARIETY on the menu. The issue with "fusion" restaurants is that they don't specialize in a particular cuisine. Some fusion restaurants are good and some are bad. 

My service was not horrible BUT the food was totally bland. I ordered Chicken Ramen and my friend ordered the Yaki Udon Chicken. I felt like the Ramen was something I could have made at home. It was like they bought a pack of 99 cents pack of noodles from Walmart and served it. The broth was not flavorful, it tasted like water. As for the Yaki Udon the noodles were fine but the chicken tasted like it came straight from the refrigerator. 

I hate to give this place a crappy review but it's definitely not the place you want to eat. If you're completely okay with bland and "western-ized" food then have a seat. I hate for people to think that this is how these noodle dishes should taste.
