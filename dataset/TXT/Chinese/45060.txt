BNeS_hZfmdQWsqewj-LuDA This place used to be called "China Star".  It is under new ownership but the restaurant has not been renamed on the door yet.  They said it won't happen for another 2 weeks or so.  Till that happens, it is going to be the old name with old menu.  You can either wait 2 weeks for things to settle or just ask for the new menu like I did.  Just don't get confused by the door sign.

I had conflicting reviews from my friends about this place so I decided to check this out myself.  From yelp, I also learned that they do both Taiwanese and Szechuan food.  (just to clarify, Szechuan is the southwestern part of china known for their spicy food, and Taiwan is the eastern-not-so-part-of-china).  

We tried both the Szechuan and Taiwanese dishes.  And I am looking forward to their new Taiwanese menu.  

Boiling beef (Szechuan) - the beef was soft and done right.  But the sauce was nothing but salty and spicy.  it is supposed to be more complex than that.  and to be honest there are better Szechuan restaurants in squirrel hill area. (3/5)

Taiwanese beef noodle: (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=6yQcm5wONjI9M9cCg_o8ZA) one of the best in town. (5/5)

Taiwan chicken nuggets (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=NLq9ud9hNAw-QnFpv7V3aw)  crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  I think it is thigh meat not breast meat, which would be a plus. but i am not 100% sure. (4/5)

Taiwan pork rice (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=4LUy7n-J7Ca9jZE44QF_hg)  it is really really good. but rather small.  I have heard they do lunch box / set dinner version too, hopefully those will be bigger. (5/5)

Zhangcha duck.  The biggest surprise of the night.  Crispy skin and fat enough duck.  (6/5)

There were few more dishes too. and free dessert (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=k8IU71im9pTAWFiiSEVz8g)

overall, I am looking forward to this place and certainly will be back again.  Just wish them best of luck, as their location is not ideal.  I won't be coming if I do not drive.  hopefully, they will do well in this Uber generation.

final verdict: best Chinese food in Ross township if not north of Allegheny
