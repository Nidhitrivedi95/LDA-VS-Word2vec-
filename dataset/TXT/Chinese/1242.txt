-juOL0eJC6kvf5RLEjoPvA Out of all 3 Kam Fung locations, this is by far my favourite because of the quality and freshness of the food, the attentiveness of the wait staff and the timely service. 

This location is quite large, perfect to accommodate large groups, even weddings. They are busiest on Saturday nights around 7-8ish, so I would suggest Friday nights between 6-8. 

Being creatures of habit, we normally order one crab claw for me (OMGGG SO DELICIOUS!!) and Danny orders spring rolls (he's allergic to seafood, so he doesn't get to partake in the yummy deep-fried crab claw indulgence). For our mains, we get chicken fried rice (with soy sauce, very very important), chicken chow mein, and beef and chinese broccoli. So, so, so good. Every dish we try is always super good; so far, we've had the pepper chicken and crispy spinach (one of my ultimate faves), crispy chicken, beef and chinese broccoli, chicken chow mein, chow fun with black bean sauce, lemon chicken, general tao, chicken fried rice, crab claws, spring rolls.. I'm sure there are more, but I'm just torturing myself at this point with the trip down memoery lane! 

What makes the meal that much better though, is the tapioka soup that is served for dessert. Normally they will either bring you orange slices or banana with chocolate sauce and fortune cookies unless you ask for the tapioka soup. There are 2 variations, one hot and one cold, and sometimes they have a sweet lentil soup. All are yummmmm. Definitely worth the trip over the bridge for you "island"ers.
