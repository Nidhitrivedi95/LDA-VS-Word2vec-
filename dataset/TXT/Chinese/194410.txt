zfiSQ1dl3vTJ-og96eqXGA I can't believe how good this place is! We only order delivery from here and every time, it's been perfect! I like that when I order the Mongolian beef very spicy, it's actually spicy! The vegetables are not soggy, in fact crispy from being fresh! They give you SO many crab puffs! The price is super fair. I really enjoy their add of fried rice and add on lo mien noodles. I honestly can't complain about one thing and I can't believe this is delivery Chinese food! I never thought it would be possible to give 5 stars to a Chinese delivery place, you've proven me wrong. Good job guys!
