csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA I took my family to Noodletasia after reading the reviews on Yelp. I was sorely disappointed.

The decor is nice, the service friendly and prompt, but the food was horrible. We started with Crab Rangoon which was burnt. The dipping sauce they provided was sweet and sour, no better than what you would get at Panda Express.

For dinner we ordered a variety of entrees. Two of my kids ordered Pho which was tolerable. The shrimp in the Honey and Walnut shrimp were crispy, which was nice, but the sauce was SOOO thick. It was like sweetened mayo. The salmon nigiri was possibly the worst I have ever had. It tasted like it had just come out of a plastic bag. My oldest daughter ordered a crunchy roll which I didn't try, but she only ate half because it was soggy. The beef in the beef chow fun tasted good, but the noodles were over cooked and mushy. Honestly, there was very little that was positive about the food. I may be spoiled because I travel a lot and currently live in San Diego where the food is infinitely better, but even my kids thought the dinner was sub-par.

We did order the mochi ice cream for dessert and I will say that the mochi was pretty dang good. We had mango, strawberry, chocolate and red bean. All were very good. Overall, this was a VERY SLIGHT step above Panda Express (except the mochi). With tip it was almost $80 for the 5 of us and none of us felt satisfied (again, except the mochi). So . . .  it's a great place for dessert . . .
