zSkm2XpNdA_8Ze0pC7HVhA Expensive small dishes. This place is waiting for bankruptcy. I'm here on sat 6pm to 9pm. Empty!!!! only one other large party no one else there. and this is a massive restaurant - fine chinese dining. Everything stingy. Dishes are half the size of standard dish. and twice the price. i admit though, it is gd quality, but def not worth the price for what you get. 
they also forgot a dish, which came after our large meal, which didn't fit. it's like getting the appetizer after dessert.
also b/c we were in the small party rooms, it was freezing. no heat in there at all. (except for a small fan heater)
