JQrh2cmndqRKwTpVveHPDg This review might be a little favorably biased.
A few co workers brought me out for dinner and picked a place they knew I wanted to try, so I was in good spirit before we even got there.
Nothing that I experienced lessened the mood at all.
The place is.. elegant and tasteful.  Servers were pleasant, but I don't think our main server spoke any english.  Probably a good thing one of the party was from China.
We had the duck of course and a few other dishes I do not know the names of.  Something with bacon and some kind of spicy crispy vegetable?   Chicken with eggplant, rice and the Dayali pear.  Got the pears because of reviews here, no one really wanted a pear but when I explained that they were not actually pears but a red bean pastry I got some foodie cred.  So thanks for that Yelp.
Everything was great, I didn't have to pay and after the bill was paid we received a offer of a free duck on our next visit.  Great night.
