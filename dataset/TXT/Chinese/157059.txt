TSGBM2z5BTeJvYQAznz8Fg The food is really Good, when they bring it out . Waited and waited for some wontons for the wonton soup, but gave up after about 45 minutes.
Sushi was nice and fresh and the chefs seemed to keep up. 
The crab legs were way too salty, like they were boiled with a pound of salt.
Our waitress was very inattentive and rarely came by to pick up empty plates or refill drinks.
For the price you pay, they should never run out of anything. I would still recommend a visit as the quality of the food is excellent and the place is very clean. 
The owners need to pay attention and address these simple issues before it gets any worse and the word spreads.
