I probably visit more than I should simply because the food at the price it cost is very hard to beat.

Me and my buddy always order either the orange beef or general tao chicken with either chicken fried rice(with orange beef) or the yung chau( I think that's how it's spelled) rice. It's quite hard to tell the difference between the beef and the chicken from the outside appearance but the beef has a tougher texture when you start chewing it as opposed to the chicken. The yung chau rice has a nice combination of carrots, chopped omelet pieces, shrimp, ham and green peas so it looks very colorful and the rice itself has a yellow hue to it, though it could be the lighting(I tend to go there at night). I haven't gotten around to experimenting with other items on the menu simply because I've been hooked on the 4 or so items me and my friend selected.

The place itself is pretty...pretty bad. The dine-in section is pretty small, but I like that they give you a pitcher of water and you are free to serve yourself as opposed to having to wait on the waiter/ress having to bring you water. Other wise it's what you would expect a busy chinese dive/restaurant would be.
