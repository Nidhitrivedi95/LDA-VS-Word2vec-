nplCF1hjAn948EMAaJAazA I've been here many times, and enjoyed the ramen. I live across the street, and being that it's Victoria day, I wanted to sit down, and just have some beers. The waitress told me that I couldn't just drink beer. I look around the tables, and 2 of the three are just people drinking beer. I point this out, and say "how come they can but I can't?" She replied with "these are old customers" I say "well I'm an old customer, I've eaten noodles from here countless times" I even recommended the place to friends , and had taken them there, also my girlfriend, and mother I've taken there for Ramen. Yet she just gave me a blank stare, and wouldn't serve me. Not to mention, she was being very rude about the whole thing. I'm a nice person, and I feel like I was treated unfairly. I won't be getting food here ever again.
