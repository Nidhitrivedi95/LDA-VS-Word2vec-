UHVeLqYpNLJp5mw_vnQnRQ I don't know why but their attitude towards customers seems like depends on where you come from. Though we come from LA, the blue T-shirt waiter may thinks we are some Chinese tourists who cannot complain about their service nor give them a negative Yelp review and gives us the most annoying attitude the whole time. 
The food is just ok, definitely not worth the high price. Save your money and go somewhere else to eat some decent Chinese dishes. The overpriced food and the way they treated their customers justify why they have such a low rating.

We will NEVER EVER come back to this awful place.
