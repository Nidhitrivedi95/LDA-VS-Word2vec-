xEIqG7Rq8ydAT9LxCVBOOg I've had the food a couple of times with my significant other and their family. I was not impressed both times. This last time, my boyfriend got me take out sushi, I know that sushi is meant to be enjoyed in a restaurant and not out of a plastic container. He told me got some sort of crazy or spicy tuna. The tuna was subpar and all that came in the roll was the tuna and avocado....which is kind of pointless, not even crabmeat or cucumber base. 
The most disapproving point of the sushi was this bright orange thick paste on top of it. It was almost like thick mayo sriacha paste with tempura flakes on top. It was disgusting. Never again.
