tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw Ordered take out on a Friday night. The order was ready within 10 minutes. Thought we were off to a great start, but the bland fried rice with a few sad, shriveled peas and carrots, and no egg (!), proved otherwise. The texture was off, almost rubbery. The sesame chicken, which was featured in reviews, didn't seem particularly high quality and also lacked flavor. The egg rolls were "meh" rolls. At least the fortune cookie would be a saving grace, right? I took one bite and was disappointed. How does one eff up a fortune cookie? *shakes head* If MSG is a magic flavor enhancing sauce, they clearly don't use it. After a few gross bites I decided it was not worth the calories (cheat meal: fail) and threw it away.
