We didn't get our water refilled once. The food was good, but we started getting a headache due to us not getting any water and feeling super dehydrated. We even slurped up the ice to give them a signal that we wanted more water. We finally  got water after we paid and got our cards back. The food was good, but customers service is always what matters the most.
