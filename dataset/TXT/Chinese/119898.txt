NYMUlUYYEb3H0nKsauj-yw I've ordered a few things from this place. The sushi is hands down very good. Not the best prices in town. but good. I've had udon stir fry noodles and fried rice. The udon was edible, not the most flavor. The worse was the chicken fried rice. They us fried chicken pieces like nuggets and no vegetables, no sauce, not even a pinch of salt. I wanted to give them 3.5 star. There is no 1/2 option. Go for the sushi, possibly the udon noodles. Stay away from the fried rice. The upstairs dining is rather pleasant. Small space, but plenty of condiments and complimentary cold water.
