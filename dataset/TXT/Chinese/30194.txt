97V91GSG-OQvrvOc9GXoGA Rough, real rough. Had to talk the lady through the pick up order. Ok, maybe she's having a bad day, is rattled and has language differences. Then we get there she has our food in hand but instead of handing it over she puts it down walks 8ft over to the register where we are and we pay. She doesn't tell us it's our food. We're waiting and waiting. She asks can I help you? Oh so the bag you set away from us is our food? Alright. I get home and the spring rolls are instead deep fried egg rolls. The steamed pot stickers are bad. The dough is falling apart, wet and taste off. Wonton soup fine, egg rolls subpar. It's only a 9 dollar meal but why is everything so wrong with it?
