taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg I've been here three times for the dumplings, and have never, ever, ever been anything less than completely satisfied (as well as stuffed to my ears). The ambiance is non-existent, but the staff do their job well, and the price is very right. However, based on my limited experience, you'd best steer clear of the soups. 

Come with dumpling-shaped intentions, and you will be rewarded well.
