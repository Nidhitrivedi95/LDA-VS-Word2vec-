hx-oJMNnweYqE5ybU8aiSg I was really hesitant yesterday to try out this place. Made me step back and move my feet forward then step back again just because I am not familiar with it but I have this goal to try out every food places as much as I can so why not go for it and experience it. Overall, I was kinda impressed!! There was a lot of food selection and everything I got was really good except for the crab legs which I am not really a fan of it so it was okay for me. Servers were really attentive and the price is right!!!
