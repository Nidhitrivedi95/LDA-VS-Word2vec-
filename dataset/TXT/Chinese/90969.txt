Firstly or waitress was hard to be found when needed, slow, not very friendly and overall not horrible but not good either.  We had to ask other staff in a nearly empty restaurant to help us.

The food.  Well I ordered the pad thai, it's a fair amount of bland food.  It just didn't have a lot of flavor, from the chicken to the noodles - nothing.  The peanuts were the only saving grace of the dish.  I also shared a pairing of meats including ribs and duck.  The duck was a little dry but fairly good.  The ribs though good hardly had enough meat.  So it was pretty ok.  The white rice was good . . . .

Of course it's expensive, it's Vegas but the quality of food and service did not match the prices.
