mZde8M2gs5popxzKOvCo5w Why is this place still open? Gave it another try yesterday( hoping it had gotten better) 6 on a Sat. night and the place is empty. I'm the only customer! Should have been a sign..
 Waitress was nice. Ordered the Singapore noodles. Pointed out to the waitress that there were only 3 tiny shrimp and maybe 4 tiny pieces chicken in the whole dish. For 9.95  a total ripoff! I want this neighborhood place to be good but after so many horrible meals, never again!
