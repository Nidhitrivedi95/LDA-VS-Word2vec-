It was around 8pm on a Saturday... we were  basically the last customer waiting to be seated. Not sure if they are low staff at this location or the service is just slow here. The only dish we ordered that we didn't enjoy is the shredded pork noodle which has no taste to it. The soup wasn't hot enough and noodle wasn't cooked enough. In general, glad to find this restaurant by Canada's Wonderland.... after a long day walk, good food in out tummy before bed time. 

Total of 8 dishes came about $90 for 4 of us.
