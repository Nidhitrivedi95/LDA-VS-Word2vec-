OIw3415Pgh2_5eNPCiIN8A Kind of meh food overall. Nothing special. They do have pan Asian, so if you want a bit of selection you get it, but none of it is terribly good. It's definitely decent, but if you're used to great dim sum, great teriyaki great sushi, or great Korean food, this is middle of the road on all fronts.
