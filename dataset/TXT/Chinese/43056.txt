beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw First time here for a date night out with my husband and what a fun and delicious experience from beginning to end! Xiao Xiao was a delight, very attentive and hospitable the entire time. We will definitely be back and with friends! We love soup and this hot spot...hit the spot!
