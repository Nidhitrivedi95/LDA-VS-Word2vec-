2jx_SaBzvIdIwul4JoY9IA Based off the reviews my coworkers and I decided to come here because we wanted authentic Chinese food. I got the chicken with veggies, everything was covered with white clear gooey sauce. My egg roll was wet, everything looked like a big gooey mess. The chicken looked boiled and not appealing. I literally had to throw it away I couldn't even try it. My workers all felt the same and we all agreed we wouldn't come back. I'd skip this place and go to Panda Express.
