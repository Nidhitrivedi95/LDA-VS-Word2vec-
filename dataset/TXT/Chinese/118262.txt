My friend and I went there a couple times and the first time my friend  was told by the maager that he could no longer have anymore crawfish after several trips to the crawfish dish. A year passed and we thought we'd give them one last shot.  This time they WOULDN'T refill the crawfish when it was gone.  We had went up there 3 times to fill up our tray and I guess they thought that was enough and told us NO WE WON'T REFILL THE CRAWFISH even after we asked nicely.  Whatever happened to ALL YOU CAN EAT? Well we found a better place that actually seasoned their crawfish with a spicy flavor and it is delicious! We go there almost every other weekend and get to eat ALL WE CAN EAT CRAWFISH! This new place had better service and better crawfish. I guess one good thing came out of this - we found a better place with better crawfish.
