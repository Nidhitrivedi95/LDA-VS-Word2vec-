WBlYp-nmLiBLp7VjP1FJFg My adult daughter and I had lunch here last January; this will be my first meal stop when I return to Las Vegas area in August.  I can hardly wait.  Neither of us is Asian but we dine on Asian food more often than on any other ethnic variety.  I am an octo-generian who has been eating Asian food since I was first introduced to solid food as a baby.  My parents liked it that much. I live in an area of California in which many, many Asians live.  Walk along any street and there is some sort of Asian restaurant behind every door or two that you pass. I know most of them. So....I feel qualified to comment on the food here.  It is as good as I have had in fine, expensive Chinese or pan-Asian restaurants in the USA or abroad.  As another reviewer commented, it is light, well seasoned, and authentic. The variety of offerings is amazing. For those whose exposure to Chinese food has been at a small town "chop suey" joint or one of the "one main dish plus chow mein or rice" chains, try to stretch your taste buds and learn what good Chinese (and some other Asian) food has to offer.  You'll never go back to "chow mein and cashew chicken" as a meal again.
