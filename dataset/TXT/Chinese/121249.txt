O7_rXHN_-cFp0TgiMaNulw The new menu is disappointing. My wife and I have been coming regularly for over a year: the food is always fantastic, and the owners are great. However, they recently changed their menu, getting rid of the #1 reason we come here: soup dumplings! Our server said they were so popular that the kitchen couldn't keep up with the orders...so they replaced their distinctive soup dumplings with regular gyoza (nothing special). Every time we came here, most tables ordered the soup dumplings, so I'm baffled by this. They also changed their sushi menu and got rid of our favorite rolls--the new speciality rolls are underwhelming. Old menu was 5 stars. We will be back when they bring back soup dumplings!
