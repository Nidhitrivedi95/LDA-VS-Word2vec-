CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw ...late night hunger, didn't want to go upstairs to order room service and didn't want the snack place again...the other open choice was this place...hidden in the back of the games and behind the bar that I've passed by for 25 years and never seen...
First impression as we walk up to it is, wow a line? Really? But since short on options, we stood in that line...
Place is very old and unkept...see the pictures...I understand there is a line to service quickly but you can clean before you take in more guests...Bellagio has let go of it's fine service of yesteryears...
We were sat by the back bar/counter...employees were sneaking food/eating at back food prep area...sneaking a piece of steamed white bun in her mouth while backwards...
Food was good...but will make the walk upstairs and order room service next time vs being witness to this specific operation...sorry!
