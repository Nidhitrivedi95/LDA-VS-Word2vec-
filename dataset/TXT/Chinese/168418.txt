vraKC3CB9KSDCxYX0q3gWA Ugh!  This W Sunset Rd. location was nothing like the Eastern location!  We ordered spicey tuna rolls & wasabi tuna rolls & egg rolls.  There was nothing good about any of them!  They don't even know how to roll the damn rolls!!!!!  The sushi rolls fell apart...there was very little tuna and just thick rice!  The absolute worst tuna rolls I've ever had anywhere!  I asked the manager if this is really how they serve them....he said "Well....they're learning how to roll them".  Instead of saying...well no...that isn't correct...let me have some new ones made for you!  I said it's ALL RICE AND HARDLY ANY TUNA AT ALL!  He said...well...I guess thats how they make them.  I was stunned at his stupid response!  So....$30 later....we left and got a pizza to take home!  Place was pathetic!  Save your money...and drive to the Eastern location.  There's no comparison to this location.  Management is a joke at Sunset location!
