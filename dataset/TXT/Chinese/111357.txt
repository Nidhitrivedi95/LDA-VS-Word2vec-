M9fOuiesoUSaouOqNQ3U2w I love crappy Chinese food.  I don't mean that it's bad quality or anything.  Having lived on the East Coast a few years, I miss the little Chinese restaurants - tiny little places, nothing fancy, inexpensive, that serve up good sized portions of Chinese food.  I have no idea what authentic is.  What I do know, is what tastes good.

I've lived half a mile (at most) from this place for a few years and have always wanted to try it.  Wife isn't a fan of Chinese food, so I just never got around to it.  Finally tried it last weekend and was very happy.

Very nondescript looking place, nothing special on the inside, though it did appear clean (at least from the front where I was standing).  The guy who took my order (and who I assume also served me when I went to pick up) was very nice.  

I had the Kung Pao chicken, which to me seems like a very generic meal - something that is a good measuring stick on which to judge Chinese restaurants (like ordering Pad Thai at a Thai restaurant...I always try that first).  

The egg drop soup was quite nice as well -- pretty thick, but very simple, very tasty.

I should be clear - it's nothing fancy.  It's not out of this world amazing.  It is good.  It is inexpensive.  It is a pretty decent portion size.  It was *exactly* what I wanted.  

I'll be back...next step is to convince the wife to try something from here.
