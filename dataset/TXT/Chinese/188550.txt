yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA the best after hours PHO place in VEGAS!!!!

I had the Pho Thai and it was amazing!!!
ha ha the Kalbi was awesome too.
I've never eaten at a place that cuts the Kalbi off of the bone.  That definitely made me want to go back!
Of course don't forget the spring rolls! They were awesome..

I really only eat a few things when I go to a Vietnamese restaurant. So from what I had I loved!
