aS4t4ee3xqQXgNHNxi9gAA **Abbreviated version: Food is good, but don't order delivery unless you want to be charged a $2 fee for it, wait a ridiculously long time, only to get soggy crab Rangoon and lukewarm food.


My boyfriend and I have ordered delivery from this restraunt several times before (partially due to ease of ordering, also due to lack of delivery for this type of food in our area). The fare is basically what you'd expect. Nothing mind-blowingy good, but good food at a fair price. The Crab Rangoon are delicious, and so is the roast pork and broccoli. The fried dumplings are also pretty tasty as well, although a bit too oily for my tastes.

My primary issue is with the delivery services. When I order delivery it's to save time and convienience. The restraunt is 6 minutes drive away, and when I ordered last night my food came late and it took over an hour to get a single entree and an appetizer. I was also charged a $2 fee for delivery that was automatically added to the bill.

 To make matters worse the food was barely lukewarm. The crab Rangoon I had ordered had been sitting or steaming in their bag for so long they were no longer crispy. For the time it took to get my delivery I could have driven to the restaurant, ordered my food, ate it and gone out for ice cream and still been back before the the driver got here. It's even more sad that I can order pizzas from a delivery place 20 minutes away and get it faster than from Flaming Wok.

I won't be ordering from this place again anytime soon.
