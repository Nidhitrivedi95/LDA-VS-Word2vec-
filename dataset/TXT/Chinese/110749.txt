lXZvgVmIz-ko1OiCG-VDTw At first I was a bit hesitant about eating here. The name for some reason reminded me of deer horn and what kind of food does a "Deer Garden" serve anyways?

Once inside though I discovered that DGS is actually a pretty popular chain serving up big bowls of noodles and clay pot dishes. It's confusing but enticing menu lets you choose your own adventure with a variety of sides, broth, and noodles you pick from. I went with the Szechuan spicy soup, big noodles, brisket, luncheon meat (spam), and brisket. 

The result was........ SPICY and really good. Think Neoguri but in a hearty fish broth and way better noodles. It was hard to put down but when I finally did I had enough left for a meal the next day. I also tried some of my friends Hong Kong won ton soup but it paled compared to my garlicky spicy bowl. The only downside to the meal was the stringy brisket which carried the added sin of being a bit flavorless. 

I'd come back to Deer Garden just for this tear-causing broth but the other dishes on the menu look quite appetizing as well. One of the better chains out there, though on their website all their other chains seem to be in Canada.

What Kay said below is pretty much what the service is like - pretty non-existent. (Some  asian restaurants have those wireless call bells but here you have to wave em down ^^")
