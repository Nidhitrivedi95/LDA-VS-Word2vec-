SlQNMsVEOSxN-ciIn93LOw I recently hosted our school musical's cast party at the House of Leng. They allowed us the upstairs area for our guests and had the table nicely assembled in rows so the kids could sit in groups. They also had a cake table set up for up for the cake we brought in. I asked for little cake plates and they were very obliging. My husband and I ordered soup to start and the Pork Dumplings. All of which was delicious. For dinner we shared the Sesame Chicken (it was huge, family style portions) and white rice. We were so pleased. After dinner the staff was very attentive to cleaning up our tables and gave us our after dinner Fortune Cookies. 
I applaud the staff for handling such a large group with ease. I did not hear one family complain or want for anything. 
We will certainly come back to House of Leng for Lunch, Dinner or Large group parties!
