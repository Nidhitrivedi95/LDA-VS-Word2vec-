rsQAS-k7GldsJm7UAtVyYA I've been coming here for years, literally grew up with this place and it's still the #1 pho restaurant in my books. And you know it's authentic when it's located in a sketchy plaza and the restaurant is blasting Vietnamese music.

I always order their bun with grilled pork and spring rolls. But today I felt like pho. I ordered their pho with well done beef and beef tendons. The broth was flavourful, and had a good amount of beef and tendons. Their small is a good size for lunch and only costs around $5. 

Note* no customer service here. You write down your order and when you pay, you have to go up to the front.
