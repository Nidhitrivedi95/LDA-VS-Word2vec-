lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA Low reviews were right. Ordered the pad Thai and requested EXTRA spicy. Told them to get happy in the kitchen because I would not send it back if it were too hot. The flavor was awful almost like a burnt taste like the oil was old. And NOOOOOOOO heat at all. Spicy is comfort food for me. There was nothing there at all. The service was good so that is why I give a two. For the food, it would be a zero. I love pad thai so I know what it is supposed to taste like and I have a special heat named after me back home so spice is not an issue. This was just mild and awful. Good portions. Just wish the food was good enough to not leave a plate full of food...didn't want a box and now I am going to find a burger because I am still hungry
