yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Me and la familia ate here 3 times over my 3 nights stay over christmas ( i think i wont be missing pho for a good couple of months). I lovee the pho soup. And i heard the entrees are pretty damn good too, especially the clams and oysters. The only reasons for the 4 stars are the service and the ventilation. I always come out smelling like pho, which i dont like. I like my hair to smell flowery, u know?
