For $23.95 before tax, we got 2 orders of soup, 4 fried wontons, 2 egg rolls, 2 good sized main dishes, 2 cartons of white rice, and 1 carton of chicken fried rice. I also got an order of egg foo young, which was so tasty! Because we spent over $25, we also got a free order of California sushi rolls. They are quick with deliveries and the driver has been super nice both times we've ordered. We will definitely continue to order from there!
