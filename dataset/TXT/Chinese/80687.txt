GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g I'm not suprised to see Fin's current ranking of 3.5 stars.  Fine dining Chinese restaurants are at a severe disadvantage.  I'll get to that a little later.  First to the food:

Appeteizer - Shrimp & Scallop Lettuce Wrap 
Entrees - Braised Sea Bass, Tofu & Shredded Pork
                 Beef Tenderloin in Black Pepper Sauce
                 String-Fried String Beans with Spicy XO Sauce
                 Stewed E-Fu Noodle with enoki mushroom and sliced chicken

The food was excellent.  I really enjoyed the Beef Tenderloin which was perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  The Lettuce Wraps had great texture and was a perfect small bite for 3 to share.  The Sea Bass also had a great flavor and any tofu bowl is tasty.  The Stewed E Fu noodles were a little bit over sauced but still yummy.

The bill came out to about 55-60 per person.  That's definitely expensive for Chinese.  But I don't think you can argue that food here is bad.  

Basically what you're paying for is the service and decor.  Let's face it - You don't go to a chinese restaurant to get good service.  Sometimes the service you receive is outright rude.  It's not a stereotype - it's the truth and I'm Chinese. 

This place is beautiful and the service is akin to a fine dining establishment.

But a fine dining chinese restaurant will never be able to stand on its legs when compared to fine dining Italian, French, and other cuisines.  If you can chop and stir fry 80% of the entrees in minutes, it's hard to argue ---  Fine dining Chinese is at a disadvantage.  

It's like meeting a girl Sally who is a solid 7.  You then meet her younger sister who is the cream of the crop - a 9.5.  Sally is pretty tasty.  She represents fine dining chinese.  Her younger, hotter sister represents the other cuisines.
