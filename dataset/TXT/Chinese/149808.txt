sQFpfRs1Flcw3evCdI2wpA Great pho! Tried their seafood pho (calamari, crab meat, mussels, and scallops) and it was delicious. 

Yummy appetizers include spicy calamari and shrimp dumplings 

Don't let the bowl size deceive you!! It may look small but it can pack a hell of a lotta broth and noodles!

Recommend :) make sure to try some of their non-pho dishes!
