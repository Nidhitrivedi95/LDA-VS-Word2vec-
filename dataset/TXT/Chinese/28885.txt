8xPmlVJy2o6x0J04CBpEMQ Went to this place after seeing pictures of the egg waffle pizza. I ended up ordering the hawaiian egg waffle pizza and it was sooooo delicious! It is a very unique twist on pizza and egg waffle.
After just ordering the egg waffle pizza, I decided to try the coconut egg waffle and green tea ice cream. The coconut egg waffle was very special as it had actual coconut flakes inside. This experience was just so great that I came back the next day to try the hong kong milk tea thai rolled ice cream. It was presented in such a cute way with a umbrella and sprinkles. The ice cream was so rich in flavour and super creamy.
To add on, the couple there is very sweet and nice! :)
Looking forward into going again!!!
