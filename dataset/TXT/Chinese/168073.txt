VKNwgZGroTNHcPqgRtmcpA I like PF Chang restaurants.  This wasn't the best experience I've had there, though.  The food was very average; nothing to write home about.  The service was decent, only because it was a ghost town on a Saturday night.  ....very average, not like most experiences I've had with this chain.
