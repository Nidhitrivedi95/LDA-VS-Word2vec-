I ordered the pot stickers and fried rice, both were excellent! They make their own dumpling dough fresh and you can watch them make the dumplings. The fresh dough as opposed to the frozen kind that most places use makes a huge difference. The dough is fluffy, flavorful, and moist. The fried rice was made to order so it was fresh and had lots of eggs which I loved. Most Chinese places make the fried rice in large batches so it sits under a heat lamp drying out. The fried rice isn't covered in soy sauce either. It's white not brown. 

Service is overly friendly, multiple people greeted me to make sure I was taken care of.  This is not a fast food Chinese place, it's a sit down restaurant where you can expect good, fresh food, made to order, made in a clean environment unlike the places in Chinatown which are full of roaches .  

There are a few misspellings on the menu, but that's how you know it's real Chinese food, made by real Chinese people.
