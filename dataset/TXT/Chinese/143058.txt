rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g This is my new FAVORITE Chinese  food place. Very affordable and very consistent in food quality and service. Located in the Lee Lee's Asian Market Center, I notice many Asian families at this restaurant .  I believe I may be addicted to their Assorted Wonton soup, filled with pork, shrimp, chicken, veggies and lots of meaty won ton dumplings. I ask them to make spicy for me and they accommodate . 
Moo-shu (sp?) pork is also one of my favorite dishes here. They also have a Take out deli with prepared to-go items. I am always very pleased when I dine here at Phoenix Palace. Not too fancy, very friendly. Clean.
