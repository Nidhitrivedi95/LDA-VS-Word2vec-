7toYPf5ZAjCkEuwaMPtDwQ I'm pretty sure today is the last time Im getting food from this place. It used to be pretty good food but the last three times have been a disappointment that I was hoping would change. Tonight I ordered a chicken dish that was supposed to be served with broccoli and a spicy sauce. Instead, I got the same mix of crinkle cut carrots, water chestnuts, onions, and broccoli that is served with every other dish in a bland and not at all spicy sauce. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked the third time right before they gave it to me and was awful. The customer service is nonexistent and the only good thing about this the place is the speed, but that's probably because they only throw together reheated ingredients in one of four combinations anyway. I know this place has a great following, and I used to be in that group, but I'm done. If you want decent food, seek elsewhere.
