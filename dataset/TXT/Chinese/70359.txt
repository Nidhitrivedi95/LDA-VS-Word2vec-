F3xksTtZUfanOcLQqJn0eQ Before marrying a Taiwanese chef I used to love eastern food in this country but have now found 99% of it to be absolute rubbish compared to the real thing.


 We went recently for the dim sum and found it easily the best eastern style food we have eaten in this country. Nearly as good as some of the dim sum we have had in Shanghai.


 We checked out the buffet and will definitely be avoiding it, looks like the normal mass produced junk you find at these kind of places.
