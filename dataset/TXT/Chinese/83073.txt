hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q I would give it a 6 if they let me. I have been waiting for them to open and they finally did. My husband and I went in the other day. The place was packed. I don't know how  people decided on price but you pay about $10 to $11 for a noodle soup which I guess it is kind of standard here in Pittsburgh. I had Won ton noodle. It took a little longer. The wonton noodle was an average but their beef soup noodle was a A+ and
it is also faster. We will be back to try their steam dumpling. The Roman bar across the street has definitely been impacted by this Everyday noodle's grand opening.
