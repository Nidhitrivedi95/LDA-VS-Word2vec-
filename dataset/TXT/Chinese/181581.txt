xEHTmRGyoj6y8m2qY50opw Was running some errands and decided to get takeout from this place for dinner. The restaurant itself is pretty clean and open. The lady that took my order was very friendly and helpful. She offered me a glass of water which is always nice. I asked what she recommended for a chicken stir fry dish and she said the chicken and vegetables was good. So I ordered that (with additional spice) and duck fried rice. The stir fry was OK, really nothing special. I prefer anything from Panda Express or Pei Wei over it.. But...the duck fried rice was amazing! I'm sure the other fried rice options are amazing as well. I will try another one of their dishes along with an order of their delicious fried rice to make a final verdict.
