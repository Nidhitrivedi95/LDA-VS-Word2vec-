trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ Five of us - three adults and two kids - had an amazing meal at Pearl Diver tonight.  Since we are sharers we all sampled all the dishes.  We started with a dozen really fresh oysters and a very tasty clam chowder.  Two of us split a hamburger with smoked bacon and cheese which was perfectly cooked.  The accompanying green salad was fresh with great vegetable additions and was expertly dressed. One of us had Chicken Kiev which was juicy and herby and buttery.  The kids had fish and chips - perfectly cooked chips, very flaky fish, and a great coleslaw.  For dessert we shared a creme brule, a sticky toffee pudding, and an apple crumble - delicious.  I also had one of their bottles of oyster beer - dark brown and delicious.  The ambience was nice - wooden booths with a strip of marble tile down the centre and church pews with plenty of room around the table.  The service was superb.  Next time I'm in Toronto I will definitely return.
