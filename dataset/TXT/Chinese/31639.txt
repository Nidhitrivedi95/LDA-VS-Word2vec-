9rzfGwR--QUGn7BZJdm-Sw We dined here last night for Chinese New Year. I was very hesitant to go to Tremendous as I have been avoiding it for years. I've had some less than pleasant dim sum experiences and I've always found it quite dirty.

I will say, last night the food was pretty good. Came out hot and fresh, in large portions. We unfortunately ordered a "Dinner for 6" for 6 people. Just don't. It is way too much food. That dinner came with 6 dishes, 2 fried rice, large soup, 6 spring rolls and dessert. The value is amazing, but just stick with a "Dinner for 4". I now have Chinese food for days in my fridge.

Notable yummy dishes were the spinach with garlic and tofu and meat sauce. The fried rice was lacklustre, very oily yet not fried. It was confusing.

Despite the food being a pleasant surprise, it is still a dirty place. The glasses given to us were entirely too dirty to even consider drinking from. I waited until I got home to hydrate.
