vMpJzMFst_9GP4boeqWIRg I used to go to the Thornhill location quite a bit. Now my family and I go to this location as it's much closer to us. I really like this congee queen as it's newer so the interior is cleaner and it's a bit more spacious and allows for more customers. My family and I arrived around 6:30 on a Sunday evening and we had to wait about 10 mins for a seat. We got fried rice, lobster, pork chops, green beans and tofu. All the dishes are usually consistent in taste and pretty good. The fried rice we usually have is the chef fried rice. We decided to try the Empress fried rice. To be honest I didn't really like it but I can see why it's so popular. The green onion and ginger lobster was delicious, the pork chops were okay, and the green beans were my favourite. I also had a Hong Kong milk tea which is really good here, it tastes like a true HK tea compared to the other ones. The service is always good here as there are tons of servers and you can always flag one down easily. I would recommend this location!
