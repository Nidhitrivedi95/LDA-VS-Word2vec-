CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw For being in the Bellagio, the dishes were very sub-par.

I live in the Bay Area, so I do speak with bias - I can easily find the same quality dish for half the price, within walking distance from my apartment in Berkeley. 

Some of the dishes were bland. Overall, the food was mediocre. 
The price is reasonable - for Vegas.
