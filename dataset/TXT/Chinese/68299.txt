eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ When it is a late night dinner, both my husband and I know there is only one place we will be ordering from.  Thai Cuisine has some of the most amazing Asian food,  my favorite is the pineapple rice, and the pot stickers.  My husband likes anything really hot, and their chicken wings.  You must try the place if you haven't already.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

 Note*  Do not order lunch, it came cold, and without the soup they advertise.  The lunch combo's tasted like it came from  an all you can eat buffet !  LUNCH NEVER AGAIN RIP OFF AFTER THIS IT WILL BE AWHILE BEFORE I RETURN FOR DINNER!
