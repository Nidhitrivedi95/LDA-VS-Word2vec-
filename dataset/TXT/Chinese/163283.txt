UPSzbM6D2SkarWAINq1I9A Tay Do is a tiny little run-down Vietnamese joint on the corner of Stumph and Snow. It is likely that if you aren't looking for it then you'll probably miss it. The shopping center is also quite dingy and when I walked in Tay Do I began to get a bit scared by the lack of customers patronizing the joint. It also left a lot to be desired from first sight. 

But, fortunately this is one of those "don't judge a book by its cover" type of restaurants. Although it certainly isn't the best Pho I've had, I can vouch for the fact that it is still quite good. A good hot bowl of Pho is like medicine for your soul and this place filled that gap for me.

I personally am a fan of the Pho Ga, but many things on the menu are good. Most of them need some additional cilantro, lime or sarachi, but all of those things are available, so you'll be more than happy with the meal. 

The only thing I was not overly impressed with were the Spring Rolls. Although I am a huge fan of mound and mounds of cilantro in my food, these over did it by a bit. 

However, spring rolls aside, the food is great and the staff are very friendly. Take a gamble and go visit.

NOTE: they only accept credit cards on orders over $10 so if you get nothing but a bowl of Pho, you better bring cash.
