ZYyi0opV_ivODZ8bU--7Xg Probably the most well known Chinese restaurant in Montreal, patrons consistently rave about the place.  Open late late, this is often where famished clubbers head when the bars start to close down.  The food is cheap and the service is swift, but it's not fine dining, the tablecloths are disposable after all.

Think of classic Chinese food from the 80s, assorted vegetables drowning in a lumpy MSG laden sauce. At 3am after a night of heavy drinking it's the perfect meal, but on a day-to-day basis I find their style of food a bit heavy.

Le Maison VIP is really great for what they are. If you are in the mood for old-school Western style Chinese food, or the party is dying down late one night and the munchies are taking hold there isn't a better place to be.
