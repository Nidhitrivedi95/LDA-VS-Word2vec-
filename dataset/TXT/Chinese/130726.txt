pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Super fresh fish.  Had the Sake / hamachi / hotate  nigiri.  All of it was really good.  Had the Neo Tokyo roll, super good too.  My faves were still probably the Nigiri.  Pricey.  Nigiri comes in singles...   but so good.  Great service, waiter kept coming back to ask if I needed anything.
