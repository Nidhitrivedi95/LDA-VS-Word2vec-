rwKJHC-DE2aLTZiS_xFy7g Good food- definitely a yes.

I ordered tofu&squid skewer both were seasoned the same.. And squid was so small for $2.50 . rip off 

Salty~ high sodium = high blood pressure  yes!!

Service : so-so ( seeing how they were hellabusy, noone really noticed us ..) Also don't like how they judge your looks and assume you speak the same language as them... Constantly kept speaking to us in mandarin even though we told them we don't understand!! [This is why I am giving them  -1star] 

Other than that i will probably be back to try more noodles and different sides ~
