BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ I was impressed with this place!  I just moved back to Pittsburgh after living in LA for a while, so I definitely appreciate good Asian food, which is hard to find in Pittsburgh.  The food here was delicious!  We started with some sushi appetizers and shared a few different entrees, which were all great!  The atmosphere was great!  I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu and hang out here!  Definitely recommend!
