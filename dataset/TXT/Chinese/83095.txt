Then I saw how long the line was and thought "OH this place is going to be good!"

First being the soup dumplings!
They really should have a diagram on how to eat these little morsels. I was presented with a bamboo steamer with dumplings, a side of ginger and vinegar, and a soup spoon. Okay? Luckily my friend who was with me showed me how to eat them. It was slightly embarrassing but enlightening. Google it if you are unsure how. The flavor is mellow yet delicious. The combination of ginger, vinegar, and soup gives this appetizer that great Umami taste!  Just don't wait too long to eat them or else they will dry out.

Braised Beef Soup Noodles:
The soup was very good and flavorful. The beef has a lot of tendons in it (not my favorite type of beef) but overall good. You have the option of getting Rice or flour noodles (wide or thin).  I like the flour noodles best. The rice noodles are light and thin; breaks apart easily. The flour noodles are more dense. It all depends on your preference.

Oxtail Soup Noodles:
I LOVE OXTAIL! Just sad that the oxtail they serve was small. But it sufficed my oxtail needs. You know it's cooked well when it falls off the bone. That's all I have to say about that!

Pork Belly Slider:
Not my favorite. 1) Too large 2) Dry bun 3) dry pork
It would be so much better and presentable if they made several small portions of the slider and served it that way. Or just make a bun instead. The steamed slider should be fluffy, like you are biting into a delicious cloud. Instead it had hard pieces like it was overly steamed. Lastly the pork wasn't that good, it was so dry.

Service/Space:
The service is fast and friendly. No complaints. There are some communal seating by the noodle makers. The restaurant space is very tight yet clean. It reminds me that I am in the city and I like that.

Overall, I love this place. I'm definitely a fan! And can't wait to try more dishes!
