jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg Joyful House serves consistently good food--I tried something different tonight--salt & pepper fried tofu, and pan-fried string-beans with minced pork. I always ask for chili-oil on the side, and theirs is excellent; I used very little this time since the food was already quite piquant. The string-beans were tasty, and the tofu was in crispy cubes on lettuce with sliced jalapeño peppers. Will order both dishes again.
