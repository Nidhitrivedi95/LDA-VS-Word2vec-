t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA 2 words and 2 words only: CRISPY TOFU. Even if you are a meat lover, it will not disappoint! My friend and I ordered Kung Pao Crispy Tofu along with a mixed fried rice, pork dumplings, and crab ragoons. The tofu was by far the best plate. The chunks of tofu are very large, so I'm sure if you would like the cubes to be smaller, you can request it.

If you are hesitant to eating tofu for the first time or eating tofu by itself, I would order a plate with a sauce base. It will help curb the bean taste! 

The menu is quite extensive, so I would look over all the options before deciding. Don't be afraid to go outside your box at Golden Harbor!
