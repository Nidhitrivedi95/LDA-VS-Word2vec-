2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w Went here for lunch at the reccomendation of co-workers, and it was a very pleasant experience.

Ordered the lunch special Orange peel chicken, and asked for no crab puff (I am allergic to shellfish) and the waitress immediately asked if I wanted extra rice or an extra egg roll to make up for it......how many places will do that?

The Orange peel chicken and the rice were delicious.
My only complaint is that the eggroll tasted very generic....other that that, great food, great service, fair prices.

I will visit more to try their other dishes.
