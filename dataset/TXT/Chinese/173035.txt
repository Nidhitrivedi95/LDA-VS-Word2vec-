W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ My husband and I loved the menu this place had in July. We came back in September with reservations to find out they changed the menu. The shrimp tempura was gone, the noodle dish with the dark buttery dark sauce, gone. And what really sent us to the moon is that they went heavy on Cod. They also, cut the menu to nothing. We are VERY disappointed in this place since the menu was great until the place replaced their menu with slim to nothing for options. Most of the dishes are all the same now. Or they have meat in them.
