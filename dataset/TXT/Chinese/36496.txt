Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Rice & Company is a bit overpriced and not the best option to go for Asian food on the Strip/LV area but if you have some food credit and not looking to venture too far from the hotel, Rice & Company isn't a bad choice to shoot for.  

Rice & Company is located on the upper level of Luxor as you head towards the Mandalay Bay Mall connector.  It's a fairly nice restaurant and has a good view of most of the pyramid area.  

Food-wise, you're looking at a standard mix of American Chinese/Japanese cuisine from sushi to entrees like garlic chicken.  I opted for the Mongolian beef to go along with the Yelp vibe which came with white or brown rice.  For one, it's more than enough (probably just enough for two if you both are light eaters) and was alright.  Again, it is fairly Americanized and won't amaze those familiar with the dish.  It's fairly heavy on the sauce too if that's your thing.  The price is probably the most 'eh' part of the experience - $25 for the beef alone (and along with a beer, it came out to be about $40).  Luckily, I had the $20 food credit from Luxor which brought the price down to what it usually should be.  

Service was pretty good with the bartenders being fairly open to chat if you'd like.  The wait to get food was fairly nominal as well.  The restaurant wasn't super busy at 7PM surprisingly on a Friday and the bar was pretty open.  These elements plus the nice look to the area probably brings the score up a tad.  

All-in-all, R&C isn't here to blow your mind or be completely inedible - it's convenient and relatively harmless if you're really hungry (and have the food credit in hand).
