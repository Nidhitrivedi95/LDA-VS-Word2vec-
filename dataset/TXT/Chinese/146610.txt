S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg Had lunch here yesterday, the Strawberry Chicken is AMAZING!! I highly recommend it. The restaurant has been here for a while and you can tell when you walk in. It wasn't too crowded and my group of 4 was able to carry on a conversation without shouting at each other. The service was attentive without being overbearing. I will definitely go back to this place!!
