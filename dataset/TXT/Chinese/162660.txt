uno5w5Zkhwn-yFkJgFuYOw Great little Chinese restaurant near us in Monroeville.  We've dined in, as well as ordered for take-out.   For dining in, it's a good venue for a quick bite.  You won't be dining for the ambiance, just for a good, quick bite to eat.  For take-out, it's quick.

The quality is good, always freshly made.  Service is friendly from a family run operation.  Price is great.  The two of us get two meals plus egg rolls for less than $25.
