Nnr0kZIVlW5sWInOJW9LMQ Meh.  I read all the other reviews before deciding to give this joint a try.  I will give them this: they might be the best Chinese food restaurant in east york...a notoriously under served community where Chinese food is concerned (note to enterprising would-be Chinese food restauranteurs...open here, deliver and make good food...you will have a captive market!).  

The good:
- decent prices 
- quick 
- chicken balls were good

The not-so good:
- ginger beef was bland.  Like really really bland.  
- Singapore noodles had no curry flavour, bland
- fried dumplings,not so fried and bland
- general tao chicken, boring bland and not good 
- lemon chicken was not lemon-y....bland 
- spring rolls.  Flavourless. Like frozen.  Bland.  
- no fortune cookies in the bag!!! Whaaat???

I bet if you just ordered chicken balls and rice it would be just fine.   Not great.  But totally serviceable.  

Now considering some of the other disasters in the neighbourhood - SANDY's at woodbine and danforth, eden on coxwell for example - this place was a welcome upgrade.   But it was not 5 out of 5.  No way.   It was ok.  Just ok.  Not good, not even average (Manchu Wok is average to me). And certainly not 5/5.   

Why can't these places hire a qualified cook and buy decent and fresh ingredients and then make sure they do the service right (like why no delivery??? Isn't that a basic requirement for staying in business as a chinese food joint?).  

Seems an easy formula.
