NKHvmp19c6wrm0dZXcLtmQ Went on Sunday at noon for a snack
Ordered: 
- House Special Black Grass Jelly Mixed
- Taiwanese Style Popcorn Chicken 
- Golden Royal Drink
- Japanese Teriyaki Fries

They didn't have tapioca for my House Special Black Grass Jelly Mixed so instead I substituted it for popping yogurt bubble I would have liked it with tapioca. How could they not have tapioca when they sell bubble tea? 

The one in downtown Toronto provided water once we came in but the one in Mississauga we had to ask for water. 

These four items cost approximately $30. 

Overall I thought it was fine.
