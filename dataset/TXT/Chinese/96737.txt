jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg ok, so I have had my fair share of hot pots in this town and this definitely ranks as one of the BEST... I had the lamb, I would def order extra meat cuz it's kinda light.  I tried the free range chicken, also very good.  Only thing I would do is maybe order the veggies seperate so they don't get too soggy, but good still nonetheless....
Tried the beef tongue BBQ skewer, very salty (need to lighten up on the seasoning) otherwise it would be tasty... I like the sauce bar, so you can make to your liking, all they need is the raw egg!  (dat's how they do it in Shanghai) I got the SPICY but could have gone 1 notch up.... I like it HOTT!  

Also had the watermelon juice....yummmmmmm, so kewl n refreshing but I would have loved to have a BEER to squash the heat..... 

Overall, you likey d hot pot?  Then you gotta likey this spot for hot pot cuz it's called booming mini hot pot spot but there's no dots on the walls... okay now I'm rambling..... 

check it out!

manja!!!!
