PAJlmByrU8zAB3WsXxA30Q Went there because of the high reviews.
From the moment i walked in, the atmosphere and the service were not was i was expecting. Not a single smile, thank you, or your welcome.
Now to mention the below mediocre overly priced food.
Nothing special and nothing worth the price that they charge. If you are ever in the area 10 minutes south of this dump is a cheaper higher quality and more delicious Chinese food restaurant called Sea-Hi.
