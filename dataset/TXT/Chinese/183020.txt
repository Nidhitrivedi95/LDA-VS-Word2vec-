Xl70366GI5Qao-ORQYCofA I've been ordering from this place for a couple months and have always loved the food however the customer service is severely lacking. After tonight I will no longer be ordering from this restaurant. The person taking my order could not get it right, the delivery took a half hour longer than expected, our order was incorrect when we got it and when we called them to tell them what was missing and wrong they said they weren't sure if someone could bring the missing/incorrect items. They will not refund anything but they will give a credit which does nothing since I will not order from them again.
