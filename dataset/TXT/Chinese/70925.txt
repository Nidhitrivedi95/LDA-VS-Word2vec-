fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ I wish we could have experienced this restaurant when it was truly worth a Michelin Star because it definitely would not make the cut today. We stopped by for dinner on a Sunday evening. We made reservations for 6pm and were seated right away upon arrival.

The service is very cordial and the decor is very nice. We were there early in the evening, so I guess the staff felt relaxed. A cook stood outside the kitchen and rubbed his back on a doorway corner like a bear on a tree. Nice.

We ordered the Peking Duck, Mapo Tofu and Cantonese Sausage Rice. The "Peking Duck" is very suspect. I can't say for certain it isn't real Peking Duck, but it certainly did not taste like it. It very much tasted like regular old roast duck. The tofu and the rice were very good, but I would certainly hope so for what they are charging their entrees for.

Basically, you could have a comparable or BETTER tasting Chinese meal at any number of other good Chinese restaurants in town for a quarter of the price. Sure, the decor is very nice, but does that warrant a 300% difference in price? The experience one would like from a former one Michelin Star restaurant just isn't there.
