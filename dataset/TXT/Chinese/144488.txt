RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ I m bummed out, maybe they changed owners because I used to eat here all the time in college five years ago. If you'd ask any college dude at the time what the best thing was for the money, they'd say it's the fried chicken cutlet over rice. I had it tonight and I think they changed the batter and quality of chicken. It was awful, I stopped eating it after one bite and then spiked it in the trash like a football. What a shame, but all good things have to end I guess. I did have Italian village after that, which is a good thing that still hasn't changed. 

I'm not writing a yelp post because of that, that's sort of trivial or I don't really have time to care about it. BUT when the lady there gave me her slight, it sort of hatched very presumptuous thoughts and I wanted to know if I'm wrong about them. So I ordered the cutlets and two bubble teas and for some reason it cost 30 bucks, when it used to be near 20. Anyways she started putting the bubble teas in the bag with hot food, I was like 'hey pleas don't do that can I have another bag for those? She looked at me as if I fked up somehow, like how dare me.. then she pulled out these individual bags made for the bubble tea, got one, then stacked both of them in there. I don't know what to say to that sequence of events, other than it's not worth it..

Maybe the owners switched? Or maybe since they got allot of business using delivery, they don't care about quality, as what happens with allot of Chinese places. Anyways, it's allot of stuff to write. This place sucks now. I hope my friends see this and take note.
