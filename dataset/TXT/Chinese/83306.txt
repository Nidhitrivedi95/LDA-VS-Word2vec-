hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA Definitely better than Buffet Asia.  This might be Chinese food heaven for someone that lives in the boonies but it was just alright for me.  They definitely offer a lot for the price and I happily stuffed myself with as many green veggies/meat combos as possible.  

All the servers were really friendly and were prompt to refill beverages and take away plates.
