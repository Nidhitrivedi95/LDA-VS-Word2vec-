I guess I am now a Vegas regular as this is one of the first places that I add to my itinerary and come to mind when I'm planning my Las Vegas jaunts.  Why not: the owner remember me and knows my name (yes, remembered my name and I don't live anywhere near Vegas and have only visited 2 or 3 times), ALL menu items are great (especially the poached Hainan Chicken Rice), and the service is great!

Chicken, thus the "fowl" is the star of this restaurant.  However, it is also accompanied by fresh and interestingly paired side items and herbs.  This is also the only place that I indulge in iced coffee.  It's great.  I usually get a double shot just so that I have a larger portion.

Now, on to the burger at Fat Choy...
