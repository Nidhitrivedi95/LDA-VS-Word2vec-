osvcl7Fh_J5VwUikh5Vskg I think it would be closer to a 3.5.

I love their wings basket that happily feeds 2-3 as a full meal. I usually opt for the sauceless original flavour that is flavourful and taste just like your childhood hk style cafe afternoon tea offerings.

I also enjoy your wide variety of dinner sets that come with a soup, dinner rolls and tea/coffee. The prices are slightly higher compared to other hk style restaurants by $1-2.5 each, but has larger portions. They have specials for $7.99 and $8.99 before 7pm which are really good deals considering the larger portions. I find their dinner rolls a little crusty if you aren't dipping them in the soup. 

I still strong prefer this old location even with the new and modern one open less than 5mins away.
I find the options and quality much better at the original store. I find many things at the new location bland and the service is much less attentive.
