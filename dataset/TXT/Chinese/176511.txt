wOmtCPiB-xeU-HknjTW4hQ I really didn't want to like this place since they replaced my favorite Chinese place of all time but... They actually won me over. The fried rice is rich in meaty goodness. I love the fact it wasn't served in to go boxes which seems to have become the norm. There wasn't a single dish that did not impress and the service was excellent. I suppose I will be back even though I live pretty far away now.
