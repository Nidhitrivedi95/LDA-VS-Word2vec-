vYzcDDVv4MqPOt46rl2kYg One of my buddies took me here one day.  I've driven past it a few times and thought the name didn't sound like Chinese Food.  So when he suggested it, I was a little skeptical.  Wow...was I wrong.  The food was fantastic!  The restaurant was very clean (cleaner than my kitchen), service was great.  Very much like Pei-Wei in that you seat yourselves and eat with silverware.  The "don't judge a book by it's cover" adage seemed true here.  In this case, the name.  Tried the Orange Chicken, Chow Fun Bowl, Lettuce wraps.  All great.
