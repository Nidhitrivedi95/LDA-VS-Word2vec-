FykLjv4tIq618q8F2pvTKg Don't go here after regular dinner hours... Everything was lukewarm and tasted as though it had been sitting for several hours. I'm pretty sure there were several health code violations. Will not return.

EDIT: For the past five days I have been extremely, violently ill. I'm placing the blame on Krazy Buffet. Holy crap DO NOT GO HERE.
