This was my first time at a Mongolian grill, such as this, and I must say I like it. The concept: you get a bowl and fill it with meat (beef, chicken, turkey) and add veggies. The veggie selection is fresh and respectable, including spinach, water chestnuts, tomatoes, zucchini, mushrooms, and on and on...There's also the odd choice of adding sausage and pepperoni to your bowl. Finally, you add your sauce, you can wing it or they have recommendations. Take your bowl to the counter, and they stir fry it for you and serve it with rice. I saw others eating noodles, so it looks like you can request. 

As mentioned, this was my first time at a place like this. The waitress was super friendly. I grabbed a table and she came out to explain how it all works, then brought my cooked dish to me. Maybe it was because it was my first time, but she came to the table while I was eating offered to let me fill another bowl since my first didn't have a lot in it. Definitely a nice gesture of going above and beyond in customer service. 

The price is $10 for the bowl + $3 for drink at lunch, which gets you 1 bowl. And for dinner, it's $14 + drink for AYCE.
