kWkW6vVePpBox_fKfGgPjQ What can I say about this place that hasn't been said before. I've been here twice and had delicious plates. I tried the Orange Chicken and Sweet & Sour Pork Chops. Both plates had good size chicken pieces, pork with fresh green peppers, onions, carrots and pineapples. To me the Orange Chicken should taste like that. When I ordered the sweet & sour pork chops the waitress came back and said you know its a pok chop. Ummm... Yeah, thats why I orderd it. Imagine country fried steak, thats what the pork chop looked like. My sis let me try one of her Spicy Tuna Sushi, which was spicy, for me.

The environment is very modern, low light settings (gives off an intimate vibe of privacy.), table space will used and the bathroom sinks are cool.
