Z4MvEVylnZPW_vddQc2Ihg Mongolian Grill is a good place to eat with friends or a group.  I have been here for lunch a few times with groups from work and I think they have something for everyone - seafood, veg, different meats, styles and spice.

I think what I like most about this place is that theres many different things you can try - sauces, ingredients, etc and every time it tastes a little different ... now if your boring, i guess your selection will be boring, but eating here gives you an opportunity to eat something a little different and taste the various flavours from Mongolia? 

I think the price for the buffet is a little expensive - $20 per person i think?? but the experience is nice.
