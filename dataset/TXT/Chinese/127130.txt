PAJlmByrU8zAB3WsXxA30Q Here for dinner last night based on Yelp! reviews and a craving for Chinese food.  Since we came for dinner, I can't speak to the dim sum menu.

The dinner menu (at least the English one we were given; not sure if there is another one in Chinese with different listings) was generally straightforward Cantonese food with a section of Szechuan dishes.  

Wonton soup with shrimp had excellent shrimp wonton but suffered a bit from an overly salty and I believe somewhat glutamated broth (I have nothing against the use of glutamate as it is a naturally derived ingredient but those who are allergic should take note).  Egg rolls were excellent, with a very meaty pork and shrimp filling given texture by use of wood ears.  My companions had fried rice and a noodle dish (which the proprietor customized a bit by request) and both were great.   The best, however, was my order of crispy chicken, which was a superb rendition of this Cantonese banquet standard.  The meat was succulent and not rubbery and the skin crisp to the point of separating from the meet.  Also nicely seasoned and no breading or other westernized nonsense.  It was served with the usual shrimp chips (very fresh) and dipping salt and vinegar.  Thankfully, the head was removed.

I would like to try this place again for dim sum.

Service was helpful and considerate and we did not find them slow.

Atmosphere is pleasant but be aware this place is VERY brightly lit.  Not a place for a romantic tete-a-tete or to take a mistress if you are cheating on your wife!
