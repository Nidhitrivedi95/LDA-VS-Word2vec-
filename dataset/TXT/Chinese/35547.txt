AEYNihHmGIjmUciRFo3qwA Atmosphere was decent for a place in a strip mall.  I ordered the Lo Mein off the lunch menu.  Portions were good.  Overall dish had a fishy smell yet there's no fish or shrimp in the dish. Lo Mein was cooked well, good mix of vegetables and Lo Mein.  Lo Mein itself lacked flavor. The order came with Fried Rice which was just terrible, no flavor at all.  Dish was also served with an egg roll, which was actually a vegetable spring roll in a light thin crispy wrapper, probably the best thing on the plate.  

They also charge an upcharge of 50 cents to use credit / debit cards. 

Definitely not the worst place, but if looking for decent Chinese food there's many other places.  If you're in the area of Talking Stick in Scottsdale, I urge you to check out Red House Chinese.
