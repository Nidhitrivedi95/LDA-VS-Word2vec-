IbOrNwCdMTd-eicZ9B2CiA Hotel Stay:
The concierge were very friendly and the hotel is completely renovated downstairs, however the guest rooms are very out of date. I think the hotel is intentionally themed with old fashioned decore. The room did have a strange odor as mentioned by other guests. I thought the bed was comfortable and the bathroom is updated. They informed me they are in the process of renovating the entire hotel. 

Events:
Hosted a large event here. It was incredibly difficult to get a hold of our event contact throughout. Rather than immediately fixing issues (doors locking, missing gluten free meals, room temperatures too cold) someone would go find someone else to do it. 

There are tons of restaurants local to this hotel. Roughly 30 minutes to downtown without traffic.
