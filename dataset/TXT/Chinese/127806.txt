pdy6EAcJvZks1hKogxOj6Q My family and I love this place! We come here every time we want Chinese take out. They have excellent customer service and their food tastes great. We usually get lo mein, orange chicken, white rice, fried rice and beef and broccoli. Better than usually getting Panda Express.
