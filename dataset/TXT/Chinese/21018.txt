And if you want a seat inside, as well as a parking spot, you've got to get there early.  There is no restroom inside, so make sure you arrive prepared.

The food is excellent, but be ready for a larger bill than you might imagine, especially if you opt for some add-ons.  The bao is very good, but this is Sheridan's restaurant so they had better be good!  The service is on-point, and they do a good job of remembering the name you give them when ordering.  They use your name when delivering food to your table, and when you depart the restaurant.  It's a nice touch and makes me feel appreciated.

The specials seem to be the way to order, but the chicken and rice plate is a solid standby.  Stay away on Monday - they're closed!
