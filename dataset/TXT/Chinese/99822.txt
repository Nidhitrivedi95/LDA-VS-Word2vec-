JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA OK I've eaten here for years and never ever had a problem. The food is great and moderately priced for the portions.  Being a family of four (wife, kids and i) we have found that two servings to go is plenty of food to feed us all. My kids are both under 10 and barely eat lol.  During our trip through the buffet line creating our masterpiece bowls, my wife was informed that we had to leave if we were getting our food to go. I simply asked why? She informed me that there's no sharing.  I asked well Is it endless trips to buffet? -She says no. I say so why does it matter, we like to get it to go because we can't eat it all and we will take what's left home. She then told me that by doing that we are RIPPING THE OFF! I Know that this is just an employee speaking there mind without a filter and I assume management wouldn't approve but this definitely upset my wife and made us leary of returning.  

Brings back a saying I've heard: "Don't hate the player, hate the game"

YCS YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR EMPLOYEES TO ENCOURAGE FAMILY'S TO ENJOY THEMSELVES NOT INSULT THEM OVER A FEW DOLLARS. LOYALTY?
