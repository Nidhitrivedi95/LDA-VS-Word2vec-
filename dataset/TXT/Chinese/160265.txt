U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q We visit Caesar's Palace every few years and we usually visit Beijing Noodle No. 9. The restaurant is nicely decorated, the servers are attentive and the food is usually pretty good. But, the hostesses are terrible and they needlessly make you wait 20 or 30 minute for a table even when the restaurant is empty.
