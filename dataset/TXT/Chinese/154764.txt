tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw if i were just rating the service, i would have given 5 stars.  i was VERY impressed.  my folks were visiting, and the three of us were well taken care of.
i just wasn't crazy about the food.  i love chinese food.  i love ordering several plates and sharing.  we ordered two appetizers (both were fairly good) and three entrees (one was excellent, two were "eh.")
perhaps it's really good chinese for phoenix and i've been spoiled having lived in chicago... i dunno... but my parents weren't star-struck either, and they're from minnesota... go figure.  3 stars is my verdict.
