ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ A hole in the wall kinda place. An institution that every goes to when they can't decide what to eat. If it were solely based on efficiency, price and "just to feed my hunger" kind of review then I would say this place is as good as it gets.

I am going to give it 3 stars but before you throw your hands up in disbelief bare in mind that there are plenty of options within walking distance of this place. Yes, it can get cheaper in the food court next door and yes you can get better quality stuff (not necessarily better tasting) next door at Blue Ocean as well. But really for what it's worth and the kind of place this is supposed to be (a no frills, affordable eatery with a ton of options) they have fulfilled their goals.

This is authentically HK fast food as it gets and the quality of the food re-enforces that as well. But since I am a snoob and do look for overachievers... 3 stars it is.
