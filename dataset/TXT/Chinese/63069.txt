DwmAsemahJywywhuqv5J1Q I was actually skeptical coming here. As soon as we went in, I felt the heat since they didn't turn on the AC or turned it on really low. Therefore, I was uncomfortable the whole time. That should have been the first sign! We were served quickly and we ordered a dish of tendon, some veggies and sweet and sour spare ribs. The tendon and the veggies were pretty good! The tendon was spicy and had s ton of flavor. My favorite dish were the veggies! I love garlic and this dish just had lots of it. On the other hand, I was extremely disappointed in the sweet and sour spare ribs. It was seriously not what I thought it would be. The meat was overlooked and I hated the flavor. We quickly dined and left as I was uncomfortable with the environment and did not like the taste of the water. I'm not sure if I feel as the meal was worth the money but you can definitely find other places with better quality.
