5PcW2QipC23t_g71rdCCcw Reliable late night Chinese seafood restaurant.

Usually come here after 11pm but I have also been here before for dinner.

They have specialty seafood every 2 weeks on Fridays -  you have to make RSVP. What I mean are live seafood which is not normally carried.. like exotic clams and fresh exotic fish Asian style.

Expect typical diner quality with their stir-fry.  Usually have live lobsters, eels, bass, and clams in stock.

I'm especially giving props to these two menu items:
Spicy Salted Noodle Fish
BBQ Pigeon


The spicy salted noodle fish is super tasty! Reminds me of fish French fries!!

The BBQ pigeon is also really good! It's perfectly BBQed with nice crispy skin everytime!

Beers are also super cheap here, I think $2.75 or $3 for bottle of domestic.

Great place for fresh seafood and cheap beers on a late-night snack mission!
