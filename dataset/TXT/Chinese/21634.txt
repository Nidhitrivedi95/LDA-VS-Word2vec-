6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q Whenever my extended family stays at the Wynn (more than I'd like to admit...), we always enjoy a meal at Red 8. The Asian food here is really yummy and it's fun to look out the "window" into the Wynn casino.

Last time, I enjoyed one of the most delicious cocktails I'd ever tasted. I ordered fresh watermelon juice with vodka and it was SO good!!! I always fill up on the family-style Asian food too and then head into the Casino to work off the food ;)

Red 8 is accommodating for young children and not as expensive as one would expect of a restaurant in the Wynn.
