CSe9FpalbwGzQcp_h5BVxg This place is the best!! I have several picky eaters in my family and they always get special requests right.  If the request was unclear, they call to clarify before they make it.  I am extremely picky about my chicken (no dark meat, fat or veins) and this is the only Chinese delivery that I don't have to look through it before I eat.  We have ordered many different items and it is always AMAZING!!  They are also quick, polite, and well priced.
