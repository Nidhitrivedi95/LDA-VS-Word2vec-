zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ The ramen here is a fusion style so, if you are looking for a thick, rich broth with the hard boiled egg do not come here. I prefer the traditional style broth so would not return. I have been to the NYC location and preferred that broth which, while it was still fusion, it was a nice change from the usual. We came at 9:30 pm on a Sunday night so there was lots of open seating and service was prompt.
