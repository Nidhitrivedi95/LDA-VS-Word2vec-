vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA One of the best dim sum meals I've ever had!  Arrived 5 minutes after they opened and almost didn't sit down because there was no one else inside.  Nearly tragic.  The service was extremely speedy and efficient.  I was able to get my favorite dim sum dishes (authentic taste) and within 15 minutes the place was packed.
