LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ What do you do when it's 11:30pm and Raku is all booked?  Go to HK Star.  We called them 15mins before they were closing and they accommodated us.  We were the only ones there but we ordered quickly, the food (noodles of beef and chicken) came out fast and flavorful.  It's not gourmet or super authentic but if they were nice enough to let us eat when we were the ONLY ones in the dining room, it's not too bad.  Would definitely go back and try something else.
