VmbvhEXcyr5mdEU-nAJfTw This is my favorite Acupuncture clinic, staff is very professional and caring, they ask questions and do their best to provide the right acupuncture. I have been lifting weights for years and nothing can take my soreness away but acupuncture. I have been to several places and you can tell when is done right. After my session I feel the change on my body as well as in my mind, feeling relaxed, rested, and overall better! I highly recommend this place.
