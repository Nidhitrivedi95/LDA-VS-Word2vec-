uBZjhmmqzIwxdTeIKopCEg I tried out Yu's Cafe today, which is a Saturday. They said the delivery would be 45 mins to an hour and my food arrived in 35 mins. I ordered the wonton soup that had a variety of very fresh vegetables. I have never had wonton soup with red & green peppers but it was still good. 

I got the fried pot stickers which were ok. I have always had steamed but was in the mood for something different, I should have stuck with what I know. I am sure they would have been awesome if they were steamed. I will defiantly try them next time.

I also got a combination dinner of Mongolian Beef which came with an egg roll and fried rice. It was good as well, 

Lastly, I order my husband chicken fried rice since he isn't big on Chinese food and I heard no complaints. 

I have tried a lot of Chinese restaurants in the area and I have to say this will be the only one I order from, from now on!
