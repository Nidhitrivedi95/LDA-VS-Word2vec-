I had the #5 Beef Shank Noodle Soup ($8.95).  It was slices of beef shank, bok choy and noodles.  There were green onions and cilantro as well.  

The broth was surprisingly good.  It was very flavourful and had a very subtle spicy kick to it.  It was not spicy, I mean I would consider it mild, but it had an ever so tiny and fleeting kick to it.

They pull the noodles in front of you when you order and then toss it in hot water.  It's a fun show to watch.  

The noodles were nice and chewy.  The bok choy were nicely cooked.  The beef was super tender, but since it was shank some pieces were a bit too fatty for my liking, but there were some lean pieces too.

I am not usually a fan of food court food, but I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It's a nice change amidst all the usual chains (e.g. Tiki Ming, Kojax, Thai Express, Subway, etc.).
