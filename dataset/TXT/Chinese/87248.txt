hsgRNkXFMCqzO7nPRB3yJQ Cheap Hong Kong style cafe food a few minutes from my home? This place was an easy sell. I've been here twice over the last week with friends and the food is pretty good, cheap, and comes out fast. 
So far my favourite dish was a fried u-don noodle and shredded beef dish. It's huge, has plenty of beef, egg, and bean sprouts, and comes with soup, Hong Kong style tea and dessert. 
These are large portions, so expect some leftovers to take home. Also, it's cash only, so bear that in mind. 
I'll definitely be back again and if I find a couple more good dishes I'll bump my score up a bit.
