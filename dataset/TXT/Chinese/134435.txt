Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g I was super excited to try this restaurant as it came up on Blogto Top Ten hakka restaurants and I needed to get my Hakka on! I ordered a chill chicken fried rice and a Manchurian chicken. It came to $21.50-a bit pricey, yes, but hey! if the quality is worth it, why not? Le sigh..sadly I was disappointed. The Manchurian chicken came in super tiny pieces, each piece was less than half a teaspoon in size, and that was after the coating and saucing. It was practically swimming in the sauce.

The chill chicken fried rice was a decent 4/5. They use basmati rice instead of traditional jasmine rice, and with a good combination of spices, spring onions, and eggs. My only grippe is that the chicken was overcooked so it tasted slightly dry. However, props for them on using white meat instead of just dark meat.  

All in all, after comparing it to other Hakka joints, this place pales in comparison with respect to price point, flavour, and quantity. If you're planning on trekking out here to try this place, I would advise you to drive further to some other places.  Shrugs, maybe their lunches are more reasonable?
