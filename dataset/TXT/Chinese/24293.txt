The organization and wait is horrendous, they seat by who they see first and if you don't speak Chinese you will be last.  We waited an hour before we even saw our first appetizer and it was wrong. 20 minutes later they came back to "double check " our order.  We were told they were out of plates and given the cheapest 1 cent paper plates you've ever seen before, to eat off of.  After an hour and a half of getting the run around and no food yet we got up and left.  I don't even think they noticed.

Definitely a bad place to dine, previous reviews warned me but we took our chances and got what we paid for.
