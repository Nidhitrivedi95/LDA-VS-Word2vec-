6gF-m1csJtckBSJEmIpsTg Am writing this review purely based on the Indo-Chinese dishes I have tried.

This is my favorite place in the recent times and would never get bored of eating here. Do not forget to ask for any specials outside the menu. I strongly recommend the Mike's Chicken and Mike's Paneer(vegetarian) appetizers. I almost have them twice a week and are my favorites. Try the soups and special Darjeeling spicy noodles, feels heaven.

The ambience is pretty decent and the staff are ultra friendly. Their suggestions would never disappoint you and they know their stuff.

Everything is freshly cooked and the chef Michael is an amazingly talented guy.

I would undoubtedly rate 5/5 for this place.
