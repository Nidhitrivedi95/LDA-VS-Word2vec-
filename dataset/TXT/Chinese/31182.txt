9OD0pQ0QYa_7dO-LbOBFZQ I love this HK style bakery since I was young. I visited it very frequently when I lived in downtown. I backed to the bakery recently and they are keep everything good as usual. I love their Teriyaki Chicken Bum, it's so juicy and soft even after one day I heated it up from microwave.  and their bacon green onion Croissant is so amazing!!! Have to try!!!!!
