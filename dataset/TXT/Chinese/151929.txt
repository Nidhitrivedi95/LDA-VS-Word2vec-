First stop was the hibachi station,  and if you are used to a Mongolia grill, it's the same thing, except you don't have much choice of sauces.  It was okay.  The hot crab legs were good.  We came on  Monday night so it was pretty slow.  Perhaps that's why some items looked like they'd been there awhile.  There are a lot of choices, even tacos, fries, wings.  Not much appealed to me.  On to dessert.  The cakes were bland and dry.  The cookies were stale.  The fried biscuits, like malasadas, we're the best thing I tried.  Overall, it was just...meh.  Perhaps if I tried again when they are busy, it will be better.  Table staff was very friendly.
