OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw My husband and I definitely got food poisoning after eating here. We were both sick all night and the next day. We had an assortment of dishes: duck, chow mein, fried rice, dim sum (har gow) and a chicken dish that I cannot recall- maybe general tsaos. It might have just been a bad night but I don't think I could get myself to eat here again.
