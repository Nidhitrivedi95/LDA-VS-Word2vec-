i3jZgPgXPtXbZIjv7obagQ I personally feel the ready-made stuff is legit pretty bad and overpriced. It tastes nothing like Szechuan food! It is more of a typical westernized chinese food made to match the local palate. However...

What I do think is worth ordering the the made to order noodles. You line up on the right side (there are two separate line ups) and you can order the type noodles, either with soup or without, paired with protein and veg. This option tastes much better and you can save a couple of bucks for a latte instead.
