MVBCWXTDtU8C1Qh5mMNSKA We went to Gold Mark Chinese Cuisine for dim sum around lunchtime, and it was quite packed. We were given a table that was too small - but the waitress objected that it would be too complicated to change table. There was a larger table ready 3 meters away and we offered to move all of our plates ourselves, but she kept shaking her head. She finally agreed after we flagged a manager that was passing by. I don't really mind this kind of hiccup. Dim sum parlors are notoriously busy during holidays, and I'm pretty sure she just didn't want other clients to wait extra time because we took their table. 

We ordered a large variety of dishes. Everything came fairly fast and nothing was forgotten. The food was well prepared and good, but nothing outstanding. The preserved egg and pork congee barely contained any meat or egg. On the other hand, the chesnut and pumpkin congee was very popular with my family. Portion sizes were quite good, and although we didn't order that much, everyone was satisfied and full (we were a group of seven). 

Overall good. Would go back, but wouldn't recommend.
