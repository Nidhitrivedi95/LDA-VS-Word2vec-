UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw We haven't been here in awhile. We first noticed that the prices have gone up. Our server was pleasant and had been employed there for some time. He was very informative. We got there around 5:30, ahead of the crowd. 

I went on YELP and checked in and found a coupon for any appetizer so we chose the Coconut Shrimp. It was definitely tasty and the bed of slaw was also appetizing.

I had the Cantonese noodles which I thought were too thick, almost like the Yakisoba noodles. There wasn't that many noodles with the dish I prefer the thinner ones. There was lots of veggies and mixture of meats which overpowered the noodles. We also shared the Hawaiian Macadamia Nut Chicken which had the same ingredients as the noodle dish except for the nuts.
