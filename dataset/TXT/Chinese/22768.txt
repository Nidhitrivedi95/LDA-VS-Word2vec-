6PPoODoXUyMULipVWnpJWw I ordered here once and it was amazing. Delivery guy was wonderful! The second time, the food was just as good! However I forgot to order my free generals with $25 so I called and the lady was insistent to deliver it to us (even though it was our fault). The delivery guy was super fast and he literally pushed my tip away because I tipped him well the first time.  

This place has went above and beyond amazing customer service and the food is just as great!!! I'm so happy to find a delicious Chinese takeout/delivery place with ABSOLUTELY AMAZING customer service! 

I will never eat at another local place. I am in love
