dgIrIkCBiHtAHZ86_-awFQ Came here for dim sum for the first time with my mom on a weekday afternoon.  The whole restaurant was almost at full capacity but we didn't have to wait to get a table.  The dim sum at best was mediocre but majority of all the dim sum were very poor in quality. 

The deep fried shrimp dumpling was fried in very old oil as the colour was very dark, the wrap was very chewy as this was likely from leftovers that was retried to sell. 

Steam pork wrapped with bean curd - this the most disgusting item that day.  The bean curd had a strong rotten taste. 

Deep fried taro with minced pork - was delicious upon first bite but further into the taro there was an odd taste of ammonia. 

Congee - plain and bland with no palatable flavour whatsoever. 

Shrimp dumpling ha gow- the putter wrap fell apart upon attempting to pick up with chopsticks.  Flavour was okay. 

Steam shrimp dumpling with snow pea - this was the best tasting item, it was delicious. 

Steam shrimp rice noodle roll - shrimp was good size and rice noodle roll was good. 

Overall this place for dim sum is very inexpensive but you get what you pay for. As for myself it was a waste of calories and I won't be visiting again.
