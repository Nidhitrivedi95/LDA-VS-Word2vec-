75SBuDApJU5ca9tGC1Pw3Q We stopped here after shopping at the Dollarama next store one evening.

As a non-Chinese, I would probably describe it as a Chinese diner.  Brightly lit, bustling, and attentive and friendly diner style service.  The food was quite good though nothing seemed exceptional.  

Very long menu with lots of combo items.  As other reviewers have noted, the food style is Hong Kong Cantonese fort the most part.
