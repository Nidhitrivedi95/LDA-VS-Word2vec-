Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg Congee Queen is my family's go-to restaurant for congee. The restaurant is spacious with lots of seating and thus I've never had to wait for a table. Service is fast and somewhat friendly for a Chinese restaurant. Some of my favourite dishes are:

Supreme Super Bowl Congee
Fried Turnip Chili Patties
Spice & Pepper Salt Squid

The portions are quite large so watch out when you're ordering!
