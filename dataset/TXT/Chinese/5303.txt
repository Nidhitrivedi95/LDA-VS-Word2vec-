079CV1EE5WLdQqVEVYFeHQ Love this place! I wasn't sure about it the first time, seeing that is in a strip mall, but like the saying goes don't judge a book by it's cover. 
I order the CHICKEN W/ GREEN every time and have not been disappointed. EGG ROLLS are wrapped in thin egg roll paper, spicy, & delicious. MANGO CHICKEN & CLAY POT DISHES are also excellent.
Independent & yummy.
