9g4jaW7IzcuwXg86eJbynw Simply great food.  Service is great and everything was delicious.  We had #10 fried dumplings and the imperial rolls for starters.  General Tao Chicken had a very favorable sauce.  Spicy pork and vegetable soup was excellent but if you want it really spicy just add some of the hot sauce in the container at the table.
