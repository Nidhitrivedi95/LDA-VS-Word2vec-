1PMwRG0uWGxk2hIVEQj62A I've been here 2 times. One time was at regular lunch hours and one time for the early bird special. I'll be a regular here from now on.

This place is more high-end than average. Prices are noticeably more expensive than the low/medium end stuff, but I think it's worth it for the most part. Their early bird special is $3 all sizes but it's for a reduced menu. This is a great deal. At regular prices, it's $3 for small and $1 increment for each size but with their full menu.

What makes this place stand out are 1) They are less oily than most places (on most dishes) 2) They seem to use less MSG 3) They have many unique dishes not found in your standard dim sum place 4) Their service is noticeably better than your average Chinese traditional restaurant.

They have many of your standard dishes like Har Gow and pot rice. To name a few unique dishes, I had red rice roll with vegetables inside, walnut dessert, congee soup with melons and diced pork/shrimp, and many others that are hard to describe in English. A few reviews I read commented about the lack of unique items. This cannot be true. I've tried many places in the GTA and Spring Villa stands out. 

This place gets packed quickly. I came right at 9am for the early bird special and it was ok. If you come at 10am you may have to start waiting.
