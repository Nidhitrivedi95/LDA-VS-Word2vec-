AwmLDzqJ0aMGZTYYoZnxWg Service is great but you will spend a lot of time trying to find the meat in the breading. I got the Sesame Chicken and the breading is so hard it's a good thing I did not get the food to go because I am sure a plastic fork would break trying to stab it. It's unfortunate because the sauce was delicious. The fried rice was better than Pandas and other such places. I think from a flavor standpoint they could have a home run (or at least a triple) if they figure out their breading issues and focus on the actual meat being the hero of the dish.
