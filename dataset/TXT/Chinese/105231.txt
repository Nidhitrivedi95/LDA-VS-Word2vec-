KVGdRDCXOPbcDH_3HC1jfA This is my favorite place for dim sum in the west end - there aren't that many choices but this is way up there even when compared to places in Richmond Hill and Markham. I would say it is almost as good as Lai Wah Heen when you consider that the price is less overall.

I have never been here for dinner so my review is only for their dim sum.  I came here after reading a lot of positive reviews on sites like Chowhound. I was not disappointed! The food is consistently fresh and of good quality. This is not your greasy, cart pushing dim sum restaurant - it is a lot more refined.  It is pricier than your average dim sum but that's because the food is above average. Everything I ordered tasted wonderful and presentation is excellent as well. My favorite dishes are the turnip cakes and the cod pastries. The service is excellent too. 

I love this place! And it's close to me too which makes it even better! After eating here and Lai Wah Heen and Lai Toi Heen, it's hard to go eat at places where they are still pushing around carts or serving greasy cold subpar dim sum.
