fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA Is this the same as the Din Tai Fung in Cali and HK? I'm not sure, but their soup dumplings are to die for and I really really wish they'd open one in MA. Knowing that they make fresh dumplings and seeing them made, makes these little pockets of yum that much better. Chive pies, panfried pork buns, soy milk and fried dough, rice cakes with cabbage and pork, pranfried dumplings, three cups chicken, scallion pancake, dan dan noodles I'm not even sure thats all we ordered. I just kept eating and eating. not too sure about price...gotta love visiting family haha! but I'm sure it was worth every penny :)
