079CV1EE5WLdQqVEVYFeHQ Out of towner swayed by the reviews to try this place out. It was about 7:00 pm and the place was dead. I was the only patron dining in, but watched 5 takeout orders get picked up. Very unassuming and dimly lit with stainless steel tables. The menu didn't really present much and seemed to be a heavily used takeout menu you'd find stuffed in your door. 

I was surprised to see Moo Shu pork on the menu, but chose an egg roll and their Pineapple Beef. Wow. The menu stated it was a spicy dish but I asked for extra spice. The beef was lightly dusted with cornstarch and held the sauce well (it wasn't drowned in sauce, which I prefer). The pineapple was in large chunks and had really excellent sear. It gave you a great flavor without too much sweetness. There were fried slivers of ginger and green onion scattered throughout. The egg roll was short, thick and seemed to have a great spice to it as well. The owner was a very sweet woman.

I told her that I would definitely stop by on my next trip. Great little hole in the wall!
