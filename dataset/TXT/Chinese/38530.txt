AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA My new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas is Veggie house. Servers were very friendly. The atmosphere is nice with lots of feng shui. For a Chinese restaurant it's also extremely clean and well maintained. 

For lunch I ordered the Buddhas delight (Jai), "fish" with tofu and vegetables, and spicy tofu (vegan mapo tofu). Lunch is served with soup and choice of brown or white rice.  Vegans can request the special dishes from Chef
Kenny be made without egg. 

The servings during lunch may seems small but they were just right for me.

There is plenty of parking underground and at the same level of the restaurant on the west side of the center. 

I will definitely returning on my next visit to Las Vegas.
