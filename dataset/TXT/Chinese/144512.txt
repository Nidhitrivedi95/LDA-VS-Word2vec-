RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ I hate to give this place a mediocre review but...here's why.

I used to love this place.  My parents, straight from asia, love this place.  In fact, every time they come to visit, the request we go here.  Pamela's for pancakes, and Rose Tea for dinner.  

It had great Taiwanese/chinese dishes, very authentic, very delicious.  Probably one of the BEST chinese food places in Pgh.  Clean, happy, bright restaurant, with friendly staff.  Oh so slightly expensive for chinese food (most dishes are $10+) but a) its family style so you all share, and b) its way better food than the little shack around the corner.

However, in the past few times I've come, its been...different.  I don't know if its because it's gotten so busy, or if it's changed ownership, or whatnot, the food hasn't been as amazing as it's been before.  Frequently, we get told "Oh that's run out." Um...you ran out of cucumbers at 6pm?  Really?
The food hasn't been as hot, or flavorful, and I found myself more often then not disappointed at the meal. 

So, it's definitely still my go-to place for chinese food in the burgh, but...it's not as amazing as it once was.
