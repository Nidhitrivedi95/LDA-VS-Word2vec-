97V91GSG-OQvrvOc9GXoGA Delicious Taiwanese food, just like in Taiwan!   Very friendly and attentive staff.

Tip - ask for the handmade fried dumplings (<U+624B><U+5DE5><U+714E><U+9903> Shugong jian jio), they're not on the printed menu, just a sign in Chinese on the wall.   Who knows what other secret treasures await!
