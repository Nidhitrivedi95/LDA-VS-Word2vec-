8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ We came in on a Wednesday night and they were so busy. My husband went to check us in and I followed up. When I talked to the guy at almost 8pm (our reservation was for 7:30), he told us it might be still a while as they were still seating people with 7pm reservations! I was furious... For one we had a baby and an elderly couple waiting with us. The reason for making a reservation was so that we would not have to wait. After we were seated, the service was still exceedingly slow. It took so long to get our orders in as we couldn't flag anyone down. My son already threw a tantrum at this point. By then we were ready to give up and just leave. I decided to stay as we were all hungry and I was hoping the food would be good. In the end, food was just ok, not particularly any better than other fine dining Chinese places we have tried. I know food might be better if we ordered differently but after the atrocious service we received, I don't feel like I would ever go back.
