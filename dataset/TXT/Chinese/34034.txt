AbgNPAnuq8X90DUw5FQ2sQ Had a combo with lobster and Peking duck.  Duck was meat,  but there were not enough shells to eat with.  Lobster was fried with Maggi sauce,  a tad on the dry side,  not enough Maggi taste, but presentation was great. Steamed talapia was just right. Sweet and  sour pork was  great,  nice sauce,  not too dry nor too fat.   Not your average red-cough-syrup sweetnsour sauce.  Service was great. Place was spacious and  not  noisy or echoey. No liquor license. The crowd here was considerate too.  I have a pet peeve about  live seafood tanks.  I would rather not have them unless they are clean. Too many  places are hideous looking tanks.  This one was OK. The decor is finished with fixtures with fine lines ever  I usually worry and dust collection or spider habitation.  Haven't seen any so far.  Overall very  clean and pleasant and homey. Not  a place for banquets but good for family dinners and  small group occasions.
