sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg I have been to Totts probably around 12 times and it is definitely at the top of my list.  I definitely recommend their various noodle dishes especially the Singapore Noodles with Chicken and/or Shrimp-the only exception would be the Pad Thai-I have found those noodles to be mushy.   Great value for the money and I like the fact that they are consistent.
