f-ookZOX4pBNldaOHMkJ4A Where to begin. I have been frequenting this particular establishment for many years; since 1995 at least.  Thankfully it hasnt changed much over the decades. Although they updated the appearance of the menu, the selection is essentially the same. The food, similarly, has not changed at all. 

In the old days i used to get the rice box with various meats in it. There was always a wide variety of juicy hanging meats in the window to tempt and entice the passerbys; the duck was always my favorite.  

I have been getting the chinese window meats for many years at many different places, but my heart always goes back to flavour of the chicken & duck at this place. 

Im saddened by the fact that i dont get downtown as much as i used to in the old days, and thusly i dont get to go to this wonderful place anymore. 

Its nice to see its still there, and still open late. I went there with some friends recently at night and the selection of dishes we sampled was as delicious as it always was (Chef Emiril Legasse used to say on his TV show that "Delicious is an under-utilized word" - but it is very appropriate in this instance). 

Its not the fanciest place downtown, but its nice & quaint, and the food is reliable & tasty. I hope it stays around for many more years. 

Incidently, the staff there is still the same (at least partly) now as it was when i first started going there. When i came back to this place after doing my residency in the US, they recognized me immediately and said "hey, where you been"! 

Despite all this, it pains me to not give it 5 stars. Its a 4 star place at best, (on its best day).
