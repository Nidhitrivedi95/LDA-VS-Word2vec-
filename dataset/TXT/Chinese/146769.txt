S6dARuOrrOXd4xSiTHti8g My brother and I went to Chengdu Gourment Christmas day during the evening.  It was nice that they were open during Christmas.  Then again, it seems that most Asian restaurants are open.  For our appetizer, we got the Scallion Pancakes.  It was very good because it was very crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside.  For our main dishes, we got the Spicy Fish Fillet in Flaming Pan and a Pork Belly dish where I can't remember the exact name of it.  They were both excellent.  The Fish Fillet was fried and crispy on the outside, and succulent and juicy on the inside.  The spicy components of dish really put the fillet on another level.  The pork belly dish was great as well and its spiciness also got the pork belly to go to another level.

The service though could be better.  The waiter only went back to our table only once to refill our drinks.  Then even after we were done, we still had to wait 20 minutes to get our check.  We could gave the waiter his attention, but he should have recognized that we were done eating and asked if we wanted our check.  Owners of Chengdu Gourmet, please review with your staff on making sure they give customers the appropriate attention.

That being said, I would definitely come back to try other dishes.
