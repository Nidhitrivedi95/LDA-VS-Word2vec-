l_pR3x7v2mvE3luVdmGuoQ My order is pretty much always the same here: salt & pepper squid, mayo shrimp, and water spinach. They are my faves and I can always count on Orient Kitchen to satisfy those cravings. Other things I've tried are the fried milk (sounds weird, but worth a try, although it might be on the sweeter side for some), pork chop, minced duck (which my boyfriend loves), steamed fish, and barbeque pork. (Sorry for listing generic items; I forget the exact names of some of the dishes.) Everything is average to good. 

There are a lot of negative reviews about the service here and that's definitely understandable. But I doubt it's personal, so I don't think much of it now. I really just come here for the food because they serve some pretty authentic Chinese food and they usually bring it out fairly quickly too.
