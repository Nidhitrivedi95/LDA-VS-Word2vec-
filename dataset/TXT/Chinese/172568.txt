w3RH9W99ZIKvw0Qgibdn4w This place is great for delivery. They were very fast and friendly. The food was excellent and still warm. We had the orange chicken and the the chicken peanut thai. All ingredients were fresh and great flavor. Also the fried rice was just like we like it all very fresh and tasty. We highly recommend this place to everyone.
