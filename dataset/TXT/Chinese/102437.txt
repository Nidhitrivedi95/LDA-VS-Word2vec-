kHZeGxR7zkW0T5Nym0NjCA DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!  The staff are very rude, they do not refill your water, wipe their snot on their sleeves, and speak in Chinese, barley speak the language.  Their fried chicken lemon was frozen in the center, and I found a beetle in my rice!!!!!!  I don't think they truly respect and take pride in owning a business in America.  I will never come back.
