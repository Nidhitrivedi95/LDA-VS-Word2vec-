RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg We've now ordered to go a few times from Tata Bistro and have always been pleasantly surprised - it is now our go-to chinese place because it is leagues above the competition! The portions on the chinese dishes are BIG - very easy to share or have for a couple meals. Some things we've tried that we hadn't had before, like the Dan Dan noodles  which are thick noodles (sort of like udon) with a spicy, delicious ground chicken sauce. We've also and the long beans with pork (a bit greasy but very the beans were SO tasty). Another recent adventurous order was the chow fun combination, which I have avoided at other chinese restaurants because it was never flavorful enough. This chow fun rocked! All the protein was high quality (great shrimp, beef and chicken) - nothing rubbery or tasteless like you find other places. Really delicious. Again, huge portions that became leftovers for a couple days. Also they have really good egg rolls.
