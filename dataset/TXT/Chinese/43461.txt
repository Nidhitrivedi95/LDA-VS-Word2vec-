"...woah.  but i don't get it.  where's the buffet?  why doesn't the air feel heavy with grease?"

trip 2 to the wild ginger.  am i hitting it on off peak times?  or do they just never have a huge crowd here?  and if it's the latter, it's not for the sake of the food.  the food is good.  no, it's not greasy.  nope, it's not a buffet (as my friend joked).  and though it's set a bit farther back from the road than its other munchtastic companions, you can't pass up the wild ginger.  

they have a decent lunch menu, and for half the price you get a huge portion of almost any of the entrees on the menu, plus rice and soup.  i'm normally not a big soup fan, but wild ginger has really great soup.  so far i've only had the egg drop and the won ton, but i think their won ton surpasses any i've had before.

how's that for complimentary?  awwwww snap!

if you've followed my yelpin' in the past, you'll know i'm not a sushi girl.  however, their sushi seems to be a hit with all my fish lovin' friends i have.  one friend just kept ordering more and more and more.  i mean, it can't be bad if he's gonna chow like there's no tomorrow.

the drink menu is pretty big as well, though i would not recommend the green tea martini.  i thought it'd be interestingly amazing.  sadly, it was interestingly and amazingly yacktastic.

big portions, not too expensive, friendly staff.  and never seems to be a crowd.  i'm not sure why.   but i'd check this place out.  their menu is gigantic, so you're bound to find something that doesn't suck.

i have.  twice.  so the odds are so far non-suck- 2.  suck-0. 

that's a better record than any clevo sports teams.

i say that like i keep up with that crap.....
