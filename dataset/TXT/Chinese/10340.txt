1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Fast and super cheap. Big Wong looks pretty questionable but actually turned out surprisingly good.

The menu is short and sweet with maybe a total of 30 items (15 items per side). The prices are ridiculously cheap- everything is around $5-6. The portions aren't very big though, so I would suggest 1-1.5 dishes per person. 

Everything we ordered happened to only be $4.95/entree ($20 total) and was enough for 3 people:
- Shrimp wonton soup with mustard greens- pretty standard, broth on the lighter side
- Dark Meat Hoi Nam Chicken over Special Seasoned Rice- this is pretty much Hainan chicken, which is cold/room temp chicken served with a delicious chicken broth-flavored rice and dipping sauces of soy sauce and oil and mild chili garlic paste, great portion of chicken, would say they could add more rice though
- Fried salt and pepper chicken wings- comes with some fried pieces of jalapeno, maybe 10-12 wings per plate, pretty flavorful and not too much batter
- Authentic curry chicken with 3 roti pancakes- perhaps my favorite dish. This one is Malaysian curry so it's darker and more liquid than Japanese curry. The curry has dark meat chicken and potatoes. The roti that it comes with is delicious and perfect for dipping in the curry.
