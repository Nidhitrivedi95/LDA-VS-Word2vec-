ZlrHrg7jrbO6blqwfa0MkQ I checked this place out yesterday for lunch at the recommendation of a friend and I can say that I was pleased with my visit. The inside is adorable and totally unexpected considering that it's located inside a generic plaza! Yelp says the attire is "casual" but I would recommend trendy/business casual to not feel out of place. The staff was super friendly and it wasn't crowded [so maybe I just missed the lunch rush?]. I read other reviews about bad customer service but I think they mistook an eager/attentive server for rushing. Most Chinese places I've been to are big on pleasing their guests; I think pride+perfection in their work is a huge importance in their culture. If anything my server tried to over refill me on soda [lol] but due to dieting I limit myself to only one soda per day. She even boxed up my leftovers for me, I love when a place does that! Honestly I didn't look over the entire menu because I was craving an orange flavor so I went right for the tangerine chicken with white rice; I wasn't disappointed at all but it could have used just a little more orange flavor (I just prefer it really tangy). Overall the food was yummy, fresh and a very nice portion size= worth the price [note: the best/freshest snow peas I've ever had in a lo mein dish]. It also came out very fast, especially considering that I ordered two dishes... about that: my only critique would be is that they don't allow substituting lo mein noodles for rice via a small up-charge =\ but being it was lunch prices I ordered the vegetable lo mein as well [I won't do that for dinner whenever I come back though].
