5aGYZbjkXpCecz4QH2ZKFg I am not a big fan of buffets, but my 13-yo son adores buffets, especially Chinese food buffets so we frequent Dragon Buffet almost on a monthly basis.  We have tried just about every Chinese Buffet in the area and, with the exception of the expensive (but well worth it) Tin Tin, Dragon Buffet is our favorite.  We have dined there at various days and times and the food is consistently good.  It is also very reasonably priced, since they don't have crab legs.  The restaurant is very clean, the service is very good and the food is always fresh.  Give it a try...you won't be disappointed.
