SZmm3wOx_fcC2rblUVewGA We have spent all day at Eaton centre. We were hungry and craving for dim sum. So we just walked around and found this restaurant. Unexpectedly, the food were so good and delicious. We love the turnip cake, ha kau, siu mai, and fried crab. The price is reasonable. Would love to come back again.
