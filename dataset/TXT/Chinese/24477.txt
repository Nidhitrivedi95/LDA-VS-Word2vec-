6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag was introduced to this place yesterday by friend from the bay. both our standards are pretty high considering we were blessed with homemade dumplings growing up. 

all of their dumplings are made their and all of the ingredients are fresh. how do i know this? i can taste it! ;) the place is smaller than average and has a nice intimate feel. if you came with a large group, you might take up half or all of the floor space. (there are maybe 20 tables) 

the only reason i didn't give them the other star is because their menu was a little limited to authentic chinese food. 

i would definitely go back and i am now on the search to find an even better chinese restaurant. thanks mama!
