spDZkD6cp0JUUm6ghIWHzA Would give this place 0 stars if that were possible. Food sucks, service sucks, the atmosphere as soon as you walk in sucks. Everything sucks about this place. Hopefully it closes down, it's literally an eyesore because I'm reminded of the incredibly terrible one-time service I visited. I'd advise everyone to stay away unless you fancy crap service and food.
