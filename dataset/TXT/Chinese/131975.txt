PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ The name of this place is misleading, in my opinion this isn't a "real" shabu shabu place. The broth had a distinct and overly strong Cajun spice taste, which is not what you think of when you think of the typical clean beef broth used as the base in most shabu shabu places (even if you get the spicy broth, it should be spicy but it should not be changed in flavor by the spices). The papaya salad was bland and flavorless, not spicy, vinegary, or have any "bite". The little Thai style dumplings were better than the shabu shabu sadly, which is why we went there. They had a decent selection of veggies, meats, and sauces but the broth which I was really looking forward to on a cold winter night was disappointing and ruined the meal I was so looking forward to. $53 for two people (without tip)? Not worth it in my opinion. I've always gone to Swish even though it's across town from me, I know it'll be "right" and consistent every time.
