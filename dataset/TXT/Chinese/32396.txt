9Z_6rRy7Tl_C6HIgm7y6FA Great place for good chinese food. Very authentic and well prepared foods. I always ask for more garlic and make it spicy hot! That's just me but they always accommodate me.
Broccoli beef is really good...I would like more vegetables though in their dishes.
The dish I always judge a chinese rest by is War Wonton Soup and theirs is bout the best I have had.
For the combo dinner menu they have the option of getting a small portion of sweet sour pork or chicken for only $2.50 more! Love that!
