W8xPHUqL088jdcmNZyH-eA Really good food!! Extremely impressed with the food we received. The service wasn't great but I didn't go there for the service. The best item we got was the beef roll (no cilantro) and wow was it good. I was so surprised by these dish and the flavors of it!! The pot stickers were next in line. They were perfectly steamed then perfectly pan fried!! The marinated cucumbers were a perfect side to our meal, highly recommend. The only "just ok" dish was the meet pie. The outside was good but the inside was just bland. I will def be back to try some other items!!
