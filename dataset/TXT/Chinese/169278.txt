vsoEZauF4lrADIqCYXySFQ Full disclosure ahead of time: I worked here as a cashier for a few months (October 2012 to February 2013). As one of the only establishments open after 2 AM on campus, it caters to the last call crowd; having been on both sides of the table, literally, this in itself is quite the experience.

As for the food, I would go to Cravings for more complicated dishes, but for staples like spicy chicken fried rice, orange/sesame/General Tso's chicken, Chopstix can't be beat.
