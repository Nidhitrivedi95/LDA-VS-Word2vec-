w3RH9W99ZIKvw0Qgibdn4w Wow I've had very few times where the food was unedible this is one of those places I had Thai pad it was horrible noodles are slimy have ate 4 pieces of shrimp and probably a cup of whole peanuts no flavor at all made my stomach hurt a bro have there sesame chicken that was horrible too will overcooked maybe burn and how do you mess up fried rice gross only thing that was good was our chicken egg roll which were probably Frozen that's why they tasted good got the counter was nice but obviously no one there and you had a cook definitely won't be back
