0pm-hpu8Rkfa16tLjWb-GQ If you want authentic Chinese food, this is the place to go. The staff is super friendly and will answer all your questions. I had #51 and it was the best noodle dish I've ever had. My son had #44 and he agrees, it's the best. We live in in OC CA wherever there are tons of good and authentic Chinese restaurants. This is better.
