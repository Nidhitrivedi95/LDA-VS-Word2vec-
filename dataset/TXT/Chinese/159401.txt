U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ I come here for one thing and one thing only; the PHO! Holy crap, it's the best pho I've had in Arizona, this far. I hate how the restaurant is not as big as it should be, because they deserve to be a big place! The soup is authentic. It's not overly oily and it's fresh. The customer service is awesome, granted on a busy day it's a little slow, but when they have time, they treat you very good. I don't get anything besides the pho, but my party will sometimes get the Com Tam and everything is good, but it's really not broken rice, just regular rice. The bun looks good and from what I've heard tastes good too. Their thai tea is good and they give a reasonable amount! I always come to this place when I'm in the area.
