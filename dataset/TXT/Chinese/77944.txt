GhWMl0J2gOOH61BhBMTAAA First of all we now have a Mongolian BBQ restaurant in the west valley. So kudos for that. I actually liked my dish which I made up from my own Mongolian BBQ experience, I only did this because I did not like any of the recommended receipes. This is pretty easy to do; select any meats and veggies you like then select the sauce. This is where I wasn't thrilled with the choices none looked like any other Mongolian BBQ places i've been to, for one thing they were all pretty thick sauces. Normal Mongolian BBQ places usually have a house sauce, soy sauce, and other Asian sauces. The one last gripe was that the bowls were kind of small and therefore a small portion of food, usually if the bowls are small you should get multiple turns to make a dish.
