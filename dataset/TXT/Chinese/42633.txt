BCga5CbMqcZLCpxAuln57w Me and my wife love this place and it is our favorite Chinese food in the Lakewood area.  The fried rice is great, which is a key for me.  It is freshly prepared and not like the yellowish fried rice that a lot of places serve that is dry and lacks flavor.  I have always been happy with any of the dishes and the food portions are huge. So, always plenty of leftovers to enjoy the next day.  I am not a Sushi expert, but my wife is and she thinks their Sushi is pretty good also.  We normally get carryout, so I don't have anything to share about their service in the restaurant.  The food is usually ready in about 20 minutes when we call with a pickup order.
