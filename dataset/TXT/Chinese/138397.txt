qoiUo-7k2ATm0eokxNr8nA I want my money back. This is probably the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I ordered the general gau's chicken yesterday and it was not even edible. I ended up throwing it away after eating one piece. There's almost no chicken and what was breaded was really saturated and soggy with the sauce. The rice was boring and kind of mushy. The eggroll looked and tasted store-bought and it seemed cooked that way too.  I really wish I could get my money back. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.
