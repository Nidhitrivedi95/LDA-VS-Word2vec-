J_NA-_WNLAJQg7eZwn1dWw #1 it is posted on here that Sesame Inn delivers , it says on menu takeout one mind you delivery. My sesame in closet is McMurray I live in Bethel park. i asked lady at desk if they delivered at my address ? she didnt understand ? the said Ask " Joe" so this guy comes up Joe? yeah  I asked if you delivered to Bethel park 5 min away? what address gave it oh yes only lunch times? so went home- a few days later 12:00 noon lunch time! I call ask for Joe He took 10 min to get on phone- i said Joe? yeah can I place lunch order for 2 @ Bethel park delivery - he said We no deliver there?then why lie to customer!put on website where you deliver and where you don't! We had to order from Rice inn wasn't very good $ costly too! if they refuse to deliver her theres 90 tenants in building wanting Chinese food delivery and only one Rice inn? we wont be eating at your restaurant until the truth be told! the BBB said you cant post delivery with out info as where if you dont deliver then put it on menu but dont lie to customer!very disapointed
