5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A If we are just talking about the food here, then it's all good. I haven't had a bad dish yet. They have a cheap lunch special that fills you up. Thai tea and coffee are yummy. They have a speedy delivery service. However, it is time to redo the menus. When we dine in, the menus are so old and crusty I don't even want to touch them. They are falling apart, have old food particles on then, stick together, and still list dishes they no longer serve and haven't served for a while. I would love to say the decor is delightfully tacky, but it's not. It's just plain tacky. If they removed some of the clutter and spent a little to spruce things up, it would breathe new life in here. But I digress, because the food is in fact good.
