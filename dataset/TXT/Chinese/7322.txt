0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ I thought this place was average. I was told that food here was really good and people raved about the chicken dishes here so I thought to give this a try. Staff were warm and welcoming but we felt rushed because waitress kept asking if we were ready to order - when we just sat down a minute ago. They were very prompt with filling your cup with water (you'll get really thirsty from eating all the meats). We came at 8pm on a weekday and it wasn't too busy. This restaurant accepts cash and debit only and 10% off for cash pick up. 

I would come back to try other chicken flavours! I would recommend to get the crispy beef. Also, I believe you get a bowl of plain white rice if you order a meat dish.
