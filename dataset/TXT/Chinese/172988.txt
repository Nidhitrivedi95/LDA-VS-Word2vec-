W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ To me ramen is ramen, just as long as it does not taste like instant noodles, like SOME PLACES believe it or not. The servers give me a promising feel, unpretentious and simple, the place kind of has a hipster vibe that I find some ramen places are starting to acquire, which I find cheesy at times. So we had an order of buns that were ok, any place I went for those, it was always a let down, they always have a mouthwatering look but fail to deliver. The highlight of these bun dishes were the sauces, it should be the PORK or the protein that should be the focal point. Now the French curry spiced pork belly was AWESOME! it was a unique way to flavour the pork belly and perfect for the concept of this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised with the lobster broth in the monster ramen as I am used to the standard pork/miso broth. I don't remember if it was a croquette or meatball on a skewer served alongside the ramen but it wasn't very necessary, I found it a bit tough. Despite the things I find they should work on, I was satisfied with the food! There is a unique take on a lot  of the menu items.
