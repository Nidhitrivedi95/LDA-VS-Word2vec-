JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw After reading the reviews, I was excited to try this restaurant.  We ordered the wontons in chili oil, beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles and the Dan Dan noodles with hand pulled noodles.  The wontons were good but fairly small.  The sauce was great and I added it to the Dan Dan noodles because it was a little bland.  The beef noodle soup was just okay.  The broth was one dimensional and didn't leave a good, warm feeling that I usually get if the broth tastes rich and has been simmering for a long time.  We probably won't return since there are other noodle soup restaurants that are better.
