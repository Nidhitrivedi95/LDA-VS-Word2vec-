ABRgXNwdOX_JyqChNr8IYw Like Kom Juk Yuen this place is a 70's icon and an institution in old chinatown. I use to end up here at 2am on weekends for all those street food dishes. Credit for its service to th epublic and afterhours crowd for 30 plus years. The place is clean serive is prompt no frills but the food is still chino canadiano. Come when your toasted it will definitely taste the best that way.
