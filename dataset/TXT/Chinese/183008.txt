xL-Ckvr8k8vEBJxC1wsCqQ I went here past Sunday July 26th with my family for my mother's birthday dinner.
We've known this place since 10 years ago, and this was the first time that they really disappointed me.
First of all, it took them awhile to have us seated and get our order.
Then we waited more than 30min for three dishes.
Then when it came to our dishes, I noticed awhile after we started to eat that the owner made a mistake on our order.
We ordered two for one lobster deal $35.95 and two other dishes.
We specifically told the OWNER that we wanted half ginger and half black bean sauce.
However, they only brought the black bean sauce flavour.
When I pointed the mistake to the waitress, she went up to the owner and they only told me that two different flavour is additional $4 and we would have to order another lobster.
I clearly told the OWNER that I wanted to separate flavours and he did not even double check our order.
We really wanted the ginger flavour more than the black bean sauce.
I was very angry that the owner did not even recognize his mistake and come to apologize or offer any discounts to the menu or fix our order.
Their deal is good but the service is horrible.
The OWNER should really work on customer service if he wants people to come back.
Very disappointed.
There are a lot of restaurants that offer similar prices with better service, so I would not go back here again.
