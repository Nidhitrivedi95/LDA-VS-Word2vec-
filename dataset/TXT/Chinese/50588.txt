CGgUHkAKU0QBsdGvXxfMuw So I just got some Orange Chx (cause its bomb)....extra crispy sauce on the side. Now, this is the 5x  I have ate this item since my last review and each time it has been on point.......why did I just pick up an order of Orange Chx  get to work and my sauce is "ICE COLD" which lets me know its yesterdays sauce, but not anything a microwave cant fix........but what does piss me off is I called to let them know and the girl at the front tells me - Some customers want it cold.......WTF, If it wasnt so damn good I would not go back
