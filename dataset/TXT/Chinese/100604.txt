k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA Very high prices for average food.  Can get tastier and much cheaper Chinese food across the street.  BTW, had a groupon coupon to use and in small print it said 20% commission so the discount wasn't all that much.  Not restaurant's fault but just a warning about Groupon...read the fine print.  High prices mostly for the nice decor.  Food comes cold because it must come from a kitchen far away.  Been here a few times and it has always disappointed.  This was the last time I will visit the place.
