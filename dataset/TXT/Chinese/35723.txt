AFxhYWtszxGXaGGMnWZ9CA This is my second visit here and I love it. Specifically because of their blow torched salmon sushi. The seats are booths which is nice! My first visit was with a party of seven and my second visit was with my bf and the service was fairly quick. This place is your average AYCE however what differs them from other AYCE that I've been to is that they have the blow torched salmon sushi. From what I remember, to enter and exit the restaurant you have to go through the mall which can be an annoyance. Overall, I've had good experiences and I would come back.
