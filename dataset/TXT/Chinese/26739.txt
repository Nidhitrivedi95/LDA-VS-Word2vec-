7um-gnjmA5sqnUcM9Gh2Mg I'm writing this review in light of the YouTube video that has gone viral, "Montreal Restaurant Brawl" since it took place at New Dynasty. The owners have lost in excess of $20 000 because of the fight of a handful of hooligans who have ruined it for everyone.
 
I have not gone to this restaurant in a few years but it's one of the better ones in Chinatown for good authentic Chinese food. Their Salt and Pepper shrimp and Lemon Chicken in particular are very good.

Since Chinese New Year is coming up on January 23rd, I'm suggesting as many Montrealers and Yelpers go to New Dynasty to help them out and get back on their feet again and show that Montrealers are better than what was depicted on that video.
