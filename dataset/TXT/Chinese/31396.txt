9q8JSsHC5lR6Hh16W_5ggg I liked the food generally but the price is too steep for what it is.  When you visit a good hakka place and order a "chili chicken" for instance, the assumption is that it comes with rice.  Well here at Salt & Pepper it's a whopping $12.99 and doesn't even include rice.  Add yourself a fried rice for $9.99 and then a szechwan noodles and you're up to $35 if not more with tax..  Just too much.  Again, the food was pretty good but there's no shortage of hakka places around with better prices, so I'm not sure when I'll return.  The one major positive though was they are one of the few places that has Dragon chicken & Chili chicken WHITE meat versions.  I tend to always get stuck with gristly chicken with the average chili chicken dish made with dark meat so that was a nice change.  Person taking the order is completely unhelpful and unenthusiastic about the food too, the guy in the black shirt.  just wanted to add that.  Seems catered to Indian and not Chinese like regular hakka.
