First off while the service is average, its super fast and quick. Dishes come out quickly and piping hot. They don't smile but as long as my food gets to me quickly and efficiently I don't care.

They are a couple of dishes you need to try.

1) Beef and Mushroom Hot Pot

This dish is amazing. The beef is filet cut super thin. Its sooooo soft and tender. The beef and mushrooms and cooked slightly in the back and then that with raw green onions and put into a super hot pot and finished at your table. The beef is always cooked to perfection and the hot pot adds a level of depth of flavor that you wont find in any other dish or cooking method. the sauce is light..made of the juices from the mushrooms and beef.  Great dish.

2) General Tao Chicken

Yes I know everyone has one. But this one is different then any other I have had. The sauce is light and red...almost like a sweet and spicy red chili sauce. The chick is lightly battered and its super soft and moist. Fried crispy and light...doesn't eat heavy. My only suggestion is the sauce coats the chicken almost like candy, so ask for extra sauce that way the chicken is fully coated in sauce and there is plenty on the bottom of the plate to redip or pour on your rice.

Great restaurant. Good fresh high quality Chinese food.
