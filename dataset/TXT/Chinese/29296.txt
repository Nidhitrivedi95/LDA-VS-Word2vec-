8zyurJRIAEHh_I0Skhcp3w This is our go to place for Chinese food when my family visits from nyc. Decor is very nice. Very clean washrooms in comparison to other Chinese places which doesn't really say much. Service ain't great but not bad either. They won't go out of their way to greet you or make you feel warm and fuzzy but they get the job done efficiently. Had the roast pork, yang Chow fried rice, lobster, beef with cashews and seafood basket. All treated amazeballs with only one issue. The basket in seafood basket I think changed. It now has this weird texture that sticks to your teeth. Not really a pleasurable experience. However the food still tasted great. This place hasn't disappointed.
