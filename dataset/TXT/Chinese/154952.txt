tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw Hooray! I may have found my dish here!

I came back on a Friday night at dinnertime. The weird, empty atmosphere was replaced with the chatter of other tables and several bustling waitstaff.

For appetizers we ordered egg rolls and fried wontons. Not the highlight of the meal, but they were pretty cheap, so whatever.

For my meal I ordered a spicy chicken dish and added vegetables because I can't just eat a plate of saucy fried food without something healthy. This meant my dish was pretty expensive, but it was 2 meals worth, so worth it. The chicken was perfectly crunchy on the outside, tender inside, and the vegetables were still a little crunchy and a good mix. Ordering it at heat level 6 was perfect for me, though I ate around a few jalapeños because it would have kicked it up to an 8.

The servers were very attentive, and my water glass was always full. The lady who sat us and brought the food was like a fussy mother, in a good way, as she rearranged the plates and glasses to make more food fit on the table.

It was so good, I boxed half of it up so I wouldn't look like a pig, then I finished it as soon as I got home.
