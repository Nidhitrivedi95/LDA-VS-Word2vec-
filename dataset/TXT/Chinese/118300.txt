nl_gkvVXtsIlhGE0sP0qFw Crazy buffet had pretty decent food! It was better than I expected. It also helped that one of the servers (possibly a manager) LOVED my husband and kept coming over every 10min saying "Ryan, can I get you anything? Ryan, would you like more iced tea? Ryan, you're so lucky you have a beautiful wife (of course he gets points for flattery lol)" We were in a group of about 10, but he was seemed to only want to serve Ryan. Haha it was pretty funny.

The selection was good--standard fare. We were there for dinner so we had a TON of crab legs. Just that alone was worth the money. The sushi bar was good too--better sushi than I've seen at other buffet. They had unagi sushi too, which is usually kinda pricey, so it was generous of them to serve that. 

They had a mongolian stir fry station where they would cook toppings you'd choose yourself. I didn't notice this until I was already at dessert, but other people at my table had gotten it and it looked really good.

The only dish I really couldn't eat was an alfredo shrimp pasta. It was pretty gross--I tasted mayo in it? Not a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a nice creamy cheesy sauce. 

They had good desserts too, which is usually my least favorite part of a buffet. They had actual ice cream, instead of gross frozen yogurt. There was an ice cream freezer with 8 different buckets--I gnoshed on the oreo and butter pecan ice cream happily. They also had some good cheesecake, which complemented the ice cream really well. 

All in all, I'd definitely go back!
