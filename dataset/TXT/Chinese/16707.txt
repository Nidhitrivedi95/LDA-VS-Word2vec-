483eMQ9g0GykUJNWTA5q3A I love this place. We live across the street and are so glad they moved from Promenade to the Fincher Farm location. Lots of sushi options and great bento boxes with lots of food for the money. All of the Asian staples and a nice atmosphere to sit down and have a meal. We feel comfortable bringing our kids but it also makes a good date night away. Welcome to the neighborhood Red Bowl!
