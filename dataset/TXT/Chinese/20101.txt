5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ Read some good reviews for this place here on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Easy to find within the Monte Carlo, my fiancé and I decided to sit at the bar and have an easy going, relaxed dinner with drinks. That's exactly what we got! Greeted by a friendly bartender, Wayne, we asked about beers, ordered our drinks and had them quickly. We wanted to order a little, eat, then order some more and that was perfectly fine with Wayne. Started off with the salt and pepper calamari and the jalapeño popper roll, with unagi and eel sauce. Both delicious. The calamari is not your typical touristy ring-style calamari, but rather large yet tasty pieces, perfectly fried with a delicious relish of peppers, onion, salt, pepper and other seasonings. Quite tasty! The jalapeño popper roll was fabulous as well. Not too hot, but a slower, almost smoky heat that creeps up as you savor each bite.  

We took a short break then ordered some miso soup...fabulously simple but flavorful, and then decided on two more rolls...the traditional Philly roll and their California Volcano roll with crab, cucumber, spicy tuna, green onion, avocado and sesame. Fabulously fresh with the delicate heat from the spicy tuna paired with the sesame overtones, this was probably my favorite bite tonight. 

Wayne was a great bartender and server with a friendly, relaxed demeanor who was also eager to please, offering suggestions and even samples of a draft beer I hadn't had. If I were in town longer I would definitely go back to try more items but will certainly make it a priority the next time I'm in Vegas. If you're looking for some fabulous food, in a casual environment with a great price point, visit the Dragon Noodle Co inside the Monte Carlo casino.
