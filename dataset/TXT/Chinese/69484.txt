The chicken fried rice is the best! I could seriously eat it as a meal alone! Their honey walnut shrimp is delicious (great portions, perfectly cooked) and they've let me order teriyaki beef too which is amazing. Their orange chicken and broccoli beef also do not disappoint! We order them all the time at Phoenix Comicon and to our home. 

I've got to go, time to get me some of their chicken fried rice!
