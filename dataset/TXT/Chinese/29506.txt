9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw Let me just say that I can never eat hot pot anywhere else after this place. The selection is amazing! Such a good variety of meats, vegetables, fish balls, and other miscellaneous hot pot  ingredients! Even at 12:30 AM, the selection was well-stocked, a little on the messy side (as I only saw one waiter on duty) but that didn't take away from how great and fresh the selection was. 
The broth of the hot pot soup was quite tasty as well. We opted for Spicy Mongolian and Japanese Miso. 
The only thing I would improve on would be service but I can understand manning so many tables on your own can be difficult. It definitely should have been on the manager to not short staff the restaurant though because it seems that it still gets quite busy late at night.
Overall, a great buffet option! The 15% discount still works last time I was here recently.
