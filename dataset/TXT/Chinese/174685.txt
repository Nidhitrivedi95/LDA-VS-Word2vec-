WfgupKdYx1h0mKBmOmNQ3g Filthy and disgusting! We like the food here but I will never come back because of the lack of cleanliness in this restaurant. The dining area is"ok" but the ladies room has fuzzy mold growing behind the toilet, the sink is gray from the layers of dirt (I wasn't sure so I took a paper towel and cleaned a spot...that gray comes off!), walls/baseboards are very dirty, highchairs don't get cleaned, etc. I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like. I'm surprised the health department hasn't closed this place down.
