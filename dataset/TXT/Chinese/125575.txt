Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w Tin Tin is definitely the most authentic Chinese buffet I've been to.  There is very limited American Chinese dishes so if you're looking for an authentic buffet place, this is the restaurant to check out!

There is all-you-can-eat crab legs, clams, mussels, made-to-order noodle soup, sushi, and a few dim sum dishes (just to name a few).  Not to mention their wide selection of fruits and desserts. I always eat more than my stomach can hold but I always make sure I leave a little room for dessert. 

We always bring our family friends here who live in larger cities and they always complement on how good the place is!  The weekends and holidays are always packed so if you choose to come during these times, expect to wait for a table!
