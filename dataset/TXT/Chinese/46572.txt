BvrG8XMpTtlJYWhOCbnpaQ This place is incredible if you're looking for good mu shu. They actually use the authentic thin wrappers that are typically used for this dish instead of tortillas by most places around here.  It wasn't overly saucy like many  Chinese restaurants often tend to be nowadays. And did I mention their mu shu wrap is ginormous! This place is defintely in an unsuspecting location, but I'll defintely be coming back for more!
