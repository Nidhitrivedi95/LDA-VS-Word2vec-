U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Service here is horrible. There's a lot of staff and rarely any patrons. Our main entrees came out first, and took forever for our dumplings to come. Not once did anyone come by and let us know when the dumplings were coming or why the dumplings took forever to come out. Lastly, no one ever came by to ask how everything was!!! Never coming back here again!
