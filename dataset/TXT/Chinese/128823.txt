PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ This place is outside of the Strip in Vegas!  Their Dum Sum is not as good as their reviews.  Not many choices to choose from.  Their Fried Taro is big!  Others have 3 pieces, they only have 2.  The sad part is its mostly Taros and not much meat inside and not much flavor to it. A Dim Sum located inside Rio is much better!
