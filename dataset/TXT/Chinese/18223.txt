5bDLpVi7ju83v2Yoeq_0Rw I have known Yang for more than three years, first when he was the lead therapist at tuina.ca before he opened his own practice at this new location. Yang's methods are unconventional, painful but most importantly effective. He has helped me with neck/shoulder pains as well as tennis elbow.  

Highly recommended.

(They don't speak English well so be patient.)
