CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Place was ok, I expected more from the Bellagio. Duck was a good portion, but a tad salty. I did not like the sauce I got either it was sweet and sour. Husband got the salt and pepper shrimp,
Nice big shrimps but not
Worth $33. Pan fried dumplings looked like they were steamed. All and all dinner $68 plus tip
So $90, for a meal I wasn't happy with. The silk noodle in the west gate hotel
Was 10x better!
