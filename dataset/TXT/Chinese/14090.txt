355zerURpj4IMs2no238_A Very disappointed in my last visit here. Ordered for pick up and order was read back correctly. Got all the way home and dressing for the salad was not included. Drove back to get it and was barely acknowledged. Drive home again and found out that the wings were also not in the bag. Gave up at that point. Called the restaurant the next day and the manager said I could drive back over and he would give me a gift card. I said I lived far away and just wanted a refund for the part I did not receive. He said he was too busy to do that but I could call back at another time. Bottom line is that I was too busy to make 3 trips across town for a simple order.  I never got refunded for the error nor did I get the gift card.
