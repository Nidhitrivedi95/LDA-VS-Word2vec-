AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw Not for everyone, I think that I can say that without anyone disagreeing. If you don't like punk and metal music or the idea of a beach bar/music club that serves Chinese food then you're probably not the type of person that enjoys unique experiences, and that's ok. I'll break this review up in 2 ways so that it represents each of the areas that Chop & Wok offer.

As a Bar:
When I explain Chop & Wok to people, I typically get strange looks. When I get them in the door for after work drinks, it quickly becomes EVERYONE's go to spot. A fantastic beer selection, a great set up for socializing. Attentive bartenders including Jamie the owner who after the original burnt down, didn't see me for over 2 years, but remembered my drink order and name the minute I walked through the door of the new location. Try the Orange Sunshine shot, it's tasty and a great shot for groups without pressing people to take shots they may dislike.

As a Restaurant:
The chinese food is some of the best in Scottsdale, I've never had a dish that I didn't enjoy. The crisp honey shrimp is great, my favorite though is the Dan Dan Noodles extra spicy. The panang lo mein is also excellent and you have to get the jalapeno puffs. If you eat in, expect music and carrying on from bar patrons, if you get takeout or delivery, you likely won't be disappointed.
