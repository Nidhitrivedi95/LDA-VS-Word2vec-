NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og First off i love how this place is right next to my house. I tried ordering on their website which didnt go thru i think it was just my fault i was confused on how to use. I ended up calling and placing my order. Its a cute small little place. I ordered 2 combination plates some shrimp chow mein and honey glazed pork chops. The only thing i didnt like was the fried rice and chow mein no flavor. 
i loved the honey glazed pork chops and the beef Szechwan. Oh and i forgot to mention i got a musabi (i thnk im spelling it right) but that was really good as well!
