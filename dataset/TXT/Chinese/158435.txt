tZ-h-gFhIWnrC4TR_N9K_Q Honestly I'm not sure why the ratings here are so low! This place has become one of my family's go-to dinner places since Congee Queen and other similar type restaurants started losing consistency and food quality. Although there are times when service has not been the greatest given some servers cannot communicate very well, the dishes here offer generous portions and consistency. We love the roast duck here! The menu is very extensive - there is your classic congee restaurant items - fried rice and noodle dishes, vegetables, soup noodles and Chinese bbq items. They even have skewers and pho! The place is also quite packed all the time but food always comes out really quick. Overall, this place has yet to disappoint.
