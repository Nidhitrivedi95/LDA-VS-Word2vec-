hoGyiTjrri-Sq3-EaO7Kpw Got takeout last night: the basil chicken in spicy sauce. Diversion from my usual spot, Thai Spice, in Westlake because I was in the area. Mistake! The flavor of the sauce was good, and the rice was cooked well, but the veggies and chicken were cooked to death. The vegetables were a soggy mess and the chicken was super rubbery. But the worst part was the indigestion that followed, you know the kind you get when you eat really cheap Chinese food? This food just has to be loaded with MSG - I was sick ALL night. I could have forgiven them for the mediocre food and maaaaybe tried something from the Thai side of the menu, but after spending the entire night rolling around in bed feeling sick to my stomach, I will most definitely pass. Avoid this place at all costs!!!
