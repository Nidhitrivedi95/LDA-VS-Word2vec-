Y1wzvTTI_rSAJOF1224LCQ If you're looking for a good dimsum restaurant, Honey & Garlic is the place to go. It's the sister restaurant to the one at Market Village (i believe it's called Green Onion or something).  This place is always busy on the weekend, so e prepared to wait. The good thing or some may say the not so good thing) is that most of the seating are booth seats.  The restaurant isn't that big, I don't think there are more than 50 tables, and probably 75% of the seats are booths.  

Another great thing about this dimsum place is that they have the traditional carts. I love the carts.  For those who dont know, the food comes on carts and the ladies (always ladies) pulling the cart scream out what items they have. If you do not speak chinese (like me), just look inquisitively at the cart and inquire in English what they have. They are usually good at explaining ("beef", "chicken" rice).  

This is hands down one of the best Dim Sum restaurants in Toronto. If you are there after 12, get the Thai fried rice! I eat thai all the time and this is the best fried rice thai style that I've ever tasted!! At a chinese restaurant, go figure. Their sponge cake and tapioca pudding is also recommended.

If you go between specific hours they actualy have specials, where all items are a flat rate (regardless of the size of the dish).  I'll have to consult with my mom on the details...

 Worth the drive, worth the wait!
