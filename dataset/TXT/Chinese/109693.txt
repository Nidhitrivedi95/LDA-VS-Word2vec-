Lpp8IiUVEhJzF4Fb8DkScQ Worst place! I refuse to go there ever again. The staff as well as the chef i assume is not at all attentive because they gave me a chicken in place of panner.I being a vegetarian making them understand this, was a task as they were adamant and did not understand the sentimental and religious concern.. As we had tried the chicken. The flavours are nowhere close to original hakka and so is the degraded quality.
