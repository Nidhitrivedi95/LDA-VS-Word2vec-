ZlrHrg7jrbO6blqwfa0MkQ Classic Americanized Chinese food. Greasy and good. Fry up some sort of meat, put a sauce on it, steam some veggies on the side and serve with rice. Well done. I'd go here again and again. Not bad pricing, either. I ordered the sesame chicken. The sauce was unbelievable. Reminded me of a buffalo wing/sesame chicken sauce. So totally conventional but great.
