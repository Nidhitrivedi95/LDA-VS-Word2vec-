KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ First off, loved this place. It's kind of a hole in a strip mall place but when you walk in, it's clean and everyone is friendly. My friend said she's been going here for years and said it was consistently good. She even had her rehearsal dinner here. Here? I'm kind of a Chinese food snob and didn't expect to like it as much as she did. But I did. The egg drop soup was great-they put a bunch of fried wonton strips on top and sometimes there is bigger pieces of egg white and it is just really good. I had the Hunan chicken, they said it was spicy--and by gum! it was :) And delicious. We had the flat noodles instead of the rice and it soaked up the sauce from the chicken--so, so good. And plenty of veggies with the chicken. My only hesitation is with the egg rolls that were kind of...clunky-almost like they had been made ahead of time and then warmed up. But I'll be back and try all the other goodness they serve. Oh! And it's good inexpensive Chinese food--2 for lunch, tea (a dollar extra) and a bit extra for the noodles vs rice and we got out for $16. Yes, I will be back--and you should go! Trust me :)
