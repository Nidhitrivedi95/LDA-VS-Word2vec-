U3TUTWRqbW9WeLeWMxi2tw We were craving dumplings and this placed popped up when we searched. I'm so glad we did! We ordered the spicy beef noodle, the pork and shepherds purse wonton, and an order of homemade juicy steamed pork mini dumplings. Everything was so good! I have to say though our favorite dish was the mini dumplings! If anything order them!
