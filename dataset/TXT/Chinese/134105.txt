q_c2ZvPJJxYEFPoWMKY2vQ Jatoba is a beautiful restaurant with a really trendy and grand interiors. I've met Chef Olivier Vigneault when I used to work for an upscale sushi restaurant Kaizen, where I remembered how fantastic his cooking was. When I saw he's at Jatoba, I was sold.

Good: We've ordered the vegetarian gyoza (dumplings), the daikon with fresh herbs and spicy beef salad, and the 1855 beef tataki to share. The service was fantastic, and the food had totally exceeded my expectations. The complex flavours of each dish was simply amazing. I highly recommend the daikon salad, it's really light, filling and flavourful. You know the food is great when you can't decide which dish was your favourite because everything was so tasty.  Now, I had recently returned from a trip in Japan, so my expectations have been lowered for all Japanese restaurants in Canada (sorry), but having tried the sashimi at Jatoba, I was instantly reliving my Japan trip all over again. Each bite was so fresh with delicate flavours, you would slowly savour it. That's how good it was.

Bad: We didn't get a seat the terrace, but it was our fault we didn't reserve in advance.

Bottom line: This is among my top 5 picks in Montreal. I would recommend this place for anyone in a heart beat. If you still need more convincing to try this place, just look at Chef Olivier Vigneault's Instagram account.
