wgYK6zF0M_o01d-32W-S2A The staff here are hit and miss. I recently stopped in for lunch one day and in this instant, it was a complete miss.
I asked how long it would be for lunch and the owner(?) went into lecturing me about how I should go to the supermarket if I want to eat something immediately. To be honest, with her rude direction I was debating on it. I had to get back to work so I was genuinely wondering if I had the time to dine-in. I was so close to turning and leaving in that moment but I wanted sushi so I subjected myself to the slow, passive aggressive service that resulted from my honest inquiry.
Their food is satisfactory but they can definitely take a few pointers in the area of customer service.
