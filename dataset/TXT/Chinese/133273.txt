PViWXTbiRkRjZhAdH0xLxg first time having delivery from this restaurant and i was pretty disappointed. ordered szechuan shrimp which was predominantly sliced onions. General tao chicken was good. I ordered hot and sour soup but got some vegetable soup. I much prefer this restaurant over Mr dumpling, which is what I have also been ordering for delivery for the past month or so in newmarket.
UPDATE I got delivery on February 25. Got the schezuan shrimp and shrimp rolls. I got food poisoning that night. I won't be eating here again.
