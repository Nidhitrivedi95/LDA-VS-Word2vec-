HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ A great place for lunch or dinner.  I've been to Ginbu more than a few times now and the food and service has always been good.

Their lunch prices are quite inexpensive for the amount of food you get .  You have your choice of 6 different sushi lunch specials which all come with 2 different rolls and a salad or miso soup from $7 to $12.  These are no scrawny pieces of sushi either.

They also have a nice selection of chinese dishes that are tasty...if you like lettuce wraps give them a try here.. of course they are not PF Changs but they deserve a mention.

One other thing to mention...I've never had to wait for a table here which is always a big plus...enjoy!
