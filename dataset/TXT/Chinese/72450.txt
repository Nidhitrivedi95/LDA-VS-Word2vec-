fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA One of the best chinese restaurants i have ever eaten at. Period!  watch them make dumplings in the window while you wait for a table, since there is usually a line out the door.  Couldnt decide whether to have dumplings steamed or fried, so we had both...YUM!  The other dishes were also fantastic, with huge helpings: General Tao's chicken, twice cooked pork, black fungus salad teeming with braised baby bok choy...the real deal.
