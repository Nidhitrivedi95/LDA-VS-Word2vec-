f0L6nuOekGDsXBO6quxrUA Just to clear up any confusion, I am giving this place two stars based only upon the eggrolls and sauce served with them.  I was not impressed with the rest of the food at all.  I ordered a combo with my husband; it came with almond chicken, pineapple chicken, two eggrolls each, Asian ribs, and fried rice.  What we recieved, besides the admittedly delicious eggrolls, were:  veggies in broth w/approx 20 cashews on top, chewy/tough ribs, beyond salty rice (however, it was not greasy so that's certainly something), and balls of chicken, fried but chewy, in some bland sourish sauce.

We ate, and left hungry with a rather large order of eggrolls to-go, for when we got home.

All that aside, as I was eating, I was facing the bathrooms and could not help but notice an employee leave the bathroom area with a still dripping plunger, AND CARRY IT INTO THE KITCHEN!  
Needless to say, we will not be going back, ever.  The saddest part is that my husband assures me that the restaurant was wonderful when his grandparents used to bring him when he was much younger.
