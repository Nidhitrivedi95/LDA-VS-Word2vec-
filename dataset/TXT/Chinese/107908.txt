lEtpTFWetCf6xnzeImLiHg I have eaten here two times now the first time it was pretty dead in the place and there was what looked like a group of kid's part of the family... My server seemed to cater to that group over me I am a paying customer keep that in mind... I ordered the General Tso's Chicken (Crunchy fried white meat tossed with scallions in a spicy sauce. I was a good meal nothing above and beyond... The second trip was for a lunch and I ordered the Mongolian beef (Spicy marinated beef sautéed with scallions and sweet yellow onions served over a bed of crispy rice noodles and sprinkled with sesame seeds... This was a really good meal and great service so let's hope the third this as good.
