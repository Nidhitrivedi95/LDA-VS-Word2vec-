l5NUIeAo6Fk-Vx4nm3Xqfg My Girlfriend and I have been frequenting China Ginger for 2 years now and haven't had a bad experience yet. We are both from NY and know our Chinese food. The food is always fresh, fast, and delicious. Service is always great and the servers are always on top of things. Prices are average,  you're going to pay $25-40 for 2 people, but that's what you'll pay pretty much anywhere nowadays.

You will always feel well taken care of here, no matter what day of the week you visit. I typically don't write Yelp reviews, but after another excellent visit tonight, I felt I should spread the word. Places like this deserve to survive and keep a steady customer base. 

Visit soon and hope you enjoy!
