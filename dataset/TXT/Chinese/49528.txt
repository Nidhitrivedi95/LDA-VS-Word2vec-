CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Yea! I get so excited to come to vegas and have some noodle bar at the bellagio.  Especially late night. Abalone congee, wonton noodle soup, roast pork rice, beef pan fried noodle...yumz reminds me of c-town in ny. 

Love the decor, its simple and very asian. Some of the dishes can get pricey but its the bellagio don't expect less! I just wish it was open late late night. It would be perfect for coming after partying.  They need noodle bars in every casino/hotel in vegas!
