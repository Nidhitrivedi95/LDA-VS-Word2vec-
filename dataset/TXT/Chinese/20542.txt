5zk3LxFzijmY2JipVZ7Xdg Omg! Couldn't find a single complaint. Put in an order for pick up, food was done when I got there. The lady was super nice! The food was amazing and the portion size was huge! We did the family meal for two. Got orange chicken, Mongolian beef, wonton soup, fried rice and the sampler appetizer all for just over $30. The two of us got through the soup, appetizer and we were stuffed! We had a few bites of both entrees just to try them before we packed up the leftovers. Super delicious and definitely going back!
