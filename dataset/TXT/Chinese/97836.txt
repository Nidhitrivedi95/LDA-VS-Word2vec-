JQrh2cmndqRKwTpVveHPDg Dayali seems to be a pretty popular restaurant, but I'm really not sure why. We went on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was filled. A big group of people were waiting to be seated but we got a seat right away since we were just a party of 3. Ordering is through checking off items on a sheet. A very nicely printed and bounded photo menu showcasing their food was provided. From that, I had pretty high hopes for the food but was soon disappointed. 

The servers were not attentive and the whole environment was too cluttered. We did not get a complete set of utensils and none of the servers noticed until we asked. We ordered 4 items which came one at a time. The last dish did not arrive until we were almost done eating and after we inquired about it. 

Dayali's concept of good food is just to drown everything in oil. We ordered the Sliced Boiled Fish but what came was a tub of oil. It's true that the flavor wasn't bad, but I couldn't eat more than two pieces of the fish due to the amount of grease coating each piece. This was labelled with 3 chili but wasn't spicy at all. In comparison, the Stewed Duck Wings labelled as one chili was 10x more spicy. Overall, the meal was disappointing. Perhaps the signature Beijing duck could've redeemed the experience slightly but I really don't care to go back again to try.
