dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ On 10/10/17 at about 7:30 p.m. me and my husband went to this restaurant and we've been there before because it's the only place in town I like their tomyum chicken soup and so we went that day and everything was fine but we found it odd that there were 3-4 servers attending us and when I paid I paid with my card and I always write a zero for the tip because I like to tip with cash and when the guy saw that I wrote 0 for the tip he told me I couldn't leave without leaving a tip and said I HAD to leave a tip and personally I thought that was very disrespectful and my husband bit his tongue because he didn't want to cause a scene and to top it off we didn't even get good service that day for us to leave a tip and I didn't even know who I was tipping <U+200D> so I will never eat at this restaurant again ! I left them $1.50 in quarters which they didn't even deserve . Personally i work hard for my money and if I don't think you deserved at tip I don't have to give you one !! Very rude , disrespectful , and unprofessional
