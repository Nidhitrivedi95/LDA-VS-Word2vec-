dqeUvrlMxTAk0VL2n1ukaw Was very highly rated. Quality has severely deteriorated. Used to be one of my favorites. I had curried shrimp with fried rice. The curry had very little flavor and was waterie. The majority of the dish was large chunks of water chestnuts and onion. Their fried rice was nothing more than white rice that they sprinkled soy sauce on. (Some of it wasn't even colored.) My wife had the mongolion chicken. Flavor was passable. Nothing great; but it had much more flavor than mine. Not worth the trip.
