Mkpg9S2j0ZrZc3q-VjfLsA I find the food here better than most Chinese places I try. I have not ordered anything here that I did not like. Typically the fish congee, general tso, fried rice, mixed veggies, and what ever sides I feel like come ordering time. The interior makes it seem like its a higher end restaurant (probably because it's clean) but the prices are very reasonable and the food is worth it.
