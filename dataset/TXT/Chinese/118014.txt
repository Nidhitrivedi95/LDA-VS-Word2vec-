You know what, I'm updating my review because I had a much better impression during my second visit!

I do find the menu a bit overwhelming because it's quite extensive, especially for the array of desserts they serve.  I didn't bother ordering anything that was pudding-like (sago, black rice, etc.) because last time I felt as though it was just canned evaporated milk + canned fruits.  I could be wrong, but that's what I remembered based on my first+last visit.

Instead, I stuck to the Milk Oolong Tea (~$5-6), which I requested with less sugar.  And it was nice, subtlely fragrant, similar to Jasmine Tea, and the perfect amount of "sweetness" for me!

My friend ordered the Japanese Popcorn Chicken ($8.49) and Japanese Curry Rice (~$8).  Both tasted very good and at great price points!

In general, the savoury foods seemed like much better value than desserts &/or drinks.  I had absolutely no problem with service, after figuring out that you write your order down + there's a service bell at each table.
