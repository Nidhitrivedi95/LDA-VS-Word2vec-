But I've had just as good, probably better tacos at a dozen places in Los Angeles, for a lot cheaper.  The tacos with the oyster in the middle was pretty funky here.  We also had a few of the dim sum dishes which wasn't great.  The shumai and har gau were kind of shameful - chalky, thin, small.  I thought this was going to be fusion cuisine but it was basically latin food on one side of the menu and chinese food on the other.  Where's the creativity in that besides the decor?  What's really disappointing is that Jose Andres' name is associated with this place - in reality, it's just an association; none of his ingenuity exists here.
