HusY0jtxYpF9lGUJ92-xDQ Great little place for delicious, fresh, fast food. I got the chicken, beef, and shrimp teriyaki with fried rice and my husband got the orange chicken with yakisoba. Everything was great! We ate there. The restaurant was clean, the food came out fairly quickly. The food was super hot and tasty. The service was friendly and attentive. We had Thai ice teas, regular and snow,  and they hit the spot! Very surprised by this place and will definitely be back again.
