_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Never ever order take-out from this restaurant. It is the biggest rip off ever. We had ordered their king crabs and a couple other side dishes for dinner, expecting that the crabs looks like the ones in the tank, it turns out it doesn't. I have eaten at the restaurant the week prior, and the crabs appear much larger than the ones for take-out. I strongly advise you do not order take out from them.
