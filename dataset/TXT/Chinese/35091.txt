aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg I was pleasantly surprised to see a full room of customers dining in this hole in the wall.  From the outside  you would think twice about walking in.  You wouldn't expect a full room of people and nice noodle/bbq cafe decor.   I had the roast duck wonton noodle.  The duck was good but the rest of so so.  Overall, I'd say I was happy with my meal and will definitely return to try the roast  suckling pig.
