I dropped by the other day for some of my favorites, but to my dismay, found the food to be sadly lacking.  Honestly?  The meal tasted like it'd been made two days prior and left out on the counter.  Even the dumplings sucked!  They've changed something in how they make both the pork and veggie dumplings - they're folded differently and the dough is awful!

I hope they get their mojo back soon..
