QvEoE_oGwHPXvw5IylllNg I wish I had found the previous review instead of the reviews I found on Urbanspoon.com.  I agree with the previous reviewer--save your money and eat at Panda Express instead!  Our family ordered three of the lunch menu specials:  Kung Pao Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Lemon Chicken.  Out of the three, the Orange chicken was the best, but still not nearly as good as Panda's.  The Kung Pao Chicken had no flavor and was not spicy like Kung Pao should be.  The Lemon Chicken was the worst of all--thin chicken fillets fried in a thick, undercooked, greasy batter with a thin flavorless sauce on the side.  The fried rice was orange as described by the other reviewer and had no eggs and the pork in ours was on the dry side.  Although we have had better, we did enjoy the egg rolls.
