Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA We said "Misti sent us" - true, but indirectly.  We chose Pan Asian based on the great reviews of Yelp, and were not led astray.

While fluorescent lighting isn't my preferred ambiance for dinner, the food and David's ceaseless sense of humor far outshone the lighting.  

We brought a started bottle of wine with us, half-full because we didn't want to polish off a whole one, which we knew we could, and would. He promptly brought us wine glasses, and when he noticed us skimming ice out of our water glasses, he brought us a big glass of ice with a spoon.  Service was like that consistently.

We shared two entrees - the Musulman Curry, with Chicken, and the Stir-Fried Linguine, which for once I was able to convince seafood-challenged hubby to allow me the pleasure of ordering with shrimp.  I loved the addition of sweet potato and avocado to the curry dish; both blended perfectly with the sauce.  I would have loved it even more if it were a tad less sweet and one star higher up the spice ladder.  The linguine was terrific, and I reveled in the rare delight of having Asian food with - omigod - shrimp!  But alas, the shrimp was tasty, but was missing that crisp "bite" that should come from wok cooking.  The veggies, especially the asparagus, had it, but not the shrimp.   Still, it worked!

We left happy and full, and we'll be back soon.
