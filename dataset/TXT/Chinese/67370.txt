emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw Ok so I read in the Phoenix paper that this place is in the top 10 Chinese restaurants in the metro area.

I don't know if it is or isn't in the top 10 but conceding for the sake of discussion that it is I'm not sure what that says about Chinese food in the Phoenix area.

Since it was our first time here we ordered simple and perhaps overly obvious choices.  We started with hot and sour soup followed up with egg rolls, crab puffs and fried shrimp.

Soup was good.  Crab puff was actually had a crab like substance in it that you could taste over the cream cheese.  The shrimp was ok, but cold.  The egg roll was ok.  The bad thing about the crab puff and egg roll was that the grease they were fried in was very old and discolored the wonton wrappers.

Main course was beef and green beans, sweet and sour pork and fried rice.  The fried rice was good.  Beef and beans were good although the beef was a bit on the chewy side.  The sweet and sour pork was sweet and sour pork...what can you say.  Again, since the sweet and sour pork was deep fried it was cooked in the same old oil mentioned above.  

All in all it was ok, but they really need to change/clean their oil.
