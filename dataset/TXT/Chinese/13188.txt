Chinese can be a real preference driven food, and there are other people here who really enjoyed Bangkok 9, and the place it run by extremely friendly people.  Also note, I had the Chinese, not the Thai food, so you may experience something different.

Our order contained a couple Sweet & Sour dishes, and they did not come breaded.  Also, their egg rolls are more like spring rolls.
