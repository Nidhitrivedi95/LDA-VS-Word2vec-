XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw The bright red floral chair covers here are easily the focal point of the dining room!  Decorative choices aside, the food is good and made with love! The restaurant name is a bit misleading, as they do offer several dumplings (arguably more than anywhere else in town?) but that does not seem to be their strongest dish. Note that the owners are Muslim and do not serve pork products. 

The cumin lamb was easily my favorite dish of the night! Juicy meat with grilled peppers and onions, with plenty of cumin seasoning and cilantro. A must-order. Other standouts include the hot oil and fish dish (can't remember the exact name), and the braised shrimp with sweet potato and bean sprouts. The blistered green beans are a safe side, and done well. 

About the dumplings: the juicy beef soup dumplings were both beefy and juicy, if you cold manage to get them without tearing. The lamb dumplings are the ones I was most looking forward to, and they were a bit bland. We tried one or two more varieties, and their flavors weren't really as distinct and robust as I'd hoped. I guess we shouldn't have spent so much time taking photos and talking, it seemed the quality went down as they cooled.  

Made reservations for a large group, and they were able to accommodate us- we moved to their large party room in the back and set up the tables to account for additional people, and the space worked well. I would bring a group here again in the future!
