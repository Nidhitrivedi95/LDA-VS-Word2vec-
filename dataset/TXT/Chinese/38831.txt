AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Food and the prices were great! I got the beef broccoli and my husband got the crispy spicy beef. The sauce on the beef broccoli was awesome. I could have just eaten a bunch of veggies with rice and the sauce. I like more veggies than veggie meat in my entrees. The crispy beef was really good, too. I liked the crispy beef better than the regular beef in my dish. Lunch deals served every day. Comes with soup. Plenty of food! I would definitely go back when I am back in town.
