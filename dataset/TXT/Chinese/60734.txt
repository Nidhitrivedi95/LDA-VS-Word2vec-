dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ We needed a fast dinner so we got delivery from this place.  I got the Laad Naa Seafood Combo (pan fried wide noodles with Chinese broccoli in brown gravy with seafood) for $13.

The entree was rather large (bigger portion than I expected) and came in one of those black microwavable dish.  

Nice rich gravy, nice load of seafood, great taste. Definitely would order form here again the next time I'm in Vegas although some of my friends didn't like their entrees.
