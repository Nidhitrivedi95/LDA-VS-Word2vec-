sr0rCMn-XtKATvl9adYQxA Double Ming, I like your name.  My wife loves your Gua Ling Go.  My double milk custard was ok, nothing exceptional.  My younger bro loves your Walnut paste, rich and consistent, very well flavored.  If I had more time, I would revisit and try something else to see what I might have missed.  My 4 Stars is based on my wife/brother's opinion of what they ordered.
