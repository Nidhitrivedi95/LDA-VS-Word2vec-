1MrJJ9tyNyfFrxaNZ67xFg A very nice and surprising addition to this area of Pittsburgh, which has been without a good Asian restaurant in all the 30 years I've been coming to this area. Service was friendly, if a touch slow on a busy night. But the food was worth the wait. Highly recommend the Eight Pearl Duck and the Red Orchid Shrimp. There are several other house specialties, along with the more standard Chinese fare. Steamed Shrimp with vegetables was fresh and well-cooked, not rubbery.
