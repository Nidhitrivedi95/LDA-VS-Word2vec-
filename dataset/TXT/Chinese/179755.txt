X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg We'll see how long this place lasts.  I was impressed going into this place, but I'm a simple guy who does not have high expectations for Vegas clubs.  I'm a resident here now and only venture to party on the Strip when friends and family are in town.  Another reason for not going to these clubs, is probably my age, I'm like a Detective Murtaugh sometimes and feel that I'm "too old fo' this sheeet", haha! But hey I felt young when I saw this caucasian dude in his fifties, maybe sixties, with a nice Magnum PI style Hawaiian button up walk into the club.  The staff was giving me issues for wearing a sweater! WTH, so what if I don't have a collar! Does that make me more dangerous! lol...Well enough about that, as I got in under the radar.  

I usually judge places like this on the quality of the "Hip Hop/RnB Room".   The vibe was pretty good in here.  DJ there was on point with the old school, I felt like I was at Booty Hop or Kaboom (in the Bay back in the day), haha!  It was not too crowded, but had a fair amount of bumpin and grindin.  It was cool to see and experience Ms. Jenny Lynn from Nebraska get hyphy when E40 was being played.  There's your shoutout Jenny!

Most people were in the main room where they play electronic dance music, the DJ lineup is pretty dope for fans of the music - check the lineup for the summer. I could almost understand why the admission price is pretty high, it is like going to a concert if you're a fan of DJ's like Tiesto, deadmau5 or Calvin Harris.

The negatives - drink prices and admission, but that's a given, it a club in the middle of Vegas Blvd.  The collar issue. Lots of stairs, but actually that might be a positive, I didnt have to do any cardio today.

But hey if you want to be a tourist and pay the price, then you have to pay the price.  

There are other places on the to party on the strip. If you need to kill your curiosity and wallet, this is the place to be!
