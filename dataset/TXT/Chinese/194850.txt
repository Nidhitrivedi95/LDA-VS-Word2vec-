zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ My bad experience here prompted me to write my first Yelp review. I often feel the staff at a restaurant can make or break your experience, unfortunately from entering to exiting my service at momofuku was just unnecessarily crappy.

First - my friend and I didn't eat there, we went straight up to the milkbar--which was overrated! A tiny fridge filled with prepackaged goods. Visiting from Vancouver, I wanted a tiny souvenir, they were out of totes and pins but no clear signage confirming that. When we came back downstairs I politely asked the hostess if there were any pins left and she looked at me, then looked at me head to toe (and back again) and said without looking at my face that they were out of pins and proceeded to talk to her other hostess friend. Ok, sure. It would have been nice if she had checked the back at least.

I shrugged it off, ordered our soft serve and waited. It was a Saturday morning so to me, not busy by any means. I asked if we could sit on the empty tables and chairs right in front of us as the whole section was empty. She pointed us to two cramped seats by the window edged by a giant supportive beam and other patrons and told us "you can sit there." I felt it was unnecessarily rude - if she had explained that the seats were for customers eating ramen then I would understand. My friend had bought $20 worth of cookies from the milkbar but it wasn't enough to let us eat for 5 minutes (which is how long it takes to eat the soft serve because it's about as big as a Dixie cup).

I left telling some other guy working there that the girl in the grey sweater was really rude to us. We sat and ate our soft serve in the foyer of the restaurant. The experience was a total let down and the soft serve was underwhelming!
