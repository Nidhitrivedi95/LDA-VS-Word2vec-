EQZPTDAy-lWijb0i8JpHNw Finally a place to get my Xiao long boa fix. I go to toronto but no more. Their spice also is 5 star along with the smile and service which you do not get at most other chinese dumpling places. Although I have never seen lamb XLB in china they make them here and I love them. The pork are just as good but as a Greek we love lamb. I can have it on anything,
