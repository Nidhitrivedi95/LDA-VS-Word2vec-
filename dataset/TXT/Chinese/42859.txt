beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Our first time and I'm really impressed. The place is open and airy, clean... Staff was very friendly and accommodating.... You make your own dipping sauce.... 
Food was awesome... Got medium spicy broth and it was awesome...... I love spicy food and this hit the spot.... They have other broths for people who don't like spicy food...
The idea of a conveyor with color-coded plates with ingredients for pricing is also smart...
Don't be afraid to try stuff as they ave vegetables, fish, tendon, noodles, and duck feet too.
Just like the terminator.... I'll be back !!!
