Ly48L1qSRdLpCSWcs_DWIw Popped in here real quick as its very close to my gym. The place was packed on the weekend and isn't very big but we were seated fairly quickly. 

Staff is friendlier than most Asian establishments but there was a quick rush to remove our plates once we were done (perhaps not enough dishes out back?) 

Only down side is that there isn't very much on the vegetarian side of things to order so I opted for dessert (yes I waned dessert at 10am so judge me!) but the flaky heavenly picture I pointed at was not available on days that it's really busy because it takes too long to make (per my waitress). 

Gutted, I settled for the condensed Milk waffle and a coffee and I can't say I had any complaints for $5 - well maybe that the waffle size was a wee bit on the small side and for that it remains undecided if I shall return.
