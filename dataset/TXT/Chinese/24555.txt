6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag This review is WAY WAY WAY past due, though i am now just getting to it.This review will probably be short, as our wait, but our server never came. We sat for about 20 minutes before getting up and leaving. As we were walking out the door, they never said anything but continued to serve dinner to the other guests which, (not trying to be racist) were of the asian variety. As i was passing by, the scent of the food wafted off the plates and smelled like a sub- par meal to be eating. Despite it being hours after opening, there were not many customers in the restaurant. We should have known it was going to be  bad if even locals ( we live on the other side of town) would not eat the food served. We then went across the street to a place called H.K. Star, which by the way was awesome. Go there instead. Please. That concludes my review.
