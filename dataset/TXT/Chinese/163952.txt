USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw We went for dimsum once because we heard good things about this place. The place was moderately busy and there were many dimsum carts rolling. The staff's English leaves something to be desired as it was difficult to communicate. Some of the dishes, which I knew were supposed to be hot, were cold and dry. If you go early, you may have a better dimsum experience, but otherwise, it was very mediocre.
