safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg been here 2x now and have to say both times its been off the charts. 
egg rolls, spring roll shell but actually has meat in it!
ribs, are okay, not amazing but solid.
wonton soup 4/5
the chicken chow mein= amazing
almond chicken= good, but clear sauce should have specified brown... but still good
just everything tasted great 
def will be going back
