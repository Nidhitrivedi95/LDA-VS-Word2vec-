dblGQtHAzNy1ACis1m2shw Ok, I tried to like this place and was excited with the reviews ...
I hate to say that Panda Express is better and that is BAD!!!!!! 
Ugh! Still searching for a good place in summerlin but I will find it!
We ordered 4 meals to go... Full of fat, dark meat and grease.

We had Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, orange chicken and mushu pork...
The best part of the meal was the white rice...

Sad... Will move on and will never eat here again
