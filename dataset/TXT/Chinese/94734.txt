JfbbFcJgj8Zfn9SjGDnBgQ Was in the area and went for lunch. Saw the rice box special and the woman manning the cash kept pushing to say how good their food was.  So I gave it a try but received a roasted pork and duck (they charge  more than the advertised price) but the main issue was that the meats tasted sourish (gone bad) I brought it back and they declined to do anything. Piss poor service, this type of behavior may work back in China but this is Toronto and have filed a complaint with Toronto Board of Health to investigate their operation
