-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw Bubble tea is the best after a big meal. I usually go get bubble tea with my friend after we finish dinner or whenever we're craving. It has become a dessert choice for us. I usually get the honey green milk tea with grass jelly.  Funny enough, it is the tea of the month at Chatime, which means that for a large it's 3.80 not including toppings or tax. This location is always popping in the evening whether it's a weekday or weekend. 

Pros:
- Drink Quality is always consistent. Some locations can be a hit and miss in the situation where they'll make a drink and it'll be great the first time but the next time it'll be a disappointment. 
- Location is great because there's a lot of food options in the area. 

Cons:
- Limited Parking. There is only street parking so when it's popping, it hard to find parking. You usually have to park at the lot behind shoppers however it is enforced so you would have to pay. 
- Limited seating
- Long line ups
