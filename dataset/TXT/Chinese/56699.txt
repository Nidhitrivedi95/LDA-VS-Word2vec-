CZzRtq0HQKwbBaJJi-Xpnw JJ and his wife, the owners, were exceptionally courteous. I really appreciate his dedication to guest satisfaction. The food was delicious and I have eaten "Chinese" food M-F for 2 years. I will definitely order here again.   NOBODY SHOULD ORDER FROM PANDA WOK ON 117. Just know that this is way better and the food wont leave you with regrets. 

Enjoy your day.
