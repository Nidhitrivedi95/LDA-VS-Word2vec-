The sushi is good (not fabulous 5-star stuff, but quite good) and the quality is very consistent which can be hard to find.  The Chinese is a tad greasy but delicious, I love the fried rice, and the portions on the Chinese are generous.

Tip: If ordering sushi to-go, ask for extra soy sauce.  I always seem to need more than what they put in the bag by habit.
