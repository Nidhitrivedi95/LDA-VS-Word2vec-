It's a newish restaurant located in the same building as Li Wah and Park to Shop.   In fact, it's owned by the same person as Li Wah.  The restaurant is pretty clean and has a fairly decent flow of customers on weekdays.   I've gone here twice.  

The first time I went, we ordered a bunch of dim sum; the second time, we ordered more traditional Chinese dishes.  Both times, my friends and I were relatively satisfied with the food.  I would say it's pretty comparable to Li Wah - not the best in the world, but fine for Cleveland.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I did not think the soup had an "off" smell.  They also supposedly have sushi, some other cuisines and Americanized Chinese food, but the feel of the restaurant seemed Chinese to me, so I was hesitant to try any of it.

The service was a bit sparse and they forgot to bring out one of the dishes that we ordered, which was kind of discouraging.  But I think I might still come here on occasion, just to mix things up a bit.  Wonton Gourmet gets tiring after awhile.
