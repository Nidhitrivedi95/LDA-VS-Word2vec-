s3AG8m6Pzq-vON729pf0gw Don't even bother ordering take out because their phone line is ALWAYS busy on the weekends--because someone in the office is on the phone and they do not care about losing your business!!!!   We've eaten at Zushi for years and their food is delicious but the customer service is terrible.  The owner could not careless.  We live very close & want to see all the neighborhood restaurants succeed.  So, for years we've put up with the sub-par service only because the food is good.  But now, I AM DONE!   We frequently order out & because the phone is consistently busy, my husband will go in and order ---even though it's very inconvenient.  Tonight when he once again questioned their phone system he was told, "Oh, someone in the office must be on the phone and we don't have call waiting"  . .  AGAIN!  My husband proceeded to explain that they may be missing out on some business but the owner's son could careless.  No apologies, no concern.   I've had it with their lack of interest for the customer.  I would rather drive to Val Vista & Baseline and order out from Ra.
