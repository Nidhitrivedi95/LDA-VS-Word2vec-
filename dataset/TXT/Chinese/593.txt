-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw Oh god where do I start. So my friend and I were so looking forward to getting some Chatime after dinner. We order, get our drinks for takeout, and leave. Just as we take our first sips in the car, we find that the tapioca is severely undercooked and impossible to chew. What the heck. I'm lucky to not have experienced indigestion after the many attempts to just suck it up and literally, suck the tapioca up. I ordered the Matcha Latte drink, and it was so powdery. I know that with matcha it's generally difficult to get the consistency right, but damn this drink was like sandpaper to the throat. Really disappointed, and won't be coming back.
