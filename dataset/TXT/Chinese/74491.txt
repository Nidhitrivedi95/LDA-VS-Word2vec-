fojiPcgWlM-FJTxZlz4Idg Finch location. Ordered barbecue spare ribs for take out around 3:00 p.m.  They don not have them on the lunch buffet, only dinner, so I specifically requested that they be made fresh. Got the order home a few minutes later only to find they were ice cold, dry and drowned in sauce.  Obviously they had been cooked the day before, taken from the fridge, put in a container and given to me for my take out order.  I called and spoke to the manager who gave me a credit but what he should have offered me was a complimentary dinner to compensate for the fact that I drove over there and was given day old food which was inedible.
