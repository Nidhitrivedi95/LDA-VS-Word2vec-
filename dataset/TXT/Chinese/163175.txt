UPiwhHLu9xr-82QMKeURqg Cheap and Delicious!!!

My husband, a white guy introduced me, an asian to this place 6 years ago and it is our go-to-feel-good-full-out-of-your-mind-delicious Chinese food. When he first took me here, I was thinking...he just took me to tiny-pacific-mall-of-Mississauga for food, what the hell?!

This place is in an industrial area and in a small mall with a bunch of food stalls. It is like a hole in the wall type of place but beats a lot of the big Chinese restaurants. We never sit there because it's not really a restaurant place but random tables in the hallway. It is always busy though. There are several food courts there but by far Lemongrass is the best one. We only buy from Lemongrass. 

The lady in the front shop is really friendly. She always say see you tomorrow when we purchase food there. She talks so quickly but never ever makes a mistake. 

Some of our favourite dishes are: sambal shrimps, black pepper beef +/- noodles, yeung chow fried rice, green beans (best green beans ever!), sweet and sour pork. They have a lot of selection though.

I've hosted several birthday parties and baby showers and have ordered their party platters before. Guests were full and happy. Super cheap too. For 180$ at one time, it fed 25 people with a ton of left over for everyone to take home. Another time for $115, I fed 15 people and then they have to take it home because there were just too much food remained. 

Super quick, delicious, yet super cheap food. 

Highly recommend!
