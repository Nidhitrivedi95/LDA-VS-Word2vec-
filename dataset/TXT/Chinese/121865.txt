My company orders from this place quite a bit so I've had their take-out and dine-in experience. The staff is a little slow when it comes to understanding coupons and the dinner prices are too high to always go, but I would recommend the lunch specials. The newsletter signup gives you the occasional coupon, so it's worth it to get the deals. The presentation and food tastes pretty good. I especially like their bento boxes.
