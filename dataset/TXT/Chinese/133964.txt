q-3Q3t3RS4qiW51fDIEvyQ Never have I seen a good Chinese buffet, and this is no exception. Not my choice to go here, but I did try to find something I could like. Literally everything here was pretty yucky or on the opposite end, flavorless (or the the wrong flavor). Why so much intense red dye in everything, and why does the blood red "sweet and sour" sauce have only sweetness?  Do they think the red dye will somehow add sourness?  Same stuff they used on the ribs. Do they even taste their food?  I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 only because they have a decent selection of fresh fruit and their wait staff was efficient while I was there.
