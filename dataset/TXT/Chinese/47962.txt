C1JNZrYl3H-YzF1dys9SoQ We just order from Spadina Garden for delivery for the first time. The site was well managed. 

First, the person receiving the order, overcharge us by a little bit and they actually hand written the receipt very sloppily instead of using a computer. Now this is what we order, 1. BBQ pork peking duck style, 2. snow pea with black mushroom, and 3 seafood treasure. 

As a Chinese person myself, I have to say that this was one of the worse tasting place I have ever had. 

There was no taste and bland with snow pea with black mushroom, and it look like they put too much ginger (did not see an ginger). This was the worse dish. 

The seafood treasure, at $17, uses cheap seafood ingredient at the Chinese supermarket, plus they just simply stir-fry it with little or no cooking specialty . Taste was pretty bland, definitely overprice. 

The BBQ pork was probably a bit below average. The sauce were not well mix and the quality of pork was poor. 

To sum it up, it was one of the worse experience I have had, and I will definitely not go again.
