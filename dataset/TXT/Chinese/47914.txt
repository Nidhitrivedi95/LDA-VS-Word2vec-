C1JNZrYl3H-YzF1dys9SoQ Spadina Garden came highly recommended by several friends. Unfortunately our experience did not live up to the hype.  
We ordered spring rolls to start, followed by the house fried noodles (vegetable), orange chicken, spicy peanut chicken, crispy duck, and crispy chili chicken.
All of the dishes, including the spring rolls, were swimming in oil to the point of being almost inedible.  The spicy peanut dish had a really nice flavour, and would have been great if not for the oil.
On the positive side, the restaurant itself was clean and modern, and the service was very quick.
