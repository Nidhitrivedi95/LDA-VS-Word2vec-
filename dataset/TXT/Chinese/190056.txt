YHXczxm4W3BkGT-z7vZBBw In awe at their new "Twilight" series, I decided to come here and give it a try. Me being the curious person I am, I asked a bunch of questions and the cashier was very nice in explaining all of the drinks to me in detail. 

However, this is definitely the first time that I've been to a Chatime where certain drinks were sold out - and to my luck, it was 3/4 of the drinks in the series. So basically, I was forced to have the Hibiscus Sunset Tea. I asked for tapioca and she recommended me not to get it because it messes with the gradient and "specialty" of the drink.. so I listened.

Honestly, the drink wasn't special at all. It could easily pass for any passionfruit tea and I probably would've enjoyed it better had I gotten tapioca with it. I would not order this drink again, but this location is fine. Well-staffed, nice staff, and relatively clean.
