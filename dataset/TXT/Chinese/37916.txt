asAHqgKQtCWiBbC3XriSIQ I grabbed a quick lunch here and I was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the hot and spicy beef with hot and sour soup. The portion was absolutely huge! The soup was not a full, standard size cup, but still more than enough with the rest of the meal.

The meat had was cooked well and the vegetables were plentiful - although the big pieces of green pepper threw me a bit - but this seems to be a common element of most styles of this dish. There also was a note of ginger that was really awesome! 

The spice level of both dishes (soup and beef) could have been better - it was very mild for being listed as "spicy." 

The real standout was the fried rice that came with. This dish was not a mere afterthought and actually had flavor, peas, and carrots - it was good! 

I would definitely be willing to try more of the menu once I finish my leftovers of course.
