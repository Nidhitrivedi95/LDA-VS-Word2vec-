CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Thursday afternoon, I'm thrilled to explore Las Vegas. Then I got hungry. Noticed that Noodles is located inside the Bellagio. Took a wrong turn by the Baccarat table and ended up by the Pool. LOL Asked a Bellagio staff (she was uber nice) and she directed me to Noodles. 

Took about 2 minutes to get the host to notice me and get seated in the back. About 30 seconds, my server was there. 

Ordered hot Green Tea and the XO Crab Vermicelli dish. Wow! The dish arrived within 15 minutes. With just the right touch of spice to get me eating more. I didn't realize I was missing crab meat and bean sprouts and scrambled eggs so much until I tasted the first bite! Taste explosion! In a good way!

I should order the Vietnamese Phone too... My stomach is complaining coz there's no more room!!!
