XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA Cold dreary rainy weather always makes me want a bowl of hot noodle soup, so I found myself here after making a stop at Eaton Centre.  Lucky for me they offer a vegetarian version, since the menu only has beef noodle soup and a dry pork noodle (I believe it was jiajiang mien although I didn't take a close look.) Vegetarian broth with extra veggies and a free side dish! I got the cucumber side dish, although I wanted to try the jellyfish. They have a stewed egg but the price was cheaper so I figured it was more worth it to get the cucumbers.  I also ordered with the widest noodles, and I suggest either getting those or less wide, but not the thinnest ones since you won't be able to appreciate the texture as much.  They forgot to give me cilantro and scallions so I got it on the side. Overall, probably a 3.5 star for noodle consistency. Giant bowl for a small size, good flavor of soup (I ordered extra spicy and it still wasn't very spicy), and cheaper if you pay cash (no tax)? 

Come here and get your carb on.
