Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Great sushi at decent prices! We stayed last week at the Excalibur and wanted a nice sushi dinner. We were lucky enough to get a 20$ dining credit with our hotel reservation and wanted to use it here. We went on a weekday and got seated right away. Great ambiance! Very sexy and romantic. I tried the Rice and Co. Dragon Martini which was WONDERFUL! Made with fresh strawberries MMMmmMM. We ordered the calamari which was DELISH. So perfectly cooked and great dipping sauces. We ordered 2 rolls which now I can't remember their names!! But one had eel and cream cheese and another had spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail. Both were very fresh and delicious. We really enjoyed it and seriously spent as much money on the food as we would have at home. For sure a place to check out if you are not on a "living large"  Vegas budget but want excellent sushi!
