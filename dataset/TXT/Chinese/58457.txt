We recently discovered Sana Tandoori Palace after playing at Parc Jarry and then walked the short distance to this neighborhood in search of a new Indian restaurant to patronize. We are so glad we tried the Sana Tandoori Palace. The food is delicious and the prices will make you believe that you are in Bombay. The chana samosas are crispy and filled with delicious goodness. The tandoori chicken is cooked to perfection. There is a huge selection of different kinds of naan... chicken, qeema, garlic, tandoori. We recommend the beef curry... there are yummy bits of ginger in a garlicky and delicious sauce and the best part... it is only $8 and enough to feed 4 people.
