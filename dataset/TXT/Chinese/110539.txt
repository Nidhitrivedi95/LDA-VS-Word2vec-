Lv9wzkvPrVG-VdPGcw53_A I've been to a couple of these places before, but this is place was the best that I have been. 

First off, the food is very fresh. They bring the seafood to your table to see the freshness of the animal. Once you have verified that the food is fresh, it is taken to the back to be cooked. The seafood is very sweet to the taste as it is extremely fresh. 

The difference between this location and other locations is that it feels that we get more bang for our buck. For example, with the crab legs, we go two dishes. They explained that it is because the legs are extremely long. They have to split it into two dishes for us. Yet at other places, there is just one dish. The portions are the same size, but at other places, it is just one dish. 

Looking at the decor, it is a standard Chinese restaurant. Nothing special. The only difference is that we can see the seafood in the tanks. It is a huge attraction for the kids. 

Service can improve. They were not very friendly. Some of the staff had attitude. Thus, they lost a star here.
