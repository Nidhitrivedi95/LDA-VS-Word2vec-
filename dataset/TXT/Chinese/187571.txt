yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA the reason why i never reviewed this place is because we always go here after a whole day of drinking so i never remember what we ate. over the course of the years, i remember eating and liking the pho, the amazing coconut in the young coconut shell, which is not only fun to eat, but very hydrating for the hungover.
