XEKx5litKe1KkfJpqtmJUw this place isn't bad. everything is pretty much standard chinese food.

the one dish that stood out for me was this hot bowl? dish or something? whatever but it had. a steamed egg or tofu type thing? i don't know which one, it was shaped like tofu would be but tasted like steamed egg.

i don't know where i'm going with that but i have a funny story.

my brother in law who is white was at dinner with us. and i was debating with my sister about the name of this place as i was checking in on yelp.
I asked, 'what is this place called?'
she said, 'Dong G-E-E'
Then i saw on yelp it was called dong kee, so i said, it's not dong gee, it's dong kee. and we debated for a good 30 seconds. and the token white guy says donkey?
So when these deep fried ribs came out and he asked what kind of meat they were, i said donkey.
