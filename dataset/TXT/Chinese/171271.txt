VxnZy3cU-ItbYiDK5XDX8g This place is deceptively bad. On surface, everything looks good. The decor is clean and modern, the service is nice, and the food looks quite good. Don't fall for it. Every dish we got was oversalted or with too much sauce. It was also all made with poor quality food. Vegetables lacked freshness, meats were cheap fatty cuts, etc.

Two stars because everything else is done well, but if the food isn't good none of that matters.
