yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A My boyfriend and I have been here a few times. The first time we were invited for a party get together. We had a great experience and the food was great. So we have been returning to enjoy a great meal. We always get two of the same things on the meal, the crab puffs and the beef lo mien are our favorites! We always choice another different entree to get as well. There menu has a lot to choose from, so we never have a problem finding something that sounds good, more of a problem trying to just pick the one thing. So far everything we have ever ordered has been delicious. The portions are pretty big, we order two entrees to share and always still have leftovers to take home. I highly recommend giving this place a shot if you're looking for a great meal!
