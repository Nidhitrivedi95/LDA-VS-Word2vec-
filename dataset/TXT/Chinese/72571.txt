fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA Love this dumpling house. I don't find the food amazing or anything, but it is great place for cheap eats and dumplings.

You can order a lot of food to make a great complete meal. Shanghai noodles and egg drop soup for example. I have never seen a line up here yet, so that can be a plus when you just want to quickly be seated and eat. Staff are friendly here!
