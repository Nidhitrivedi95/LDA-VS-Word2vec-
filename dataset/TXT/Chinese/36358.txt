Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Nestled on the Atrium level in the Luxor, I found the decor & atmosphere approachable with a hip vibe and the menu reasonably priced. The specialty roll selections were very interesting...and very good. We had the "Yes Grasshopper" and the "Fre Kin Good' rolls.

They have a wide variety of signature cocktails and we enjoyed the Sake Sangria and the Mamason's Kiss.

I found the entree menu with many traditional Chinese dishes that you usually don't see on the strip without that "fusion-pan-asian" flare. Our group tried the Peking Duck w/ mini moo-shu pancakes, Mongolian Beef and Pecan Shrimp.  All dishes were flavorful and the service was attentive. And you must try the Fried Banana dessert. The presentation is over the top!  We will return for sure!
