DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA We ordered our food, right away the waiter came back served the rice, i thought the rest is following. It took a while for the protein to come. So i already scoop out the rice, sitting on my plate getting cold. Second we wanted silverware since we dont know how to use chopsticks but no waiter is around us, so i have to serve myself. But my main complain is the rice, why serve rice and sit on the table get cold whole waiting for the main entrée. So we end up eating cold food instead. Rstaurant is not even busy. Just 5 table, 2 waiters. And then we needed water,  and not one of them came and check if we were ok. I could have been choking to death and they dont even know it.
