ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg Been here for years since I was a little kid. I never really written a review until I started a yelp page but this place rocks. Compared to other dim sum places I've been to like Toronto and California, this place isn't that bad for Midwest Cleveland. 

They have dim sum on weekends from 10am-3pm and it's best to arrive early since the place can fill out fast. Food is charged based on how large or small the plate is. 

My most recent visit we ordered at most all large plates which were $3 each and the smalls are like $2.50. I went with my family for Labor Day weekend and there were 5 of us. We ordered the shrimp noodle, shu-Mai, ha gow, tripe, spicy chicken feet, and seafood lo mein. Everything tasted delicious and I can't forget about their egg tarts. The only downside is that they add lots of msg to their food so make sure you drink lots of water!
