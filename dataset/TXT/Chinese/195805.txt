ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg Congee Quenn has become one of my fav spot for Chinese food. The service here is fast, efficient and the services are friendly. Price range for their food is reasonable, for $10.95 you can get a huge noodle or rice dish which is totally worth. At this location they offer a special lunch menu between 1-5pm (I believe) and whatever main dish you order from this menu, you receive a free drink. You have choices like (red bean freeze, lemon tea hot/cold  and HK style milk tea hot/cold). Congee Queen is definitely worth a try if your in the area.
