PeUFhzP8rlfd7guK3dO6nQ This was my first contact with traditional chinese medicine, acupuncture, etc. 

The place and the people are warm and welcoming. David has been working with me for the last two visits. I have been coming here for neck, stress issues and a pulled muscle. My job as a personal trainer & business owner  is highly physical and can be stressful at times. David used a mix of Tui na (traditional chinese massage) and acupuncture and the relief that I have experienced in two treatments has been amazing. I am looking forward to working with them in the future.
