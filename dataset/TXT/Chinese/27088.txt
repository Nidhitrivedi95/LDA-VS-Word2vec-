7zQejWAhY4v4LXHR6bY7dg It was my first time to have Shanghai food in Canada. It was not totally authentic but it was good enough. The soup dumpling (xiaolong) was awesome. The scallion pancake was fine. The small pork bun (shengjian) was not right at all lol. The stinky tofu was fine but I preferred sweet sauce. We also ordered red bean yuanzi, it was not authentic but it was still delicious. Also Shansi (don't know how to say that in English lol) it was kind of expensive among all the dishes, it was fine.
