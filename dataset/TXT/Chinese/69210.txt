eWhVkKqvyfEaC-BGa8ftvg Great little place in the neighbourhood. Items I recommend include spicy green beans, house special hakka noodle, chilli chicken and Bombay chicken. Food is flavourful and spicy (if you ask for it spicy). The food is similar to Spicy Dragon or Fredericks. Not as good as Spicy dragon but it's very close to our place and they deliver.  Prices are very reasonable as well. Did not give 5 stars because some items were slightly over salted for my taste.
