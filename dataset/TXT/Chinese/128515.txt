PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ First time here i was told the food is good.  I ordered food to go it's taken 45 min to get it if you don't have time to wait I don't recommend this place.  It seems busy which is a good sign but when ordering dim sum to go and it takes that long I have to give it a low rating.
