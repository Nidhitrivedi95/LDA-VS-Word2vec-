OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw The food here was okay. I went to this one because of all the Yelp reviews but I don't think it was worth all the hype.

The wait time at 11:30 was about 30 minutes long (not too bad) but the food was just okay. I felt like the rice wrapped in shrimp tastes a little bit artificial and the Shu Mai didn't have as much flavor as I though it would. 

There was about 5 ladies pushing the cart and I thought it was funny when people were running up to them and taking things off their cart instead of letting them walk by. The Chinese donut was extremely fried and almost as yellow as turmeric but my boyfriend said it was delicious. 

I think the service could have been better too as the ladies pushing the cart skipped our table and other tables next to us a few times. All in all, I think I will give it another shot before I make my final decision. The place was clean and the floors were clean- at least they have that down!
