tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw ATTN ANDREA: I'm super super sorry, I was short on cash that day and only tipped you 18% when I really wanted to tip you much more! If we have you as a server next time, I'll make up the difference to you!

Really impressed with the level of service at this particular PF Changs. Andrea was our server and ensured that our party had everything that we needed. I ordered two drinks, the first was the coconut mojito which had the right balance of coconut milk with the traditional expectations of what a mojito should have (mint, lime, rum, soda). Second drink I got was the mai tai; really strong and really reminiscent of an Arnold Palmer!

For entrees, my party ordered the vegetable egg (spring?) rolls, the ginger chicken with broccoli, chili-garlic green beans and the salt/pepper prawns. All of these dishes were excellent! I will attach photos to my review shortly after posting.

Ambiance wise, this PF Chang's has the bar directly viewable as soon as you enter, with dining tables situated around the bar. Plenty of tables, yet this place gets so packed so quickly with how popular PF Chang's can be!

Service wise, my server Andrea was great, came by at the right moments and offered suggestions when asked, but more importantly, the entire front of staff was incredibly attentive. Simple gestures like staff opening the front door for guests resonates in customers' minds when they think "PF Chang's".

Would return and already have :)
