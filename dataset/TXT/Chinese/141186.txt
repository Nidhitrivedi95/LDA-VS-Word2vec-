rdifwelsxkuUf-tw2O4o1g I was starving and happened to stop by this place. It's a hole in a wall under new management. Tried their lunch special garlic chicken. I must say that I was very happy. The place is very clean and staff is amazingly polite. Food was very tasty and fresh. I will definitely come back
