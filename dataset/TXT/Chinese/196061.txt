zkU-WMio8g6dpRJ2Y2xqvQ More higher end Chinese food as you can tell by decor and pricing but I found the quality of food justified that. I tried a couple of a la carte dishes including wok fried scallops and steamed chicken and I really enjoyed the food. Service was attentive. I only tried dinner however.

It is more catered to larger groups as their set meals seem to be great value. Will likely be back as I would like to try their Peking duck and crab dinner set for 6 people at $138. Seems to be a good price and a popular choice for the tables around me.
