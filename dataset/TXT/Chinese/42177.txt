bbFjlDYqeZvHFfitD9nFIg Mil got a free coupon for a sesame chicken dish. So we came here for dinner to try it out. Read the reviews on Yelp, so wasn't expecting a lot. Saw a lot of rotating fans, maybe their air con was not strong enough. Saw pictures of the chef with Mayor Scarpelli & Chef Yan. 

Decor is kind of tacky, golden chair covers & red table cloths. Golden Dragon & Phoenix on the wall near the stage. 

A Soup of the Day came to our table: Pork with Veggie

We ordered a 4 dish set meal: 
Ginger Juice Stir Fried Chinese Broccoli
Stir fried Snow Peas with Fish
Braised Tofu with Fish
Garlic Stir Fried Lobster
Free: Sesame Chicken (b/c of coupon)

My favourite was the lobster and braised tofu and fish.   Both were full flavour and was very tasty. The free sesame chicken was very tasty too and quite a big portion for a free dish. 

Finisher was a purple rice sweet soup. It was quite good as well. 

Overall, the service was ok, food was not bad either. 
I would come back again to try their dim sum etc.
