-juOL0eJC6kvf5RLEjoPvA Definitely the best dimsum in the Montreal area and no resto comes close. Definitely try out the regular shrimp and pork dumplings, shrimp and beef rice rolls( cheun fun), fried shrimp dumplings, deep fried seaweed seafood rolls. If you are on the adventurous side definitely try out the braised chicken feet, honey comb beef tripe, or braised tendons.

This place loses one star due to their service, dim sum ladies have a bad attitude.
