I thought I saw everything but somehow missed the grilled pineapples until the end! The sushi was delicious and there were so many kinds to choose from. The dessert area was a heaven of different little cakes, flan, creme brûlée, etc... The whole restaurant was themed as well, with carved bamboo animals, an assortment of ornate chairs, and other distinct designs. One thing I will note is that it can get crowded on Saturday nights, so get ready to do some serious plate dodging! This was one of the best buffets I have come across.
