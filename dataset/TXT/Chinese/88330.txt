I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg This is the most amazing dessert place in Phoenix. They have the best snow in all of Arizona! 

The mix of ice cream and shaved ice is to die for. The flavors that they carry, along with the toppings and drizzle flavors are all so good.

If you come here you won't regret it, it's much better than any Coldstone or Dairy Queen.

Just be open minded and give Snoh a try !!
