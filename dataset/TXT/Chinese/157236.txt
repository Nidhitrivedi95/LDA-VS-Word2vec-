TTVXY5vOJDqC0_Je8UhK8A I go here often,  My family has diverse taste and we can usually accommodate everyone without any issues,  Vegetarian's are happy, combo meals are great - the eggrolls though large are extremely tasty. The sweet and sour chicken are one of my favorites. Its an inexpensive go to spot that does not disappoint.
