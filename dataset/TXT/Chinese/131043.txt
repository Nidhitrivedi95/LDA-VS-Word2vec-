Though the circular table was a bit in a weird location, right in the corner by the stairs, lots of cross traffic, it didn't distract as much as I thought it would. 
Nick, our waiter, didn't rush us, but when we later told him we had show tickets, he made sure we got outta there on time. 
We started with edemame and shishito peppers. These were good peppers but not my fav. We ordered a few different things and shared the dishes. Shrimp & veggie tempure- great spicy dipping sauce. Miso sea bass (large plate) it was the best thing we had there. El Topo roll- I was worried how the cheese would be, but the roll was really good. The Sasa handroll left much to be desired IMO. Agedashi tofu had lots of flavor in the sauce that is used. Other dishes were ordered which I didn't try, but everyone liked the food. One eh thing was that the table would get full and we would have to flag down a waiter to take away the empty plates, as oppose to them coming by often to check. 
There was an extensive sake list, but we opted for a bottle of wine. Nick made sure our glasses stayed full. If you are looking for some non-traditional sushi, this is your place.
