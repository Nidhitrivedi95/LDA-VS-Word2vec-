W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g While "home" for the holidays I was really craving pho. I grabbed my daughter to set out and find some. Armed with our iPhones and Yelp app we found Simi's Cafe. I've only ever had pho at 1 other restaurant so I don't have a ton to compare it to, but it was great. The ingredients were fresh and the price was perfect. My daughter ordered the orange peel chicken and said that it was the best she has ever had. It was only $4.99 on the lunch special menu. The staff was friendly and attentive. When I'm home, I'll be going back to try more dishes. Loved it!
