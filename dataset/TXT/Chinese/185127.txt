XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA So excited to have a Lanzhou Ramen restaurant near my working place. Always has waiting line, typically 10-15 min wait for one person seat. Very simple menu. Traditional noodle is my favorite. The side dishes are not so good. Maybe could try beef if feels noodle itself is not enough. Big portion though, and I could hardly finish small bowl.
