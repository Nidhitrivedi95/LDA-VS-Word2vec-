EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q For sure the best Chinese food in the west valley no doubt about it. The quality of the food for the quantity and price is something you find once in a lifetime. The tenderness to crispness ratio for the orange chicken makes Panda Express look like they're serving chicken nuggets. Not only do they provide the entree but they always give you the dankest egg drop soup with sweet and sour sauce. I'm originally from Tempe but my boys and I will drive 45 min just to eat at this establishment. The only negative thing I have to say about this joint is that they always assume I want brown rice. They will however always fix this for you without complaint.
