My personal favorites include: 1) the crab rangoons-fluffy and delicious. 2) the Dragon and the Phoenix. It's a great combo of general tso's chicken and tangy shrimp. 

The delivery has never been more than 45 minutes and everything arrives hot. The drivers are prompt and friendly. 

I can't speak to the restaurant since I've never eaten there, but if you are looking for some tasty delivery this is a great spot.
