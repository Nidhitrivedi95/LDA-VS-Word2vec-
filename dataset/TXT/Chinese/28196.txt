- Needs more parking since the place is so popular.  I come here mainly to ride the Vegas Express Bus (Chinese bus) between Vegas Chinatown and L.A. for $25 one-way.
- Compared to Cali any Chinese (or Vietnamese) business in Vegas is usually not as good whether it be 99 Ranch supermarket, Sam Woo's BBQ restaurant, dim sum, banh mi or pho.  Still, I think the quality and definitely the prices for Asian products and food is good considering we're in the middle of a Nevada desert.
