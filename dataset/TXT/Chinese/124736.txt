ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ I went there yesterday because of the location and because of the memories that I had there. I've been there a couple of times and I enjoyed it every one. The food were very authentic and service was okay. The restaurant is on the expensive side of the spectrum for sure: two of us spent 72 dollars tips included without ordering anything particularly expensive.
