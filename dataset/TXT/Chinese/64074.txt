CSB: 4/5 - Good dish if a bit too flavourful for me. A unique take on char siu bao which does make it a bit tastier.

Macau Cauliflower Curry: 4/5 - Pretty good. Decent size and a pretty unique concept with the cheungfun

Scallop Ceviche: 3/5 - Decent. I wouldn't order it again though. The flavour didn't really do it for me.

Kalbi: 5/5 - Definitely the best dish of the night. Tender meat and great flavour. We cleaned up the rice cake underneath as well.

Bibimbap: 4/5 - Good, but I prefer some meat in my bibimbap. The waitress asked us if we wanted her to mix in the hot sauce. Good thing we chose to do it ourself because it's inherently spicy.

Peking Duck: 3/5 - The duck meat itself is fantastic and the way they cook it is very unique. However, I actually prefer the traditional Chinese pancakes (thinner and stretchy) to the thick hard ones they use because you can't really taste the hoisin and duck flavours as well with all that breading. It feels like they used the pancake just to make it different rather than better. Because of that, I honestly prefer peking ducks from more traditional Chinese restaurants for like half the price. They should give you the choice of what style of pancakes you want. Also, it's kind of ridiculous they only give you 8 pancakes and charge extra for more considering it's +$70 for the duck in the first place.

Overall, this place is currently pretty underrated on Yelp. Sure, the food isn't the best Asian  fusion food I've had, but it IS good. Maybe we skipped the "miss" dishes I guess. The atmosphere is pretty unique for Chinatown as well and the service was good.
