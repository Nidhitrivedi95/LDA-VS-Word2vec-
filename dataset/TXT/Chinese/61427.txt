drIFrAyZnyismS1ArZlmAg One of the best vegetarian, vegan restaurants I have ever experienced.  I go here at least twice a week. Meals include gluten free items as well. A must try is their curry but I have many more favorites. Their tofu dishes are delicious and full of flavor. I have loved  everything I have had here. You should know that I am not always a vegetarian or vegan, but know where to go when I need a good healthy meal.
