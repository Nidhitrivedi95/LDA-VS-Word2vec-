oAbPUdAp-7HgJ9hHkanAbA I love Shanghai food! Everything we ordered was delicious, especially the Pork Rump Shanghai Style. The meat literally fell off the bone! The Garlic Eggplant Claypot was good, but too oily. I don't really like food soaked in oil. I also ordered a refreshing watermelon juice without sugar (you can easily make this at home, just blend ice with watermelon). The Shanghai Panfried rolls were delicious too. There was sesame seeds on the bottom which made it extra crispy when you bite into it. 

The restaurant looks clean and also the decor is inviting. Love this place and will come back soon!
