d51qbs6CitHbFD--G-AEVw Thank goodness the delivery guy came in and turned up the heat!  We sat at the table furthest from the door, freezing (sitting there in full winter gear).  
The restaurant looked more like an abandoned storage unit (lots of old toys and a piano).  
The bill was outrageous two TINY dinner specials and two cans of warm soda $25.  *The meat tasted like mock meat and the service was sub-par.
