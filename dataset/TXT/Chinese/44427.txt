BJ9GwNMo8vIgSuKc6B_mOw i had one of the best meals of my LIFE here! Never tried the dim sum, but the combo meals are A 1 the combo that includes lobster was my favourite
I get that its too expensive for some but when I want to go somewhere  for a special occasion and eat like a queen, this is one of my gems i've found 
I didn't even want to share my experience because I felt like it was my own special spot but honestly they deserve it! Consitantly good
