yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA On a cold, blustery day in Las Vegas, I was craving pho.  It was the kind of craving I could taste!  Thank goodness, Pho Kim Long was not far from our Strip hotel, and despite the fullness of the parking lot and the dozen or so people waiting ahead of us, we were seated within a few minutes, ordered immediately, and received our steaming bowls of pho very quickly, with a smile, and with a return visit to bring more water and see how we were doing a few minutes after that.  One of the things I loved was that they gladly made me a pho that wasn't on the menu:  my favorite combination of chicken and shrimp.  Some places won't do that at all, and others skimp on one or the other.  Not here; both the chicken and the shrimp were bountiful.  They also didn't balk when we asked for extra jalapeno.  In addition, the decor of the place is very appealing, with none of that garish lighting and wretched music that plagues too many Oriental restaurants.  My only criticism is that the restroom could've been cleaner and could use some mirrors over the lavatories.  Overall, though, I loved it and will return.
