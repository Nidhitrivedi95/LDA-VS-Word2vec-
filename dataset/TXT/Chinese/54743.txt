cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw OMG! A big mistake to go there! 

I would say that the food was Okay, but the service sucks! It was really a chaos when we were there. All the waiters seemed unhappy and not willing to help guests. The elder female, owner-like lady, kept yelling at all the employees, trying to get things done in a good manner. However, this seemed helpless and everything was still in a big mess. We ate up all the dishes and soups but the Twisted Cruller never came up, which was our main target of the visit. Will never visit again!
