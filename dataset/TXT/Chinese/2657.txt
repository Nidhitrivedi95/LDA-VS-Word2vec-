_fTBHNW58xuw0MMbgZTz9w 1.  Poor service as there were only two people for the entire lunch crowd (one busboy and one cashier/server). 
2.  Tables were sticky, floor was dirty.
3.  No offer of drink choice, just plopped down water.  No offer of complete menu, just the very Americanized lunch specials.
4.  Hot and sour soup was neither spicy nor sour, nor was there an offer of a different option for soup.
4a. Not an egg roll, but a spring roll.
5.  Kung Pao chicken had an odd aftertaste that I didn't like the taste of - and it was only the chicken that had that taste.  I ate the vegetables after trying a couple of bites of chicken.
6.  The busboy spraying bleach-smelling stuff right next to us while we were eating was not good.

All in all- very disappointed.  I would like to see if Dirty Dining has been there.
