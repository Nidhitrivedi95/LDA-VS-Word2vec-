bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ if youre looking for fresg cooked egg rolls and perfectly crisped orange chicken then look no further. This place has outstanding customer service, But it doesn't stop there. I get it everyone... you hate waiting for food longer than a few minutes... but were not at mcdonalds here. THIS PLACE IS WHERE ITS AT. I would wait an hour for a meal here. I noramally wait about 15-25 minutes when I order things from here but it's totally worth it.
