LRPp4mqZ0DLq9Vx-E2MnxA Chez Mein, aka 2$ Chow Mein, is legendary on the Main.  Chez main operates in a tiny space on St. Laurent.  They have enough room for 4-10 people to sit and no bathroom.  There is no menu but rather bristol boards that are brought outside when the drunk rush starts.  

The food itself is nothing really special.  It's extremely greasy, "Chinese"/Canadian food served on the street.  What makes it special is the fact that you can get a large serving of peanut butter covered chow mein noodles for 2$.  This may not seem like a big deal, but bring someone who's never been after a few drinks and they will be amazed.  The food always seems to "hit the spot" after a couple of beers.  Plus, it's vegetarian friendly, so everyone's happy!
