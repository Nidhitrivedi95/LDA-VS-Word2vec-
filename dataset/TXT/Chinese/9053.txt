1PMwRG0uWGxk2hIVEQj62A Came here for lunch today.  I haven't been here for a long time but it's just changed management, so we decided to try it out.

We only ordered 6 dishes of dim sum and they were all 2* max.   We ordered the basics, har gow, siu mai, chicken feet, beef rice rolls, steamed salmon fish head and shrimp paste squid.  There was something not right with each dish.  Beef rice roll was thick and not smooth, filling was ok.  Sui mai was not juicy, dry and bland.  Chicken feet was too sweet and pale in colour, not brown enough.  Squid was too sweet and cut up too small.  Best dish was har gow but not worth the price.  I can get much better dim sum at the lower end restaurants.  

Service is ok here but it's because there's not many patrons, hence the 3* rating.  Not worth the prices they charge for this mediocre food.  They seem to have a lot of dinner specials, like sea cucumber in abalone sauce for only $2.99 each.  Peking duck for only $22.50.  Might give dinner a try but not coming for dim sum again.
