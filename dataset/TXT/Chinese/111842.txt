MBirSnTW4pt2k7Ny6KC72w Greasy cheap chinese food. Ordering was a bit confusing. It seemed like there's about one employee who speaks English. You get a big styrofoam box of whatever meat and vegetables you order, with a lot of rice underneath. Everything runs around five bucks. So lots of bang for your dollar. Food was prepared pretty quick. I certainly wasn't wowed by the food, but it was fine. If I was drunk it would probably have been revelatory. Food was expectedly Americanized. The decor is kind of dumpy. But this isn't a place you go for atmosphere anyway.
