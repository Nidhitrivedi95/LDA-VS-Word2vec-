NKMkvLWatV9v7zbMNS6D3g I know good chinese food. This is good chinese good. Egg rolls above par, sweat and sour sauce is out of this world. Crab rangoons and egg rolls are best with it. General chens chicken is the greatest fast food chinese dish ever created. CRISPY white meat chicken smothered in sweat spicy sauce. Yes, even covered it that amazing goup, it's still super crispy. Simply put...amazing stuff!
