Cjs6QghR-nIninfgAoErvw Saigon Gourmet is the place to go if you are very hungry but don't have anything specific in mind. Its meals are consistent, fairly priced and comes in generous portions. There are the dinner for 2, 3 or 4 deals, which is what I usually choose when going with my family. A dinner for 3 can easily serve 5, and we always wrap the left to go. Food doesn't take long to prepare, by the time the hot tea is served the chicken balls are rolling out.
Total cost for today's dinner for 3: $40 with beverages, tax and tips included. P.S.: Dinner combos are also served at lunch time.
There is free Wi-Fi and plenty of free parking spots around the corner (enter on Manning Ave and return on Clinton St) or park on the dime just in front of it.
They take lots of takeaway orders and also do delivery.
