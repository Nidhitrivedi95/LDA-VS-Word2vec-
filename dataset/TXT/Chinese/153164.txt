t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q I have ordered from then once online and the food tasted good. What turned me off is when I tried to order them for a second time online on a separate occasion. Just like the last time my friends and I ordered a couple of items to have it delivered to our address and waited approximately 30-40 minutes. After waiting we decided to call them to see why it was taking so long to have them tell us that we clicked 'pick up' and the food was ready. We were then told it would take an additional 20 minutes to arrive, which then turned into an hour wait. It became evident that either the website was having an error or they did not realize the order until we called and needed to cook and deliver it. It was poor customer service to try to blame the customers for their fault and the food is not worth the lacking customer service.
