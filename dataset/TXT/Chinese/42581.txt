Outside seating is at once invigorating & stiffling.. beautiful shade, fast service (sometimes an issue for outdoor seats). It's also right next to a bustling sidewalk and there's a bus stop fifteen feet away.. prepare to eat on view for 20+ people if crowds bother you. 

Service was fast, efficient & robotic. "Do you want another drink yet" started our interaction and was quickly followed by "are you ready for food?" No name, no "how was ____?" during our entire visit.

Cocktails were disappointing.. the B squared and Lady Boss are refreshing with nuanced fruit & yet little booze and no interplay.

Food was equally mixed. The tangy pimento needed more spice. The dry short rib cheddar biscuits were rich & one-note, bernaise-dominated. The pork-belly bites had more nuance, nice contrast from pork to pineapple, the smokey aioli adding requisite salt and spice. 

The best of all was the soba w/crab and edamame. Light & husky, bold & subtle, crunch & creamy. Prob the quintessential dish at Grit & Grace, a definite must when visiting.
