d51qbs6CitHbFD--G-AEVw We ordered dinner thru yelp and thought we were good...our meal never came. We finally called the restaurant and they say they don't use yelp....if that's the case why is it shown as an option...I'm still hoping I don't get charged....we ended up ordering via phone, food was late getting to us and the chicken was a lot of breaded dark meat...mainly bread. My granddaughter had chicken fried rice..she kept telling us there was something crunchy..the rice wasn't cooked...bad night for Shanghai!!
