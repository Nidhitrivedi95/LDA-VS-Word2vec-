yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Lets start with Service... The service is pretty damn horrible. When I always go to Pho Kim Long I feel like I'm not wanted there. I feel that if your gonna open up a business that "Serves" people, then SERVE the people. This place has the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. 

Food. its eh nothing to boast about.

If I could give this place half of 1/4 of a star I would =\

PS. if you want thai tea just go next door to LEE's Sandwiches .. they at least get it to you.
