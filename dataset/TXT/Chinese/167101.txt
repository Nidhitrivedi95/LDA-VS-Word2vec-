vFYvsI5KK_XGWCifg8LvCQ I'd give them 4.5 if I could. Food was really good. Though the sweet and sour chicken could have been a larger portion compared to the accompanying rice. The beef noodles was a solid choice,the woman mentioned how proud they were to use this particular source of bean sprout. Hyping the perfect ripeness compared to many competing restaurants. They were good, they are also just bean sprouts so I don't know. Yes, some places have raw bean sprouts and I usually don't eat it. I will return to try more!
