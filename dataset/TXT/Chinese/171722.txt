VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ This place is packed on Saturdays and as I read about their lunch deal on Saturdays for 6$ ,I am kind of unbelievable .Even I called up before I reach there to make sure about the deal.:-)

As we entered on a Saturday afternoon, we found the place is almost filled and our waitress helped us getting a table very quickly and she answered all my questions very promptly. So here I explain the deal of Saturday. Anything on their lunch menu (Entrees) are absolutely 6$ complimented with a salad and a choice of white/brown rice.

Apart from that , I give the stars for their staff and taste of the food. This place is highly recommended on your lazy weekends or when your taste buds demands some Asian food.
