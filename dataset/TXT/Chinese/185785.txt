Y1wzvTTI_rSAJOF1224LCQ This place appears very clean.  Their staff was there when you needed anything without hovering.  I didn't witness any thumbs in the food when the trolley pushers served the food.  

I tried their chicken feet in black bean sauce, traditional shrimp dumpling aka ha kow in Cantonese, pork dumpling aka siu mai in Cantonese, Chinese donut sticks wrapped in rice roll aka cha lerng served with a peanut & hoisin sauce (surprisingly, this sauce was not straight from the bottle, it was actually "treated" so that it was not over-powering), and baby beef spare ribs in black bean sauce.  I found the ha how and siu mai very average, meaning I couldn't taste a difference between theirs' and other restaurants.  Their cha lerng was really nice, the added touch with the sauces made an immense difference.  I guess it's the same way a good dressing can make such a difference on plain old salad or how a jar of pasta sauce is compared to the home made tasty versions.  Their chicken feet were perfectly done.  I find that sometimes these get over-steamed and the meat just falls right off the bones and they lack the texture.  These ones were done perfectly, much like pasta al dente versus pasta when you walk away and get carried away in conversation.

The thing that pleased me the most was the bill.  As with most dim sum restaurants, the prices are lower for early risers.  Their prices were unbelievable though.  I dine with my tween daughter for about $30 (tip not included) in Chinatown at the early riser price.  When I ate here, my sister, daughter and I dined for $34 (tip included).  My sister does not have the figure of a big eater but let's just say that if she had normal metabolism, she'd look more like Mario Batalli.  So, needless to say, I recommended my best friendto trek it up here and try the food...as I would recommend to anyone else.
