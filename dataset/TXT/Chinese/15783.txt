3Ru1_F8GoUcV-QwhX378hA Fast (including delivery)!  And reasonably priced.  We've been going to Asia Lee for a few years now.  Love the fact that they deliver.  Cause well sometimes you just don't feel like leaving the house, ya know.  

Oh and if your order is over $15, you can get a free (select) entree - Usually either Fried Rice or Sweet and Sour Chicken.  

Generous portions = Leftovers!  :)  

Though the strip mall it's located in can be perceived as dicey, its not that bad of a location.  I love the fact that they've made all of the parking in front a "No Cab Zone".
