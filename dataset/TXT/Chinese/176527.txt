Wpfv64KNkGwMzfo2B_VAuQ One of my favourite Hunan restaurants! My mom is from there so I eat my fair share of spicy food and this place is delicious! 
Recommended dishes: 
<U+519C><U+5BB6><U+5C0F><U+7092><U+8089> (traditional delicious Hunan dish!) 
<U+53E3><U+5473><U+5C71><U+836F> (spicy white Chinese yam)
<U+5B89><U+4E1C><U+8FA3><U+5B50><U+9E21> (spicy fried chicken pieces) 
<U+519C><U+5BB6><U+7092><U+9999><U+5E72> (dried tofu, pork, spicy green pepper) 

All the above are spicy! They might make your tummy feel funny the next day but they taste is worth it. 

Their egg custard buns <U+5976><U+9EC4><U+5305> are okay too if you're down for something small and sweet after the spicyness. 

Don't ever order their soups though.. Takes forever. 

Also, sorry about my translations... I don't know their actual English names. 

In conclusion, this place is a must go if you're around and love spicy Chinese food!
