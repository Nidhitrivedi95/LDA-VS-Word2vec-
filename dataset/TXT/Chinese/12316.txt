2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w We just moved here from San Antonio, not exactly the Chinese food mecca, but we were looking for our fix out here in the desert.  Not only did we enjoy the food, we were very pleased with the service.  The family that runs the restaurant went above and beyond to make my large family feel at home.  The food came in large portions and was better than we expected.  We have stopped looking for another Chinese food restaurant.
