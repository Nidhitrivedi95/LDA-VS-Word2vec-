CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I was in Las Vegas for the Pacqiao vs. Cotto fight and happened to meet my friends for breakfast at this place.

According to the name of the place and what I have seen online, this place is supposed to be a "noodle house." Now, I didn't get around to any noodles because it was breakfast time... so being half Chinese myself, I ordered Chinese breakfast... aka Dim Sum.

As far as Dim Sum goes, they had everything I could have wanted:
   - Pork Siu Mai
   - Shrimp Siu Mai
   - Har Gow
   - Sio Pao
   - Chicken Feet (gross to Americans, delicacy for Asians)

Everything was nicely prepared and tasted excellent... especially the Chicken Feet. I guess my only complaint would be that it is a little pricey (due to the number of people in our group) and that the Dim Sum was a little small in size. But as far as Dim Sum goes, the price is really going to be determined by how hungry you are since you order each item separately.

Other than that, I can't really complain. It was a wonderful break from steaks and buffets.

I will have to check them out for lunch or dinner some time.
