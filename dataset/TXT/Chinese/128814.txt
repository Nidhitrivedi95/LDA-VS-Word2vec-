PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Food is too salty. Fried calamari got too much flour coated outside. Most of food doesn't have price tag and did not tell you there's surcharge if you add other ingredients which you should tell customer ahead of time before order. Service is good, but food came out slowly in very disorderly manner. Will not go back anymore.
