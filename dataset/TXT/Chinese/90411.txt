IFXL6wMLBgBSGSiLBjtViA if you like hot pot, this is the place to be.  The service here is incredible.  I really like their sauce station where you can mix and match with 15+ different type of sauces.  Drinks (soya milk, green teen and plum juice) are all you can drink as well.  I am definitely coming back during winter time.
