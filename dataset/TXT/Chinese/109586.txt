lP8Qx2Lv0rjgTgDOvs_2Sg Went here after 4pm as a mid-afternoon snack and thought we would order some congee, popcorn chicken and shrimp dumplings (har gao). Congee felt like it was thickened with lumps of flour... Popcorn chicken was full of batter and the small pieces of chicken were extremely dry and hard. The only decent thing were the shrimp dumplings but the shrimp were not deveined and didn't have much flavour. Overall, an OK place to eat if desperate... But I don't think I'll be back.
