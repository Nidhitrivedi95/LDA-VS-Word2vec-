q_c2ZvPJJxYEFPoWMKY2vQ I've been going to Jatoba pretty regularly for lunch over the summer. This restaurant has one of the nicest terraces in the downtown area. In fact the decor and atmosphere of the entire restaurant, both inside and out, is A+. Whether it is for a quick business lunch or to chill out on the terrace in the afternoon you can't go wrong here.

Everything on the menu is pretty solid and the presentation is great. If I had to pick out one standout main dish it would certainly be the cod. It is excellently prepared and melts in your mouth. However, the real highlights on their menu are the desserts. Oh my god each one that I have seen or tasted is amazing. The portions are enormous so plan to share and they are rich and just out of this world. Take the chocolate bomb for example, someone has posted a video of this. Yes, this menu item is so amazing and interactive it requires a video.  Upon arrival at your table the server will pour hot chocolate melting a chocolate sphere containing more chocolate and fruity goodness. Forget the main course just go straight for the dessert, you won't be disappointed. 

In all honesty, even if it wasn't for the desserts I would comeback just for the terrace, there is nowhere else downtown with such a nice outdoor space.
