BQIscJNv1rNEZpV9S7Z_tQ I used my coupon from groupon tonight. My daughters both ordered pho, It was o.k. I ordered chicken pad thai and mentioned extra spicy. It wasn't spicy at all and it was sour. I like my pad thai really spicy and on the sweet side, not sour...but then I thought; it's not a thai restaurant, of course their pad thai won't be the same.
I also ordered beef chow fun, it was too salty. The place is clean, the service was good. The waiters really nice and polite, they came and checked on us 3 times, asking how was everything and refill our drinks. They have generous portions, food came quick but I don't think I will be back because I don't really like the food.
