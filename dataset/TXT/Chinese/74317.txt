fnaDx7UD4MiodQlgYHDwsQ I tried this place out all because of Shane's ROTD and yep it lived up to its greatness. I ordered a appetizer platter, twice cooked pork and pork fried rice. (Apparently I was craving pork which is beyond rare) Man all of the food was really good. The egg rolls were stuffed with yummy goodness, the honey chicken was finger-licking good, there was TONS of pork fried rice packed into that container. My goodness was it stuffed. The only disappointment was the twice cooked pork. Don't get me wrong it was good, but when I ask for extra, extra spicy, that is exactly what I am expecting and it fell short. :(  But will it stop me from going back,? heck no. I am already thinking about what I will be ordering this coming weekend.
