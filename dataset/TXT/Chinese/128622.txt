PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ I'm in town visiting and was looking for some Chinese food. Well this place is pretty good. Food was prepared just to my liking. Perfect amount of sauce on the General Tso chicken and FRESH! The fried rice was cooked different than what I'm use to, but still good. I'd definitely do business with them again next time I visit.
