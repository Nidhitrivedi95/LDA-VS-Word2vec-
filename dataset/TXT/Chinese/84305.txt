I should've known but I still came here because I was curious about their Hainan chicken rice. 

Our server persuaded us to order the broccoli tempura appetizer which was good yes, but for 10 small pieces I will not pay $6 for that again.

My cousin ordered the Hainan chicken rice while I ordered the roasted chicken rice with the latter being $1 more expensive. 

When we got our food, we noticed it was a small portion and we were right because we wolfed that down pretty quick...or were we just hungry? But I would say it is definitely on the smaller side for the price you pay. My cousin said the chicken was salty and the original Hainan chicken rice or even the ones you can get uptown are way better.

We also noticed that the rice was soggy...I mean who cooks soggy rice?! We expressed that concern to the server at the end of our meal. I'm a little disappointed with Chef Craig Wong as I'm a fan of Patois. But maybe for those who aren't familiar with Chinese cuisine or Hainan chicken in general should give it a try.
