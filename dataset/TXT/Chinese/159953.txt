U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Pros: Very stimulating and intricate interior design, delicious noodles, friendly service.

Cons: Soup dumplings weren't really soupy, service was a bit slow, overpriced.

I haven't really tried any other menu items to give an accurate review, but  I hope to go back one of these days to give it another try.
