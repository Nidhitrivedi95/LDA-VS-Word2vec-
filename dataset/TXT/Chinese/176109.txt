WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg One of the better places for lunch downtown

Pros:
Large amount of lunch specials
Good value

Cons:
Dishes are on the salty side

Chili chicken is definitely one of my top 5 fav dishes so it's only natural I would make my here eventually.  I had a day off and met up with my GF for lunch here.  Yueh Tung is well known by the locals living and working in the area.  It's a pretty large place with plenty of seats on top of a sushi restaurant.

One look at their lunch menu and you can see they offer a ton of options.  Every dish is $8 save for some seafood ones.  I have never seen a place with this many lunch specials.  They have chicken, pork, seafood, beef, veggie and Chinese BBQ dishes.  There are little add ons like veggies for about a dollar each.  You could come here everyday for lunch and almost not get bored!

We of course ordered the chili chicken.  The chili chicken here is very good.  I would say top 10 in the city for sure.  Frederick's will always be my favourite but I like the one here too.  I prefer the dry version rather than the gravy version.  The gravy version is a little salty and they give you a tone of sauce so it salty is not your thing, it could be a little overwhelming.  Noentheless, you get good value and a great lunch here.

I'm not downtown often for lunch, but Yueh Tung is a solid entry for lunch time that I recommed to anyone who likes Chinese and Hakka food.
