I ordered a regular Coke but was given a Diet Coke.  So I asked her if I could change my drink out because it's the wrong one and she said no.  Confused, I go up to the host stand and ask for a manager to get the drink I ordered.  I don't think it was a manager that helped me out because she said if it was something she can take care of rather than a manager.  She comes and talks to the waitress and then comes back to my table and in front of my family, tells me that I need to drink all of it before I can order something else or be charged for another drink.  Out of our huge party maybe three ordered water, so I asked if they can get regular (not diet) Coke and I'll just drink it and she said no.  

Whatever. We were here because my parents chose this place and my aunt from Hawaii was visiting so I decided to be the professional and be the bigger person here.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't a language barrier or miscommunication but maybe because I was looking so good that day.  But seriously, if you come here be sure to keep your cool because even though technically we're not stepping into a foreign country and have to speak with a foreign tongue, you do need to treat them like a kindergarten.
