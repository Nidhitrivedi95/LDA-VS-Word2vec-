OX0T9dWI8b7meu-ljTo22A If you love going to dives with great food, eclectic decor, and great prices, this place is a must. By food I mean hot wings. The wings here are excellent. The fries were average but the quality of the wings make up for any drawbacks. I wish Long Wongs expanded to LA. On second thought maybe not because I would be in trouble. If your looking for your hot wing fix in Phoenix, look no further.
