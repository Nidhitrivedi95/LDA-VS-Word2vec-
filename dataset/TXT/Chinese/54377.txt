CSe9FpalbwGzQcp_h5BVxg Best Chinese food place me and my fiancé have ever been to! We stumbled in here while waiting for our movie at fat cats! I highly suggest the chicken lo-mein and teriyaki chicken! Amazingly priced too. We ate it for the next two days it was such a huge portion and the meat wasn't fatty at all.
