There are lots of Chinese restaurants and businesses in the area. There is a sign on the marquee and then you drive into the parking lot to find the restaurant facing west. It is a small place with the cash at the front and the kitchen in the back and a group of round tables covered in plastic cloths as found in most Chinese restaurants. The decor is simple and basic and the staff exuberant and helpful. The menu is extensive featuring an array of Buddhist styled vegetarian dishes, so any vegetarian will be thrilled to be able to order anything from the menu. For those unfamiliar with Buddhist menus everything is written with the names of the animal equivalents, but the dishes feature no animals. Everything is created using vegetable, gluten or tofu equivalents to create the taste and texture of the meat or fish. We tried the gluten appetizer, some har how, some fried wontons, then a selection of entrees including Chicken balls, Szechwan Beef, a shrimp dish, a dish that featured the most amazing walnuts and a noodle dish. It was a pleasure to be able to order from such an extensive menu.
