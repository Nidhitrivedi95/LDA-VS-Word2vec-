sePTDv1dGHPID7kwuNzXaA Best congee I've ever had. That's a big statement because I've had some pretty good congee before.

My family decided to venture around Markham and the Pacific Mall/Market Village areas in our finals days in the GTA. This place was a pleasant surprise as we wandered around the mall. We quickly became quite invested in watching the people in the window make the congee, Chinese doughnuts, and steamed noodles. Very cool process.

Since we came around noon, it was considerably busy and we had to take a number. The wait was maybe 20-ish minutes for a table. Once we were seated, we started selecting various dishes off the menu, which all seemed to be in the $5-7 range. I can't remember what else I ordered beside the congee, but it was good. Food gets on the table pretty fast after ordering, service is straightforward. The wait staff did seem a little bit like they wanted our group to hustle though.
