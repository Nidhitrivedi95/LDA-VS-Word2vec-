wZvSsHFU0NdyQ03625kh6g Ate Sunday night dinner at Capital Seafood. Very disappointed. The chicken was over cooked and dry.  Beef dish was cooked in an unknown sauce with too much onions. A Seafood casserole dish did not contain much seafood at all. The only passable dish was the snow pea pod vegetables.  Came with visiting friends from foreign. Will not return or recommend.
