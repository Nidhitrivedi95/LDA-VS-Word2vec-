3sdUVTMBHPiVN5zqZjb1zw Definitely an overwhelming variety of dishes here. From Chinese to everything else. Food was ok, nothing great. I can't imagine eating here when it gets crowded. It was annoying to get around the buffet when I was there and it was just moderately busy. Everything tasted like it had way too much MSG. I felt a little dizzy after my meal and I didn't even overstuff myself like I normally would. I think I would rather go to a decent sit-down Chinese restaurant (like Wan-Fu) then mess with this place again. If you are a glutton for the All-You-Can-Eat Chinese Buffet than you may really enjoy this place. For me, it's a no go.
