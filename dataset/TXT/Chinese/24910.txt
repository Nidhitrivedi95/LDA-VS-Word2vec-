70nmPKnAufzeKfRNVE0-Pg This is THE best Chinese restaurants I have ever eaten at in Madison, probably EVER.  It used to be on campus on University Ave but I just rediscovered it at the Hilldale Mall recently and I've been there 3x in the past week!  The food there is delicious.  MUST try the calarami (4.95), pot stickers (3.95), wonton soup (1.95), beef stew (6.95), in fact, EVERYTHING is a bite to die for.  It's pretty great Chinese food, I eat and eat but leave not feeling how I usually do after I eat greasy, fatty Chinese food.  Unfortunately, they don't deliver, but if they did I would be in heaven!  I do love their new spot in the mall--you can tell business has been gooooood!
