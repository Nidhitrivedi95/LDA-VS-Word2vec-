Rx_ZwOPb6pusIXeLLrBUqA After visiting the Faberge exhibit at the Mtl. Museum of Fine Arts, I wanted a quick bite to eat before heading home.  Had researched some local spots not far and Mai Xiang Yuan came up with good reviews, so I headed in that direction.  When I entered around 2 p.m. there were only two other diners there;  I was offered a table for two.  The hostess/server was not overly welcoming or friendly, but she did offer a menu and brought me a pot of nice hot tea.  I really only wanted a dumpling appetizer size portion but was informed they did not do 1/2 orders - so I requested the Lamb and Coriander dumplings (steamed).  There were 15 plump and delicious dumplings and I did manage to eat them all.  The plating of the food was very plain - no parsley or colour to enhance the plate and the sauces on the table were only soya and some spicy hot watery sauce.  This is just a small hole in the wall place, but tiny details can make a big difference in the enjoyment of a meal.   The décor is pretty tacky too; hanging red cut work Chinese lanterns from the ceiling and an annoying flat screen TV  with an Asian channel with people talking and eating.  The washroom was pretty dirty too:  dusty heat register, dirty waste bin and dirty floor - however the sink and toilet appeared to be fairly clean.  If the owners paid a little more attention to the cleanliness of the washroom, turn off the TV and play some nice Asian music, ask the hostess to smile and welcome guests and maybe add a smidgen of parsley to the plate and some plum-like sauce to dip the dumplings in - then I might return to give it another try.
