I really wanted to love this place because it is so beautiful, but the service and food just did not match the beautiful decor.  I enjoyed the orange pork, but it wasn't anything truly special.  We also ordered the shrimp lo mein, sweet and sour pork and clay pot beef brisket.  The beef brisket was mostly fat and the other dishes were just decent.
