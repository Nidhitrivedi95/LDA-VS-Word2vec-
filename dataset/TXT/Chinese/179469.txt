X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Such a disappointment.

I really should've written this a long time ago. I went back in April when it pretty much first opened, and I was super pumped! We were able to waltz past the ridiculously long line (that literally went out the door into the back of the hotel). Obviously, we were feeling pretty snazzy!

We had had a pretty hardxcore night before at Marquee, but we were still dressed to the 9's and ready to party (except me haha). Anyway, we get in around like.. 10pm, which is super early (thanks, "guestlist" line) but it started to fill up super quickly. 

First of all, I had heard people call it "hakka-stairs" and I was not prepared for what came next. Those stairs to the club are ridiculous. Each step is so high and there are so many of them, more than Marquee!! Trekking up in those killer pumps was a work out. By the time I got upstairs, I was panting (out of shape.. I know).

Upon getting to the top of the stairs, I saw more stuff.. a bar on the left, a cage thing in front of me.. It was a bit underwhelming. Then I saw the dance floor. Sure, there were tons of lights and video screen thingies, which made for a nice party ambience, but the dance floor itself was so small. Even the walkways to the dance floor were sucky. They were too much of a slope and it wasn't easy to walk in heels.

The upstairs also a smoking area, which is not cool. I really don't like the fact that there's no outdoor area. Of course, there's A/C but with that many people, it gets hot! The "hip hop" room was also a joke. It's basically all tables and booths, no dance floor, but people try to dance anyway. It's a horrific experience even for non-claustrophobic people.

1/10 - would not return
