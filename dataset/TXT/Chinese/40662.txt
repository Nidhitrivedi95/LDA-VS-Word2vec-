B3H60GaBic12F4VLBi7-9A Americanized Chinese Eats.

I placed a to go order and a big one at that. I was picking up for a few other office coworkers and they told us ten minutes. Kind of didn't believe that. But I pulled up and walked in ten minutes later and the food was hot and ready to go. They were pulling the last of our chicken wings off the fryer.

I was able to split up the payments for the orders no problem. And the food was well packed and still steaming hot when I got back to the office. They were very busy when I went and that definitely surprised me. I guess I just expected them to be a random hole in the wall spot that only a handful of people went to. I was wrong.

I ordered chicken wings and fried rice lunch special that came with an eggroll. The eggroll was filled with veggies and slightly greasy but with some duck sauce, it was decent for Americanized Chinese food. The fried rice was very basic fried rice, cooked with only soy sauce. I would pass on this if getting the lunch special again and probably go with French fries. The chicken wings were a pleasant surprise and very tasty. 

If in the mood, I would definitely come to this place again.
