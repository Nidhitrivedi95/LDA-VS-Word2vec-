cIoB6iinl48KDGCVwtCHoA AVOID this restaurant!!!!

We ordered delivery service from this restaurant for first time. She said we have to wait for 25 minutes. We called again at minute of 60, she said our food is one the way. Then nothing still 1.20hr later, we called again, she said the driver just left. WTF, it means she lied in the previous call. At the end, we canceled our order. She was really rude on the phone.
