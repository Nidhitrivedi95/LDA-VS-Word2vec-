6WDDksGLLehfQDIvQXzR5w This is the closest thing to authentic tasting Chinese I've found in Tempe. The mapo tofu is AMAZING. The wonton soup is the best I've ever had. The Kung pao chicken is the best I've ever had. Seriously everything I've eaten here is the best I've ever had , with the exception of the mapo tofu because I've eaten it at another restaurant in Houston, Tx and it was the same quality. If you are looking for very Americanized Chinese food look elsewhere, but if you want the real deal this is the place to go. The staff is also very friendly and the restaurant is clean.
