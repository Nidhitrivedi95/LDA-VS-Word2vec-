gnqHyA6gY2-m9S-FKt6Xqw Well, almost exactly one year later, I've revisited Cravings as my first lunch after coming back to CU. While the points I made last time about the interior still stand, I did try the Jakarta fried rice, and it was quite good! Good enough to bump this up to 4 stars, but alas, I had some bad service this time around. A mistake was made when putting in my order, so I ended up having to wait 20 minutes for my food. I couldn't even sit down to wait since all the tables were full. Ack! Just 3 stars then...

P.S. Excessive use of styrofoam - cups, takeaway boxes, and bowls for small soups, all in styrofoam.
