n72smZw1iVORdnjGfFT0FQ I'd give Richmond Court zero stars if I had the option. Ordered chicken breast in tomato sauce with rice. Inedible, chicken tasted like a plastic silicone implant, sauce was so sweet you'd think they poured a cup of sugar into my container with soggy rice. By far one of the most disgusting meals I've had. Big lover of Chinese food and I've seen far better than this.
