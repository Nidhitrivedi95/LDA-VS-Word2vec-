K0FtmxCgqJEbDNCyXyMX_w Not sure who is telling the truth, the website or the workers. Went to the pandas at 930pm, they told me they were closed. No one actually told me they were closed, the guy cleaning up stood at the windows and pulled out his phone to check the time and made a "no" motion with his head motioning to not come in. Website says 10-10 with an "open now" indicator. Great customer service btw.
