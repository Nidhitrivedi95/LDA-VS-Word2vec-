NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og New owners changed and gutted the menu. It is not the same family and so now the combos do not come with sweet and sour chicken and they only use zucchini onion and carrots in everything... Wheres the baby corn and water chestnuts? 

The food is ok if you never tried the old place.
