yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Normally I don't mind eating at this place because the food is pretty good. Today was definitely out of the norm. Service first of all is pretty poor. The waiters there need to learn the basics of customer service...wait it would probably be better if some of them actually learned English first. Anyways back to today...the pho there was a little salty..saltier than normal, i asked for side onions and the waiter gave me a look with an attitude (i mean dude just go get me some onions i asked nicely), lastly if most of u guys don't know this...most restaurants charge u 15%-20% extra gratuity if u have a party of 7 or more in your party and well the waiter or waitress there will let u know that gratuity was added to the bill...here they charge you 17% for a party of 5 or more...don't a word about the gratuity added to the bill. $57 dollar meal today for a party of 5 which is cheap...$9 dollars for gratuity which was added automatically...and if i didn't ask for a copy of the receipt i would have gave them another 9 dollars on top for tip again...and for what? crappy service from fools that pretty much slide my food over and not say a word to acknowledge me that my order is ok i got or not? and the guys weren't even busy and i had to ask for my check 4 x before they brought it to me. they lucky that this is one of the few 24 hour places my friends like to go. but from now im going to refrain as much as i can. was very very disappoint with them today
