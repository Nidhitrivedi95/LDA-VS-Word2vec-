O_9K3WhlGlXW3KFPfTo0yA Thought to give it a shot as the place looks promising from outside.

The Malaysian fried noodle came very quickly.  The veggie took over 30mins to come.  Then the Baked Portugal Style sliced chicken on fried rice took good 40mins to come.

I guess there is a reason not to order "baked" stuff from a steam kitchen.  Not only it took forever to come, but the taste is way off...  More like chicken in cream sauce.

Waitstaff are friendly, but looked lost.
