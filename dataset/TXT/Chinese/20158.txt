5WhDd9MnacntXYURmvgMZA Decided to stop here for a quick lunch.  Wish I didn't.  Yes the place was clean and yes the staff was wonderful.  I also love to hear the my food getting cooked fresh coming straight from the kitchen.  Love the sounds of sizzling and woks getting banged up.  But... I really have had better with flavor.  The lunch special is not all that great for the price.  I thought it would be until I walked up to the counter. I did read in one review that the eggroll was falling apart. So did mine.  I did not finish because it was not good at all.  The sweet and sour sauce was watery but that's ok I really don't like sweet and sour anyway.  I ordered the chicken and vegetable lunch special.  It was ok.  Nothing great to where I am going to invite my co workers or ever come back to have a quick bite.  I will also let you all know please do not try the hot and sour soup. Very tasteless. It had absolutely no flavor. If I closed my eyes and took a bite of it I would think it was warm thickened water... Water Gravy with small bits of tofu and mushrooms.  I know that there are a lot of wonderful reviews for Asian Garden and that is all good for them but not so much for me. Sorry not one of my faves. I wish them well. Merry Christmas!
