FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ 4/5 only if you come for the early bird special. If not, it becomes expensive. It is probably the best dim sum in sauga imo. As their name suggests, they specialize in seafood so you should definitely give those dishes a try. If you're coming with a large party, or just have visitors over and want to treat them to a good meal, this would be the place to go. I've had family friends wow-ed by the lunch lobster dishes, and combined with their dim sum, it leaves everyones stomach happy and in a food coma afterwards. 

The place is grand itself. Plenty of tables, but even then they're all occupied during the early bird special and you have people standing outside waiting with their dim sum selections checked off and ready to hand to the waiters/waitresses once they get seated. 

I'm a fan of their steamed rice noodles and their deep fried sesame balls. They're sooo good. 

Have yet to come here for dinner but I'm sure any of their set lobster/seafood dinner specials will blow me away.
