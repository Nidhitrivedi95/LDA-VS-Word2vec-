7OKQ4ENVfPfxtDqFOG7x0g For quick order Chinese food A8 is pretty standard. At some times they have very inexpensive lunch specials. The dinner prices are a tad bit higher (although still reasonable). It's a bit more spacious than Asian Kitchen if you want to eat your meal on the spot (just as often, though, I ordered to take home). Other than that, not much else to say about it.
