2dSXKC4BQUFSqsiziNFwtA A must visit! Yes, the wait time is a bit long, but it's made fresh to order! I had a chance to talk to the owner since my family is also from Tianjin, and  he explained how he waits until a customer orders something to make it. The soup dumplings were excellent. The wrappers on all the dumpling were the perfect thickness. Thick enough to not break easily, but not doughy. My brother and I ordered boiled egg, chive, shrimp, pork dumplings, the soup dumplings, and the braised pork, cabbage buns. All delicious!! My brother and I have been to Tianjin many times (him living there until he was 7) so we can definitely vouch for the authenticity. Do not hesitate to come here.
