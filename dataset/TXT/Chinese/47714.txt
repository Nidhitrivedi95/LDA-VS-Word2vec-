c-Ur4wPDNjt-e2N5MkRRaQ Came here at noon on a Sunday. The place was mostly full. The interior design and their cutlery choice was very tasteful. The service was good for consistently filling up the teapot for us and food came at a reasonable pace.

We ordered 
- bbq pork buns - was good but kinda soft
- Shirmp dumpling - yummy
- beef tripe - average but decent 
- chicken mushroom congee - really good! 
- fried squid - well cooked, flavourful 
- mango pudding (baby koi fish shaped.. ) - super small and wasn't that good  
- Peiking duck from chef's recommendation- was good but the portion was soooooo small there was literally one slice of duck, one slice of cucumber wrapped in thin layer of thing thing you wrap peiking duck in for $5.50 not really worth... 

In total we spent about $45 dollars for 2 people.. Overall I give it a 3 star for the decent taste but this place is not worth the money for their super small portions. Not coming back here for dimsum again though.
