DsT7r6NlTWzA1RTwkze8VQ Best Chinese food in Huntersville. I love going there and hearing the high burning woks do their magic. They don't use MSG, so you don't feel sleepy after eating all the good food. My husband loves the lo mein and fried rice dishes. I usually stick to all the Chinese dishes, the Thai dishes have a more Chinese flair to them, but are still good.
