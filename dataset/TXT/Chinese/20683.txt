618yZxC6stz-Un4xLsp5vw I work near this place. It is so perfect when you are craving Chinese food and don't want to spend a lot of money. The staff is always friendly and the food comes to you hot and fast. I never had any problems with the flavor or quality of the food. it's always so fresh! My favorite  items are the bbq pork ribs. Oh man they are so good!  I am hungry just writing this up.  You can sit at the few tables they have available, or take the food to go.
