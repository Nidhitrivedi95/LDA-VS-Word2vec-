kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A I work down the street and have visited this restaurant a few times now and I haven't been disappointed yet. Probably the only noodle restaurant that reminds me of home. Would definitely recommend!

Food: the food has a very authentic feel and tastes great. The quality is great and you get to watch them cook through glass walls. I personally love the knife sliced noodles.

Service: service was very fast. Food came out fast and if you need something, you get it quickly. Not overtly friendly (which I don't mind) but definitely attentive.

Price: very agreeable imo for the quality and authenticity you're getting.

Cleanliness: haven't gotten a dirty plate or silverware yet and the place is very well kept!
