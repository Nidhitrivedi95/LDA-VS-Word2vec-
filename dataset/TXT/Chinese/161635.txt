uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw Came here with high expectations. Apparently, this place used to be a lot better (more generous meats and better service). Well, too bad.  I have had better hand-pulled noodles at other places . The food was below average. It was packed when we got there (Sat. just before noon). They didn't have enough staff to serve tables. We had to ask for water and wait for a long time to place the order. I managed to take a picture of my dish to look like it has a good amount of meats. The ones shown in the picture was it. Nothing beneath the noodles. Soup was bland, not much flavour to it. 

Overall, I won't be back here. I don't recommend this place if you want to have good soup noodles. I don't know about other dishes. As their name indicates, they specialize in noodles....so chances are...other dishes are not worth trying.
