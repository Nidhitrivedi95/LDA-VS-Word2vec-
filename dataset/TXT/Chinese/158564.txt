tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw Usually not a chain person but received several gift cards and have been using them the last couple of weeks. Go to PF Changs at Happy Hour- you will not leave disappointed! Cocktails and wine $6, beer $4 and food $5-6. Ordered the cauliflower tempura, spicy tuna roll and Moscow nuke. They use all fresh ingredients for all of their cocktails; even have a house made ginger beer. This cocktail couldn't be more refreshing!!! Cauliflower is not a healthy treat but so delicious- covered with a similar topping to sesame chicken and a little spicy but not overbearing. Spicy tuna roll tasted so fresh!! Not typical for AZ. Lots of great options.
