_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Service:  Very good.  Propmt and pleasant.
Food:  Polar opposite, and simply said, very poor.   Lettuce wraps passable, but the chicken fried rice and egg flower soup was absolutely flavorless...I mean shockingly FLAVORLESS...the water with lemon had more flavor.  I will NOT be returning to this establishment.
