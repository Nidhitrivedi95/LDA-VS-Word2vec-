xyyLHodMgcAwon4EeRT_jg Imperial Palace is my favourite place to go for a sit in Chinese meal. The dim sum is excellent, and there is a wide variety of dishes to choose from- both from a traditional Chinese perspective but also the fare you'd expect from any Scottish Chinese restaurant, except usually with a few interesting variations. The price tag is pretty good too and the portion sizes are brilliant. I would go as far as to say Imperial Palace is better than the much praised Chop Chop.


 My only niggle would be that the staff are slightly racist; the last time I went I was shown the menu for white people at the back without any explanation that there was a Chinese style menu I could order off if I so wished, and my dining partner and I were brought a knife and fork instead of chopsticks. But it didn't bother me that much because the food was AMAZING
