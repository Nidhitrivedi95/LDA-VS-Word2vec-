2UFl9gLOQrSGY2sPu6U-kA I was referred to this Hotpot place.  This chain is also in the US, San Francisco.  

This is your typical AYCE.  There is only two different broths:  spicy and regular or you can get both in a divided individual pot.  The broth was a tad too salty for me.  They only replenished with a plain broth and it didn't help the saltiness.  The spicy was nice, but I like spicy.  The food is unlimited like all AYCE.  The selection is ok, I have been to a few others that had more selection.  The drink bar was nice, I love soy milk and that won me for sure.  It is a decent place.  The beef and lamb was really good.
