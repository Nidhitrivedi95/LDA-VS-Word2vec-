fsqLNNiViaTPFk5ggOy-gQ If you really want to experience the worse case of food poisoning in your life..try this place. I use to be a fan and ate there previously. I placed a family order one Sunday night and 2 out of the 3 of us ended up in the Banner ER with severe food poisoning. I would give them "0" stars but Yelp wont allow me...EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
