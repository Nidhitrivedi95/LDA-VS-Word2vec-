qAbXHsddBhmfQFegGiV7Dg I wanted to love this place based on the reviews and the location, but I just couldn't. It's clean, has nice employees, and my food came out quickly. The beef sukiyaki was not very good. The beef was flavorful, thinly sliced, and tender ... But the gel everything was coated in was so disgusting that I couldn't eat it. The chicken teriyaki was okay... The rice was too over cooked and there wasn't enough teriyaki sauce. Again, not bad, but I'd rather drive a little further for better.
