8ci0d-HKFK8MgHrf8kPF8g First off, I must say that we ordered and it was in our stomachs 15 minutes later. I was very impressed.

We ordered the szechuan chicken and shrimp lo mein. They were both really good, also the egg rolls were definitely the best I have had in ages. 

Great service and great food; we are so happy to have a new Chinese take-out place.
