zPcF4fI18gSp42G17oHmmg I give this place two stars and on a busy weekend 3. My family and i come here every once in awhile when we want a chinese buffet, it is the closest to where we live. The food is okay but it isn't always the freshest especially when they are slow. A lot of lukewarm food and sometimes the meat sits and gets tough. Plus they rarely restock the crab legs and when they do it isn't much. The service is great though.
