eI1ZHGOr2Pus842KrZD5ZQ To be honest, I'm not really sure how to rate this: It's average when compared to the dimsum joints in Chicago, but subpar compared to the many other wonderful Toronto spots...and it's pricier to boot. Given all of that, I'm not really sure why there was such a long line to get in.

While the food seems special on paper (swallow's nest egg tart, anyone?), it didn't really translate into reality. In fact, for the price, it was definitely missing the finer points of excellent dimsum, such as delicate wrappings or intricate designs. To be fair, they did try...but did not succeed.

And lastly, there was just something off about the ambiance. Look, I like dimsum and I like museums, but eating dimsum in a museum didn't really synergize for me the way it might have for others. We were seated in a smaller room of only three other tables; it definitely felt more like a museum than a restaurant in there, and as unrefined as it sounds, dimsum just isn't dimsum without having to yell over the din of a hundred other raucous diners. And I echo other reviewers' sentiments that the place as a whole is a bit snooty. 

Go here once just for the experience, but go get better food elsewhere after that.
