rfKVqRE2uB1U_jeFfqjssQ Not bad at all! They've been open for 5 yrs under 2km from my house and I never went there:( tried the basics Chilli Chicken and Chicken Manchurian. Soup needed almost the entire packet of soya. While it was done nicely. I'd have preferred more flavour. Incl Salt. The chilli chicken though... Mmmm yes that's how it's done! Beautiful flavour, nice an crispy outside with warm and soft deliciousness inside. Good amount of chicken as well with a hint of veggies! It's a little spicy I'm warning you before hand! The outside needs a major revamp! The interior is not bad actually! Simple an nice. New go to Hakka place close to the house!
