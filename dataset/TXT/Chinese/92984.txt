IXP6VfjiUFIRiRbZjeUulw We so want to like this place as we started going here when Tai Wah moved to Streetsboro. They have all the dishes one wants in a cheap Chinese take-out, it's close to home and it's quick. But after more than a half dozen visits we continue to be disappointed. The food just tastes "off", or not very flavorful. So sad.
