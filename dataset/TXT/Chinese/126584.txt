p2OOk46G_AOO0nCWl-eVlg I really enjoy the food here but the way this location runs is a disaster. We came during a busy time so we expected a bit of a wait. Our food came out relatively quickly which was nice, however the wait just to place our order was about 45 minutes. There was ONE register open with 4 girls around the counter. One of the girls stood at one of the register and didn't take a single order and frankly could care less about the length of the line or that the customers were getting irritated. To make up for her lack of effort in all areas she would stock the napkins every so often perhaps to make it look like she was doing something. As we approached the front of the line many of the guests waiting for Togo orders or call in orders that they had placed over an hour ago were telling us that they had been neglected entirely. Lines stayed long and people were willing to wait to get their food but something needs to be done and more than a single register needs to be open when the line is wrapping around the building.
