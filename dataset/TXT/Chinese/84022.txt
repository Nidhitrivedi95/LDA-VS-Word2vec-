heyU2rq-K2soH-V0SVMHVQ I have tried to get on board with the food here many times, as my boyfriend orders it for work. I have tried many dishes but she feel something is lacking. I do like the spring rolls but mostly for the dipping sauce. I took my son to dinner tonight to try the dine-in option. His meal was ok- the sweet chicken and Mac-n-chz (but how could anyone not get that right). The staff looked annoyed- all of them- not one person smiling. Took them 5 minutes of me standing at the front for one of them to drag themselves away from whatever they were doing. While I am at it, the lighting is awful- totally too bright and the track lights point right in the diners' eyes. The food is not BAD, it's just not that great. And it is pricey. Sorry...
