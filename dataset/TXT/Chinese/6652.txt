0LA4HKI7ydji1zwnqDbgnw Oh my sweet Lord where do I begin.
I love this place.
Service is always so friendly.
The food is just incredible. The veggies are so fresh, noodle choice is amazing.
I haven't had any of the soups/curries but I imagine they're just as good.
I keep wanting to come back to try different combinations.
Always go with my boyfriend after work and we both are obsessed!
