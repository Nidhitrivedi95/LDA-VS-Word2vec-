YjPWt-V5oMkakdRWrALb8g I like buns, hon. Ok, ok. Have I overdone it with that joke? But seriously... I had my first buns at Honey Buns last week and I'm now obsessed! 

First things first. Honey Buns is located INSIDE Super G. When you enter the grocery store, first marvel at how clean the store is and breath in. If you're lucky, Hong Kong bakery will have something in the oven and it'll smell like you're literally inside a birthday cake. Next, turn right and head towards the back corner. There you'll find a magical food court housing Honey Buns, along with Hong Kong bakery and a Korean restaurant.

Next. Check out Honey Bun's menu, posted to the left of the register. There are pictures of every dish to help you navigate. (Although, a lot of the buns look the same, so I'd actually suggest going by the description of the stuffing instead.) 

Once you've decided what you're getting -- I had to write it down I wanted so much -- head to the register to order. I had the BBQ pork, teriyaki chicken, red bean, and Vietnamese pork buns. All were delicious but the BBQ was my favorite, hands down. Throw in an order of glass meatballs (just so-so) and a diet Pepsi and my total was $11.50. So cheap!
