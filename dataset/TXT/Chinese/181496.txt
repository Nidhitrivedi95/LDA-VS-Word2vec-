xdphjWZymq-3dqOWmA_wwA Look this food is great, and that what makes this review so hard.  The most unfortunate thing is that the product is great but the service is among some of the worst I've seen.

Like other reviewers I got the apathetic notorious counter guy.  I could swear he was xenophobic, purposely lied about the time it would take to make us food to shoo us from the restaurant.  The manager is very unprofessional, talks like he still lives in a frat house and very abrasive.  

I've seen Henry post on here several times that he would address this with his staff.  It's sad because nothing has changed over a long time.  I guess perhaps he's comfortable with rude staff because it's clear that they are being enabled.  I guarantee this business would do mountains better if things were stream lined.

Also they do not answer your calls during business hours.  I called several times, and then on separate days to see if it was a one-off.  It wasn't.
