XjmHPe0H91BlJ3gwJb7OiA I only had the afternoon tea so the review is only based on the afternoon tea combs. This is your typical Chinese style Cafe and the food is ur typical Chinese Cafe dishes. It's a good place to come for if your in the area and want a Chinese style Cafe. Ordered the chicken wings as every table ordered them. It was pretty good and tasted as I expected. Nice, crisp and not dry. If your gonna order them, keep in mind they take quite some time. The only thing I was disappointed was my egg and corn beef sandwich. Lots of egg but where was the corn beef?! Lol
