UcIrRf2mWgqqlg-HNoDl0A I ordered delivery and got my order pretty fast. I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl but got beef instead.. the Singapore noodles were done well with not too much curry but the right amount for great flavor not too overpowering.. the vegetable rolls were crisp.. this was first experience and I'd check them out again... prices are fair and consistent with other competitors and service was better than average.. sorry no pics, I was hungry, my bad...
