Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg I've been going to PF chang's for year's now.. and this place has never let me down.. I highly suggest the Sea Bass Fish , and the Ribs.. It is to die for! Also for starters order the lettuce wraps.. I normally dine at the District @ Green Valley Ranch but i just happen to be here at planet hollywood.. i would also suggest calling ahead for reservations so the wait isnt too long.. Place might be a bit noisey but who cares my grou group over powered the noise level and i think we were the noisey ones in the place! For dessert order the great wall of chocolate.. I msut say for those of you who wants authentic chinese food this is not the place to go.. keep in mind this is American style chinese food but still the bomb! hehe
