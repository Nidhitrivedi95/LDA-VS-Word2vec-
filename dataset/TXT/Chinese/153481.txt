taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg I "lived" in montreal for 6 months, i was on a work assignment. i spent my last dinner/night in this place. I met other people in the hotel I was staying that were also long term and they did their farewell dinners there. this should tell you everything. If that doesn't do it, then: Food is AMAZING, there was nothing I tried from the menu I didn't like, servings were big. prices are very good and the atmosphere is just great. people working there ranged from "just" polite and nice to interactive and funny. Definitely a 10 for this place. I only wish i could come back just to have dinner here.
