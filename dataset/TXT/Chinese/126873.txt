P7r8DnVRIVfEhwl14x7zbg Went here for a Father's Day lunch in 2015 and ordered the following: beef noodle soup, scallion pancake, beef pancake, and 15 pork and cabbage dumplings. The beef noodle was quite bland and lacking in taste, but I thoroughly enjoyed the dumplings. At only $7, the dumplings were well worth their value! The pancakes were both greatly delicious as well, though fairly oily. 

Came here a couple time afterwards, and I can honestly say that I love their dumplings. Always so fresh and made in-house! My mom personally loves the scallion pancake, which, I admit (though I hate most things fried) is pretty tame in oil and great on taste.
We also tried their dessert once, the deep fried red bean bun. It was super light, tasting a bit like meringue (the egg white taste is so prominent). Pretty good, though the wait is quite long for this, as it has to be served piping hot and fresh.
