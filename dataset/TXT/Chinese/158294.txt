TYEQ38ONpmYMYv378IByhw Had dinner here on a Wednesday night without reservation. The restaurant isn't completely full but still has good amount of customers on a weekday night. Food came fast after placing the order and waitresses are nice and with good customer service;  which possibly because it's not weekend and not pack. 

Ordered congee, deep fried dough,  and 2 meat dishes for 2 peoples, more than enough for both of us and can still pack up for lunch the next day. The congee comes with a big bowl and the deep fried dough are good.  The congee I ordered is kind of peppery,  not sure if it's because of the pork bone so maybe ask for less black pepper next time.  Sweet and sour pork is so good.  The meat is so tender and the sauce is delicious. It comes with a pineapple as a bowl which is cute.  Lemon chicken is also great and it has the perfect balance for the taste, which isn't too lemony so that's good. 

I will come back again for sure but probably not in a big group since the place is small.
