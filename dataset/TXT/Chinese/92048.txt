IOwTrStIy6NinyquhBrLZQ If only I could give this place a negative star. Fried Rice and chow mein were disgusting so I tried to drown out that taste with the Orange chicken.... Orange chicken turned out worse! Waste of money. First was a little upset about how little of food they give you but now I'm really glad they didn't like that crap on. If you are staying at the Excalibur I highly recommend DO NOT GO HERE!
