TtaXPsMrTGyPsAlO5LFQ6w Finally got to try this Chinese Restaurant after looking at all the reviews for Chinese Restaurants in the area.
Overall, pretty good.  
Chicken Egg Foo Young-very different presentation to what I am used to.  3 medium size pancakes, very tasty.  All settled in a base of chicken strips, tons of mushrooms and a savory gravy.  Real good, pancakes light and fluffy.  This one entrée and the rice side would be enough for more than 2 people!
Sweet and Sour Chicken-again, lightly battered and fluffy coating.  Huge pieces with a better than average sweet sauce.  Could have used a few more vegetables, though.
Chix Fried Rice-the usual and good.  Small container, though.  Huge taste, again.
We have tried Dragon Express.  That was O.K., but Tao Yuan food has 3 times (3x) the flavor.
Cannot speak for other entrees; we only had the two mentioned.
Will return and try other entree's.
