OlGImeovM5U14T5q5DnVSg Wouldn't say it's the best Chinese food I've had, but certainly not the worst either.

Stopped in here for a quick lunch one day while driving by the area, and for the total of $9 I spent (including tip), I was happy I made the pit stop.

Ordered the chicken and broccoli lunch special.  What a deal!  For $5.75 you get soup, egg roll (one of the best parts of the meal actually), crab puff (way more puff than crab) and the entree and rice.  PLENTY to eat.  You won't leave hungry that's for sure.  The broccoli was fresh, and chicken tender.

Service was good (didn't have to wait too long for them to re-fill my water - which is just one of my tests for good service!).

If I'm in the area during lunchtime, I would not hesitate to stop in again.
