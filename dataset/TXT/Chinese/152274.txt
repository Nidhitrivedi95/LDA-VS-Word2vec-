t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA I come here every time I drop off/pick up my college daughter.  The place is spacious and the food . . . my goodness the food!  You know it's great when Chinese people themselves come here in droves. The young lady at the cashier booth is especially attentive to your needs.  I come only a few times a year but she remembers what I like!!!
