KLvpdtFYUi1I0LNsmIqeJw This is a standard chinese takeout place.  We had a wanton soup, sesame tofu, and chicken with string beans.  It was all pretty lousy.  I can't say that either of us was surprised.  Our experience with Madison chinese takeout places is basically very bad.  

The only good part was that the lady taking our order was nice and chatty, and we both liked her.
