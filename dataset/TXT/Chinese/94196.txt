JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A My favorite Korean Restaurant in Glendale area. Beat every Korean restaurant out here with their Banchans. Very authentic and home-like. The ajumma who serves there reminds me of my grandma. ;) Must visit. Sucks for no alcohol but that doesn't deduct a star point. Not the best if you are trying to compare with LA restaurants, but we are in Phoenix. Bare it. ;) I add, their dduck bok yi is the best yummmm...
