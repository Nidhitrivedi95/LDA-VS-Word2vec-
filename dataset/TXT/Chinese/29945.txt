966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA I am sorry to say that this place has gone so far down hill it is amazing.  The person with me ordered the shrimp and it came with mayonnaise on it in place of a garlic white sauce.  They said they ran out so they improvised.  Very very bad.  The service was even bad, it took forever to get a beer.  I am taking this off of my neighborhood favorites for a while  There are far too many great places within 100 feet, so they better pick up there game.
