rBxFYhMxq2bIA9FGKIfCrA I've been wanting to write my review for iKitchen after I try out Republic Ramen + Noodles so here I am finally!

While yes, I know they both specialize in different things, I will like to say something in comparison between the two!  After a two hour flight from Colorado and dealing with a snowy Spring there, I wanted to get the heck off the plane and slurp up something warm and filling.  My thoughts were to try out this place finally!

Anyways, I had gotten the miso ramen here and I felt a bit lost.  The flavor wasn't bad but it lacked that, "Wow, that was awesome" feeling.  I myself am Chinese and have plentiful Taiwanese friends and was a big fan of their previous establishment, Eba, when I went to ASU.  So knowing all this and my history with the kick ass Eba, I was disappointed.

When I went to Republic Ramen + Noodles, they supplied everything iKitchen lacked.  Everything at Republic Ramen + Noddle was healthier and more fresh.  

In the end, iKitchen really isn't a bad place but I would rather go to Republic Ramen!
