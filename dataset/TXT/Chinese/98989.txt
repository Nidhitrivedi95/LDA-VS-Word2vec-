Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ "The" worst place in town for Chinese food!  Where do I begin, the orange chicken was burnt and had some weird sauce on it, sent it back with their attitude, ordered safe and ordered chicken noodles (lo mein) when it arrived it literally had 5 small pieces of chicken in it and it was poor quality chicken with a blubber like texture. I did not eat it, nor did I get a to go box. My husband ordered the deep fried flounder and it came swimming in grease. $40 later and a bad case of indigestion, I downloaded this ap, never have given a review before but I did because Las Vegas needs to know and I don't want you to waste your time and money, go to Ping Pang Pong...much better choice!
