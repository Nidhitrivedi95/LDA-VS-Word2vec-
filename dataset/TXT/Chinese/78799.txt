GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog We celebrated my brothers birthday and had an amazing time at this great restaurant. Corinne was the best waitress. The service is the best I've ever seen. Waiters and bussers constantly cleaning our plates and refilling our drinks. The when pigs fly dish was my favorite but everything is good here. I will definitely be back for more tacos, dim sum, and rice. I love the variety of flavors on this menu. Again the employees and service was off the charts. Very satisfied.
