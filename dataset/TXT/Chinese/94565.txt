jenDHueIvOhpB-0ivdiRoQ I want to like the food at Shanghai, I really do, but I just don't.  The lettuce wraps are good if you load them up with sauce, but their other entrees are just okay. Hardly any veggies in their entrees. Tonight the Terriyaki chicken was dry & overcooked, the Honey Chicken was mushy, not crunchy on the  outside (it is fried). They have driven me to cook my own Chinese food.  I'm just from cities that had great Chinese restaurants. Hopefully they will change some of their recipes.
