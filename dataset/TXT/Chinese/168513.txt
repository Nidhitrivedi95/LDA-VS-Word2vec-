vraKC3CB9KSDCxYX0q3gWA This place used to be great, not any more! Whatever you do, don't use the app unless you are prepared to wait 40 minutes for your order...they said they always do the in house orders first, even though you are sitting there waiting. The food is no longer what it used to be, and they left out a key component to my meal. The fried rice, which costs extra, was awful. All in all, a lousy experience!
