cykzJbkgweJvZsvkrHMR7g I come here at least once a week for my lunch break. They have lunch specials from 11am-3pm ranging from $6-$8, but I come here for the Combination Pho. I think it's the best dish they offer. This is probably the only place that serves Pho on this side of town.

Call ahead to order your food, because they take a long time.
