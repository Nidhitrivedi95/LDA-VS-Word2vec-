UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw Having just moved from Boston to the Phoenix area, I have been exploring restaurants and heard about Bamboo Club from an acquaintance.  As a frequenter of Boston's Chinatown as well as fine dining establishments throughout the city, I'd say the food is on par with a food court.  A highly Americanized version of Asian cuisine, the food did not match the quality of a P.F. Chang's and was overpriced.  

Just as we were finishing our meal, the waitress was rude to my mother, a senior citizen who rarely visits restaurants.  It takes a lot for me to decrease a server's tip under 20%, let alone under 15%; however, this young woman's service warranted it - rarely have I witnessed treatment so insulting in my life.  I felt terrible that my mother was treated so poorly on her vacation to visit me. 

The ambience and decor attempted to come across as sophisticated, but did not mesh well.  The music was out of place - a loungey remix of Madonna classics - and the decor had the feel of an amusement park to me.  Granted I work in the architecture industry, studied interior design, and am used to dining in restaurants on the East Coast primarily, so my perspective on the expectations in the southwest may be skewed.  However, those restaurants I've been to in the downtown Phoenix area are superb all around in terms of food, decor, and service - Bamboo Club couldn't hold a tiny birthday cake candle to them.

All around I would say this experience was among the worst I've ever had and I'd recommend trying someplace else.
