966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA The food was pretty good however the service was horrible!! I was still working on my food when the waiter asked if I was done and tried to take it away. 5 mins later another waitress asked if I wanted a to-go box and I said yes since I wanted to leave already because the waiters had a really bad staring problem. So they take the food to the back and come back with it in the to-go boxes and plastic bag. I clearly remember having 2 shrimps left and I was left with NONE. They took my SHRIMP!!! I'm shocked honestly. And the worst part is that they'll probably reuse it.
