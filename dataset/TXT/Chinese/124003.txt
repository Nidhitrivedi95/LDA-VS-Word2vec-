ooFlFjIuGW8Lx0bxmvEZJg Pretty good buffet. Bars well stocked and food was well cooked and tasty. About what you would expect at a good buffet. Ham was excellent as was all of the different chicken offerings. A large variety, real sets this place apart from other local buffets. Dessert bar is awesome. Cobblers, caked, rolls, pies, cookies, you name it. Hot strawberry cobbler, topped with vanilla ice cream and sprinkles! This is no joke... 
 Only complaint, table was dirty and I asked the young man who took my drink order to clean it. When I returned it had not been touched. He blew me off and did not return. 
 Waitress was excellent and made sure we were not wanting of anything. Drinks were kept full and she was very pleasant.
