JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA Sadness can only be cured with fried Chinese Doughnuts and Hot Soy Milk. An early trip to drop off my sister to the airport alloted me an hour before I had to get to work. An hour is a strange amount of time. Not enough to devout too much time to any activity, but long enough to make it difficult to fill. 

My job is close to Chinatown and I have wanted to try Taiwanese breakfast. I love my hot soy milk ($1.75) and yóutiáo ($1.75). Other than that, I am not familiar with this style of dining. The soy milk is thin and comes plain. The waitress told me that I would need to add sugar to sweeten it. Maybe after some of the reviews saying it was too sweet got them to just serve it this way. I am a fan of self service and added just a little to lightly adjust the flavor. Unsure about the sizes of the dishes here, I decided to order one at a time. Lucky, for me, because the Egg Cake and Chinese Doughnuts ($4.75) is a bountiful feast. One stick of two doughnuts are wrapped in a large egg pancake. When the waitress came around, she had many little plates on a tray and dealt them out to multiple tables. I eyed the largest plate and wondered what it was. Wonder no more, because it was mine. I debated on whether or not to finish my meal, but the perfectly brown dough begged not to be wasted. The savory and soft egg gave amazing textural contrast to the deep fried bread. They fry them up to order, because on the bottom of my plate, there was a little puddle of oil. Usually this is a turn off, but the taste makes it easy to overlook a normal infraction.

At $7.03, I ended up with a delicious meal at fast food prices. I would like to come back and try some of the pickled mustard green or vegetable buns. 

For a large restaurant, there is only one waitress attending to guest and cashiering. She apologized a few times for the wait time, but it was nothing to get hung up over.
