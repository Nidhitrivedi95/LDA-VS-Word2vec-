N9noZs9OIQLF2F9TzI_ukQ The food is BAD and so DISAPPOINTED! I feel awful to write this. But we all work hard for a living. When we pay to eat out.....we do expect it to taste good. 

Orange Chicken - Over cooked and was so stringy. Couldn't enjoy it at all. Sauce didn't taste right either. Very bland. Didn't have that slightly spicy orange sweet flavor.

Egg Fried Rice - NO flavor whatsoever. I added that sweet red sauce to it, which made it taste a lot better. 

Crab Puff - I actually think this is the only thing I liked. 

Beef and Broccoli - Overcooked and no flavor, per family member who ate it. 

Chicken in Garlic Sauce - My BF ordered it. The chicken was cooked well and it tasted good. He wanted spicy, and it was spicy. 

Egg Drop Soup - Bland, no flavor. Worse we all have ever had.

Again I feel bad having to write a very negative review. But having to wait an hour and a half for delivery of the food (took 30 min longer than it was supposed too) and costing $35 for the 3 of us to eat. It was a waste of money. I wish we had gone elsewhere.
