9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw Ok.. Here I go..I want to like this place, so much that I tired it three times. Is so close to my house and open late that this would be the ideal place for me to get my  refills of my addiction of fried rice, they also have reverse happy hour and just in time for when I get off from work late at night. The service is good they're nice and attentive but I'm not here to eat the help, the problem is, that this fried rice does not satisfy my cravings, it needs something to give it more flavor every time I get home with my to go orders I have to add some Del Scorcho taco sauce, tapatio or whatever I find to give it more flavor but end up with Komex instead, the pan fried squid is too greasy and the tofu seafood soup too bland. Too bad that I have to leave China and head to the Sahara for good Chinese fried rice.
 I know I'll try again someday, is so closeTo my house, is hard to resist, hope next time they add some secret ingredient or some coke or something to the fried rice to make it memorable and make me come back, or at least add some MSG.
