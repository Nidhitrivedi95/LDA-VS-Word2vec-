yBxzqKXHhvNVaFnEOd4f7Q Wow, wow, wow... I love this place and highly recommend it to everyone!

I found this place on Yelp and it is the first Chinese place I have tried in Vegas because I am super picky and hate stomach mush after meals..

I saw a picture of the deep fried shrimp and that is what I ordered.  It had been many, many moons since I have seen a place make the fried shrimp in this amazing tempura style

We had the orange chicken, egg drop soup, sweet n sour. hi ken, egg rolls, fried rice, and deep fried shrimp.  It is all good!

It's is a hole in the wall, drive too fast and you will miss it. 

We ordered over the phone and picked up to go.  The service was nice and the prices are cheaper for the value.
