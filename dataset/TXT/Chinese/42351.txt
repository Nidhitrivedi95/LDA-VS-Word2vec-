Our waitress was minimally enthused and was experienced as irritated by our questions ("What do you recommend?"). However, the food was very tasty. I ordered the pork ramen which was the perfect portion for a later evening meal. I also had the New Holland Dragon's Milk stout which has sweet vanilla tones. Their menu says they have Strong Bow but they no longer serve it at this time.
