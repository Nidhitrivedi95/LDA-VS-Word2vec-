9SHoWGXsGOCa5hOjBOzPtg The last time I was here was 5 yrs ago. The food was good. Went back about a week ago and had Pork fried rice and bar b que pork. Both were tasteless and greasy. The fried rice had raw onions in the dish. My stomach ended up getting nauseous. Called to let them know and they acted like I didn't buy my food there. The reply was basically you paid there is nothing we can do.I will not be returning here ever again.
