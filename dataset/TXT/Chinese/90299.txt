iemZJSKNBp8vx66CPBG79Q If you are curious about name PengLai, 
I am not sure if that was an intention from the owners but it is the name of the 
place where Lu bu met his love in "Romance of Three Kingdoms".
anyways,
I was skeptical to try this place but It was not bad at all.
I tried Korean-Chinese style dishes such as black bean noodle
and spicy noodle with seafood, and yes it lacked the usual flavour of M.S.G!!
but was still O.K like a well home made type of dish.


Service was good, place was clean and I would return sometimes.
