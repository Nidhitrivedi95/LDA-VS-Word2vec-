MbDMS-I2eHoEWR5XMZ9YxQ Walked in during lunch hour at this small restaurant in Hochelaga and the place was busy! I figure this place would fill up more once school is underway too! 

You place your order at the counter and take a seat for your food is served! I opted for takeout: Pad Thai (or Pad Homa in honour of the neighbourhood) with chicken 11$ and a Vietnamese coffee at 3$. The portion was huge and the food was awesome! Service was super friendly and quick too! 

I especially liked the Vietnamese cold coffee which although I've had before elsewhere, I never enjoyed it as much as the one from this little hole in the wall! 

Literally, a hole in the wall; this venue looks sketch, located in a rundown strip mall across the metro, but the space is bright, clean, cute decor and offers some seating with a very casual setting.
