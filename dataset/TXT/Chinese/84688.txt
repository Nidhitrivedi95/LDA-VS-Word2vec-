hHtmzOwkdNj93QnKaUr5og This place is to Korean food what Outback is to Australian food.  So I wanted to write about what this place is and, perhaps more importantly, what it is not.

First, the good. The service was fine and the food arrived quickly.  Also, the interior is quite nicely done.  

Ok, the bad.  We were expecting authentic Korean food, but that's just not what this place serves.  For example, no Banchans; these are the small side dishes served at virtually every Korean restaurant.  Also, the rice wasn't typical of Korean fare, and had little flavor.  Also, they do not serve barley tea and they make their kimchi out of the wrong type of cabbage.

Unfortunately, this place is more of a rough interpretation of Korean food, as if the owners went to Korea, snapped a few pictures, ate a few meals, then decided to open a restaurant state-side.  

Vegas needs more Korean restaurants, but not at the expense of what makes Korean food delicious.
