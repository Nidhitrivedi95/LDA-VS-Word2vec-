VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ I've never been a big fan of Chinese food but I've heard people raving about this place for years so I finally gave them a shot. At other restaurants I usually get Kung Pao Chicken but here I wasn't all that impressed. I tried a few more things but still wasn't impressed however one day I found what has become not only my favorite dish here but just about anywhere -- the Ginger and Onion Beef with white rice.

Unfortunately, whether I'm at either of the Scottsdale locations or the one in Tempe, the quality has been inconsistent. We had a bad experience at the Scottsdale Rd location a few years ago. My wife ordered the Lemon Chicken and when our server brought the food to the table and then came back a minute later asking how my food was. I had started eating already but by wife said it was too hot so I said mine was fine and then the server disappeared. When my wife finally tried her food there was something wrong with the chicken but the server was nowhere to be seen for at least 20 minutes. We were finally able to get her attention and told her about the problem and she was snarky and said "why didn't you say that when I asked before?" We couldn't get her to refill our water glasses. I didn't want to leave a tip but my wife insisted even though she was pretty upset. We left a comment on the bill about the lousy service. We don't go that location anymore, going to the Tempe location most frequently.

My favorite dish is sometimes amazing and other times it's so-so. Last time we went to the Thompson Peak location, we ordered crab wontons as those along with our entrees tasted overcooked or burnt.

I hate to say this but I'm starting to fall out of love with this place.
