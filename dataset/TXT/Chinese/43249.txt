beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw From the time you walk in I was greeted with a menu and the option of a drink (while I was waiting for the other people in my group). This a great out of the norm experience for me and the food was good! Like I wouldn't have expected that when looking at soup! I like that everyone can choose what they want to eat and compare. Thanks again to the hostess and to James!!
