LG6vpg5Qx_DstY2aT8-O4Q Oh my god, I'm a student that eats with my parents and goes out with my friends to eat many types of cultural foods since I love the differences. I just had to say that the peanut butter chicken they had was like the best thing that I've eaten in my life. I was really confused why they didn't have it when I ordered before and they said it was a new item and people may have an allergy to it.I have tried many types of peanut butter chicken from lots of places this was the best!
I am defeninantly in love with it!!!!!!!!!!!!

Confined to come here since homework/school things kept coming up. I love the late hours and new things on the menu!
