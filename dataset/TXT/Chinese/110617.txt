Lw2vlPixPe72lDp9Cx6GoA I order regularly from Wang's Kitchen. I believe it is the best Chinese cuisine in the south hills. I like the seafood wontons & egg rolls. Their General Tso's chicken is also good. They usually have someone answering the phone that is able to clearly speak and understand English, which is always helpful. They always get our order right.
