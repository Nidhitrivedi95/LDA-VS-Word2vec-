2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg Went there tonight.  It wasn't as good today for some reason.  I ordered the home-made ice tea and it was great.  But that's all that was great.  We had the general tso chicken and it tasted raw and there seem to be more batter than chicken.  And their chow mein portion was so small and again the chicken seemed raw; and the sauce was pasty and greasy.  Last, we had egg rolls and they were soooo greasy too....

I still rate it a 4 b/c this is the only time I ate here that was a miss.  Just remember it's nothing fancy - just straight rustic Chinese food at a daily price you can afford.
