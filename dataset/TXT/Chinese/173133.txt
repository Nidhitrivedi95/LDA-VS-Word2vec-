W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ We came here with another couple and had one of our absolute best Vegas dining experiences. The food was delicious and had such a nice presentation. We were seated overlooking the strip and the service was perfect. We highly recommend Yusho and will be returning on our next trip!
