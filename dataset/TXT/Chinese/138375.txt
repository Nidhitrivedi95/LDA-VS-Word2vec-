qO6CWdRFfbOqDJ2UOulpaA I ate here twice and both times I was confused?  Was I eating Chinese food?  I was hoping this would be a great lunch stop, since its so close to my house.  With so much Chinese food restaurants to pick from this is one I avoid.  
I have to say the food is on the greasy side and the huge grease trap outside is evident from the alley on the side. 
Inside is very small with a few tables and supplies fill the back corner.  Not a pleasant place to sit and eat, take it home or on the go.
