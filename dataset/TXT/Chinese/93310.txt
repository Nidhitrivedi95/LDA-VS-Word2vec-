j-0QQUXuMuowlItX3ekBBQ I'm reviewing the new location at Yonge-Sheppard. I had their chicken dried noodle, first item in their menu. I only got one chicken wing in the bowl, definitely not enough when there's a tall portion of noodles underneath for me to eat still. I don't think it was unreasonable for me to expect a bowl of noodles that costs more  than $11 after tax to have more than one piece of chicken. The one piece of chicken was tasty though. The noodles were a bit too dry and the oiliness sets in towards the end. Although they mix the noodles for you beforehand, there was still more peanut sauce at the bottom than at the top of a tall noodle container that didn't allow much room for me to mix the noodles myself at all. Maybe I came in closer to their closing time and they didn't have enough ingredients left? I would have been open to trying other things on the menu if they had just been honest about it and recommended something else that they think they could have delivered better.
