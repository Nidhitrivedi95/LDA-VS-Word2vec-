Place is nice, service is EXCELLENT, food presentation follows, but quality of the food itself is where everything falls apart. 

My friend and I ordered two lemon drop martini...that tasted like LEMONADE!! I swear, there was no alcohol whatsoever in those. So we had to get a shot of vodka to compensate. I'm not sure if my friend got charged for it. I bet our waitress figured immediately why we needed it. No wonder. Perhaps someone else had the same issue. 

Next, the Tuna Tataki appetizer was the worst of the dishes. I understand how valuable tuna is, so why don't you serve fresh tuna and charge a bit more? NO doubt, that tuna was frozen and old. 
The sushi itself was not evil, but neither the best we have ever had (Tokyo and Tiger rolls) 

Wonton soup was delicious, one of my favorite soups and dessert (banana tempura) was good. (The green tea ice cream tasted just like a ball of sugar, no flavor of the green tea, but that's the least). 

I guess the Tuna app and the sushi itself is why I might try other places as far as Japanese cuisine. Too bad cause the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere cozy, but down to the quality of food, a disappointment.
