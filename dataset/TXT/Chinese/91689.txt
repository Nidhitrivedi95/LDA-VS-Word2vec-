ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w Loved the quality of the food here.

Just a few recs -- we ordered way too much -- the orders are generous in size -- even things like Shu-Mei and Har-Gow.  So order more conservatively and then order more if you need.

We had reservations and yet still waited about 20 minutes.  We did however go on a Sunday around 12:30 pm which is a very busy time for dim sum restaurants.

Do recommend whatever you want to try -- it is the typical Dim Sum - but of very high quality.
You tick off your selections from a form.
They then come back with a sheet showing what you ordered and tick off each item as it arrives at the table.

The place is bustling and you can certainly see why.
Recommend that you transit -- or there is a GreenP around the corner (not inexpensive though)!
