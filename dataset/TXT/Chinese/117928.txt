njngMI0mhAGJ-kH0oo68Ow I've been here again since my first review. Instead of the rice, I got noodles-- much better choice. I got the green beans which are as good as ever. I also got the  mapo tofu which was good as well. I tried the beef and chicken and I still think the meat tastes strange, but now I'm starting to think it's the seasoning. The chicken wasn't totally gross this time!
