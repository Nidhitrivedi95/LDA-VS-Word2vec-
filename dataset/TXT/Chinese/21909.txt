6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q Came here for a late lunch one day. The place was only half full and pretty quiet, which I really appreciated. We ordered vegetable steamed bun, har gow, egg noodle soup, and choi sum stir fried with garlic. Everything was really good, I especially liked the veggie steamed bun, I could have eaten just 10 of that and left this place happy. The egg noodle soup was really good too (it definitely satisfied my mom who was craving soup noodle the whole time we were in vegas!!). I would say this place is WAY better than Wazuzu in Encore. So if you're at Wynn or Encore and want quick Asian food fix, definitely go to this place over Wazuzu.
