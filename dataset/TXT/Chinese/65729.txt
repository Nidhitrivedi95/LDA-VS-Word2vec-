ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw The time that these restaurants are open are in accurate and yelp should change that to reflect the correct open to close times. Went there this evening just before closing, according to yelp, 9:30 but the actual time is 9:00 pm. Once inside I was waiting behind another person and the cashier was just laughing and talking to them for almost 8 mins. Once I get to the register he asked me if I was there to pick up and I said no I needed to place an order. That was when he told me " umm sorry we are closed" I replied no because I've been standing here for the last 10 mins and referenced the yelp listing hours. 

There was another person that was behind me and she too was upset at the fact he was taking his sweet time and trying to turn the both of us away. 

After everything I was able to place more order and left satisfied.  I just feel the staff could have handled things a little better and it would seem there needs to be a change to their hourly listing on Yelp.
