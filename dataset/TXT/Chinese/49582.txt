After a long 3 1/2 hour drive from California, checking into the Bellagio, and getting settled in the room, they start craving for Asian food. The first restaurant that comes up in Noodles because it's not too big like the other restaurants and it's tucked away right by the Baccarat Bar and table games. 

Every time we wait to be seated, it takes about 15 - 20 minutes but when Chinese customers wait, they are seated right away like they were, V.I.P.'s. Sounds like discrimination to me!  The Contemporary decoration in this restaurant was very relaxing with various jar of ingredients they use for their overpriced food. 

Our server was friendly and personable and gave us our drinks right away with some time to order. 

We ordered: 

*Hot Tea $4.50 -- Jasmine

*CHILEAN SEA BASS $34: Nonya curry sauce, bell peppers, onions (steamed) Homemade garlic ginger sauce, broccoli (steamed or deep fried) Soy sauce, green onions, ginger (steamed)

*BEEF $22 Kung pao sauce, bell peppers, onions, peanuts Broccoli, straw mushrooms, carrots Mongolian style, bell peppers, onions, green onions
Black pepper sauce, asparagus Black bean sauce, bell peppers, onions, garlic

*CHINESE BROCCOLI $12.50 Sautéed in garlic or steamed (oyster sauce)

*CANTONESE ROAST DUCK $18.50 Plum sauce

The food in my honest opinion was delicious and I couldn't fault on anything. What bothered me and caused the review to go from 5 stars to 2 stars was the service. It took us a while to get our refills for out water and the food took about 25  - 35 minutes to be served. 

Our server kept telling us, "the food was on it's way," my Dad got tired of waiting and went to hit the slots. Around the restaurant, I noticed a lot of Chinese customers were getting their food much faster than us and that made me irritated. I never experienced this level of service. 

Nest time, I'll avoid this over priced restaurant and go for the Bellagio Snack bar where I can receive excellent service and cheaper eats.
