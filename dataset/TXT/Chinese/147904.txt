Pacific actually started in Chandler and I'm very to happy that they added another one here on the west side! Never have to wait too long here. Plenty of room and great variety of Asian cuisine. Pretty good sushi bar with tempura veggies, various sushi rolls, and a platter of sushi "accessories" such as pineapple salmon salad. The rolls are made fresh in front of ya. They also have a Mongolian grill, also hot and fresh after you assemble what you want. King crab on the weekend is a must. They seriously have a variety of food...from es cargo to frog legs to dim sum items. Along with a variety of desserts, they even have green tea ice cream! Haven't seen green tea cream at any other buffet here in AZ.  Oh, and you scoop your ice cream the "Thrifty" way from the tub...which I prefer than the Micky D's way. Anyways, come with a big appetite and enjoy!
