Solid meal with entertainment today at this new restaurant that used to house one of our favourite restaurants. We were a group of 13 for New Years dim sum.

Food was good, with the usual dim sum favourites available. We got there at 930 and they would not let us order off the 11am menu until 11am. This was a bit disappointing as my kid has allergies and most dim sum places will let us order half chicken for her to nibble on.

They had a veggie stuffed tofu dish which I enjoyed very much. Also at 11am we ordered a deep fried tofu dish which was tasty. The beef rice noodle roll was too red for my liking.

They had live entertainment for New Years, three dragons dancing. They had heads of lettuce that you could get for your table centerpiece and you were expected to stuff them with lye-cee so that the dragons would come to your table and "throw the cabbage". The older kids and adults loved this.

Service was very slow, even though we were there before it got crowded. Empty plates piled up on the table. Lots of people working there spent a lot of time getting photos with the dragons.
