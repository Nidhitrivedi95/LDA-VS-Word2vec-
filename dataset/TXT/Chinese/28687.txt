8TpKY3zo6UzG3SVk6a-FRg Had the worst experience in this congee restaurant. Their server was an older man who had a tooth pick (actually picking his teeth) in his mouth the whole time. My biggest concern was if anything from his mouth or tooth pick could've gone into our congee! Another customer next to us was coughing erratically so it was just a gross experience for me and my family. When it comes to cleanliness this is not the best place to go for congee. I suggest going uptown instead.
