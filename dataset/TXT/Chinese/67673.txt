eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g Was excited to try this place out.. Been waiting for them to finish renovations..

Finally got the chance to try,  

The place is renovated for fine dining, however the food wasn't worth the fine dining price.

We had a table of 8, tried the Geo duck, lobster, and king crab combo, it really was nothing special for fine dining... I've been to other places were we ate the same type of food for a cheaper price and bigger portions...

I would say that the fried oyster (separately ordered) was really really good and the fried rice at the end was really really good, those two dishes were the highlight of the evening.. Crab legs and lobsters were just regular Chinese food

We didn't have anything to drink, the bill was $120pp, for that price, you can actually have fine dining downtown... Not just regular Chinese food in a fine dining environment..

All in all, I would not go back, but didn't regret the experience.

Lol, my brother ended up going to McDonald's right after dinner.

My biggest pet peeve, I heard so many things about their fish tank during pre-renos, even in Ottawa I heard about them having problems installing their fish tank, I expected to see a glamourous fish tank, but was so disappointed.. I should just go to Ripleys aquarium next time lol
