tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg The service was ok. The food was salty. The sushi was full of rice and not enough filling. The lettuce wraps were ok but pei wei has better ones that have more flavor other than salt. The reason for two stars instead of one was because my drinks were very tasty! I had the ginger lime margarita and the daily mule! I won't be back for the food or the service but maybe for the drinks!
