EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ I'd rate it a ZERO if I could.  Sat down & was not even acknowledged. After 15 minutes I decided to leave. Waiters & waitresses saw us but never once came to our table. RUDE. OH! & the place smelled like shit & they couldn't even spell Fried rice correct in their menu. Steeeer Awayyyy.
