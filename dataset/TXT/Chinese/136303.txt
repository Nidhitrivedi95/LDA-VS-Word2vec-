QG56Fy7JQ_9XgAwtj7fhjw Their food is excellent but the service is so unsatisfactory. 
We would go their once a month ordering the roast fish which is a fish marinated, pan fried, grilled and boiled in the spicy soup, served in a big plate over small charcoal. You can order different kinds of spicy. 

I also recommend the pork/lotus root soup. The dishes with lotus root are all worth a try. 

The service was slow every time I went there. Their waiter and waitress can't do multiple tasks. We would like one cup of water and one empty glass. He did that by coming twice. He also forgot my order of one of two dishes. This happened before probably not the same waiter. What I dislike most is they don't give you receipt and only accept cash. That is so convenient for them..... Not us.
