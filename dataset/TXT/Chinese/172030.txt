VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg Yooooo I actually love the crystal boba here. Like, I love the texture and the flavor, I really wish I could find a place in LA that had it because dang, I'll definitely want this boba again. It also went really well with my Jasmine Milk Teapresso! Not too sure what a teaspresso is but I asked for 75% sugar and it was the perfect sweet Jasmine flavor I was looking for. 

I also had my friend's Osmanthus Oolong Tea and it was pretty good too although I prefer my Jasmine. Overall, this place has solid teas which is what I appreciate because nowadays, too many places taste like straight up syrup and that's not cool. It's also nice that you can adjust the sweetness. 

And again, that crystal boba. This is a boba place I'll have to always visit every time I'm in Vegas!
