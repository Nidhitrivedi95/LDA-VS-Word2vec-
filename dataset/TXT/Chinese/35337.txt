ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ Was here for a birthday celebration and we sat at this longggggg table near the back. 

The food isn't bad. Everything was freshly made and some were made to order. The Peking duck was pretty good, better than some restaurants. Sashimi was fresh, salad was fresh. The shrimp at the salad bar is a pretty good size and was fresh. The prime roast was also pretty good. Moist and had a nice pink color. The dessert table had a good variety. Creme Brule had a nice crust.

The service was night and day between two servers. One of them was nice and attentive, she even gave me a free refill on my cold osmanthus tea. While the other server just seemed annoyed to be working or was having a bad day. 

Overall for a buffet this place isn't bad at all but I prefer the one at york mills more. I think it's the decor but this restaurant seems to be much noisier than the other one. I also felt the other restaurant has more variety.
