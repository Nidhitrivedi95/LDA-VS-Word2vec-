6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ I was really excited for this place.  Their specialty are steamed dumplings, one of my favorite dishes.  What I really enjoyed was that they had a variety of flavors and so many choices.  So on my first visit I bought the pork and cabbage dumplings, the chive and egg fried dumpling, lamb kabobs and a blueberry and strawberry smoothie.  First of all the lamb kabobs were awesome.  They were full of flavor and well priced.  The meat was tender and tasty.  I would give it four stars.  The second item was the smoothie.  That was one of the low points.  It was very ice filled and not very flavorful.  two stars.  Next was the pork and cabbage dumplings.  Was super disappointing.  I like the speed of how they were made, but the dumplings themselves were bland.  Very very bland.  two stars.  Last of all was the fried chive and egg dumpling.  This was my favorite.  It was large and crispy, full of flavor, and nice and hot.  It was super filling and well priced and i would for sure order that again.  I well update when i go back again, hopefully it will be better.
