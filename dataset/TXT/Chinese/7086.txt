0pm-hpu8Rkfa16tLjWb-GQ This is our new place for some authentic, Chinese spice loaded dishes! The dishes are very flavorful but that means they are really strong (which I personally like and am OK with), so be aware. Our favorite of the day was the pickled string bean and minced meat noodle. YUM. We will be back often!
