JethT5yt9ju6MGK8-N3oPg Groove is in the heart...
The chills that you spill 
Up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come. 
I WOULD ask for another
Oh yeah, I'd ask for another (that's right)
Your groove I don't deeply groove.
Ugly walls only the bridge
My Supper dish
My super tasty wish
I'd ask for another

Watch out!

Reviewing Noodle Delight is like reviewing a mom and pop shop burger joint.  It's the asian equivalent to fast food burgers.   Now normally I ONLY order the Brisket soup noodles and very rarely stray away from it.  And now I remember why.  I had the curry chicken special which for $10 includes a watery hot and sour soup, a flattened fountain drink, a greasy spring roll (which wasn't too bad) and the wateriest blandest curried chicken I've ever had in my life.  Not only was it not any kind of curry I know, it should have been renamed "essence" of curry water.  It did come with giant chunks of chicken, but if it's going to be so flavourless, you could provide me with the mother of all hens and it's not going to matter.

Service has always been the same here since the dawn of time.  It's fast food, where you go up to the counter and order, and the set up is like Harvey's, but they always somehow make you feel like they're doing you a favour by providing you the food.  The turn around time is always amazingly quick, and that's the bottom line that keeps me coming back.  When I'm in a rush, this is the place.

I know other things have been okay here, like beef fried noodles and the sweet and sour chicken that I've known other people to have ordered.  But from now on I'm sticking to the brisket.

Groove is in the heart.. 1-2-3 brrrrrr.. *pop*  C'mon, ya'll are crazy.
