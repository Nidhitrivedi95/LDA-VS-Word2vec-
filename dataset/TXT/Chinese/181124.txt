Having said that this is my go to place for Chinese take out. Always fast on the delivery, I think last time it took a little over 20 minutes from the time I hung up to having the delivery guy knock on my door. 

The quality is always consistent and tasty. The portions are huge for most dishes. Almost every dish is good for two meals (and I eat a lot). It's also super cheap - about $10 for most dishes, cheaper if you get a veggie only dish. 

Been ordering from here for two years now.
