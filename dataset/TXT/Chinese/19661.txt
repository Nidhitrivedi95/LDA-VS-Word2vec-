5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Had the pleasure to attend dinner at a private room with 10 people.
The fried lobster, peking duck, and foie gras were superb.
The mustard greens however were overcooked.  The whole dungeness crab didn't have much meat to it.
The oolong tea was flavorful.
Great service.  Got the white glove treatment.
