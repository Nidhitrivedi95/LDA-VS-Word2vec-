Q9veWOu7mFj881o3nqB4bQ Bad customer service. The other day my friends and I wanted to go there for dinner to celebrate friends birthdays. We made a reservation because we have six people. The person who wrote down our reservation told us the only time available is 6:15, and we cannot all make it at 6:15. He informed us it's okay if most of us are presented. When five of us got there, the guy (I think it's the owner) told us we don't have a reservation. After awhile they figured someone had crossed off our reservation for some reasons. The guy refused to seat us because there's one person missing. We told the guy what we were told on the phone, and he said that's not our policy. His employee told us the wrong thing, so we have to wait. We were waiting for thirty mins until our one friend got here. When we all arrived and waited another 5-10 mins, he told us there's no available seating for us, we'll have to wait for awhile. We got so frustrated so we just went somewhere else.
