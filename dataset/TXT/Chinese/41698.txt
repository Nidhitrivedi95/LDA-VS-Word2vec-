b7wUWVV01xaa7E0FUNMDiw We took some friends here to dine. Our favorites were the pork hock, crispy octopus, wontons and the truffle fried rice. My only gripe is that the portions are miniscule. The bites are super tasty and flavors are unique. I had the tom yum booze cocktail which had a good kick to it. The menu is split between one bites and shareable apps and mains. Server got his math wrong and charged us less. We did not realize this until we stepped out and were ready to walk to the streetcar and he came down chasing us apologizing for his mistake. The restaurant got really busy quickly and it was a tad loud but we got a nice private booth. The service was decent and we never felt like we had to wait for too long to be served. The desserts don't look all that interesting on paper but were not bad. The banana split had some interesting spice to it and the sugar cake reminded me of a popular dish in our culture. Definitely a place to check out and should soon rise in popularity with word of mouth.
