SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA This place never disappoints!!!  Lunch or Dinner, it doesn't matter I'll be there :p  Food is awesome, and not overpriced! Anyway, if you decide to go or not it's totally up to you. But if you do make sure you try the sesame chicken and the chicken lo mein, and the Mongolian beef. They are very very good!
