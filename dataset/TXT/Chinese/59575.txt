dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw Came to Great Bao's solely on a recommendation from my friend who is a chef. He was taught by the owner of Great Bao's, Chef Sheridan. Who also cooked at Michelin Starred, Sona and various other restaurants around Las Vegas.

Great Bao's is tucked in a shopping plaza and inside of a hair salon. Yes you read right, a hair salon. Searching for this venue was like playing a RPG game. It is in a hair salon and literally the restaurant is in a shack. NO more than 2 people can fit into the kitchen and maybe 5 people at most can eat at a time. But don't let the exterior decor fool you. Chef Sheridan is no joke on his tiny electric stove. It shows. People will line up just to try one hell all of his baos. 

I absolutely love his concept and his food, obviously. Simple items made to perfection. Order ANY of the baos. They are all great. No lie. I just ate whatever he flowed to me. He started me off with the sesame noodle salad as a starter. A great crisp appetizer worth every bite. Pork belly, Duck, Pulled Puck and a drink for $10. Really can't beat that. Special shoutout to his lady for making those mocha shakes cause we had to hit the road back to California right after. We even ordered another round of 3 bao's for the road. They are THAT awesome!

The bao's were as good if not better than David Chang's Momofuku buns and a clear competitor to Ippudo's in NY's.

Make it a point to visit Great Bao. I rec' friends to go and they are overly impressed.

Happy for you Chef Sheridan. Best of luck with your endeavors!
