ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Great little spot on Central!  

My husband and I have been meaning to try it for a while now and we finally made it in last night.  It was 8pm on a Saturday so needless to say they were busy.  But we were seated right away at the bar so we didn't have a wait.  Our bartender/server was awesome and I'm glad we made the choice to be seated at the bar.

I had the "hey bartender" and my drink ended up being a tasty concoction of gin, basil, and lemony goodness.

My husband had the grapefruit soda and that was really refreshing with the right balance of tart and sweet.

We loved our shrimp and chive dumplings so much that we ordered another round of dumplings and tried the pig face dumplings.  Also good!

We split the pork ramen and it was pretty good, as well.  A little salty but I'd prefer the broth be a little savory instead of bland.

Overall the service, food and energy were great.  Can't wait to go back for more.
