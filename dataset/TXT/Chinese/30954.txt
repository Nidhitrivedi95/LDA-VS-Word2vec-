9ibMbke1qYbmhJ2Qf3tWfA Really like this place! It stunk because they were closing in 10 minutes when we got there so we ate outside for a bit. Anyways! We got the fried rice, egg drop soup ( not the best.. has corn in it which I'm not a fan of but if you are by all means enjoy!) I got the Mongolian beef and my boyfriend got General Tso's Chicken. Both were completely amazing! I will defiantly be back and try more things! Please check this place out! It is defiantly worth it!
