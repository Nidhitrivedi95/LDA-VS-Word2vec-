HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw The reviews don't lie. This place serves legit Chinese food at a bargain price. Since it is a hike from our home and we didn't know when/if we would be back, we tried a bunch of food (and will have leftovers for a million days). The menu was huge and somewhat strangely disorganized. Make sure to look all the way through so you don't miss out on the yummies in the back. We ordered:

Kung Pao Chicken/fried rice
General Tso's chicken/brown rice
Veggie Chow Fun (dry)
Crab puff ($2 for 2 large poofs)
Spicy chili chicken dumplings(4)
2 sodas

(all for $28!!)

The Kung Pao was tasty, spicy and the veggies cooked perfectly. The chicken was a good quality. The only negative was that the peanuts were placed on top after the dish was prepared. The general's chicken sauce had a kick and the crunch and taste of the breading was unique and yummy. The chicken meat wasn't all the greatest quality (a lot of dark meat, untrimmed gristle) but served its purpose. Bummer that no peppers or veggies come with General's as elsewhere.

I was offered either wet or dry chow fun and went with the recommended dry (stir fried in soy sauce). So glad that I got the veggie version. Perfectly cooked and the subtle sauce on the flat rice noodles was fabulous. The crab puffs(2) were clearly homemade, which we appreciated but they didn't have much flavor. No crab to be found and missing that slight sweetness that I enjoy in the puff elsewhere. Hubby enjoyed the dumplings (4) and saved the sauce for his dish (I didn't care for the sauce but the dumpling was cooked really well). They give you cans of soda (thus, no refills) and the food comes out super fast. This is usually appreciated but it came out at the same time as our appetizers, which didn't give us a chance to ease into our ginormous meal. 

Due to the freshness and low cost of the food as well as wide variety of options, we would come back but try something different.
