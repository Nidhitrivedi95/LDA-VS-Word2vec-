bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog Mian Sichuan Noodles is delicious! I ordered the House Beef Noodles and it was full of flavor! The soup has a nice umami flavor and a good spicy kick. They also have Mung Bean cold tea that's free. It's a light sweet taste, similar to Chrysanthemum tea. I will definitely come again!
