uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw Came here late one night after consuming some adult beverages.  The beauty of this place is that it's 24 hours!

If you are looking for fresh handmade noodles in a rich broth, this is the place to be.  Had their noodle soup with lamb and it was great.  The soup was a tad salty, but the texture of the noodles was perfect.

We came here at about 2am on a Saturday night and they were packed, but service was still on point, quick and accurate!

To end, great food, great service.
