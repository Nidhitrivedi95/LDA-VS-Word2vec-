KhvwEXKJXRTgcJRNmJNhsA I have been driving by this place for weeks now and finally I got to try this place out last night! I am so happy there's finally a great Chinese restaurant close by me. I ordered the salt and pepper chicken, shrimp pad Thai, and their Szechwan beef! It was delicious! The pad Thai was not as good as real pad Thai, but it was good enough to fill my expectations.  The place was very small but intimate. I like how you can see the chefs cooking your food and they have boba's!!! They also have lunch specials which is priced very reasonable!
