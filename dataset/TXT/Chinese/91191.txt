iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A Today was the worst experience ever for rude service and terrible food...
Male Asian server brought our the wrong dish and said it was what I ordered?
The soup was nasty tasting and served cold 
The main dish was not edible...
When I told the server how bad the food was...he couldnt give a damm...I asked the server if there was a new owner because Ive been coming to this location for years...he said no?
DON'T WASTE A DIME AT THIS BAD RESTURANT... TOO MANY OTHER CHOICES
