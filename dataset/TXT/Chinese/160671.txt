uBCRRQJ4ukFaE_UyY6T1uQ I have to say, my experience was different than several of the more recent reviewers. I had some family in town staying at the Four Seasons and we decided to head here for dinner for the large booths so my nieces could lay down if they got tired. The staff was beyond accommodating, even going next door for a peanut butter sandwich and chicken strips for my young nieces. I though the food was very good and the server was very knowledgeable and helpful in deciding what to order. I can't think of any way the experience could have been improved and will definitely return.
