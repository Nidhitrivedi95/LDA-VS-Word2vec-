x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg I've dined here so many times I can't even count.  I've just never been compelled to write a review until now.  

We've celebrated many a birthdays and anniversaries here including our wedding rehearsal dinner and most recently, my daughter's 1st birthday party.  As a new mom planning a baby's 1st birthday for 60+ guests, I was a ball of nerves trying to find a restaurant that could deliver great quality food and also have a nice looking private room for the festivities.  The choice came down to a handful but what really won me over was the manager, Joyce, who was so helpful in planning the menu and accommodating us for numerous access requests for decorations and deliveries.  I must say that she did such a fantastic job for my daughter's birthday, I will always return to Asian Legend and they have a customer for life.  

The challenge was that out of the 60+ guests, about half would be children under the age of 8.  And as I did not want a sit down menu with multiple courses (C'mon, who has kids that'll sit through a nine course lunch), it was a new thing for Asian Legend to tackle.  But they stepped up to the plate and served a buffet-style lunch consisting of lots of dim-sum menus and traditional dishes alike.  There were a total of 19 dishes so I will not go into listing them all here but all I can say is that the food was excellent and the staff did such a fantastic job serving our guests as they arrived with fresh food.  They even helped serve my 2 gigantic homemade cake!  

I cannot say enough great things about Asian Legend and their staff for making my daughter's first birthday party so stress-free for me.  As most first time moms would agree, sanity is a very precious thing.  :)
