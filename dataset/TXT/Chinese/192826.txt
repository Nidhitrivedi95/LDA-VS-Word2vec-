z9lOfnUorcbWR_xS0DSeHw My fiance loves this place to death. I have tried about 10 dishes here in hopes of finding one that I will like enough to be happy when he wants to order Fugu instead of switching into clever-ploys-to-do-something-other-than-Fugu mode.

I can't put my finger on it, exactly, but everything seems to be too much or too little of too many things. Too spicy, too greasy, too bland, too many bones I have to pick out. It's like that dish that you cook for yourself at home and when you go to taste it you think oh dang, this isn't very good but I made it so I might as well eat it. But you don't really want to feel that way about takeout that you get all the time, you know?
