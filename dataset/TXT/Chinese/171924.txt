VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ I tried this place again after bad food experiences in the past, and yet again Flos didn't deliver. The hostesses took our pick up order, but left out our lettuce wraps. When I called to have them charge the order back to my card, the hostess was snippy and told me that they could only take down my phone number so that next time I came in to dine there I could get credit. I won't be going back.
