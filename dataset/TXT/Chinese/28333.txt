The noodles were high quality and definitely the highlight.  I could tell they were fresh (had the thin round noodles).  Base was also tasty but not too spicy.  Would recommend if craving a good bowl of noodles.

Believe they still needed to finish the inside of the restaurant.  They only took cash.
