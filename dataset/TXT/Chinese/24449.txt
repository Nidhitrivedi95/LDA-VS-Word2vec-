6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag We asked friends for a great Chinese restaurant and they suggested China Mama. My daughter and I tried it out last night, as promised the food was delicious but the experience was not. I'll preface this I own a restaurant in Florida, I've done everything in a restaurant from washing dishes to cook, serve and everything in between.
We were seated, given menus and then then nothing, no one came back to take our order, we sat for 1/2 hour. My daughter went to the counter to ask if we had a server or if we were suppose to order up there because no one came by. He just replied with asking her what she wanted. We still aren't sure where you're suppose to order! Our food came quickly they were not that busy and it was great. Then we sat another 1/2 hour after we finished and my daughter had to go back to the counter to ask for our check. Since we still had no idea if we had a server and this was turning into a self service experience. The menu says fine dining, this was not. 
We had a lot of leftovers and asked for to go containers, the waiter said he didn't have any he ran out. I was incredulous, I said you have take out right? He said yes, then looking at my face, he picked it up and he would figure it out and he did.

One more thing the portions are served family style, I think an Important thing to mention.
