4X3IPhAmq5YynFRDeuBlbQ There are is one other Chinese delivery that I know of in my area, and I prefer this one more. 

I have ordered from them, both take out and delivery, several times now and have enjoyed it each time. It always is hot and fresh tasting. As far as Chinese food goes, it is pretty typical. Everything is standard and good. I also like that when you order a meal that is typically served fried with sauce (like lemon chicken or sweet and sour anything) they serve the sauce in a separate container. This allows you to drip or drech how you see fit and keeps the fried meat from becoming soggy. 

Good portions and reasonable prices.
