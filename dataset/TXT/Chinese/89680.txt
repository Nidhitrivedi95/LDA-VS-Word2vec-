I8TOosBLYKxZMAYNNyGEyg I have ordered from here twice. First time was our first night in Arizona; my boyfriend and I were tired, starving, and smelly. I ordered the sesame chicken dinner special and crab puffs. Boy, they both hit the spot and it all was the right amount of food--not too much, not too little.

The second time I ordered the same thing, but the quality sucked. The breading was soggy, and the container was barely full. Also the eggrolls are nasty but they gave me one instead of the drink that I asked for on the phone. When I asked, "may I have my drink?" the girl (who didn't take the order) said, "You can only have an eggroll or a drink. You got an eggroll" *points to bag*. And that was that. 

 I'm not going back except in a time of desperation or intoxication.
