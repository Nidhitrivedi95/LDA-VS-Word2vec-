OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA Came for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The restaurant wasn't crowded which was a good thing. 

We ordered:

Roasted pork: good, skin was delicious and crunchy but a little bit on the salty side 

Roasted duck and char siu with egg noodles: duck was super salty and chewy. Char siu and noodle soup was bland 

Preserved eggs with pork congee: good. Not too watery

Chinese donut: would have been better if it was a little toasted

We asked for extra onions and the waitress said she already put a lot in the noodles and didn't seem to want to bring us more but she did. We asked for boxes to pack up our food and they asked for what. The waitress even left the cashier to come to our table and ask what we are packing up. I said the Chinese donut and pork, they said use the brown bag for the donut and give her back the box. Who says that? I don't want to put it in the bag. Does it matter how I pack my food? I told her I didn't want to put it in the bag I'm traveling far. She was pretty upset and mumbled in Cantonese how it should be in the bag and if we weren't going to use the bag she wanted it back. I replied in Cantonese and told her you want the bag then take it back, but of course she didn't. She was super rude. Food is whatever I would say pass on this place and spend your money elsewhere.
