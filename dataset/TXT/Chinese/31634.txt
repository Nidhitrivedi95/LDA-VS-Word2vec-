9rzfGwR--QUGn7BZJdm-Sw I've heard so much about this place over the last several years and for some reason just got around to checking it out for myself a few weeks ago. 

I visited with a friend for lunch on a weekday. It was fairly quiet, yet wasn't easy to find a parking spot. From what we could see there are only about ten spots out front and it looked like that would be a big problem at a busier time of day.

We ordered 8 different dim sum items and they all arrived quite quickly. Unfortunately, a couple of items were lukewarm when they arrived and the others got cold quite quickly as we could only eat so fast. This is the problem with a dim sum restaurant where you have to order from a menu as opposed to one where the carts are being wheeled around and you can just grab one or two dishes at a time.

Temperature aside, the food was pretty good. We had the black pepper shortribs which were very tasty and bit chewy (as they usually are). They were also served piping hot. 
The pork shiu mai was delicious and nice and warm. 
The steamed shrimp dumplings were plump, filled with lots of shrimp and also very hot. 
The stuffed eggplant a favourite of mine for dim sum) was also nice and hot and probably one of the best I've tasted. 
The shrimp rice rolls were lukewarm and just okay. The fried shrimp rolls were absolutely delicious and nice and warm. They were just whole shrimp wrapped cigar-style in spring roll wrappers and deep fried.
The fried shrimp dumplings were good, but could've been warmer.
The radish cake is also a favourite of mine, but this one just wasn't good. It was far too big, lukewarm and not very tasty at all. Big disappointment.
The taro buns, although very tasty, were again served lukewarm.

All in all, we enjoyed our meal and I will probably return with my family and give them another chance to wow me.
