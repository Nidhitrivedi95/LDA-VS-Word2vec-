wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw Great little joint; pipes in satellite TV - what a treat to watch Asian variety shows while having a late Saturday-night  dinner.  It's the kind of place where you can order off the Chinese menu, except that the Chinese menu is accessible to everyone.

Good:
* Great, great food.  The seafood with X and O sauce, the salty fried rice, the jade tofu with fish - I order these with regularity.
* The wait staff are super-nice and happy to make recommendations.
* Good price for decent food.

Bad: 
* I love snow pea shoots, and all other manner of greens, and order them here, but they are on the greasy side.
