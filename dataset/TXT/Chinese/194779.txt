zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ All hype, no substance. Not really a noodle fan, but I wasn't WOWED by the experience here. Pork buns were tasteless and I should have brought my trusty bottle of hoisin sauce as service wasn't the best either. Such a disappointment as the NY location was so hyped up. 

I hope David chang reads this before its too late.

Will NOT be back.
