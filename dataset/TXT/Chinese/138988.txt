qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w I've been going to this place for at least 6 years . I have recommended it to countless people in that time. Sadly about a year ago they started on a rapid decent to become one of the worst run operations in town . I don't know if its new ownership or employee's but the overall food quality and flavors have gotten terrible. Delivery service used to be reasonable even on very busy Friday or Saturday night. Not anymore. We usually order with EAT24 online and have never had a problem . We figured we would give them one last shot to redeem themselves and they failed miserably tonight. We placed our order and waited 2 hours (stated wait time 60-75 mins)  . We called to ask and were confronted by two employees that spoke no English . Not broken English  as might be expected but literally no English . We called Eat24 to cancel our order . Sadly we will have to find another East Coast style Chinese place in our area.  If it is the same owners who originally opened the restaurant and they are reading this . Please fix whatever it is that is broken . You were the best and now are a sad excuse who will be out of business soon running like this .
