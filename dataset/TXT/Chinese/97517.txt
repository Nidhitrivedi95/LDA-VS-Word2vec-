JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw REALLY good. And talk about that eye candy!

My friends and I came here on a Sunday at 3pm and there were only a couple of tables left, but they had obviously just been through a huge lunch rush as most of the tables still had to be cleaned. At first we asked for a table but thought better of it and decided to sit at the bar. Do this. Sit at the bar. It is totally worth it and the experience of watching the noodle transformation, the dumpling making, and just food preparation is probably a totally different experience than sitting with your companions at a table.

The restaurant is small -- no more than twenty tables and a wrap-around bar with about 20 seats. The staff here is super friendly and very, very helpful. They make no assumptions about how much you know about the menu and are incredibly enthusiastic to offer suggestions. For appetizers, we ordered the following: Spicy Wonton - house-made wonton with spicy soy sauce and Beef Pancakes. Totally agree with the other reviewers - the sauce for the spicy wontons is a bit on the sweet side, but otherwise they are very good. Don't expect huge lumpsof meat wrapped in a tiny wonton though, because they are cute, tiny wontons. I really loved the beef pancakes and thought they were a unique cross between a soup dumpling and gyoza. Delish!

For my main, of course I had to order soup! I tried the Shang Beef Noodle: beef broth, braised beef brisket, veggies + hand-pulled noodles. The  soup is HUGE. It is incredibly flavorful and the beef is tender and seasoned well. Everything in that bowl is delicious, made even more delicious by the hot young man constantly pulling noodles in front of us. I'm telling you, sit at the bar. Oh, and you get lots of noodles in the soup. Don't order extra noodles, that's just crazy.

Worth traveling off the strip? If only just to see the noodle maker...
