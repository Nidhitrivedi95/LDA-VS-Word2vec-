qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A PF Changs has always been a place where I have enjoyed going for some Chinese food and the food was still excellent. I had the hot and sour soup to start which was a nice start, chicken lettuce wraps were delicious, the crispy honey chicken was cooked very well and the banana spring rolls for dessert has become one of my favors dishes. The reason for the two star review is because of the service which was horrible. It took us about and hour and a half to complete our meal and this is because the waiter that attended to our table to put it lightly couldn't have cared any less about pretending to want to be there. If we wanted a drink we had to wait, every dish took forever to come out and it being a thurs night with a very limited amount of patrons it didn't seem to make sense what was taking so long. The restaurant used to be a nice place for a night out,  a date something of that sort, but it's completely lost its gusto. I would compare it to a little bit nicer than Chilis when before I held PF Changs to a higher standard. I guess the more corporate you become, the less you care about what takes place in your restaurant and it clearly shows
