lh9ZqHBodHoHkRZzshaXlg We came here for lunch today.  The place was pretty empty,  we were there from 12.30pm - 2.30pm and there was a total of 10 patrons including us.  We ordered a personal hot pot each.  We ordered the signature spicy soup base  and the pork bone soup base. The soup bases are the best thing about this place,  apart from that,  not much else.  You can't really go wrong with hot pot,  you're cooking food yourself.  Also noticed that you get 2 trays of meat per pot now,  instead of 1. It was filling but still not good value.  The meat is so thin that it's see through.  We also ordered the poached chicken,  side dish.  It wasn't very good looking or tasting and a waste of $5.99. The staff came to refill our pots with broth a few times,  so there was always liquid in the little pot.  We were served a mug of tap water but Chinese speaking customers were given a mug of hot barley tea.  Also,  when we enquired about the 20% discount promo,  we were given a mumbled excuse,  that it doesn't apply to hot pots.  Only applies to a la cart,  like wth?  I thought you only sold hot pots and noodle pots.  I think he was being dishonest because the place is so empty.  Doubt I will ever return again.
