cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A So fabulous.  We weren't sure how to order but people in line were helpful and then taste testings at the order desk with such helpful, patient people.  Red jade Chicken and Emerald Chicken -some in quesadilla's -the black beans and fresh pinto beans were to die for.  Planning what we want to try next!!!  Just awesome.
