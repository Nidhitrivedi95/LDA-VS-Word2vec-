bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A Ordered through eat24, which was easy an convenient. Delivery was prompt and order was accurate. We each got the $9.99 meal, which is an egg roll, rice, entree and small soup. It was a good deal for the amount of food. I got the egg drop soup and Mongolian beef, not too spicy, and it was perfect! My fiancé got the Kung pao chicken and wonton soup and both left something to be desired. Wonton was pretty bland and the Kung pao wasn't even spicy, like at all, and he asked for it done "medium". Egg rolls tasted pretty gingery and could've been better but they were ok. Overall it was good and we will be ordering again, just a shame the Kung pao wasn't better.
