HGuHk935tyokX6kveEviJw Terrible customer service and nothing great about the food. Our bill was pricey and they treated us badly. Only one guy waiter made an effort to do his job correctly, our other server was horrible. Told us to shoo our plates in order to make room for setting the food items and even told one of our guests "she's too busy to be serving us, ask someone else". Only giving it 2 stars because it's a clean and spacious environment, and because of that ONE person who was actually being nice. We had to stand up multiple times to get their attention, no one was attentive to our needs and no one offered to refill water.
