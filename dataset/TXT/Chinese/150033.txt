Tired of going to the store to get laxatives?
I have the solution for you.  Order the lettuce wraps at PF Changs.
We recently dined here as we have for several years.  Unfortunately, the quality seems to be declining.
After three days of constantly visiting the porcelain throne, I called the restaurant and talked to a manager named Brad.  He said he would file a "claim" and I gave him my name, etc.  By the way he handled my call to inform them so that other customers would not be affected, I got the impression that he is no stranger to complaints about the food.
It is a shame.  They used to be great.
Fortunately, there are so many other restaurants here in the Valley from which to choose.
