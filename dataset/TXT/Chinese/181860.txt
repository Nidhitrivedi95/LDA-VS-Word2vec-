Xfod0UWr_9B-TOM6qxVIwQ We decided to try Asian Island because of all the nice reviews it got. This is a little mom and pop place that reminds of those little shops in SF Chinatown. 

We decided to eat there and they started us off with fried won ton strips with sweet and sour dipping sauce. Won ton was stale.

I ordered the pan fried noodles and my wife ordered the hawaiian BBQ chicken. The BBQ chicken seemed like it was marinated over night and was very juicy and tender. The noodles was pretty good and had shrimp, chicken, and a bunch of veggies. 

I thought the food was good and I've tasted better that's closer to us. So we'll see if we visit again
