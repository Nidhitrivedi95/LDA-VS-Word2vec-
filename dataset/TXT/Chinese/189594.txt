yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I'm so disappointed in this place right now...use to be an afterwork stample for us.
We went early this morning after 3am and for some reason the food came out super fast...by 6am everyone was sick. We should've left as soon as the food came out..if your food comes out less than 2 minutes with over 2 guest, that's sandbagging..(the food was already done before you ordered it and sitting). A Friday wasted and line for our bathroom with a house full of sick ppl,smh.
You've definitely lost us as regulars for now.
