If you are super sensitive to MSG,  make sure ask not to add any flavor enhancements such as Ji Jing,  aka. chicken essence, which contains large amount of msg.  Dishes w/o it just taste so much fresher and you can actually taste each of the ingredients. And no more feeling extra thirsty. The kidney dish is my favorite so far.
