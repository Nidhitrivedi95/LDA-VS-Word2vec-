6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ Had dinner with my hubby here in a very busy weekend. Service was quick and servers very observant of customers needs. Love the ribs with honey glaze. We had to have seconds on that. The fish for main dish was cooked just right to perfection and presentation was good. If you want to eat in a nice seated dinning, with fresh, quality asian food, this is the place to go. The cocktails in the menu was also good. :)
