_mkObKf2FTg4pRcCFZBf4w Decided to try come back to this place for the first time in YEARS. I came on a Thursday night with a party of 5 and the place only had a few tables filled. The buffet price is a lot cheaper compared to other places, but that comes with a smaller selection. The food was okay, they had a decent selection of salad, fruits, cake, ice cream, sushi (don't try it it is not fresh at all), fried food, and Chinese main dishes. I recommend the chow mein noodles and the oysters. 

The service was actually pretty attentive, they were always clearing our dishes and refilling our water, so that is definitely something to appreciate. Would I come here again? Maybe but I'll agree with the rest of the reviewers that you do get what you paid for, which is a cheaper quality than average buffet at a cheap price.
