DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ Again, my boyfriend and I have recently relocated near this area so I'm looking for food places that are "cheat-day worthy". While the service is quick and the staff is friendly, I only gave this place 3-stars. In my opinion, it was filthy. The floors were dirty and the tables were sticky. I've visited this place 2x now, both times it wasn't as clean as I hoped it would be. It may have just been the staff working on those particular days that don't clean as often, idk. 

I would suggest ordering to-go. The food is decent. It's always hot and fresh when it finally arrives at our table. Good job chefs! 

Again, only thing you guys need to work on is cleanliness. Other than that, it's a decent place to grab a quick bite.
