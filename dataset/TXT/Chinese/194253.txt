zEd3Ex_k3vHiBbBPWRrO7Q Service was outstanding!!

 When we were here it was super busy! I must admit I was impressed with ALL of the workers, from the cooks keeping the food coming and looking amazing, to the servers preparing our to go boxes  filling our containers. 

The broccoli was so green and firm and the beef was cooked perfectly as well. We all were quite pleased with all of our different dishes. :)

This location was super clean and the food was very FRESH and packed with deliciousness!  :)

If you are looking for a good Panda Express I definitely would recommend this location! Enjoy :)
