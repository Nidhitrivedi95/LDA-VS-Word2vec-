YjlCXwWr9xx6TnHmTFCKGQ My last visit to P.F. Chang's was my best so far. This restaurant just gets better every time I visit (I initially rated it two stars). Normally this is not the type of food that I enjoy as the sauces they use don't really mesh with my taste buds, but I am pleasantly surprised more and more by the food when I go here. I have now come around to enjoy the lettuce wraps and the crab wontons are pretty awesome too! I also really liked the seabass that I ordered as my main entree on one of my more recent visits.

P.F. Chang's is making an unlikely fan out of me!
