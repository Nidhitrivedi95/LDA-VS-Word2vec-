CpJRzbebSyHwOFNsOixK1w I accidentally found this place on yelp today--it's a tiny store in a little strip with mostly business offices. The menu is small but sufficient for a simple meal. I ordered the Ja Mo and cold noodles combo and sat down in their small but clean dining area. The JaMo was hot, with crispy shell, and the meat was very flavorful. The cold noodles came with sliced beef, half an egg, and peanuts; the sauce was simple and I really liked it. 

A good place for a simple lunch or dinner. :)
