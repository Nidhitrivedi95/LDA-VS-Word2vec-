PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg When the chinese restaurant I was headed for was suddenly closed tonight, I tried this place again after a bad review several years ago.
Hubby had the egg drop soup which had corn in it.  Passable but nothing to write home about.  Had the Walnut shrimp which came with a PILE of mayonnaise "sauce" on it.  I wish they hadn't poured it on so heavy.  The shrimp were large enough, lightly floured, and delicious. I wiped the sauce off with napkins and I quickly devoured them.   The walnuts were nicely glazed with honey.    Hubby had orange chicken dish but asked that the chicken not be breaded.  They did that very nicely.  

Here's the rub:  

If you are studying to be a telephone receptionist, this is the place to practice. 
 
Constant ringing of the telephone both the landline and the cell phone.  The problem is that they allow the phones to ring and ring and ring and ring and ring.  There was a symphony of ring tones while we tried to eat.  Not a good thing.  Annoying.  

This place is better than the last time I was here, but not by much.
