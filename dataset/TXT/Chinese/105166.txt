kuvBnJc3bllm2xpuleezIw Food was poor to mediocre at best. Beef pancake was very salty and the cucumber jelly fish cold dish was extremely sour and tasteless all in the same plate! 

Services was terrible...Severely understaffed, they forgot two of our orders and left us hanging for 40 minutes despite us repeatedly trying to signal the waitress. Had to leave without having our orders fulfilled...
