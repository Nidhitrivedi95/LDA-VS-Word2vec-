HQpMwOOrGND3GaRqMNV9ig To start things off, wonton noodle has been my childhood favourites, and Jim Chai Kee really is able to deliver that familiar flavours with lightning speed.  The noodles are always on point with 4 wonderful fresh shrimp wontons and a lightly flavoured fish stock.  The tea is self serve, and the price was just wonderful at $5 plus tax.  As soon as I sat down, my order was taken.  It took less than 2 minutes for the order to arrive and the choy sum was tasty with the oyster sauce.  I am really satisifed with the quality, price and speed.  Not much more I can ask for.
