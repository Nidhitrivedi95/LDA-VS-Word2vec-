qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA I'm so impressed. I just had probably one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. Every thing was perfect. Great service.. Whole staff was energetic and friendly, food was amazing, beer was perfectly cold. The male manager absolutely knows what he's doing and deserves a raise. I work a lot and this was the first time I've had a night off...
Well spent. I will absolutely come back.
