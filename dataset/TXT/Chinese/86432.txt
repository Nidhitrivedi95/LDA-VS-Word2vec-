HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I am HERE, every YEAR.  I have been coming to this spot since I saw Sheridan on "Chopped" back in the day.  We take our yearly pilgramage on my b-day and go from the Deserts of "Palm" to the Deserts of "Vegas".  This is one of the joints we ALWAYS hit up.  Sheridan has been there every single time slaving away in the kitchen making "Ono Grinds".   Always have to have at least two pork belly bao each.  Last year I brought my boy Dean and he asked me earlier this month, "We hitting up Fat Choy this trip?"  I said, "Hellz Yeah".  Food is excellent, service is great.  I can't wait to sink my teeth into his yummy bao.  I had the Pork Belly BLT last year, I hope he has something new and delicious on the menu.  If not, I gotta try the grilled cheese this year.  Anyways, the bao is full of flavor.  It has a nice crunch, a lil bit of greens.  So yum.  My only complaint.....the smoke.  Aside from that?  This place is awesome.  I am kind of bummed that they had him on DDD recently.  It probably means he's gonna be hella busy when we visit him this Labor Day weekend.  I still can't wait!
