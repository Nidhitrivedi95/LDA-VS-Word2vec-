ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ The experience here is really Disappointing!! I came with high expectations cuz it's under one of my friends recommendation. We had our food unusually bitter and it is not like what I used to be served in here, the manager insisted that there is nothing wrong with the food when I constantly explained to her that it's not the same thing as I used to have. When we were charged they automatically charged the tips like they think they should get tips for every service they provide even if the service doesn't deserve so. 

If the food was not good I at least expect them to show politeness.
