I am Indian and am used to much spicier broths which I have tasted in New York, so a milder one was refreshing. I might go so far as to say it was too mild but who's checking. For a appetizer, my friend and I shared the pork pieces. They were very well glazed and the spring onion bits added crunchy freshness to them but there is no taking away from the fact that we were eating pure unfiltered fat. For the flavor they are amazing, but I would recommend 2 people finishing that little heartattack in a bowl. The price was really good but too bad I couldn't stay for dessert. The call from Prantl's bakery was just too loud :)
