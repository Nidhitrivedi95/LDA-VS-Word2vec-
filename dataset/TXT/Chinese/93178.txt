IZ33QKVggRtHdMdWoDPi6Q Had high expectations for this place from all the reviews but was dissapointed with the food. The service was great (the dim sum cart ladies were very nice and attentive even when we were in an inaccessible location of the restaurant) but unfortunatley the food failed to impress. The dim sum tastes like the McDonalds version of dim sum but at mid-range prices.
