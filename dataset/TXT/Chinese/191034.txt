Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g Went here on a groupon deal. The quality of food is excellent and it is absolutely delicious! The menu is excellent. It has a picture for everything! It was especially great for us because we didn't quite know what to get and didn't have to mentally envision what our food might look like through the descriptions. Ah, the great adventures in dining! I have to say the thing I didn't quite appreciate was the service. We are not Asian, and it felt like we were being treated like the red headed step children. After we placed our orders, we got our food and that was it. We didn't even have anyone come by to refill our drinks, nor ask if we needed anything else. We had to go out of our way to wave down waiters. I hate to say this but I did notice that others that were dining...who were Asian getting lots of attention. Maybe it was just our waitress that sucked. I don't know...but it was annoying. Bad service lowers the rating of this place for me. The food as I stated earlier was great quality and very tasteful. Grandma's short ribs was sooooooooooo yummy! If I can put aside my feelings of how I was treated, I might go back. But for now, i'm not too sure.
