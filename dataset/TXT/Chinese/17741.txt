4vLaHphDBWOy1aI7URQ75Q This is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants. I am not sure why there are only 3 stars here on yelp. But I order their sweet and sour pork every time I am here and it's unbeatable! It's really hard to make this dish well and this restaurant does justice to sweet and sour pork. They also have a $11.99 menu which is super good for those on a budget. This place is the neighbourhood Chinese diner for families.
