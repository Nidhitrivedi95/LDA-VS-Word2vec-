C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ I think the food is just "ok" but the one thing I hate is poor customer service. From the moment me and my family walked in it was terrible! We were a party of 2 small children (3 yrs old) and 4 adults. When the cashier was ringing us up she tried to charge me for 6 adults and I politely reminded her we had 2 kids, she scoffed and told me next time I needed to be ready and have the kids line up next to some height measuring line on the wall. We were then escorted to our table. Our waitress took our drink order, I asked for juice for the little boys and her reply was " we dont have no juice". When I asked what drinks they had the waitress said she would just bring them Orange soda. (Whatever, at this point we all just wanted to eat) Overall it was just a mediocre experience. OH I ALMOST FORGOT!!..... When the waitress brought us a refill on our drinks she brought them back in the same glasses that she put her fingers in while carrying them back to get refilled! GROSS!!! The glasses were greasy too! When we asked for new glasses she rolled her eyes and told one of the bussers to get us new drinks.. The dining area wasnt too clean so that says a lot to me about how clean their kitchen may be... I probably wont EVER go back there. SORRY BUFFET @Asia... Work on your customer service and the cleanliness of your restaurant!
