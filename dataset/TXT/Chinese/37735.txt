aqszoKRB4Ol9bpemt0_-GQ Got chicken lo mein and tangerine beef with fried rice. We enjoyed the chicken lo mein but the beef was way too heavily breaded and some big pieces had NO meat in it. The fried rice had no veggies in it and smelled like it was made from stale rice. We let the server know the situation and he offered new rice but we declined and he went to tell the chef but nothing was done by the management to fix the situation. We will be spending our hard earned money elsewhere.
