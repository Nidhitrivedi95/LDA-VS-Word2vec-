Z4CA7jEArUT_D-1ZM4Bh1Q This review is solely based on a pick-up food experience last night and it is not indicative of any positive/negative feelings regarding the ambience or dining experience inside. 

So my friend Kate was craving shrimp fried rice, it was late, and after searching Yelp we learned that Chop and Wok was the only Chinese food serving establishiment still open. We called and made an order. Picked it up. The food was greasy and oily, simply not good, and certainly not gourmet (that is laughable, actually). We ordered BBQ pork, but were given BBQ ribs, really? Overall, the experience was highly disappointing. I have no need to ever go back, late-night or otherwise. My suggestion would be to avoid a late-night Chinese food craving and go for one of the many fine late-night options in the area.
