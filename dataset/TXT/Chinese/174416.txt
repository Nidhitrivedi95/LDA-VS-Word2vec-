WdtmkT5lWzW167T3rBxKsw Cheap little hole in the wall chinese take out restaraunt with good food and good prices.  I've never gone wrong with this place.  Excellent Steamed or Fried Dumplings and General Tso's Chicken.

They've got a few small tables inside, but I've never actually eaten there.  Just takeout.
