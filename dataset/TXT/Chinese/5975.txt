mind you I love spicy food.  I always order the food extra spicy and they comply with my requests perfectly.  While i wait they offered me a free soda.  And they have always greeted me with a smile.  

Not to mention they are clean and quick!

They do charge a little bit more for their entrees than other places, but it's well worth it for the service.
