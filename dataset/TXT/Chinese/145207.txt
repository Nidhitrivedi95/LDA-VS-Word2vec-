ryCpLx4jaTkkkaGXg5jvBQ I have to say; if you don't like the food here, you really do not know Chinese food; and having LIVED in China for several months, i feel i can say that on good authority.

The place is not much to look at, and the service isn't exactly great; but its not bad service either. They focus on making GOOD food. 

The food is fairly traditional Chinese--nothing too exotic, but unlike many other restaurants in Charlotte the food is cooked in traditional Chinese Style-- not the overly Americanized stuff many other places serve.

The portions are great for the price you pay, and the entrees are always good--i particularly the Hot and Spicy Beef, as well as the Honey Chicken,the Crab Rangoon's (which actually have bits of crab, and REALLY GOOD cream cheese)  and especially  the Kung Pao chicken--cooked almost exactly like it is in China--The food is also ALWAYS piping hot too.

The Chinese are big on veggies, and all their dishes will have plenty in addition to large amounts of meat. Not sure what the other reviewer was talking about shrimp wise; i have always gotten plenty.

This being said, i have NOT tried them for delivery, only take out. And DO NOT get their Fried Rice (hence only 4 stars); it is not good--but the white rice is great.

All in all  its a good Chinese Restaurant serving, solid tasty food.

Don't let one person's bad experience ruin the opportunity for some GOOD food. You've got to be pretty superfical  as well to judge a place by its location and "spelling"? It helps to not that the owners AND Cooks here are ACTUALLY CHINESE.
