O0zyXuEw_aojAK5ILW6WJA Really good food and reasonable price. Their meatball soup is delightful and pretty much every dish I tried was on par with my expectations. The atmosphere is friendly and casual and the place is nested in a plaza filled with food. Parking can get painful during rush hour but if you don't mind a short walk there's always parking at the No Frill's at least!
