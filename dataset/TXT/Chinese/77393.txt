gFqLYzm_erOkjDwedVE7QA We had dinner at this restaurant Saturday night. The food taste good but we wait for almost 1.5 hr. I got my diet cook in a wine cup, which is fine for me....When refill the drink, it was only filed half of the cup... suggest the restaurant provide better training to its servers.
