355zerURpj4IMs2no238_A I enjoy pei wei.  It has really good food, and it is nicer than fast food, but it is below a restaurant.  I am not sure if you can use it for dates, but I do enjoy the vibe.  All kinds of people come here which is always nice for people watchers.  The scenery is always clean.  Prices are not cheap but not expensive either.  You are paying restaurant prices without the tip.  So I guess it saves you 20%.  I do think it's a good place to go if you are meeting a for a quick dinner.
