zXjA4Jms2jCAP09EO7Ghfg Great first impression. Friendly and fast, generous portions, quality ingredients...definitely off to a good start. I tried the fire puffs and orange chicken. Puffs were good, I can't believe I'm saying this because it's usually the opposite but I think they could go a bit lighter on the filling. Filling is super flavorful and very creamy but almost too sweet and I think it was because of how much there was. I took some out and it was perfect! 
I can't honestly say it's the best Orange chicken I've ever had but it was good. Chicken itself was great with large pieces  of white meat and veggies were cooked perfectly and not drowning under sauce. The chicken pieces were almost too large - I had to cut one piece into 12 bites! The sauce was ok but along the same lines as puffs, it was too sweet. It has good flavor but it is just way sweeter than I prefer. 
I will definitely be back to try other items because you can tell the quality is there with their food. Funny enough, the rice was my favorite and that's a good thing because I am really picky about rice. Rice was cooked perfectly and helped level out the sweetness of the Orange chicken. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend Wok Fire. I've been looking for a place to get shrimp with steamed veggies and rice and after my trial run tonight I am definitely comfortable going back and trying the shrimp!
