EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw The food at Dim Sum Cafe is below ok. Before I came here, I read the other reviews from this establishment on Yelp, and saw some negative reviews. So, i decided to try a new dim sum restaurant. When me and my cousin came to this restaurant around 8 p.m., I was surprised that we were the only one dining in here. We order a few dishes. I was stunned that the portion was small. Plus the tasting was below ok. Compared to the food from this restaurant and other dim sum restaurant I usually go to in Las Vegas, the other Dim Sum restaurant is better.

I would recommend going somewhere else than this restaurant. The food has no flavor and seems the food was microwaved.
