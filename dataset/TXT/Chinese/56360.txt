czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA My husband and I passed through Las Vegas this week coming back from vacation and I found this place on Yelp. This place is a gem! The customer service was excellent!!! All four girls were very nice. Greeted us, refilled our drinks, got our order right, and even put our food in to-go boxes for us. Now the food, wow! It was sooo delicious. I had the coconut shrimp and it tasted amazing! The sauce didn't overpower the shrimp and the fried rice and chow mein was tasty and delicious. My husband ordered the teriyaki chicken and that was also very tasty! All of the food was made fresh and served hot. The food is not affordable. The ladies that worked there were very quick and made sure that all of the tables were cleaned and ready for customers. I was very impressed with my experience at this restaurant and highly recommend that you try it!
