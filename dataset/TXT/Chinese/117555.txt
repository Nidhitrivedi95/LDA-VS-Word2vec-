NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ I'm not really a fan of Ten Ren's food, drinks, and service. However, their holiday special meal was quite the opposite. 

The holiday special meal features Hokkaido milk tea, a bowl of Russian borshch, a choice of steak or salmon entree with a side of vegetables and spaghetti and a cake dessert all for $24.99.

So I decided to choose the steak entree. I had really low expectations and had an odd thought of having steak at a tea room. The hokkaido milk tea was thick and had a creamy texture. I never had something like that before and I thought it was nice. The russian borshch wasn't really hot and lacked something.  The real surprise was the entree dish with steak with a side of vegetables and spaghetti.  It actually looked like the picture for once. The steak was really tender since it was advertised that they used angus beef cuts. I thought the spaghetti looked dull but it was actually pretty tasty. The vegetables were just so-so as they were cold. I find that the dessert is not that special and it came straight out from the freezer as it was solid as a rock.

Sometimes when it gets really busy, their wifi does not work and their service is sometimes really slow.

Overall, I was shocked that this holiday special was overall a pass on my books. They should really consider putting it on their menu.
