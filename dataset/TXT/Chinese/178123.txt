x_4gEfC25uiX21NyYdohgQ The food needs to be rotated out more often so it stays hot n fresh, but it is really good otherwise.  They do not use MSG and have more than enough choices that should please anyone. The take out is by the box, not weight, so that is a plus, cram that thing full...  Anyhow, the hot tea is not complimentary, which is odd, but the drink prices are low and refills are free for soda.  The music is WAY too loud most of the time and the waitress once they bring the check expect you to pay or sign your slip right away and can be a bit annoying by saying; you need to sign, you need to sign now and keep walking by, very rude!  Anyhow, if the place could get a couple of those things under control, it would be just about perfect.  The bathrooms are clean and they keep the food area clean. We will come to eat here again, but if the music is loud again, they will either need to turn it down or we will leave...
