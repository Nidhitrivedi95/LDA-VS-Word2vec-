LpdW1vh1AVm5QznEL5j03g It's a Saturday afternoon and I've just been outvoted. We're heading to Panda Express for a late lunch. I look longingly across the street at the Fry Bread House while I wait to place my order. But you know, it could be worse. This is a nice Panda Express location. It's roomy. It's well staffed. It's clean and well maintained. Television. The workers seem pleasant enough. Service is prompt. Panda Express tends to be a bit of a calorie bomb. If I'm going to indulge, I'd rather commit to caloric food I really love. Today's order? Steamed veggies, chow mien, orange chicken. All solid, but uninspired.
