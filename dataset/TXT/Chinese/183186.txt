XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw Walked in during closing time like around 10:40 but they closed at 10. The lady was very kindly to still serve us after hours. I felt bad for not knowing and stayed to eat Becuase apparently it said on Yelp they close at 12. Anyways the service is alright but the food is alright. I ordered the beef soup dumpling which everyone keeps talking about isn't all that. Also ordered the crispy beef and shrimp fried rice which was tasty but you can taste the MSG pretty heavy. I wish I can give this place more stars it's just instead of the lady just telling us we are closed instead of rushing us to order.....like okay?
