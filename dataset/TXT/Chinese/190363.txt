YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g I went with the Luckee Har Gow, Luckee Shrimp Cheung Fun, Char Siu Beef Short Ribs, and the Cantonese Fried Rice.

Taste (5/5): The dumpling skin of the har gow was very delicious and unique compared to other chinese restaurants. The cheung fun was good as it seemed like a combination of cheung fun and fried shrimp dumplings which provided an interesting soft and crunchy taste. The main attraction was the char siu beef short ribs which if I had time to I can speak about all day. They are actually boneless and these literally melt in your mouth when you take the first bite, which is a pleasant change from the usual chewy short ribs at other restaurants

Service (5/5): The waiter visited a lot to see how the meal was and was entertaining to have around. Bonus points for the additional service on my birthday

Value (4/5): For a higher end restaurant the prices are reasonable as it is about $10 for dim sum and $20 for entrees. The portion sizes are a little smaller, but there is still enough food to fill you

The restaurant is large and has a classy atmosphere. This would definitely be a good place to visit for a date night or work event.
