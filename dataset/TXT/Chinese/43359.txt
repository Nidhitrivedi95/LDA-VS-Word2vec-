bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog We came to Las Vegas and stuck here due to Hurricane Harvey. We are all tired of American food and craving for some authentic Chinese food. We accidentally arrived this place and decided to give it a try. This is a small restaurant but is very clean. The staff here are very friendly. They have cool mung bean soup in this hot summer day for free and refill instead of ice water. They also brought in Sichuan pickles as our appetizer. The pickle was authentic, not like Cantonese styled. Their Manu is short but every single dishes are tasty just as it is supposed to be. We ordered spicy sour wonton, house special rib noodle and Chengdu minced meat noodle. All tasted fabulous!  We definitely will come back. It beats any buffet on the stop after several days away from home.
