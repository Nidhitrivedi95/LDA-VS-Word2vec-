w2-A-qlxtGTgT6KgQv8RdA my first experience with Star Walk was pretty good. I enjoyed it. I ordered one of the same dishes this time and it was horrible. Was supposed to be rib tips and what I got was a mixture of dry tips and some microwaved BBQ pork. had to be one of the worst dishes ever but, it was followed by a really bad dish their egg foo young. I don't know what they did to the eggs but they're like bricks. their food quality is inconsistent at best. I believe this is my 4th time and every time worse than the last. I think this will be my last time
