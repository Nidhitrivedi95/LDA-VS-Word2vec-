In fact, walking by, you will usually see someone actually cutting and pulling noodles and a small crowd forming to observe.  Once you order, they take the fresh noodles and cook then for you.  But here's the downside: the price!  Because they are located in Caesar's Palace, this place is incredibly expensive.  On my own I probably wouldn't have eaten here, (thank you work for my meal per diem.)  The noodles were ok and the dish I ordered came with some beef (which was rubbery and bland) in some broth.  The noodles themselves ended up being kind of bland, since the overall dish didn't have much flavor.  I also ordered some pork buns which were really good.  They took a while to come out because they are steamed fresh when you order them.  I'll say though for hand pulled noodles, you can probably do better off the strip in Vegas in a hole-in-the-wall type of place.  But if you've got some extra cash and looking to try something  different, check out this place.  Their goldfish tank is way cool - but note the signs that say the fish aren't for human consumption.
