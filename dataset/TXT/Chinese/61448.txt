drIFrAyZnyismS1ArZlmAg It was nice to have a vegetarian restaurant relatively close to where I was staying!

I started off with the Assorted Platter appetizer, which came with three different kinds of mock meats served on a bed of shredded cabbage - I think it was ham (or duck?), chicken and deep fried eel. All were good and it actually creeped me out for a second thinking that it was real meat (well, at least the texture did).

For an entree, I had the New York Veggie Chicken - it was poured onto a hot plate at my table before being served, which produced a sizzle sizzle effect. It was okay - the mock chicken was good, but the dish itself was average.

I ordered the tofu cheesecake for dessert - very tasty!

I'd go back again for sure, there were so many delicious looking options on their menu...
