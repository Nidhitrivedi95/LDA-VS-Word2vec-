O_9K3WhlGlXW3KFPfTo0yA There were several things I liked about Steam Kitchen and several things that were not impressive.
Firstly, the most important thing was the food. It was authentic and tasty Cantonese food. I had the ginger chicken, which comes with two sauces, and the orange chicken. They were both tasty and rich. This is not your standard semi-Chinese restaurant.
What they specialize in is food that is steamed without allowing any steam or juices to escape. This allows for the full taste and nutrition to be sealed in.
The service was fine. Yes, it is a Chinese restaurant so high-end service is out of the question, but they were generally polite and prompt when called. Food also arrived in reasonable time.
The price is high, but the food is higher end.
There is an attempt at ambiance and decoration, which is helpful.
Where they lose points is their tables. They are really close to one another and people will move so close to you or overhear your conversation or hit you going in and out. The washroom was also not very clean and, of course (sigh), had ran out of paper towels.

If Mandarin is one end of the 'Chinese' food spectrum, Steam kitchen is the poplar opposite!
