QHZw2L6LV1qmExNJbfhIsQ Good food, prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are exactly what you'd expect from a chinese restaurant.  I came here for dim sum and was very happy with the food.  The service is ok, not the best, not the worst.  I was taking my folks out and wanted to pay so went to the cashier to pay but they had to grab the order sheet from the table.  Then I had to stand in a specific place to pay for the bill.  Literally the guy told me to take 3 steps to the left and 1 back.  And had me wait there.  It was really weird.  But besides that the food is really good.  Their bbq pork is probably the best in the city (bold words).  But its really moist, soft, and the glaze is done really really well.  its been 2 days and the leftovers still taste good.  Another thing to try is the bbq pork pinapple buns.  Something unique and becoming more popular in Canada, but so far the only place I've found in Markham.
