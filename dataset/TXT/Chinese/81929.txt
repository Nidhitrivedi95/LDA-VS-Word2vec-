H2ljOK6pDHJ-iQzHkijW0w I came here the first time. Service was good. Prompt. I just wasn't a fan of the food. I asked the waitress what's the best and most popular chicken dish. She suggested grilled chicken with spinach and cheese with rice. It came out very hot, which was great. It was an "ok" rating. One big piece was only the skin of chicken with no actual meet in there. I will probably not eat here again. Maybe it's just not my taste.
