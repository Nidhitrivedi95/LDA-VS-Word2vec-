VGwPrBPlbD24SZAT_b0JBw Prices are very reasonable. General Tao chicken is a fam fav at my house. My husband loves the chicken wings. Now with that said... It is nothing too fancy just your typical Chinese take out. They do lunch specials which are pretty cheap for the amount you get. Also you can get dinner meals for 2,3or more that are pretty reasonable also. All in all decent for the price and gets a recommend if in the area
