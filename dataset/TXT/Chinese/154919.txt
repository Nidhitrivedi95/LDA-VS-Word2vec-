tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw This little restaurant is off the beaten path and worth going to!  In my opinion, it is the best American Chinese food in the Valley.  Great friendly service and the food is fantastic.  Tthe best beef & broccoli EVER with a fantastic satiny sauce.  The regular (not spicy) chicken with vegetables and the sesame chicken are also wonderful.  We iwll be back.
