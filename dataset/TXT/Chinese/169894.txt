Vuk8Xn0RmP1o88QqfB75qg I was really happy to see this store improved a lot from its first opening. Me and my boyfriend went there yesterday around 1pm. though the store was packed the server quickly arranged us a 2ppl seat. We ordered: shrimp dumplings, egg tart with birds nest on top, piggy bun, steamed chicken claws w/black bean sauce, pineapple buns w/BBQ meat in it, and other dim sums I can't remember the name. They were All SO GOOD. Especially their famous piggy bun was so much fun. So in general, quick arrival of food, nice tasting, friendly servers, good decoration. I will come back again at their dinner time to check dinner items( I saw there was a 2ppl dinner set with three course and all with lobster in it costs only 30!) 

Tips: they have free wifi available and the dim sum now is having a promotion. Before 10:30 all s/m/l dim sum is all 3.18.
