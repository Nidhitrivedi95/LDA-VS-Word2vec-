tIby_wfzpZ5QH02IWFNogg When I entered the China Sea, I expected a mediocre Chinese fast food parlor; for the most part, this is what I got. There is a lunch "buffet" area where you can get a variety of food for $4.50 a pound, and lunch and dinner specials that are priced relatively the same as other fast food Chinese joints. The taste of the food is decent, but what really stands out is the amicable and congenial staff. Do expect a 3-5 min wait if you come during lunch hours.
