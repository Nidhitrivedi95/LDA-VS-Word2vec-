ruHEkBY2ysclSFIcai4tfg My family has been ordering House of Wong for years, since the Silver Dragon down the street closed in 1999. 
We always order the chicken balls, pork fried rice, shang-hi noodles (extra spicy and even then they are not too bad), beef & broccoli, deep fried won tons, sometimes honey garlic ribs. We recently started ordering the Honey Chili Chicken which is also good, as well as General Tao chicken. Spring rolls are also good and pretty authentic although that's just what I've been told if I'm being honest, as I don't know what 'authentic' really means. 
We have always found the food very fresh, the chicken always crispy and the food generally excellent. The only problem we have ever had is they have a tendency to forget items when delivering! It's usually the won tons unfortunately, which everyone loves for scooping up rice with. 
We never eat there, always take away or delivery. The decor is typical old fashioned Chinese restaurant decor, faded carpet, peeling paper, not the greatest but not the worst. 
Always double check your order on the phone by reading your order back or having them read it back to you. Delivery times tend to be long esp on weekends. There is %10 off if you pick up and pay in cash I believe. On holidays like New Years, Christmas Eve, Mothers Day etc call at least 2 hours ahead even if you are picking up. 
Enjoy!
