I'm writing this because I miss you. We haven't reunited since August, and it's now October. The last time we met, the Bingo Players (sadly only one bingo player now, poured some out) graced the stage. Before that, we bonded over Calvin Harris. Not to sound like a stalker, Hakkasan, but everything about you is perfect. 
Downstairs (Ling Ling Club): Equivalent to a hip-hop room. Crazy vibe, dancing on every surface, and geisha-style dancers gettin' jiggy. Great spot to hit up for free bottle service before upstairs gets wild. 
Upstairs (Main dance floor): When you enter, there's a large area to your right with a smaller bar and an area with lots of tables and seating areas, with an obstructed view of the stage. Straight ahead is the main dance floor, with large tables in a U-shape around (much like Marquee in this regard). There's another bar to your left, and tables on upper levels. I've never been up there, because I made it my personal goal to dance on the stage. Simply put, the customer service at Hakkasan is unrivaled. Anything you want at a table appears within minutes, any spilled drinks are immediately cleaned up, they even have shirts and shoes if someone spills on you. 
So, Hakkasan, what I'm saying is that you are perfect, without even perfect imperfections. Come back to me.
