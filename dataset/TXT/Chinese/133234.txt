pv0CUMRAJqOES16AayszlQ We've been here a few times now and have noticed improvements by the staff with each visit.  The food has always been great and the staff has always been friendly and patient.  The first few times we came here the food came out slow and many menu items were not available because they didn't have main ingredients.  The last time we visited the restaurant, the food came out quick.  Our favourite item here is definitely the steamed chicken!  Sounds simple, but so delicious!
