IoUtQRoXPuDcAsfp-Q7CLQ This review is only based on their dim sum items, I never actually bought a proper meal at this food court restaurant but whenever i do go to First Markham Place, I always get two items from here, their Fish Meat Siu Mai (Don't know what they call in English) and Soya Sauce Rice Noodle Roll (coeng fun).

If you do go to First Markham Place, I highly recommend picking up some dim sum snacks from this place, especially the Fish Meat Siu Mai!!  They make theirs super HUGE and they actually taste good with spicy soy sauce.  A MUST try if you decide to dine in at First Markham Place!
