CSe9FpalbwGzQcp_h5BVxg My brother and his fiance always order out here and have never actually stepped inside the joint, so when we as a group of 9 wanted to go out to eat in celebration of someone's birthday we had little idea how small it would be. However, the staff at Grace Garden, although a bit thrown off from the big group curve we threw at them, handled us... dare I say it... gracefully.

We ordered the Family Platter plus a couple of extra dishes. The Family platter says it feeds 6-7 people, but we definitely took home extras. It comes with a lot of different dishes, and I will probably miss a few.

Now, as you can see I am from NY, and I'm visiting my brother who lives in Arizona. This place says it's a NY-styled Chinese food joint. So, as your NY guide my verdict is... it passes! I'm glad my brother has a chinese place that can stand among our NY places. Some of my favorites were the kung-pao chicken, crab ragoon, orange chicken, and sweet and sour pork. The most incredible thing, for a group of 9, and ordering a few extras, the bill came out to less than $80. LESS THAN $80, for delicious food, to which there were leftovers.

I don't recommend this place for large groups, but dear Phoenix area, this is your place to go!
