aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg We recently went to Asian BBQ & Noodle and had a pleasant surprise. We tried to go there one evening and figured that they are closed on Fridays. I would give it a 5 stars despite of this is another cash only restaurant.  The staff are friendly and the food are authentic. We ordered some roast duck noodles and BBQ pork ribs. They are both delicious and reasonable-priced. Definitely will return to this place when I crave for pork belly and cha siu.
