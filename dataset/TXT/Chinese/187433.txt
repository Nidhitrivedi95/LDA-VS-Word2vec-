yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Pho Kim Long was a very good restaurant, employees are very nice. Came here around 3am and it was surprisingly packed it might have to be with being such a short drive from the Strip. But, I enjoyed my meal and I would definitely come here again with my Husband being part Vietnamise!
