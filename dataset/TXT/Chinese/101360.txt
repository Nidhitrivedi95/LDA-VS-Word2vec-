kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A Over the past month I been hearing a lot of buzz, all positive ones, through my sizable army of tasting agents in my social media network.  They kept posting pictures of bowls after bowls after bowls of noodles, with a plate or two of Mongolian Beef Pancakes (<U+8499><U+53E4><U+725B><U+8089><U+9921><U+9905>) and Fried Dumplings (<U+934B><U+8CBC>) tossed in the mix for good measure.  So I was intrigue to say the least, when some of the more active tasting agents were posting updates multiple times in the span of 3-4 days.

That good huh?

So yeah, I did the mental bookmark thing on my virtual list of notable restaurants to try. But with moving and all the related hassels associated with finding a place and arranging movers and carpet cleaners, etc. I was not in a hurry or had the time to tackle this list.

So last night after watching the Warriors came close to taking game 3 to OT, but sadly allowed the Cavs to take the game and 2-1 lead, Mike K and I decided to check this place out. It was only 1.4 miles away.

We arrived in the final 30 minutes of their business hour, so we were told we had to place our order since it is already "last call" time. After studying the menu, reviewing reviews, and performing final cursory analysis of the hundreds of Yelp photos, we both ended up with what we thought was a safe bet. 

B3 Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup (<U+5C71><U+897F><U+5200><U+524A><U+9EB5>) - Beef Brisket, Sweet Potato Vermicelli, Black Fungus, Pickled Cabbage, Green Onion, and Cilantro. 

Our orders came out quickly and Mike K confirmed that it was shaved from a ball of dough, not cut on the cutting board like some other types of handmade Chinese noodles with uniform size and thickness.  So it tasted great, just the nice chewy texture one comes to expect from a properly made Hand Cut/Knife Cut Noodles (<U+5200><U+524A><U+9EB5>). The broth was excellent, I ended up drinking as much of it as I could with that clunky black spoon that they serve your order with. The Beef Brisket could be more tender, and definitely could be braised longer, but it was not so tough you can wear out your dentures with and leave culinarily frustrated.  So I would definitely recommend it for first timers.

Service was friendly, even for a place getting ready to close for the night.  The decor is simple, the view of the clean open kitchen is nice, especially for people that sits at the counter.

Definitely planning to come back in the near future and try some other noodles from their small menu and the Mongolian Beef Pancakes.

Easy 4 stars in my book.
