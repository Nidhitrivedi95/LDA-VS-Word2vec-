anhk98859Rmo3mL6X41jbg I LOVE Panda Express. When I found out they created an app you could order food on I was over the moon. Panda Express is literally everything to me. At least it was before today. I was having a really rough day and jonesin for some of their chow mein and fried rice (it always makes me feel better). I decided to take a lunch break instead of spending my lunch cooped up at the office as planned and headed on over to the nearest PE. When I pulled up to their drive through it took the counter girl approximately five minutes to say anything to me, and when her voice finally came over the speaker it was unwelcoming. After ordering and pulling up to the window I was asked if I wanted any soy sauce or sweet and sour. I said no. I paid for my meal drove off. When I got back to the office I noticed that I was given soy sauce and sweet and sour despite my "no thank you" which is extremely wasteful. I over looked this and excitedly dove into my Panda Bowl (figuratively not literally) only to find that I didn't have any fried rice in my bowl, only chow mein. Disappointing but what can you do? The deed's been done. I continued eating only to choke on a bone from my mushroom chicken a couple minutes later which not only grossed me out but made me fear for my life for a brief moment. You've done me dirty, Panda. You've done me dirty.
