zUHz-rUIR7FSvmP7bbemsA I love Bayview Kitchen. Been going there with my family for 10+ years now for breakfast, dinner, and everything in between. Their decor recently had a facelift which was a nice addition. I come back time and time again for their friendly service, dependable quality food, and very reasonable price points.
