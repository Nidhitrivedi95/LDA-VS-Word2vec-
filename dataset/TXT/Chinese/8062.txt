Not a huge fan of Chinese food (or any Asian food - too many vegetables), but I like PF Changs. Their beef dishes are great. The meat is excellent quality and has nice sauce/spice flavor and cooked perfectly - still tender. Very nice atmosphere, good service. 

When someone wants Chineses, I take them here.
