MKviRVX2QxRgGS6juCEeYg This restaurant isn't aesthetically pleasing... It's a bit of a hole in the wall. They take cash only- but the food is inexpensive yet fabulous. I highly recommend it. 

I usually can tell that an Asian restaurant is good, if everyone in the joint is Asian but a few people. It's authentic. :) They are open really late which is a plus!
