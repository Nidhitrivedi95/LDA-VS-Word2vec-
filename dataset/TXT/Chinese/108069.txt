LG6vpg5Qx_DstY2aT8-O4Q Asian Kitchen is definitely my go-to place for quick and cheap Chinese food - especially when those late night hunger pains creep up during exam time - or after nights of drunken debauchery - (they deliver until midnight most days and 3 am Thursday-Saturday!).   

General Tso's tofu is one of my favorites and the chicken version isn't bad either.  The chicken lo mein is super greasy but good nonetheless. The "bubble tea" drinks are, at most, okay. They're more like super sweetened fruit slushies.  

The food is cheap and come in huge portions. I usually get three servings out of whatever I order. The service is okay, could probably be better, but you get your food pretty quickly.  Overall all, I like AK - it's the epitome of what American Chinese take-out is - and enjoy it most in the comforts of College Library.
