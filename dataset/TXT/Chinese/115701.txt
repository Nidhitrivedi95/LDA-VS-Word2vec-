N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ Not a bad ASIAN fusion Jamaican themed with Chinese plates and funky interior
They have done some interesting twist to Chinese food. And have done it well, I would recommend the Pineapple Bun burger as it is my favourite in the Whole Shebang menu
Chinese salad and fried chicken are both great
While the oxtail, jerky pork belly and dirty fried rice are too salty for my taste, but then again it is jerk taste
Overall a great experience we had a good time trying different food
Probably will be back again but not too soon
