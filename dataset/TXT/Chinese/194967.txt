zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I'm not big on hype.  When you start hyping stuff up - like soft ice cream - really!?? - there's a good chance that you're going to lose my vote.  This place has pretty good ramen and few other noodle dishes.  But even if the prices were the same, I'd enjoy the ramen on Bloor or Dundas more than at this swanky hotel.  Just not my scene.
