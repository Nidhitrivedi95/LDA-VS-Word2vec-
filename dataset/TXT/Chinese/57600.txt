D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA This restaurant is an embarrassment to the Paris Hotel. In the middle of Chef Ramsey's and Martorano's, really??? How did they even get in?
The food was horrible, I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs. I was served beef tongue in my beef soup. Why was it not on the menu description? The taste and smell alone was anything but pleasant.
The service was good, but seriously, the food, how can anyone on this forum say anything good about it? Relatives, friends? Surely they have to be.
I have been to several Asian places, and this is by far the worst I have ever been to, in fact, the worst food I have ever eaten in any restaurant all over the world. I hope Paris gets word of this and others that have left similar reviews. It has no business there, at all.
