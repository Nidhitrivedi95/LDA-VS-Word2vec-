DDdX9rGk5v6OVoH9VMkk4w It's really good Chinese food with really fast delivery. One of the few places that if you say that you don't want veggies with your entre, they will just give you more of the chicken/beef/pork. The fried rice is hit and miss. When it's good it's really good, and when it misses, it's still alright, just a little bit like food court fried rice.

If you want chinese food delivered, buddy up with someone and call in an order. It has to be over $25 before they will send it out, but it's the best quality delivery in the area.
