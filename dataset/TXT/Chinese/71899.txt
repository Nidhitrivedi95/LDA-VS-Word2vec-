fDpiXePaeKqbOfoxXxUKyw Bangkok 9 is now just a shadow of its former self.  It is no longer my place to go for lttuce wraps as it no longer has them on the menu.  There is quite a lot missing from the menu now.  My roommate and I walked out last night because they did not have what either of us really wanted.  We wont be back.  Perhaps the food is still good.  I would not know.  For Thai in the North West, I think I'll go to Pin kaow instead.  Its too bad.  The only saving grace fro Bangkok 9 at this time is the iced tea.  It was strong and almost bitter.  Just the way I like my iced tea to be.
