wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw Possibly Cleveland's best offering in the Chinese category, Wonton Gourmet is a must visit if you are looking for authentic chinese cuisine with a wide range of choices.  Tung Choy with Garlic is one of the most flavorful greens dishes ever and the Cumin Beef and Mao Pao Tufo are all my favorites.  Also, the Salted Bake options are unique.  Be advised many of the Shrimp dishes come WITH the shells on and while I know it is customary for many countries to eat the shells...I just can't get past it!

No, it isn't fancy dining and won't Wow you with ambience...however...the food makes me grateful this restaurant is part of our amazing food scene in Cleveland!
