pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og Food is great. Although the location is a little bit off the beaten path it makes for a nice, quiet dinner. The sushi is authentic and they have Chinese food for those not fond of sushi. The cheetah roll is by far my favorite.. Even though it is a little gimmicky with the flaming hot Cheetos in the center, it tastes amazing!
