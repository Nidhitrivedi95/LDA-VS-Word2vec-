CPcy22Hd2F7z0EKG66FMRA The food is delicious and aromatic. One of their signature dishes is the "water cooked fish". Their skewers are always perfect and very flavourful. 

The service/staff are quick and friendly. They also offer take out AND delivery, which is a huge plus, as most Chinese restaurants do not offer delivery in the GTA.

One of the best Chinese restaurants in Toronto! I don't usually give five stars, but this one's definitely worth it!
