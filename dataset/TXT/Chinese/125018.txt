I've been waiting for a long time to find a place that compares to the quality I was used to in the SF bay area and this place delivered. Its definitely a bit more upscale and there were customs I have never experienced before in a Chinese restaurant (such as: warm towels between courses, tea candle food warmers) but I liked them.

Its been a long time since I had had a decent crispy chow mein dish so when I saw it on the menu I ordered it without thinking twice. The vegetable spring rolls were very light and fresh, not the standard oil drenched rolls you usually get. Overall very tasty food. 

The place is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. I do miss the wee hole in the walls with amazing Hong Kong style chow mein but this place certainly fills the void. Yes for a bit more cash but I would prefer that over the MSG coated noodles I'd be getting elsewhere.
