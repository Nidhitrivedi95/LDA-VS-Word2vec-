KUqInLEY1y7SkyZyDoGn0Q Nice decor inside and food us ok. Service was good. Food is pricey compared to other dim sum places. We only ordered 8 items and it costs us $50 for 2 people. I have had more food and paid less at other places. No discounts or happy hour before 11am here. Tried it once to see how it's like. Don't think we will go here again. I heard food here used to be better and we rather eat at other dim sum places in Markham with happy hour/discounts before 11am.
