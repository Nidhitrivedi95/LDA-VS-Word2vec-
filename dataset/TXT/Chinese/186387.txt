yAkaDc6MWX3dy8bnEcCrRQ My best suggestion is that if you are looking for good Chinese food, this isn't the place to go.  The tip off should have been when arriving just before 7pm on a Saturday night, the throngs of blue hairs leaving from their dinner.

Waited 20 minutes for a seat (not the worse by any means), but then was promptly seated in the bar for dinner by a cold drafty window where everyone else waiting for their tables congregated.  Essentially not very nice ambiance nor were the hosts very accommodating to the request of a place elsewhere.

The meal was very disappointing to say the least.  Appetizers took 45 minutes to reach the table and when they did they were cold.  The wait staff were completely absent outside of delivering the food.  Mind you the initial waitstaff disappeared after the appetizers were served, then followed by 3 others who too were nowhere to be found when needed.  The main courses were completely bland and calling it Chinese was a very loose interpretation.  What was supposed to be a sizzling dish, sizzled for approximately one minute and then lost heat  very quickly.

In a nutshell, if you have every eaten Chinese food outside of Wisconsin and in a large metropolitan area such as Chicago, New York, etc.,  this is not the place to go. The restaurant appears to cater to those who most likely have never traveled 20 miles outside the town they grew up in and find cheese curds the ultimate appetizer.
