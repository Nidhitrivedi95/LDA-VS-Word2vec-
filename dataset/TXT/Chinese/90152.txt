IdVoDto0eqtzzH5B4bpvsA Stumbled here for lunch as we were driving down hwy7. Surprisingly it was their first day opening.
Seems like a family owned restaurant where the husband is the cook and the wife manages the front.
They didn't have their menus printed out yet so it was only the menu on their chalkboard on the wall which was in Chinese only.

Laksa noodles with chicken and shrimp ($10.95)
This was okay. The soup based lacked a bit in flavor, strong in Coconut but not really spicy. There was a lot of chicken meat bit they were just boiled and put it, not marinated with flavor.

Pork chop rice ($12.95)
The pork chop was really good! The meat was really tender and flavorful. I asked for black pepper sauce but it felt like it was just their normal "siu" sauce with black peppers. Regardless, the pork chop was tasty. Comes with two big pieces, veggies and rice, and a soup and bun as appetizer. I like how they serve Chinese buns, since most places nowadays only serve soup or garlic toast. The soup was interesting tho, it's like a chinese coconut chicken soup but I wasn't feeling strongly about the cocunt flavor in the soup. 

The food was a little slow given the fact that we were the only customers eating there. Overall the food was good, the staff seemed really confused but I'd give them the benefit of the doubt since they just opened.

Debit or cash only.
