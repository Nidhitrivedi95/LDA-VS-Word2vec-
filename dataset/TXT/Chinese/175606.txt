wJnhUJCOYkncLPZAwaMffA A little surprised at the 4 star rating this place has.  Maybe it was the time I went, maybe it was because this was following up a phenomenal brazilian bbq experience the night before (see my Chima review).  Fish was ok, but not the freshest I've had.  

My server was kind of friendly, but she never came to check on me.  I had to keep asking them for things.  Although a trendy atmosphere, the staff's overall uninterested attitude makes for an underwhelming experience.
