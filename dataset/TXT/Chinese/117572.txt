NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ Ten Ren is quite a unique experience. They carry a wide variety of hot and cold teas and tea-based beverages. The space is divided into a dining area and a premium tea shop.

Some of the items on their food menu is inspired by tea. The Tea Egg for instance is an interesting take on the hard boiled egg and makes for a decent snack. The Fried Rice with Tapioca is less palatable than one would expect.

Both the food and the teas cost substantially more than neighbouring locales. I would recommend this place only to highly discriminating tea drinkers. As a casual enthusiast, I do not like paying the premium on what tastes pretty ordinary to me.
