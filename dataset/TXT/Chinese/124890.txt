ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ I love Cantonese cuisine!! My sister told me about this place and I decided to try it out on Sunday night. We were a group of four; we arrived especially early like around 5pm to avoid the crowd. There were maybe 6 to 10 diners who occupied 3 tables when we arrived. 

Positive: 
1) Noise level was very low!
2) For us ambience is very important; therefore we were very pleased throughout the entire dinner. 
3) Use of fresh ingredients mostly and they don't reuse frying oil. 
4) Absolutely no smell of re-fried oil in the entire restaurant.
5) The crispy duck was lean; we did not have to spit out any fat. It was so tasty that we had to order a second serving.

Negative:
1) Hot and sour soup with seafood was bad! It was thick, salty and it tasted like a soup that had been sitting for a long time. 
2) Washroom was a bit smelly! Not expected in a fancy restaurant.
3) Price a little bit high. Our final bill came to $200.85 tip included. 
4) Dishes were not large. Despite that we were not big eaters, we had a total of: 1 soup, 5 dishes (we had 2 orders of yummy crispy duck) 
5) I read many complaints about the service. Although we did not have any unpleasant moments, but perhaps Maitre'D and ladies at the cashier could be more relaxed and be more welcoming to guests?
