ZuNJelvkJD4wsXNBRg6t5w The best Chinese sit down restaurant in NW Vegas. They sell lunch plates and dinner plates too. The only Chinese restaurant that does it for dinner. Quality is very good and taste clean. We prefer this restaurant over China One or Grand China. Restaurant is clean and so are their bathrooms. Would we go back for sit down or take out ABSOLUTELY ! The staff are nice and pleasant.
