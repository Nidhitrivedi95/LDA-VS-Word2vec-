The Chicken Fried Rice was mostly yellow rice with a few tiny bits of Chicken. However, I was surprised that the Hot and Sour soup was actually not bad....not good....but not bad. Also, the fried chicken wings were overlooked and dry, but the flavor was pretty good. 

Staying at the Holiday Inn, this is literally the ONLY delivery available other than Pizza.
