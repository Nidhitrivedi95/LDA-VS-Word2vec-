VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng When ever I am passing by Las Vegas with a craving for seafood this is the one stop shop. They have crab legs and oysters, pretty much the only things I eat most. There is also some decent sushi and a Mongolian grill that is delicious. The prices here I believe are fairly cheap compared to most places in Vegas that offer these foods. Ive never seen any of the food go empty and fresh food is always constant.
