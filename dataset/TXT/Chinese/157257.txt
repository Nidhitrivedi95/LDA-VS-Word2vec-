TU95jEn8aGitY8hZowXaBg I was craving congee this evening so I stumbled in expecting a Congee Queen knockoff of some sort but instead I was met with dumplings and noodles! I was just about to turn around and dashed out but realized that the parking situation makes it almost impossible to dash (it's a little tight). And after just enduring a 6+ hour drive I wasn't exactly looking forward to stepping back into the car any time soon. Needless to say, I settled.

The menu is interesting with lots and lots of items that will definitely appeal to you if you're Chinese. Anything from appetizers, dumplings, pancakes, noodles and even desserts all look (in pictures) and sound ridiculously good. The prices are so low that they are a bargain when compared to McDs!

We had dumplings, pan fried onion pancakes and 2 bowls of noodles. The dumplings were some of the best ones I've tasted in the city. The filling is very flavourful and juicy and the wrapper tasted fresh and delicately thin. Albeit I wish there was a harder sear on the wrapper as it didn't crisp up like the way I like it. Noodles were perfectly done  with a full flavoured broth. Noodles have that delicate yet distinctive chew that only hand pulled noodles have. The best was for last and it's the pancake. Fantastic sear with a deliciously eggy filling with strong hints of onions and garlic from the chives. When it was all said and done, we left with a check well under $30 with taxes and tips.

This was a surprise discovery and despite the deceptive name I would recommend this place. I know some folks have mentioned about the wait times but we didn't encounter it during our visit but keep in mind we visited around 10pm.
