len7Tn8eoi1KhUXbvbzQDw Apparently it used to be a bubbletea place and thank god it's not one any more... Really love the steamed buns because they taste soooo good! Those who are looking for xiaolongbao kind of steam bun, go to other restaurants, this restaurant serves amazing flour-made buns instead of soup-filled buns so stop complaining that their buns are not authentic. I find the other dishes (salad, side dish, drinks) so-so, but I would come back again and again for the steamed buns.
