z9lOfnUorcbWR_xS0DSeHw I went here for lunch with a couple of friends.  First of all, I must agree with Lan that the space is MUCH more appealing than you would guess from outside, and the restrooms deserve a special note of their own--single occupant and I'm not kidding, they are beautifully decorated.  The overall ambiance was very nice.

For the meal, we shared the steamed dumplings and my friends had Sichuan dishes with pork and tofu, respectively, while I had the Thai basil noodles with chicken.  Madison is sadly lacking in Chinese food, but I would say we finally have a decent place in town for at least some traditional specialties.  The Sichuan menu items are appropriately spicy and my friends liked them a lot.  My Thai basil noodles with chicken were DELICIOUS.  My only complaint is that the sauce was a bit overly greasy, which one friend said was also an issue with his spicy garlic sauce, but it wasn't overwhelmingly so and we agreed that in both dishes, the flavor was still very good.

The steamed dumplings were serviceable although not particularly rave-worthy.  (Then again, their competition at the meal was fierce.)  The entree portions were large; I tend to pig out, but many people probably could have made two meals of them.

We also had hot tea, which was promptly refilled by our waitress as we ate (admittedly it wasn't very busy at 11:45 or so when we were there).  I really like green tea, and the flavor of Fugu's house tea is lovely--a bit bolder than Takara's, I would say, which I also like, but not too strong to enjoy with a meal.

I gave them $$ for price because many of the entrees are in the $10-15 range, but they have a lunch menu with a range of $8-10 specials.  Not at all expensive for the quantity and quality of the food, in my opinion.  You should note, however, that there is a $15 minimum for credit cards.
