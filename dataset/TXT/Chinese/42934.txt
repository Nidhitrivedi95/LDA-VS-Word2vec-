beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw This is our second time here and we love it! Great food, great service from a sweet and patient waitress that explained everything to us. Thank you Queeny! You choose the base broth you like and then it's endless food choices to cook in your broth. We tried all the broths so far and they are all good. The freshness of their produce is ridiculous, the meat oh so tender! Will come back again and again!
