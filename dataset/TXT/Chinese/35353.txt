ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ Came here for CNY dinner with my parents. We made a reso for 3 a week before and were seated within 5 mins of arriving. It was PACKED and a lot of people had to park on the side streets due to lack of parking.

The food was just as good as the last time I came here (when it first opened). Highlights are always the Peking duck, the chicken/mushroom soup, the hand sliced noodles, black sesame ice cream, fresh sushi/sashimi and the sheer variety of food they have. They've replaced the hand sliced noodles with a robot! 

The price has gone up since they opened (of course). It's now $34.99 per person on Sat for dinner. I think that's still quite a good price for all the food you get there. The part that annoys me is if you order a pot of tea, it's $2.50 per person, which I think is a bit ridiculous. 

I would definitely come back!
