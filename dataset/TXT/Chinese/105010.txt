Ksz-HV_hafeeEQe9Zaos_Q perfectly cooked, elegantly plated, excellent flavor.  my onion beef was very tasty.  I would expect to pay much more than the 7 something for this plate.  

we walked in to order takeout, but the hostess was so nice and the restaurant was very clean and beautifully decorated that we decided to stay and eat in.  glad we did!

started with the potstickers.  they were very delicate and tasty.  plus they have Kochi and pho!   next time we are in vegas we will be coming back. 

the location is right on the corner of the building and is much larger on the inside than it appears.  very happy.
