SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ My boyfriend and some friends have made this place our Sunday dinner every week. We used to go to a couple of different places but this has definitely been the best. Every day is 50% off of all sushi rolls. Each roll that we try has been amazing. I have never had a bad experience here and I have been here more than a handful of times. Customer service has always been wonderful and the food is amazing. I would recommend the orange chicken. The portion is huge and it tastes amazing. 
I was sad to see that it was closed last Sunday due to some work that may have been done one the place. But I always look forward to Sundays!!
