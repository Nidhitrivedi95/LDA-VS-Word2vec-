AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw all i ordered was the royal early grey milk tea. so i don't know why it took 20+ minutes to come out. and when i finally got it, it wasn't all too impressive either. the grass jelly and pudding was a bit thicker/harder than i preferred and i honestly could not taste the difference between the two when i drank it. tapioca was also not soft and squishy all the way through. the earl grey milk tea itself was pretty good. might try again. i enjoyed taking raunchy pictures with the statues outside.
