rv9T1qGHbh9eXqFpKEPy_A Best Chinese food in Az! It's not too greasy, too salty, and has the perfect amount of flavor.. AND I don't feel like sh*t after. My favorite dish is the pad thai and kung pao chicken. Their broccoli beef is another one of my favorites. The portion sizes here are perfect and it's moderately priced.. Worth EVERY penny. It's nice because you can order it to go or eat there. The service is great and the servers are very friendly. I highly recommend trying Sesame Inn!
