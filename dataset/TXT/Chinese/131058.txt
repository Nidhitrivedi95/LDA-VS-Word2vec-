pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA At about midnight, we rallied to head back out into the Vegas night. The boys lured us with promise of 20-pc McNuggets (yeah.... we're that type of girls :P).... luckily, we ended up at Sushi Samba instead. The restaurant calls itself a fusion of Japanese-Brazilian-Peruvian. It definitely is fusion - but done very well. They recommend to order dishes to share and our waitress was really nice in making sure the servings matched the number of people in our group. 

What stands out in memory? The salt and pepper squid. Berkshire Pork Belly ramen (the bf had to be reminded to play nice and share ;) Crispy taquitos!!!!! Chilean sea bass (how did they get that on a skewer and yet still tastes so tender?!). BoBo Brazil samba roll. 

The only reason I'm giving a 3 star review instead of 4 is that the servings are rather small for the price. We did all leave super full though. And I rather wish someone had ordered the ceviche - I bet it's delicious!
