xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I know most people don't get what the fuss is about.  But this place just continues to be one of my favorite places to eat. I know it's not special.  But the crab rangoon is amazing, the egg rolls are delicious.  The Udon and the Pho soups are great.  The eggplant tofu delight is tasty with a wonderful sauce.  I fell in love with both Bubble Tea and Tom Kha soup at Lulu's.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I know it's not a 5 star restaurant, but it gets 5 stars in my heart.  Lulu's has never let me down, and as long as I live in Pittsburgh, I will always keep going back.
