V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA Nothing but noodles is DELICIOUS. It definitely stands out in the Stonecrest area, and the food is very tasty. There are many noodle options and also non-noodle options. Service is quick. Maneuvering around and figuring out what you're supposed to do is easy if it's your first time. 

The only thing that keeps me from going is the nutrition facts for some of their entrees. You can find them here at this website: http://www.nothingbutnoodles.com/myfiles/pdf/nutritional_information.pdf
