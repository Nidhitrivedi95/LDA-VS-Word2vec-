sDQDMrb5xez4aASZ8U5qTg The food here isn't bad, but after receiving possibly the worst customer service of my life, I decided to stop going. There's a lady with dyed orange hair that works behind the counter that has the worst attitude ever. I ordered fried noodles for me and my friend, and after they made it I realized my friend had an allergy to sesame seeds. So I decided to order another one and told them I didn't want sesame seeds in this one. It's not like I'm trying to scam them for an additional dish, I literally said I would pay for the extra one. This orange-haired lady starts MUMBLING behind the counter saying that we should have known well ahead of time giving dirty looks and heavy sighs. First of all, if you're going to complain, do it when the customer's gone (at least that wouldn't be as disgusting as doing it to their face). Second of all, you work in the food service lady, drop that attitude. I really do appreciate the food items this place has to offer, but the owner or whoever seriously needs to reconsider hiring proper staff.
