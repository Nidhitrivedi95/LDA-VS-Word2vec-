RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg Got in and was seated right away.  Waitress got our drinks then nobody came back to take our order until we flagged another waiter - about 15 mins.  Food is very good but the service is terrible.  We had to flag the staff to get their attention.  Only once did someone stopped by and here on us.  They also gave us the bill without asking if we need anything else.  We had to remind them on the kids dessert and the waiter looked surprised like he didn't know it came with it.
