YxRu2ISrpSs7p4lxgWuu7w We dropped by during Taste of the Danforth and saw their advertisement for the "Best calamari on the Danforth". Although I'm not a huge fan of calamari (and seafood in general) my friend wanted to try it, so I tagged along.

The calamari itself was hot and the portion size was decent. The dipping sauce was interesting and had a vinegary taste to it which was different but very tasty in its own way. There wasn't a lot of breading on the calamari which I found nice.

Taste of the Silk Road is actually a Chinese restaurant which is interesting considering it's in the middle of Greek town. Having said that, their menu items looked interesting so we will be back again to try their other dishes.
