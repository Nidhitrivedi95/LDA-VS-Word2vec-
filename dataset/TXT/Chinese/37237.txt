An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg This is the kind of place I enjoy coming to when its cold or chilly outside on a winter or fall day.  The tomato and pumpkin soup base is my favourite.  And I like how I can get udon (my favourite also) as a choice of noodle with no extra cost, which most places charge extra for. I personally don't like to come here during the summer time because it gets too hot inside the restaurant, or maybe it's just because they should turn down their thermostat.  When I'm craving for some comfort food, this would be one of my goto places.
