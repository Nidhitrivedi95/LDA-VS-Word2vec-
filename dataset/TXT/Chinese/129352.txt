pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA 4 stars for the dessert and tempura green beans.

Everything else was meh.

Ordered the samba strip roll which came with a little lobster tail and had mango in it.  It was average.  The peanut curry sauce I wasn't a fan of as it tasted like ginger and I was not feelin it.

But the star was the dessert...banana honey crispy taquitos.  They have a caramel sauce on top and chocolate on the bottom. AMAZING

and the green bean tempura is served with black truffle aoili.  I yelled so loud the table next to me ordered it.  It was a very "When Harry Met Sally" moment "I'll have what she's having"
