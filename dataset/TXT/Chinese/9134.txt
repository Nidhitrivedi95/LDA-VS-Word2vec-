1PMwRG0uWGxk2hIVEQj62A One of the better dim sum places out there for sure. Is it slightly more pricy? Sure but not ridiculously so. The quality of their food and service also matches up to the costs which is totally ok with me. I like going here because although they do dim sum classics really well but they also make an effort to present new menu items that aren't typical and continue to reinvent their dim sum offerings on a routine basis. Here are some of my favourite dishes:
-cha siu bao (bbq pork bun)
-steamed beef honey comb w/ turnip- love the sauce here!
-steamed rice noodle with mushroom (light but generous with fillings)
-something with seaweed and purple rice- one of the more unique items
-japanese style mango rolls
-seafood pie with avocado

Of course these recommendations are to my test but I definitely recommend those who have been going to the same dim sum places over and over to give this place a go!
