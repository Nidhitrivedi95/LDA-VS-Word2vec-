64ZPMllrqdrVNXMEQIvXhw I've been coming here since the late 90's early 2000! Amazing lunch special, fast, and great food. I LOVE their Hunan Chicken, I still crave even though there are million restaurants here in NYC!  

The first place I goto in CLT for food is Cherry Blossom, THATS how awesome they are!
