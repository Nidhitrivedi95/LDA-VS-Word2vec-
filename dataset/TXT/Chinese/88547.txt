I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Ever since I've tried Snoh for the first time, I crave their mango slush with honey boba quite often. :) Normally, and quite regularly, I go to the downtown location, however tried the camelback location today. Parking at this location is quite a nightmare, as it's right next to a very busy Oreganos and is located on a very busy road, however, the craziness is definitely worth battling for the deliciousness of Snoh! Because I love the mango slush with honey boba so much, I'm yet to try anything else on the menu, however, the menu is extensive and seems to cover just about any sweet craving!
