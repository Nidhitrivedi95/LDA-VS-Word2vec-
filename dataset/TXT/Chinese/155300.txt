TjuSHnbPtB83R-1FzdBBgA Came here today 

.. Worst tasting dragon roll ...still has skin attached to the shrimp that was hard to digest ... And definetly didn't taste like sushi to me.. 

And some cheap cucumber roll... I mean I'm paying like $14 for some cheap cucumbers.. Ahem that's lunch special .. Much rather not.. Because I can get so much better for $9 in Markham ...

I didn't expect much from a chinese japanese restaurant but this was beyond .... What I thought it would be. 

Probably won't be back ever. Although the decor wasn't too bad..  And service was up to par but... Still food was ugh.. Cause the salmon absolutely did not taste fresh............  .
