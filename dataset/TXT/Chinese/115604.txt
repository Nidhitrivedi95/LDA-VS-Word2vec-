N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ We went here with a few friends after a marlie's game one night. Since we are big eaters and there was four of us, we decided it was in our best interest to order the whole shebang. Everything was amazing, I have no bad words to say about any of the dishes. The pineapple burger and jerk chicken I think were my favourites. We even decided to order all three desserts they had that evening, again, amazing. We all ordered drinks, mine in particular was rum punch, which was awesome. The pricing is a wee bit high but I don't mind paying a little extra for delicious food. Our server was very informative and answered all the questions we had about the menu. She was attentive all night. The owner even came out to clear our plates and talk to us about how our food was, this is what really won me over. We will be back!!
