tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg Ordered food at 7:00PM. Called at 8:00PM and they said they were backed up and it would be two hours from time of order. Ok, fine I can understand that. At 8:40PM I got a text from GrubHub that my order had been cancelled. When I called, the person I spoke with was unapologetic and couldn't explain why my order had been cancelled an hour and forty minutes after it had been placed and after I had previously called. Very frustrating. Will not ever go back.
