GhWMl0J2gOOH61BhBMTAAA I find it laughable what one of the reviewers below said. $8.99 is nothing in comparison to the prices at Stir Crazy in Illinois and other similar concepts, but I guess ignorance is bliss. Not to mention piling up a bowl like that with the raw meat on top cheats the restaurant as it is technically another meal. But I digress.

Genghis Grill is a casual Mongolian stir fry joint, similar to Pei Wei or the hibachi station at an Asian buffet. There are a good variety of meats and veggies to choose from. I understand why the sauces have to be attended; I wouldn't put it past a stupid customer to dip a finger in a sauce otherwise. Not to mention if you put too much sauce, the amount of sugar in certain sauces can burn and screw up the meal.

I pieced together a meal of udon noodles with chicken, veggies, and honey soy sauce. I enjoyed it and can't complain--a regular size bowl left me stuffed.

The waitress was nice and prompt with our requests, although another one came by later and kept saying "K" after the two things we asked for. 

Overall, I like the place since you can control the amounts of which ingredients go into your meal. Despite it being Friday evening, there wasn't a terribly long wait and our food came back cooked quickly.
