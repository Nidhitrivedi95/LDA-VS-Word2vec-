1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Big Wong is a total 5 star establishment for me.  Is it the best ever restaurant I've visited?  No, not at all.  But look, if you want something hearty, yummy, and cheap, it's like... as good as it gets (assuming you want Chinese food lol).  We arrived to Vegas during our recent trip pretty late (a story in itself) and missed our reservation in another restaurant.  After a quick browsing in Yelp, we decided to give Big Wong a try.  Because it was pretty late for dinner, the restaurant was pretty quiet.  There were maybe 2-3 tables.  We ordered several dishes to try, including salt and pepper shrimp, hah-nan chicken, curry dish, wonton soup, and probably something else that I forgot.  Everything was really delicious.  

Mind you, it's not a fine dining kinda establishment.  So there is no 'excellent service', 'artistic plating', white table cloth to speak of.  But you get a great, down to earth, delicious meal for a fraction of what you would otherwise need to pay for, it's pretty kick butt.  I'd definitely go back again the next time I go to Vegas.
