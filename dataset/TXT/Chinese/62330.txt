DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA Authentic Chinese/Canton Style BBQ restaurant.I have been living in Las Vegas for 9 years and I most of the time come to Sam Woo when I have craving for roasted duck or pork.There Hainanese Chicken is also very yummy.I would recommend a teamed flounder(fish)if you come here.Even though it is on an expensive side but it is worried to try this steam fish dish .The flounder is so fresh and tasty.

Service here is not excellent but it is not bad at all.The waiters are very fast. I have to say I am a fan of Sam Woo.Don't let the two-star ratings on Yelps stop you from trying.Try it yourself and you will be the judge.
