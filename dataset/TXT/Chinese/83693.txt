HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ We stopped by on a Friday night around 7pm for dinner. Parking spaces were tight and very limited (but I guess that's the norm for this area of Charlotte). Once inside, it took a few minutes before someone acknowledged our presence and then instructed us to seat ourselves at any available table. The worst part of our dining experience at Ginbu was our waitress. Her name escapes me now, but she was a short, chubby Asian girl with glasses. She plopped the menus down on the table and scurried away without asking if we cared for something to drink while looking over the menu.  After about 5 minutes or so, the waitress returned to get our orders. We ordered the Crunchy Roll and two other maki rolls, all of which were decent, but not memorable. Another person in our group ordered the General Tso chicken. The portion was plentiful, but the chicken itself was overly sweet. Our waitress was MIA for most of the meal. We had to flag down other staff members to refill our drinks. Not once during our dinner did she smile at us or displayed any warmth. Service with a smile is definitely not something they practice at Ginbu 401. 

The whole experience with Ginbu 401 (parking, awkwardly seating ourselves, the poor lighting, and the unwelcoming waitstaff) was very unpleasant. I am unimpressed with this restaurant and doubt I would return in the future. My recommendation to Ginbu is to hire better wait staffs and train them on the importance of being friendly and courteous to customers.
