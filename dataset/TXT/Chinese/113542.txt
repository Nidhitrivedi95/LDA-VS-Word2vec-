MpT8KheTjs7TSDWIoMUFxg I started getting take out from here because I recently moved, and it is by my house.  I have to say that this is one of the best fast food Chinese places in the area.  So far Everything has come out great.   I have had the mapo tofu, the sesame beef, and the chicken wings.  The portions are fantastic for the price.  Everything was nice and hot.  The Tofu was super silky and soft, and both the chicken and beef was very crispy and tasty.  The flavors were on point for a crispy, sweet greasy salty dinner.  I really liked everything.  The biggest issue was the amount of oil in the mapo tofu, but other then that this place is fantastic.
