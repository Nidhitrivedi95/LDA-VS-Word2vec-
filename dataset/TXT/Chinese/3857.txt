_ONkRPvpIYdCuj9u6cIPeA On a nostalgic trip, I thought that I should come here for dim sum one more time before it goes for good. Located inside the soon to be demolished Market Village, this restaurant is now the sole surviving dimsum place since its competitor Ginger & Onion has closed shop.

Arriving 10 am on a weekday, I found the place to be almost full. Contrary to accounts of unfriendly servers, I found their service the same as you would find in other traditional dim sum places in the GTA.  You have the choice to order off a paper order form or wait for carts to come around.  As I wasn't sure how frequently the carts come around, I ordered off the paper form.  About 25% of the dishes arrived lukewarm.  I think it was because they took it off a cart without reheating it first, even if that cart had been out doing rounds already for a while.  The other 75% of dishes which arrived hot were good.  Portion sizes were ok.  Prices are good -  $2.50 per dish, from opening till 11 am.  As a bonus, tea is free!
