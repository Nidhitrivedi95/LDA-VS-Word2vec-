uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw Food was fairly decent, especially at it's price point compared to what you'd get anywhere downtown.  However the service is errrr militaristic.

We were in a bit of a rush, needed to basically dine and dash (while paying of course).

This place gets stupid busy at around 6.  We came in at 5, with no one really coming by other than dropping off a canteen of water and menus. 

We spent a bit about 5 minutes going over the menu, and by the time we were ready to order, then entire staff went on break and started having dinner.  The kitchen staff was on one side, and servers on the other.  The whole place just came to a halt.

When we tried to explain to someone we were in a bit of a rush, her eyes glazed over and responded to us in Mandarin.  Uhh, none of us speaks Mandarin.  She went back and sat down to her dinner.

5:20 rolls around.  And finally forced someone to take our order.  Luckily the food came quick. And we were out of there by 5:50 (we needed to be out of there by 5:45).  We woofed down our food like probably the two guys who escaped the NY prison would if they had the chance.

So... meh.
