IAqyeVG1ZMrv7hiV3FAB6Q I took my niece here on a Monday night, so it could have just been because it was so slow, but the food was mostly terrible. The Orange chicken was pretty good, honey chicken also acceptable, but all seafood options tasted horribly bad. Even the peel and eat shrimp (how do you mess that up??) Tasted like it had been thawed, refrozen and thawed again. Desserts were also bad, I was excited to see coconut macaroons, but they were soggy and bad. Only thing keeping this place from 1 star was the friendly service, and a handicap being a slow weeknight. Probably will not be back.
