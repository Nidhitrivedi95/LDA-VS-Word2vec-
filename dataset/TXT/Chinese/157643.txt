tw8I1hZdlGpwO2QaAIeQWg Goodbye Kumo ... Hello Fuji!!!

We were very impressed with this restaurant. The food were cooked fresh and that we had a lot of options. We were so full we didn't even get further out to the hibachi portion. 

We definitely recommend this restaurant. 

We will go here first before we step foot in Kumo again.
