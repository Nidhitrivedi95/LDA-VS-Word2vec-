7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew While I'm not (yet) an experienced connoisseur of dim sum (I'm working on it!), China King consistently has the best dim sum out of anywhere I've been (about five different places, both here and Seattle).  

As others have said, it's usually crowded on the weekends - we find that going on Saturday morning (about 11am) is pretty decent.  Not more than a ten minute wait, and there is a good selection of food circulating.  The sticky rice in lotus leaf, the beef in rice sheets, the shu mai, both the steamed and baked bbq pork buns, the Chinese broccoli, the custard buns... everything has been utterly fantastic, each time I've gone (I'd say we've probably been there 5-10 times).  Value for the price can't be beat.  

Eventually, we'll try them for something other than dim sum (take out ftw!  Just wish they delivered...), but this place ranks up there as one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to.  And having tried Asian food in nearly every town I've visited... it's not a small list. ;)
