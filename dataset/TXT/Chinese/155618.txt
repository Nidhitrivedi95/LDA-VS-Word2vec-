Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w this place is as authentic as it comes!
my family is chinese and wherever they go on vacation, they look for chinese food to eat. like why even go on vacation? just move to chinatown nyc or something geez.
so my parents came to visit and i took them here and they loved it.
i knew they'd like it but man they loved it.
we got fried noodles with bean sprouts, mapo tofu, braised tofu with snow peas, and bak choy. all delicious, light without being bland.
i live here so i eat in or get take out here every week. the braised tofu is my regular. it's pretty perfect as far as tofu goes. fried outside and silky on the inside with plenty of delicious sauce.
i stopped by for take out on christmas night, of course because it was one of two restaurants in the whole city that was open, the other one being boo long across the street, which is also delicious. it was packed! who knows, maybe it was all the jews, or the christians who didn't want honey baked ham, or just like me and my friends, dgaf about christmas.
go here. eat well.
