pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I am not a big fan of fusion. I would rather eat the real deal. I lived in Japan for years and so was a little skeptical of this Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian fusion restaurant. But the food here was great. Our waiter was friendly and the decor was interesting. But back to the food. Green Bean Tempora, Kobe Robata Yaki were delicious. The Brazilian and Peruvian beers were tasty.
