_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg Decent food but a bit on the pricey side.  The average adult meal (with a beverage other than water) is about $12. Some of the food felt lukewarm, as if it had been sitting out for a while. Also, there weren't many choices for those of us who prefer more chicken and beef and less seafood. More of a balance would have been fine. The restaurant itself wasn't too bad, but as others have pointed out, it did have sort of a humid feel inside.
