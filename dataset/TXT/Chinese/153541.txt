taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg Service here is terrible. We came here around 1pm and there's really not a ton of people. We were seated right away but no one took our order until 20 mins later.  We literally had to flag someone down. 

When we were ordering, we kept repeating we wanted the "pork and corn" and the waiter kept asking us "what number" and we said "pork and corn, uh 26?" And it turns out 26 was "pork and leek" and 26A is "pork and corn". So after repeating it two - three times, we still got the wrong order just because the wrong number was given which is super frustrating. No other numbers on here had an A or a B so I can see why my husband missed it. 

Furthermore, taste wise and texture, it's nothing compared to Mai Xiang in Chinatown and Sammy's soup dumpling. So skip this place if you're looking for a good dumpling house with decent customer service in Montreal. Disappointing.
