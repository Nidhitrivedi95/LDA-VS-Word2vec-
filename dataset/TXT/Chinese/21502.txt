Growing up near Alhambra, Monterey Park, and Chinatown, I have had my fair share of Cantonese food and Dim Sum.  In my opinion the flavors of Red 8 are a lot lighter than ones from here in SGV area.  All the dishes I had were good but light, and my theory is that the lighter flavors are meant to cater to those who don't eat Dim Sum on almost a weekly basis.  I must say, however, that the texture of the foods were very good.  

We ordered five dim sum dishes, abalone fried rice, and Peking duck.  It was definitely a nice change to experience the lighter flavors, but the price was a little high.  Well, maybe I have just been spoiled from the dollar dim sum dishes here in SGV.  And it is Vegas, so everything is overpriced.

If you are looking to eat something light, I would recommend Red 8.
