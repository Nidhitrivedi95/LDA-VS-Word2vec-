fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg We came to this restaurant after shopping at the mall. It had a nice setting inside, clean and chic tables/chairs. Not like most Chinese restaurant we've seen. Beef Noodle Soup ($13) was O.K., but beef was "dry" & "over-cooked". Shrimp Fried Rice ($13), well presented, but had too much cabbage. It has a big room to improve.
