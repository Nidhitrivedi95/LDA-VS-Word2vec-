CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw How have I never been here? MY NEW GO-TO! A Chinese American (get it? chi-am?!) spot with organic & vegetarian options... AND no msg! Everything was so fresh & made to order; might have costed a tad more than typical dim sum places, but YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! Quality over quantity, clearly. After eating Asian foods -- my skin feels oily, my stomach is in on/off knots & I feel sluggish. Not at ALL after this place! And I definitely indulged out of excitement! 

FOR HER: I ordered the TIGER WALNUT SHRIMP, which had surprisingly large battered shrimp in a creamy mayo sauce topped with candied walnuts. Paired with WHITE RICE & LONG LIFE NOODLES. I also tried the JUMBO SHRIMP SIU MAI (fave!), JUMBO SHRIMP DUMPLING, and SHRIMP & PARSLEY DUMPLINGS. All served hot and fresh, so delicious... ordered 3 of each! 

FOR HIM: He ordered the BEEF & BROCCOLI with WHITE RICE. As a Chinese food fanatic, he was very impressed! Very flavorful, fresh steamed broccoli (I don't even like broccoli and I liked it!),  and extremely satisfying! He also was impressed with the dim sum as he could not get over how it was not coated in oil like we're used to at other places! 

They also have some very cool promotions going on while we were there. They had good priced catering options with free delivery, a Spring Value Box special (entree & side for only $4.88!) and the cutest Chinese dress accessory for wine bottles given with any $20.00 purchase! Oh, and check in on YELP & you get 20% off your next visit! 

Also have to add this is probably one of the cleanest places I've ever eaten at. Even the bathrooms! The decor is very cute & modern as well (especially the ceiling!)... and the customer service was amazing from start to finish. Devonne & Chung the cook were so nice! I feel like I can go on and on about this place honestly! My only qualm was that I got too full to try more of their dim sum selection -- which I will definitely be back to try! :)
