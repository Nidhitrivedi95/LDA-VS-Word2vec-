This happened to us as a couple of times already. We've asked them a couple of times and they said we we're next after an hour. Another 45 minutes have passed said we we're next. 5 groups were seated ahead of us as they indicated they made reservations. It is sad to say we walked out because we were felt neglected as others are being seated. From a customer service standpoint, this is unacceptable. Other than that, their food is good but their seating system needs adjustments.
