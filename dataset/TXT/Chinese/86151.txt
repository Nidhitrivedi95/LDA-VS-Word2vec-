HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I never would have expected to find such good food in a small off the Strip casino. Their wonton Soup was so tasty, some of the best I've had. And the Duck Rice delicious, meat so tender. Also, the pork belly and duck bao was tasty. It is nothing fancy, friendly and reasonably priced. Just go!
