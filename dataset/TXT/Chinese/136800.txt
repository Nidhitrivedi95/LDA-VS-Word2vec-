qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A Anyone who criticizes this place for not being healthy or REAL Chinese food...DUH (thank you Captain Obvious!) That's like downgrading Coldstone for not being homemade or healthy ice cream!  To each their own I guess but I've never come here to feel like I was in China or eating clean, healthy food.

Now, to the service...I have NEVER had a bad experience here with service.  The staff is extremely friendly and nice.  They ate attentive (never have my ice tea empty, etc). 

This place is great!  The food is awesome! The decor is nice!  The staff is friendly and attentive.  

I come here three to four times and a month and will continue to do so!
