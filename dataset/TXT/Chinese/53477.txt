cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg Decent Chinese food, for Phoenix.  The hot and sour soup was actually very good, but didn't have a lot of extras.  The pork fried noodles were flavorful.  The spicy fish fillet in spicy oil was very underwhelming.  I asked for it to be very spicy and I didn't even think about breaking a sweat.  The broth was also rather bland. 

My three year old daughter loved the noodles, hence the 3 stars.
