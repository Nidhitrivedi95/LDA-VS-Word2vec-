BwbPzuEuIN_oFmNRJIgHlg All in all, I really liked this place. I had no expectations coming in, didn't know that it was a popular  restaurant from taiwan. Once you get past the gimmick of the shake shake salad and rainbow sauce pork belly, there's actually a broad spectrum of  taiwanese cuisines and  reasonably priced dishes to choose from, to share family style or to even order if you are dining alone. I came here with my husband and his colleague, we tried the tasting menu and it has four appetizers,  two drinks, one main ,one side dish, two desserts which I think is pretty good for 60 bucks.  The menu was clear and beautifully photographed and the food we got mostly looked liked the photos in the menu.  My favorite was the signature beef noodle soup cause I'm a meat lover. It has two kinds of beef in it, grilled and slow braised.  I thought the price of this was quite reasonable for the size it s hard to capture how huge this bowl was in the photo i d say you'd have to hold it with two hands
