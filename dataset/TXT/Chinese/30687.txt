9g4jaW7IzcuwXg86eJbynw I have no idea why I haven't seen this place before, but I'm pretty glad I did! Another handmade noodle and dumpling joint in Montreal! It was about 7:45pm when I go there it was still quite busy, so I decided to take my order to go. I will have to come back for a dine-in experience.

I got a spicy handmade noodle soup and the soup was tasty, noodles were good, but I suspect they would have been much better had I eaten them straight away and the spicy was not a kick-in-the-face spicy but something that warmed the soul. The prices are super and portions were big, I split my meal in two! Oh and service! I asked how long it might take and he said less than a minute, and I'd say that I got everything in 2 minutes (1 minute and 25 seconds to pack it and take my money!) Looking forward to my second visit!
