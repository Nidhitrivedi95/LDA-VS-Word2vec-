H2ljOK6pDHJ-iQzHkijW0w Spacious lunch spot (was Pho On 7). Pretty full on a Saturday afternoon. They have lunch specials starting at $7.95 and nothing over $10. All came with soup (tomato or cream) and milk-tea or coffee. Service was quick and courteous. Nothing to complain about the food, but price could defiantly be a bit cheaper compared to similar food in the area. See picture for the lunch menu.
