ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg Food poisoning alert: my whole family got sick from eating this place! 


I frequent this place for dim sum, they are not the best but they are decent in the area. 

While the food is decent, my only complaint is their service and cleanness. The table cloth on are table was filthy when they sat us down. Not a big deal but definitely have me question on their sanitary. 

Service is bad, no question ask. I won't be back.
