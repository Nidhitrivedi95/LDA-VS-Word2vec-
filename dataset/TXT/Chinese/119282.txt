Nsi49BE_XsjJ0oOXwhH8hA This is probably the cheapest buffet I've ever been to. Yes, the selections are not as much as other places, but for the price, what are you complaining about. Just like other buffet, there are some good food, and there are some bad food. And from what I remember, this place was not bad at all. If I had gone back three times for more servings of food, then it must be good. So if you want good deal when it comes to food, then this is the place. Just remember to make the best deal out of a buffet, make sure you come hungry.
