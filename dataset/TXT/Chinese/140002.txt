R-EGIdIgtoFzl--OudANtA This restaurant is definitely worth trying. Most may not dare to enter because it doesn't look that appealing but the food is really good and the low low prices make it even better. If you like pork liver congee this restaurant makes the best one I've ever had. There is big pieces of it and it's cooked to perfection, not hard/tough like some places. 

Also, the rice noodle rolls are really good and freshly made. It's not the typical ones you get at dim sum. I like the fact that they have so many variety. I usually order the beef and pork liver rice noodle rolls. Yum!
