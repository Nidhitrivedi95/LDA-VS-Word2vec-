UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw My friends and I eat here on occasion. It's very good. The service is fair, as I've never had to look up and wonder where my order is. The staff come by often to see if we are OK or to give us updates. The meal size is just right. Have you ever had crunchy spinach? It's pretty good!
