BJW6rCMoWcn8fDFhbMVyEQ I have picked up take out from here before but this was the first time dining in.  This is a restaurant that believes in customer service.  Many restaurants could learn from Jade Palace.  They actually greet you with a smile!  There were always two people at the hostess stand so everyone who walked in was greeted. We sat at a table in the bar and had impeccable service from Beth.  We ordered hot and sour soup and lettuce wraps for appetizers.  They assemble the lettuce wraps for you at the table- how nice is that!  I love lettuce wraps but they are usually really high in sodium so I end up drinking a gallon of water after eating them.  These were delicious without killing you with salt.  We ordered the beef and broccoli and the kung pao shrimp.  Both looked and tasted very appetizing and had fresh ingredients.  The broccoli was not soggy or overcooked- it was done perfectly. At the end of the meal they bring a complimentary refreshing sorbet.  The fresh food and the awesome service does come with a price tag as this is pricier than your average Chinese restaurant with many of the dishes at $15 and up, but their service really made an impression. The manager was stopping by tables- ours included- to make sure everyone was happy with their meals. And as other reviewers said the clientele is a little older.  But if you are just picking up food from here you are missing out!
