9RSgLa87uZTZKdTvxy2qyg I find myself again disappointed in Pei Wei. I was looking for healthy options near my office, which is near Metro. I've been to Pei Wei before in the past and never was super impressed, but felt it was an okay option if I wanted something with actual vegetables in it.

I ordered the fried rice with tofu and extra vegetables. I ordered it for pick up, online, and the whole process was fine. The food was ready when I got there, and I like the pick up parking.

When I opened up my lunch, however, I was really disappointed in the amount of vegetables. I paid $1 for EXTRA vegetables, only to find 2 pieces of broccoli, probably 6-8 snap peas, and a bunch of shredded carrots. This seemed really cheap to me - as carrots were probably the cheapest vegetable. I would have liked some more broccoli or some green vegetable. I was expecting a bit more, given that I paid a whole dollar more. I would hate to see what this dish looks like without "extra" vegetables.

The tofu was good - there was a lot of it. Which makes me wonder did they mistake the "extra vegetables" for "extra tofu"? Not sure how that is possible since I ordered it online. Anyways, the food was really over salted. It left an odd thirsty feeling in my mouth for hours after I ate it. This has happened before when eating at Pei Wei, I suspect they cook with processed ingredients or add some kind of additive to their food. 

For the price of the food it's not worth it. I paid $10 for a place of processed, overly salted fried rice. This includes the $1 I paid for some "extra" vegetables - probably an extra snap pea and an extra pinch of carrots (not worth a dollar). I won't be coming back there, even if I'm in a pinch. There are lots of other restaurants coming in, I am sure I'll find something healthier and more worth the price for lunch.
