fRmzrUNb1qtqxRtdkWsW2g It was my first dinner experience with my family.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  The staff is friendly.  It is a restaurant better suited for couples.  My kids are extremely picky eaters and it was hard to find something they would eat.

I ordered the Appetizer Platter that serves 4 for the children to sample.  The dish was well presented.  The platter was delicious.  We were not fans of the Thai dumplings & the red paste on top.  This is definitely an acquired taste.  

The kids loved the Crispy Shrimp Sticks, also an appetizer.

My husband and I ordered the everyday special. You pick a soup, get a salad, vegetable spring rolls and choose a main dish.  The wonton soup was good.  The salad was mediocre, the vegetable spring rolls (reminded me of what I purchase at costco) & dipping sauce was good.  I found my shanghai noodles to be a bit oily but the meat was delish!  My husband found his general tao chicken dish to be ok.  The dish was good just not his favourite. 

I felt that the server could have filled the water & removed the empty dishes sooner.  Considering the restaurant was not very busy.  But all things considered I would recommend and return again.
