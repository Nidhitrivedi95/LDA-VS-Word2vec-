Bp7Qj64Qr8jvj3r7WBtmSg Went back. Ordered  Fukien Fried rice and BBQ pork and Duck. Deliciousness.  Cool waiters. Did not go into washrooms this time. Lol. My buddy who went with me also found the food quite good. This would be my second trip and the BBQ pork is consistent with the last time I was here. Good!
