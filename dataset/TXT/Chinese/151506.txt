SZldZinCvCRE6u92q0u0cA This is for the Shepard location 
I ordered with delivery.

I don't recommend the egg rolls unless you like a filling that is only al dente bean sprouts with little flavour that get stuck in your teeth. I ended up throwing the other 2 out after giving it my first one a 3 bite attempt.

Also the Chicken fried rice tastes like smoke not savory chicken. I was disappointed in it but nothing was technically wrong with it.

General Tao Chicken was pretty good, I preferred spicing it up with the included chili sauce, and leftovers were enjoyable.

The experience overall was not what I expected and probably will remain a one time thing for me.
