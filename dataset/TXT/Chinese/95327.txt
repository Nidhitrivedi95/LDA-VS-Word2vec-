JhEtJbGjAqKDHCZ11i3qoQ 10 bucks for a large bowl including rice and a drink. Yes please! Pick your meat (dark and light chicken, pork, beef, cod), load up on veggies and then move to your starch. I loved that they had recipes for sauces for those that couldn't decide. My bowl was delicious, I went with the chefs special sauce and kicked it up with siracha. The soup was a beef broth and I heavily piled on the wontons. I couldn't finish my bowl but my leftovers were great. 

The only reason this isn't 5 stars is they charge for take home containers and the hostess had an attitude. And if you don't have cash you are putting that 50 cents on your debit card... Not cool really. Still I would definitely be back as the food was good and the line moved quickly.
