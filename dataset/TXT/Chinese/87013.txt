HQpMwOOrGND3GaRqMNV9ig I use to come here in the 90's when I went to high school down the street.  I remember it being good, and recently tried it again.

long story short, I found a LONG piece of hair in my soup.  This wasn't just a small hair but more like a foot long piece of black hair.  I nearly puked.

I will never return!
