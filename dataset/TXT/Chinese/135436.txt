QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ Came here for a family meal and ordered A LOT of food! The service was really nice and friendly (one of the staff came through to wipe up our mess midway through) and I think everything is made when you order it. 

The best parts were the cucumber salad, the beef roll (had a very Peking duck feel), the chive (and egg) pockets (SUPER HOT, but SO DELICIOUS!), the spicy tofu (was very fragrant, and super flavourful; not mapa tofu). The Xiao Long Bao buns were super soft. 

The green onion pancakes were yummy too! Tried the steamed dumplings, the boiled fish ones...black crapas and chive? (which were surprisingly light and well flavoured), the hot and sour soup (yummy, but a single serving), fried pork and chive dumplings (these aren't super well closed, but okay).

It's a good price point!
