XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA Fantastic buffet. It has a very large variety of food, I couldn't eat everything I wanted to because there was just too much to try. My favorite aspect was all the barbecue dishes (and the tasty fried plantains). Lunch buffet is $10 before tax or tip, which is a great price for so much good food, plus the Mongolian grill and sushi bar.
