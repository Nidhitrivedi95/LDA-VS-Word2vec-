PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ Terrific food in a lovely atmosphere. The pumpkin curry, the house speciality is outrageously good. So were the basil noodles. This restaurant is a combination of really good food and excellent management.  The prices are very reasonable, the service was good and the overall experience was to our liking.  We certainly will be returning.
