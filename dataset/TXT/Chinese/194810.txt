zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Came in a date night with my beautiful wife  we didn't have a reservation but we were sat right away at the bar. Service was fast and polite and the pork buns I ordered came out lightning fast and were very tasty. The pork was soft and yummy. We both ordered the momo ramen and it came out as soon as the pork buns were gone they were hot and super tasty with perfectly cooked noodles. We also tried the crack pie / cereal milk ice cream they were both in the same container and we could not tell which was which it would have been nice if they were in separate bowls so we knew the difference. Now you might be saying sounds like This would have been a 4/5 star review and it would have been however our waiter gave us our check and the processed to let us rot in our seats trying to get his attention to pay it honestly took 15-20 min to get some random staff member to get someone to let us pay. A great experience ruined by our struggle to pay. I'm sure I will be back to give them another chance but this certainly ruined our experience.
