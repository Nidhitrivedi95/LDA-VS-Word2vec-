They offer that egg custard bun which oozes out warm, neon-orange colored, yolk-flavored sweet custard. Not all dim sum places offer this delectable pastry, which is my favorite.

*Thumbs down*
Overall, quality has gone down significantly. The dim sum portions looked smaller and more shriveled up. They were served almost at room temp, and it didn't help that we were seated directly under an AC vent going full blast. Service still takes forever.
