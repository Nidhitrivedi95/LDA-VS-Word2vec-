w3RH9W99ZIKvw0Qgibdn4w Having just moved here, I needed to find my go to Chinese joint and this spot definitely checks everything off my list. 

1) local and family owned
2) A+ customer service
3) BOMB FOOD
4) Fast delivery

Have been my go to for months now and this place ALWAYS hits the spot. 

Order the Hawaiian Carmel chicken and the cream cheese puffs. Will not regret. Orange chicken used to be my go to but order this!!!
