JOrz9T33rVHDbusIKPj96g My favorite restaurant in Mississauga. They have very authentic southern Chinese food. Every dish I tried here are delicious, some of my recommendations are:  The sliced fish and to-fu soup, marinated meat platter, fried noodle with beef, fried squid with salt. 

The restaurant can be a bit crowded, but the service is decent and dishes are served quickly. And the price is also okay compared to other Chinese restaurants.
