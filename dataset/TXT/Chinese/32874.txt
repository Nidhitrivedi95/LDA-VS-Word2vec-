a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg Off to a good start with crispy noodles (upon request) at this Scottsdale 'upscale' Chinese restaurant served with hot mustard and sweet and sour dips... wait staff very attentive and friendly. Ordered PORK EGG FOO YOUNG and finally had it served properly with a dark beefy gravy plus duck sauce on the side. For a couple of dollars more than the fast food 'take- out' joints you can have a really nice sit down dinner. Ideal for a date to add some class to your night. Ask for "sweetie-pie" for exceptional service... you won't be disappointed!
