2XTHIR2Fza2XiC54NWiNZg The only reason this location gets a star at all is because it is a Panda Express. The service and food is consistently terrible. We have been to this location now three times and every time they run out of food, the employees are slow, ineffective, and apathetic, and the floor is a sticky mess. I encourage the manager and owner to spend more time training their employees.
