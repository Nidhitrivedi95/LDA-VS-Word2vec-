Q9veWOu7mFj881o3nqB4bQ Just left this restaurant. I absolutely loved it. The all you can eat is amazing and priced great for what you get. There are so many options to choose from on the list. The food was fresh and tasty. The service was great. Our server was very attentive and anytime we ordered more off the menu it made its way to the table very quickly.

We were lucky enough to chat with the owner which made the experience even better. As it was our first time at hot pot he made some great recommendations. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town.
