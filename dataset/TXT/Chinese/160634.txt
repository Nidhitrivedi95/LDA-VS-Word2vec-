ubC3XvGLxDi3QHlW2J1Q7w Whoa! Terrible place. Smelled like I just came out of a brothel afterwards.  Unprofessional massage.  You should never massage directly on the backbone; that could cause permanant damage. Came out with a horrendous headache!! Also, very rough.  Cut your nails people.  I have never been scratched so badly in my life, never scratched during a massage before period. They switched the person doing the massage halfway through.  Also massage person was frequently talking on the phone in another language during the massage. Even left her cell phone on the table at the end.  Tried to ask for a different price at the end than what was quoted on the phone, but finally relented and told me not to tell anyone.  WTF?  No other massage experience even compares to how horrible the experience was.
