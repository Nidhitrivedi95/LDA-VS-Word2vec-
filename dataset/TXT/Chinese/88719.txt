I_WWH2vYccjz-QxW3u1zJA This was easily the worst buffet dining experience my family has EVER had. The place is filthy, and nobody speaks English. There is a koi pond filled with dozens of fish that are much too big to be confined to such a tiny space. It's a wonder they're even surviving. That has to be constituted as animal abuse of some sort (possibly neglect..?)
As for the food, everything is super spicy, even "Butter Shrimp". When I tried to figure out which dishes aren't spicy, nobody was able to communicate with me. I literally had about four different items to choose from. It was pretty pricey ($40 for three people) as well, and one of us didn't even get a drink! The service was also horrible, as I had to repeatedly ask for my ice tea to be refilled.
If you're looking for decent Chinese food, this is NOT the spot! You're better off going to Panda Express. 
I'll never come back... If I could, I'd rate it at zero stars. YUCK!!
