bghaKcuM3a3pnUWzq4NEbw I have been going to Silver Star on and off since 1996 when i moved to the Durham Region.  Whenever i go i always get the same thing.  Dinner for 4.  We get the chicken fried rice, chicken balls and chicken wings along with egg rolls and the chicken chow mein.  Your first impression when you walk into this place won't be great.  It's a dump.  This place is take out only and they haven't done anything to make the inside of the place look better in 20 years.  They use flattened cardboard boxes as entrance mats and the only guy that speaks english at the counter is missing half his teeth (sorry being honest).  I'm sure these things would turn off alot of people.  So your first impression wont be great, but there is a reason this guy has been in business for so long.  The food is good!  My wife and I have tried a lot of different chinese food take out places over the years and we keep coming back to Silver Star.  Their food is pretty good and reasonably priced.  I love their chicken fried rice, its the best i've ever had to be honest.  I have been to far more expensive Chinese restaurants and their rice can't touch Silver Star's.   Their chicken balls are really good also, i find the chicken wings a tad greasy but they taste good.  The egg rolls are egg rolls and the chicken chow mein i also really like.  I am not a daring eater when it comes to new things, so when i find something i like i tend to order the same thing every time i go there.  I'll highly recommend Silver Star for the food, but definitely not the decor!
