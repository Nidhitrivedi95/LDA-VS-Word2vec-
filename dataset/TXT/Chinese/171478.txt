VYByx4yXYiZDeiaVVus7HQ Super excited when this place first opened up! Taiwan is my favorite place on earth 90% because of its foods, so I wanted to try it asap.

The decor inside was very cute and unique. Wifi was readily available. The servers were also very nice and approachable.

The food though was kind of disappointing. Here is what I had:
- Chicken popcorn: too much breading, too little flavour. The spinach was the next part of the dish.
- Yakisoba: hmm I'd have to say this is the worst yakisoba I've had in a restaurant. Dry and flavourless. Avoid.
- Fried mixed mushrooms: my favorite dish. The breading is still a bit much, but the flavour and the combination with the texture of the mushroom saves it. 
- Unagi and pork belly steamed bun: The meat/fish by itself is well seasoned. But the bread hides the flavour too much. The bread is also cold, which was a weird combo with the warm fillings.

Overall, it's a nice place to hang out. The reward system is also pretty cool. I might come back to try the drinks but probably not the food again.
