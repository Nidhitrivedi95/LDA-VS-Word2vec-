BsyNabKZJOVIHWmwUghreg Horrible experience. It was the first time I visit this location I normally go to the one near Dundas but this time I decided to go with my friends to this location. When we entered we had to wait for over 7 minutes to be seated although the restaurant was 80% empty, the waiter was distracted all the time he even took the order wrong and brought us a non- Viggie Spring Roll although we told him we Only want Viggie dishes. When i confronted him he was rude and said this is what you ordered and mumbled words in an Asian language that i am not familiar with. the rest of the evening he ignored us completely and avoided passing near our table.

Basically food was too salty and greasy; not tasty at all and not worth the money we paid. 
Just dont go there its not worth it! Their service is horrible and food is not tasty the only good thing about this restaurant that the design looks nice and deceiving!
