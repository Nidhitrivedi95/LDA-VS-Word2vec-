Ei5UwFatcAXCweKug4SuGg Pretty good and super cheap (not in quality but in price).  Lunch specials are varied and plentiful.  I like that they allow you to chose between fried rice and steamed rice as I do not like fried rice with my saucy chicken dishes and most other Chinese restaurants have it fixed on their daily or lunch specials.They serve good portions for a fraction of the price of competitors.    
This is my new place for those weekdays when I do not want to cook, want good food but have little money to spend.  :)
