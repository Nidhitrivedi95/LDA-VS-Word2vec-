F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw great food, bad service.
bad start, good finish!

It took them 20 minutes to come and take our order(I timed and noted this in my phone LOL)
once the orders were in it didn't take to long for the food to come out.
The Drums of heaven(chicken lollipop) was alright, I mean I guess all the menu hype had me thinking it was some extravagant and amazing tasting chicken, but it was quite bland(maybe I got an odd batch)
I felt a lot of the things we ordered lacked flavor, but minus this experience, it is pretty hard for me to find Hakka food out in the west ends so I won't cut them out completely just yet, I def have to try them again and update my review upon my second visit.
