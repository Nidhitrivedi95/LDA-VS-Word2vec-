eCJDiRPoSuA0bsb7F1gNUA Good food.. Great value. I recommend the lemon chicken, the honey garlic chicken, anything sweet and sour, and the walnut shrimp. Those are my faves! They're getting 4 stars because their plain fried rice that comes with the dinner combo is awful. Just awful. But if you order it with all lo mein, they don't charge you extra and it is yummy.
