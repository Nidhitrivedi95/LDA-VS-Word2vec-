drIFrAyZnyismS1ArZlmAg I'm not a vegetarian, but this food was really excellent. We order a ton of food! I'll start with the things we didnt like so much or found odd. I didn't really like the spring rolls which tasted bitter for some reason and the fried rice tasted like it was drowned in soy sauce. It was so salty none of us could eat it but I talk to the waitress and they brought out some more that was just excellent. Also, the Sweet & Sour "Pork" w/ Pineapple had really, really nice flavor but a strange chewy texture. I would order it again because the flavor was good.

We also order the Family Tofu, steamed broccoli, steamed rice, some kind of "chicken" and noodles, and wonton soup. Also, we tried the cheesecake and YUM!!!  All of these were soooo freaking good... OMG! I totally crave this place now!
