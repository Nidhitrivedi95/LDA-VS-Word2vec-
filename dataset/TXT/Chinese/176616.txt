Wqa1JjkSuviehZ7OedhPeA First of all, when we arrived at the restaurants, there were a lot of people waiting at the front gate. After we took the number from the front desk, it took us approximately half an hour to be seated.  I wouldn't say the environment is fabulous but I am Chinese so I don't really expect anything spectacular from a Chinese restaurant. We ordered the Beijing grilled duck, which is not bad. But it is not comparable from the one I had in China.  The skin there is crispier.  The tastes of spicy chongqjng chicken and the mao xie wang are fair. The steamed Xiao long bao is not really juicy. In a word, the food taste is just fine and don't expect a wow because they are not really gourmet styled.  If I want to eat Chinese food one day and it is nearby,  I would go to this restaurant but it is definitely not worthy of driving for like one hour just for that.  Oh by the way, despite that majority of the restaurants in Major big cities in China accept credit cards, they only take cash or debit card here, which is not surprising for me.
