f-ookZOX4pBNldaOHMkJ4A Do not be deceived; family dining until 9:00PM, but gunshots and takedowns from 11:00PM until 4:00AM. Hong Shing's and Wah Too Seafood are the scourge of this downtown neighborhood. The after-midnight crowds do not seem to mind a little fight with their food.
 
There have been 3 gun-related incidents related to these restaurants in the last 2 weeks (and 2 of them were actual shootings). Hong Shing's is not a safe establishment.

Take care walking to your car, or simply along the street, bullets literally fly.
