rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g I LOVE Flamingo Palace.  My family has been going to this restaurant for years.  This is my first review!  (I'm new to YELP)

Their are always super fast, service is very friendly, and the food is the best part.  I love the cashew chicken (spicy)!!   This is the best Chinese restaurant around.
