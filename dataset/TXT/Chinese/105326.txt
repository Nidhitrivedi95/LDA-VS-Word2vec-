kVXyz0mYd7NaGuGdM_VMeQ Yay finally!! I don't have to go to Chicago for some asian cravings!! I know the asian marts here carry baked goodies from chicago, but having freshly baked awesomeness right here in town is a totally different story.

I've been to Asian Sweet twice before, but I waited until my third time to pen this review because the first 2 times I went in the afternoon, and only for the bakery items, which by that time they were mostly sold out, so I only got to try very selected stuff. But today we made it right as they open after consulting friends who have pro tips (go early!). 

Their food items are a real deal, you can easily get a full breakfast complete with coffee/tea or a mix of coffee and tea (yuan yang) for less than $10. They offer all day breakfast and lunch items starting at 11 am. I will be going back to try their lunch items some time soon. The tofu and fish over rice looks amazing! We had the shrimp crepe, wonton noodles, chive dumplings and pork congee set today. The crepe, dumplings and congee were all nicely done. I found the wonton noodles a little on the plain side, probably cause we had that right after the crepe, which came with soy sauce. But that aside, the wonton doesn't have pork in them, only shrimps, not quite the best you can get in town, but not too bad. 

As I mentioned right at the start their freshly baked goods really stand out. Finally I got  the long awaited egg custard and char siew buns yay!! And they are really good. The red bean buns are another popular item on the menu too. These sell out fast. While I was in line I see different groups of people come in and grab more than ten bakery items at one go. Amazing! 

So, go early for the best selection!!
