He asked what places to eat were over in the Smith's shopping center, and we meandered across the freeway.  We noticed China Tango was new, but I saw Jennifer C.'s review and knew at least a big plate of rice included with a dish would make Eric happy.

It looks like we should order at the counter, but the cashier handed us a menu and told us to sit at a booth since we were dine-in.  He gave us a styrofoam bowl of fried wonton strips and a plastic sauce cup of sweet n sour.

We got small styrofoam cups of water, styrofoam plates, and mini plastic forks.  We decided on egg drop soup (I was skeptical because soup was pricey like $5.25) and ginger and onion beef.  The soup came out immediately in a big plastic tub with a plastic spoon (not a ladle).  It had corn in it and was hot, just hard to serve in these small styrofoam bowls we had and little plastic spoons to eat it with.  

The ginger and onion beef had lots of green onions (good), bamboo shoots, red onions, and ginger.  Without a doubt, we received a huge plate of white rice.  The beef though - it looked good, but the texture was horrible.  You could call it "cheap meat" but I could not chew it.  I tried a few times and ended up spitting it out each time.  I ate the green onions with my rice instead.  At least the sauce was okay.

For the inedible dish and expensive soup, it was over $18.  Imagine if each person got a dish, yikes!  There is no value for your money.  Just lots and lots of styrofoam...! Will not return!
