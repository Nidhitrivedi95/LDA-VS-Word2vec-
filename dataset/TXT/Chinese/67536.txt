emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw I remember going here with my mom as a special treat when I was little, I always loved eating dim sum here. I went back a few days ago with my boyfriend and was very let down. The food was greasy and tasteless. We had a dim sum platter appetizer, pot stickers, tempura shrimp and BBQ beef love mein. The only really good thing was the tempura and the free dessert bun they gave us. I think I'll just stick to my childhood memories of this place, but find somewhere else to go for dim sum.
