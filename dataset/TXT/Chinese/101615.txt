kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A When you first enter this place the first thing to draw your attention is the wide open window that opens up to a lively kitchen with a L shape counter for sitting. Its quite small but the turnover is high so you don't need to wait too long.

Our server was nice and was able to explained to us the concept and his preference of what dishes to get. Our party was quite pleased and the Chicken w/ Mushroom Fried Dumpling was crispy and browned in the right places and not soggy with a great consistent flavor. We were offered a small dish of Spicy Oil Paste to add to our dish to make it more spicy which we opt since we like our food on the spicy side. However it was the Noodles that stood out in every dish we had. If I'm ever in the area and needing a quick and delicious meal , I know what place to check into.
