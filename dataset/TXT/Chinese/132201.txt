PMsqD6wHCfxdrZkGXIepvA This place is without a doubt one of the if not the best Mandarin restaurant in town. They operate like no other. Costumer service is so good, they always compliment you and acknowledge you when and if you need something. I'm glad I came here, it's like no other experience. Trust me and go eat here.
