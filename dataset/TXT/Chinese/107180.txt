L7iOEZLuvd3vHoX8Efi_hw Well, one word i want to say "sucks"~ four of us went to this restaurant because the next door was too crowed~ we found out the decision was so wrong~ 

first, they did not have any breakfast to order which did not match with their Ads outside. after we sat down, we waited more than half an hour for all dishes but in the end, they just cancel our order and let us go becayse there are more people waiting outside.

Then, the food was very little, just one spoon per person and no one was full~ 

 i think this restaurant is not even qualified for one star~ 

Anyway, think carefully before you go and this restaurant is not recommend at all!!
