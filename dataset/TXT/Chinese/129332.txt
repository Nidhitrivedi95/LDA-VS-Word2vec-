pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I tried SushiSamba because of one of the kids friendly restaurants in Las Vegas, but it was a huge mistake. Here is the worst place to have dinner with my child. They have a kids menu. That's it.  
Our server, Alice gave us pretty bad services.  We visited there before 6PM and they weren't busy at all. We placed some orders but she didn't bring my child's dish at all.  After 30 minutes my child almost cried and we called Alice.  Then we found out that she hadn't ordered it.  10 minutes later we got kids beef skewers. but they were so bloody.  I had to return it to recook.  My child started crying finally.  We ordered Mochi Ice ream for my child's dessert and she repeated "Mochi-icecream without any candy flakes, all right."  Worse, we got tons of candy flakes on them at the end. It was unacceptable. 
I used to work as a waitress, so I understand sometimes it happens.  But not too many mistakes for one table.  It's clear she should have paid more attention to us after making mistakes.  At least, we wanted to finish our dinner better because the restaurant is kids friendly.  Did I expect too much? I don't think so. I mean if they care.  

I contacted managements later, and they emailed me to give us $200 credit we spent at that time on our next visit after mailing that I live in LA :(   We just wasted our money and they ruined our day.  It was the only one day I saw my child crying at dinner.
