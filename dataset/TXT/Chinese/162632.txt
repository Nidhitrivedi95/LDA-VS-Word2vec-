uNKc0RnUClv-Nk6pU34QXw This place is okay for dim sum. We came at 7:00pm for dinner. The reservation was made long time ago, but they still made us wait for long time. The food is good, but the service is aweful. The servant was extremely disrespectful to us. The food came after one hour of wait, and they say that it is the NORMAL wait time. In the end, all they cared was if you can finish eat fast and pay the bill. They impose the 15% tips to the bill, which was handwritten, and the tax was added. No official receit was given to us. We paid cash, so I highly doubt the restaurant will really pay the tax to the governement, and it was more like a 30% tips for such aweful services that we got. I am a native chinese, and had been to a great number of similar restaurants in my life.... this is definitely the worst place ever.
