X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I guess if would be a great place IF you have a table. Otherwise, there is really no place to "chill". You either have to constantly keep walking to stay out of traffic or be push and I do mean PUSH in the dance floor because it's ridiculously crowded with no space to enjoy dancing. Bigger DJ nights, forget it, I won't survive. I would get squashed like an ant.

My experience here wasn't bad at all, I somehow made my way to a table on the top floor off the balcony right in the center to have the clearest view of the DJ. I just thought wow, if this hasn't happened to me the night, I don't think I would have even a slight good time. I was just disappointed at the many great nights I had in Vegas that weekend and wanted my last night being at Hakkasan to be amazing. It was alright, not terrible, I would give this place a try one more time.

No lie when they said this place is huge. There's an elevator to go on each floor of the club so yes, you will get lost if you separate from your group, but it's Vegas, go on an adventure.
