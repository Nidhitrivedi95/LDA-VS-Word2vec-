IFXL6wMLBgBSGSiLBjtViA Food was good and service was attentive.  Nice to pick your own sauces to mix and match.  The decor of the main dining area was nice (even though there was a lot of steam from the hot pots the atmosphere didn't show it).  

The bathrooms were disgusting though.  There must had a problem as it looked like it was being fixed.
