76C_syxpetD-muSUe5_ABQ Have you ever noticed how restaurants on holiday are different to ones at home?


 Hot Hot Chinese is probably one of the strangest restaurants I've been to in the UK. It's like a little piece of China transported to Scotland. The decor is sparse and you might end up sitting on plastic picnic chairs in a humid, chilly basement if the main room is full. The waitresses barely speak English, and the menu is Chinese with only basic translation.


 It was also one of the most fun dining experiences I've ever had. Each table is set up with a hot plate, on which is set a boiling cauldron of stock. You can choose from different flavours, like fish or spicy. Instead of ordering what you want, you simply tell the waitress what you don't like and she brings you everything else. Vast plates of thinly sliced raw meat, shellfish, mushrooms, turnips, seaweed and tofu come to the table. These are then dunked in the boiling stock until cooked.


 Noodles also make an appearance, and you get certain side dishes, such as raw peanuts and kimchi style pickles. The drinks menu is a little limited, but you can get a few bottled beers and juices.


 It's probably not a place for a first date, or an impressively fancy meal, but for £15 a head it's a mini-holiday!
