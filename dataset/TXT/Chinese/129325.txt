pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I like this place. I stopped by late on a Saturday night. It was pretty crowded but we we're seated in less than 5 minutes. The DJ did a good job priming up the atmosphere. 
We ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, 3 Meat Entree, with some nigiri on the side. Although, the Teri Chicken and Nigiri portions were small, the 3 Meat Entree made up for it. The steaks couldn't have been cooked any better. The Teri Chicken was average and I've had better sushi. 
The service was on point. Our waitress checked on us numerous times and kept our glasses filled. 
Nice place to grub before a night out.
