bvTyaYHXupi1c5mbs65RyQ When my husband suggested going to this place I warned him that it was not going to be pleasant having been there for  a previous dinner. Most of the food was yucky.  The crab legs floated around in tepid water for an hour without being replenished when we questioned the waitress, she said that the cooks were busy.  The best dish was the coconut shrimp which I ate for dessert after having some during my meal.  The mussels were bland and the fish was blah.  Everything on the buffet had been sitting there for a ling time. Should have known to leave when there were only 5 other people seated when we arrived at 7:30 pm. Yikes!  Our waitress didn't bring new napkins nor did she pick up our used dishes. I'd recommend the sushi/buffet at Parma town or Yellowtail in the Akron area .
