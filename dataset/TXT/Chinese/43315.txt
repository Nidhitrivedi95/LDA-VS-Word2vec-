For my first visit, I tried their chengdu style zhajiang noodle with a side order of chicken gizzard. The noodle was cooked perfectly; not too soft, not too chewy. I asked for regular spicy level and found that it had a slight amount of heat, which kept building as I ate more. However, it wasn't too spicy, where it would make it hard for you to eat. I've had sichuan style food that's way spicier where it literally numbed your tongue and made you sweat like crazy. The noodle dish from this place didn't do that to me, so if you like super spicy food, the regular heat level might not satisfy you, so ask for extra spicy. The chicken gizzard was tasty (though it was not a chicken gizzard only, but is rather a chicken giblet) and was actually spicier than the noodle.

They gave you plenty of food and I was struggling to finish my bowl, but if you do need more food, you can ask for extra noodle for free. For drinks, they gave us sweet mung bean soup, which helped cool off the heat and which they would refill.

The only downside is this restaurant is located in the same small plaza, where tea station and ichiza are, so parking can be a challenge during busy time. However, you can always park at the bigger chinatown plaza next door and walk over.
