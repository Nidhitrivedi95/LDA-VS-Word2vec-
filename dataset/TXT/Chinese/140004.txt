R-EGIdIgtoFzl--OudANtA Besides Sam's Congee (located in Market Village) this is my other favourite place to go to for congee (rice porridge). You get a huge bowl for what you pay for, I usually can never finish a bowl myself. My favourite congee is the pork liver with pork blood congee. The congee's flavour is phenomenal, never too salty, and the pork liver is always cooked perfectly. The dough sticks are always freshly fried and are made to order. Crunchy on the outside but super soft inside. Tastes so good to dip the fried dough into the congee!  They also have rice noodle rolls here, so I'm excited to try that next time. It's a hidden spot, but very popular. It already starts getting busy (I mean lineups from the door!!) around 10am so I suggest going at 9am ~
