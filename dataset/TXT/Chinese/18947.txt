5h2DIYpfzc7KDTFg18uuew I don't know about the food yet, but it is really ghetto as far as interior and exterior go. Definitely in a questionable part of town. Hope the food's good. All I want to do is leave! It's that bad in here. Ok, the food, "sigh", not so good, edible, but is that all I want from my food? The answer is no, I'm afraid. When I got it home, the sauce had leaked all over the bag, so much so that I didn't see the egg roll I had ordered and by the time I realized it was missing it had been soaking at the bottom of my "pool" of sauce that I just decided to forget about eating that egg roll. I ordered Kung pow chicken. It was mostly bell pepper and onion, some chicken and maybe two peanuts? Very disappointing. For now, Grace Garden is still my go too place for good Chinese food, go there!
