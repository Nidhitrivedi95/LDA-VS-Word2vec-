However, if you need something quick and don't feel like queuing up for 15 minutes, then welcome to Szechuan Express !  

This is food court food at it's best.  

This place had a huge selection of all the basic Chinese dishes.  I've tried a number of the different items in my combo pack, and for the most part it's all solid food court food.  Does that mean it's great food... Not by a long shot.  However, It's quick, hot and it actually tastes pretty good.  Throw on top of that you get a pile of food for your $$.  Don't get me wrong, quantity is not quality, but there is usually enough in a 2 item combo for my lunch and dinner and for $10 !

I've been to this place in the heat of the noon rush, and they get you through in less than 5 mins, even if there is a large queue.  

Overall, I like this place, it's quick and it's good (for food court). I've repeat visited, and likely still will.
