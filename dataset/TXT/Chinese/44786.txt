bl2U-rhPusg5BtgORlZTEg Don't let the name fool you this is not a noodle house, it is a full-on Chinese restaurant with a complete menu. Over the last couple of months this place has become our go to spot for Chinese as it is close to our house and as good as any of the places that we frequent in Chinatown. 

Like many Chinese places one suspects that the best stuff is on the special section of the menu written only in Chinese charters.  So to get the upper hand we had a friend translate it for us:

1.       Broccoli with spicy sauce

2.       Ox tripe (salad)

3.       Chicken with sauce  - not sure this is boiled or fried

4.       Ox tripe in chili sauce (salad)

5.       Sautéed  eggplant with Tofu

6.       Sautéed sliced pork with vegetable (boil the pork first and slice to pieces, and then fry it a bit, cooked with vegetable)

7.       Scrambled egg with tomato

8.       Pork ear in chili sauce(salad)

9.       Yu Shiang shredded pork with spicy garlic sauce

12.   Peanut mixed with pork tripe (salad)
