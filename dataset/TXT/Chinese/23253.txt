6SfNZP1oqiQV1AYLK9A8WA Came in for lunch after hearing a co-worker talk about it and decided to check it out. Pretty small restaurant. Service was pretty fast for the lunch hour, and the person who took my order was very courteous. The food, however, did not impress me at all. My wings were drenched in sauce and there were about three sad-looking, soggy carrot sticks in there as well. The fries were pretty bleh. I think the soda I ordered was the tastiest part of my meal, to be honest. I'm giving it two stars because the service was good.
