I walked in and was greeted with complete chaos at the front desk with a line of people waiting to pay and someone disputing the price of a treatment.  It took forever to check in, then I waited 20 minutes for my very rushed and stressed technician.   The treatment room was filthy.    I had a facial in a filthy room with stained sheets.  They used cold water from a crock pot.  Can you believe it?   Barely any steam came out of the rickety old steamer.  I opened a drawer looking for a blanket, and saw a mess of junky products and dirty laundry.  Complete waste of time and money here.  They get all their business through very good marketing.   Do not have many repeat clients and I certainly would not recommend them.   They offer way too many services to try to accommodate everyone and do none of them well.  Would give this negative stars if I could.
