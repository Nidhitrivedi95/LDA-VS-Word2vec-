FfmH-oEWN7K1za-o8KZQDA Friendly service, decent Hong Kong style buns, decent Hong Kong style milk tea. Plenty of seats are available. It will be a nice cafe to hang around in the neighbourhood. 

I went there around 4PM, most of the shelfs were empty. I guess you need to go earlier for more selection.
