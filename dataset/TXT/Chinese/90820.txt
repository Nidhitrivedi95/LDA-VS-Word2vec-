IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ so disappointed.Checked in late and kids were hungry Thought I would take them to a nice dinner..We ordered orange chicken.it was gross and just some fried chicken with soy sauce.Told waiter we did not like and it was nothing like orange chicken we have had elsewhere.His response was that was how they do it.Chow Mein a little better but very average same with fried rice.As a previous reviewer said Panda Express would have been much better and not cost $55 for 3 dishes.A waste of money and a big disappointment!
