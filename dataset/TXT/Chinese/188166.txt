yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I don't get why this place has less than 4 stars. I've been for the first time today and it was pretty good! A friend of mine swears by this place, she comes here a couple of times per week so when it came time to planning a dinner date we followed her lead and agreed to meet here. 
I tried Chicken Drunken Noodles, Chicken Pad Thai, and Rare Steak Pho. I really enjoyed the drunken noodles  and pad thai, great flavors! The pho was ok, I wasn't crazy about it. It seemed kind of bland and flavorless. 
The portions are big enough to share and prices are beyond reasonable. Service was fast and friendly. AND I noticed they're opened 24hrs, YAS! All in all, I'm definitely coming back!
