_xt4ZyvtgY8Xu_O6SpSB5A My go to Congee place when in Mississauga.  I highly recommend the preserved duck egg with pork congee and the chicken and duck congee.  This is the only place that I can find in GTA that has boneless chicken and duck congee.  Also recommend the hand pulled chicken meat that is marinated in spices and a special sauce... very flavourful and delish.  The only item I would not recommend is their curry dishes.  I found the curry a bit watery and not strong enough for my liking.  Everything else on the menu is two thumbs up.
