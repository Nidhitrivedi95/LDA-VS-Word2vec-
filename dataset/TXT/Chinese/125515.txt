Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w The price to eat here is completely worth it if you know how to eat.  Do not dine here and not eat everything.  Fresh crab legs, oysters, and shrimp make the price completely worth it.  I gorge on seafood here.  Their buffet options are plentiful as well.  It's only considered pricey if you don't know how to make the most out of every buck.
