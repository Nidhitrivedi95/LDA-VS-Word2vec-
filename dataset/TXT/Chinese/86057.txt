HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I visited Fat Choy today for the first time. Reviews had been mixed, and being very close to home, I decided to give it a try. 

Arrived at Eureka around 3pm on a sunday and the place was empty. Same goes for Fat Choy: only me and a couple inside a booth. 

Ordered pork belly bao as appetizer and short rib rice as entree. both were terrific!! Bao was so good that I could've eaten 10 of those.  Short rib was also amazing. So tender that I had no problem eating with chopsticks. 

I left as a happy customer, really. Food was great, service was fast and friendly. I didn't have a problem with the casino at all -or the smell of it, as other yelpers have pointed out-. 

I will definitely be back. Great new place.
