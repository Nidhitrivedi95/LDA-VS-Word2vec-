I ordered Cashew Chicken to go which gave a good helping and balance of meat and veggies. The portions are very generous with rice being served in a separate box and the prices are comparable to Pei Wei. They advertise lunch specials for just under $6 which is certainly intriguing and warrants a second visit. Good spot to get Westernized Chinese cuisine without straying too far from South Chandler.
