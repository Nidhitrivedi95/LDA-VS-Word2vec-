Ns4tjgLfqR1qawGlNFROBA This is my second time here. If I came back it must be good. For a small hidden place the service is friendly and everyone is willing to speak and chit-chat. Kristin is a great server too. Sushi chef does a great job with a variety of rolls and the wok chef knows how to throw them noodles. Overall great experience and would recommend to all.
