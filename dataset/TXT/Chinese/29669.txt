966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA Wendy's is a bit misnamed by calling it a noodle café.  Yes, they have noodles, but the menu is pages long with more items that are not noodles.

Several of us gathered here to try a number of dishes.  We ordered:

Curry fish meat balls
Shanghai dumplings
Honey glazed eggplant
Sweet potato fries with black sesame
Kung pao assorted mushrooms
Pork with preserved egg porridge
Pan fried noodles
Walnut prawns
Rice omelette with seafood Alfredo
Grilled ox tongue
Spicy steak cubes and rice cake with ramen
Chef's special fried chicken wings
Fresh fruit Napoleon
Hong Kong style mango crêpe
Snow flower sundae

I'd recommend these dishes:

Curry fish balls, Pork with preserved egg porridge, walnut prawns, grilled ox tongue, and the chicken wings.  Avoid the sweet potato fries, the pan fried noodles, and the rice omelette with seafood Alfredo.  For me to recommend chicken wings is an uncommon thing.  Good flavor on the wings and the jalapeños served with the dish were great!

As for the desserts, perhaps sharing made it harder for two of the three dishes.  The snow flower sundae is a two person kind of dessert and the Napoleon had fresh fruit but crispy layers that broke in small pieces.  The mango crêpe was good and it comes in a plastic box so you could take it home if you wanted.

The restaurant was not busy but service was a bit lacking.  I'd list this in my OK category.  It might be worth another try sometime but I won't hurry back.
