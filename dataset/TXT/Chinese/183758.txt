XRYBvFFBNOUZT5NFqyS53g Really enjoyed the meal I had there a couple of days ago.

I had skewers:  taro, lotus root, chicken claws, and peppers. The chicken was just right--not falling apart, but not tough. Watch out for those peppers. I thought they'd be something milder like shishito, but they were jalapenos. One skewer was two peppers, and you get two skewers per order. Just one pepper was enough for me, though I finished one skewer.

I also ordered the unagi kabayaki.  It was good, but pretty standard. Came with a small side salad and small bowl of kimchi.

I'm planning to go back once the weather cools down to try their oden.
