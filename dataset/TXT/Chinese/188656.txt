First, the flavor and quality of the broth, it can't be too greasy, great deep color of the broth, nor too much MSG. Secondly, the quality of the meat! I usually get the combination, of tripe, tendon, and the rare beef . Lastly, the quality of, what I call the extras, i.e. Thai basil, white onions, bean sprouts, jalapenos, &etc. 

The second dish I usually judge a Pho joint is by the quality of the spring rolls. Now, I've been to many places where the spring roll just plain sucked! It's hard to find a place that has all the elements of a good spring roll. i.e. the shrimp, not too over cooked. The pork, is it flavorful? Is the vegetables mushy? and the overall quality of the flavor, not too much vinegar, a slight touch of mirin, and of course the quality of the peanut sauce. Makes me hungry as I write this! This place hit all the mark! 

Now, let me say this, when a place is called Pho Kim Long...Pho soup is the way to go! Enjoy what they are known for! With that being said, the bowls of delectable Pho has to be one of the better ones in Vegas. It's not to say that the Banh Mi sandwiches are not bad, to be exact, it's actually pretty good! 

Service is very prompted, friendly, and professional! Nothing negative to say about it at all!  

Price wise, it's great! Everything is pretty much under $10.00! Can't complain too much here! 

Enjoy! 

 n ngon nhé
