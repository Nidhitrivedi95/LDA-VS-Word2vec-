Lunch specials are drenched in sauce, beef are chewy and not tender, and onion pieces are cut too long that it doesn't fit in one bite.  Egg rolls are huge resembling something that is not an egg roll.  Go to George and Son's in Glendale if you want better Chinese lunches for similar price.  They do serve you tea for free though (although very heavy/dark/non-fresh) that pushes them up to 2.5 stars.
