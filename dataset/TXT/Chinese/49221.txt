CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw During my first visit, I had the laksa and having tasted laksa in Singapore, I thought their serving was pretty good. So I had high hopes when I came back here for their other noodle dishes like wonton noodle soup. Unfortunately, it was mediocre and overpriced. The serving of noodles was not generous and the broth was sub par. 

It took more than ten minutes for the order to be taken because the waiter seemed to be lost and not in the restaurant. However, when I asked for the bill, it came in snap.

I won't come back unless I wanted to satisfy a laksa craving.
