vMpJzMFst_9GP4boeqWIRg Well, I've now officially been to 4 Congee Queen branches. Unfortunately I felt this place fell a bit short compared to the other three I've been to (McCowan, Steeles/404, Commerce Valley).

I went to this branch with some friends one night, as it was a more central location for some who live in the west end. Not surprisingly there was a lineup at around 6:30pm on a weekday, so the demand is definitely there for this branch.

We ordered the general tao chicken, shredded beef and preserved vegetable chow mein, fried beef noodle, fried turnip patties, and spice/pepper salt squid. All the noodle dishes were good, as well as the general tao chicken. However, the fried turnip patties were large in size and lacked the "turnip" texture, and the squid was too overcooked (overfried? too much batter/squid ratio).

Service was par for your typical Congee Queen, if not a bit lower. It was harder to get someone to take an order due to the less than spectacular setup here compared to the other branches.

I likely won't return to this branch as I've had better experiences in the other branches.
