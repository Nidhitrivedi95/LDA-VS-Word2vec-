CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Review 26 for 2017! 

Save your money and eat elsewhere for some quality food!!!

Noodles is tucked away at the Bellagio Hotel near the high roller tables. Without someone showing it to you, you might have walked past it without knowing. We dined here on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait at all. The restaurant decorations were on par with the rest of Vegas. Interesting and unique.

We ordered pan fried potstickers, pad thai, kung pao shrimp, seafood noodles and the hainanese chicken rice. When I bit into the potstickers, the meat and texture didn't taste quite right. I felt like something was missing. I think the meat wasn't as juicy as I would have hoped for. The dipping sauce that came with them was pretty bland too. I personally ordered the hainanese chicken rice and it came with a side of house rice, chicken (you had the option of bone in or out, which is nice), soup, and dipping sauces (ginger, soy sauce and chili). I was really hoping for some unique flavors for the dipping sauces. The only side that I actually liked was the soup! Pretty flavorful, but not enough to make me order it again. When I looked at the kung pao shrimp, there was at most eight shrimps for the entire dish! Not to mention that it costed $22. For that amount of money, you'd think that they would at least give you more or decent sized ones. 

Service was good though. One of the servers noticed that our food was taking awhile to deliver (even though I didn't think so) so she personally checked on it without us having to talk to her. I noticed it out of the corner of my eye. 

Overall verdict: For the price that we paid, I don't think I'll come back unless they up their game!
