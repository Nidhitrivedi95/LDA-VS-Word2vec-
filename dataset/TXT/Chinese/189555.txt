yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA A little bit off the strip, but definitely well worth the drive.  A delcious and spunky (C'mon, one look at the name and you have to know that the owner has a sense of humor) place to get a huge bowl of pho....HUGE!!!  The service is friendly and very speedy.  The group of six that I was with was in and out within 30 minutes!  Ridiculous!

Pros:
-HUGE portions
-Good tasting broth
-SPEEDY (SPEEDY GONZALEZ FAST) service!

Cons:
-Off the strip... Have a sober person drag your booty here... TOTALLY WORTH IT.
