2UdoeXzcFg87O1VMCc3WGQ Been here a few times, kept going back because the food was really good and they had good variety. The decor is really nice as well.

However, after our last visit we will not be going back. Normally I don't mind a bit of crappy service so long as the food is good, but this time will be our last.

Constantly stuff from our orders is missing, so we have to re order.

Although the place closes at 10:00, the kitchen closes at 9 and you won't be able to order anymore food after that. Nowhere is this mentioned on their website or when we come in.

Now, the really annoying part- it is 9:20 and they bring our bill before we even ordered dessert! Fine. We ignore it and continue eating. The waiver comes back and asks us how we want to pay. With my mouth full of dessert I manage to ask if we can finish eating first. HE SAYS NO, WE MUST PAY NOW AS THEY CLOSE UP THE TILLS!!! THIS IS AT 9:20!!! RESTAURANt DOES NOT CLOSE UNTIL 10!! HE WOULD NOT LET US CONTINUE EATING AND WOULD NOT LEAVE THE TABLE UNTIL WE PAID!!!

NEVER HAVE I WITNESSED SUCH HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. IT IS CLEAR THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS, JUST THEIR MONEY. DO NOT GO HERE.
