AR1w3ragHgRvnU71A7aaZA In my few visits to Soga, I've had tasty experiences. A tad pricey experiences, but tasty ones.

My first meal here was with a big group and we settled on hot pot. We'd hosted our own little hot pot party a month or so prior, so I will say that the bar had been set high. A pot of boiling broth arrives to your table along with a bounty of raw veggies and thinly shaved raw meats. Chicken and pork were the selections we made for the night. The concept is fondue-esque, yet you're cooking your meat in broth rather than oil. We found the broth to be dull in flavor and the meat portions to be skimpy. The dipping sauces for after you cook the food also left much to be desired. Thus, while the hot pot at Soga was adequate, we weren't overly impressed. 

I will say that each entree I've ordered since has been great. 

The wings are perhaps my favorite option here. They're served rather spicy and with sauteed veggies and chopped peanuts. I've then tried the gyoza dumplings as an appetizer, as well as the dry braised chicken in hot pot. No complaints with the dumplings and holy spice on that chicken, in a good way. 

I also ordered delivery once and opted for the ribs stewed with pumpkin, which was impressively portioned and speedily delivered.

While Soga is on the pricier side in terms of Asian food in town, I've found the good food and hearty portions to be worth the extra expense.
