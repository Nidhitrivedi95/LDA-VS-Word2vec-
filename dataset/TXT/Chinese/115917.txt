N3kBSwTiplhiCSyhEdrXrg Agree with Lauren. Best Chinese/Japanese in the area. Sushi is excellent and better than Red Bowl. Take out orders are huge and low cost. Try the Triple Delight chef special. Hot  and sour soup has a nice bang to it. We have ordered from there four times in last two months. Although they are next door to the defunct Mamma Theresa pizza and previous Italian specialty store, these folks will be in business for a long time.
