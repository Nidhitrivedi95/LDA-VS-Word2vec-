safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg At least for me this is place is good for take out. Me and my wife dine in a lot of places and this has been by far the worst service we have gotten. And we know about service. My wife is a server and I used to be one. The server we had came to dropped off drinks, took the order, brought the food, and never came back. Not to ask if everything was ok, not to refill drinks. On top of that, I didn't even see a smile on her face all the time we were there. Other tables were asked of everything was ok and had their drinks refilled. We order take out from this same server before and you can tell she is not a happy server. Last time we eat this place
