AR1w3ragHgRvnU71A7aaZA I have been constantly searching for a Chinese restaurant in Madison that serves good sesame chicken so I decided to try this place. At first glance the sesame chicken looked incredibly appetizing, but when biting into or even trying to cut the chicken it was incredibly tough. There were barely any pieces in the whole order that appeared to be made out of quality chicken, the rest were inedible with chewy, tough, clearly not white meat chicken. I guess I'll have to keep looking for something decent in Madison. Would not recommend this place.
