EbgUkmDxPUa2fr0rc8EFJQ Sad to say that although their menu has been revamped and look really nice PF Changs quality of food and service has gone down. I initially ordered the Kung Pao chicken which came out dry and just did not taste right. It was then replaced with the honey chicken which was decent but nothing to write home about. House Lo Mein was decent, probably could have went to Harris Teeter and got the same thing if not better. Service was slow (not our waiter) and we Only had 3 in our party and it was 230 on a Sunday afternoon, restaurant was not even half full. Sadly we will not be returning anytime soon, especially after spending $80 on something we could have picked up at our neighborhood grocers. I hope they get better.
