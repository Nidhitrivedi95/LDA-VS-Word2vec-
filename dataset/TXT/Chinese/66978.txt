EjYGxyksao-Jhw86tIAiYQ I'm a regular here.  Noodles, noodles and more noodles. I heart noodle soup and their cake noodles are good too. I usually get one noodle soup to share and add extra noodle for a little more.  My favorite veggies are the string beans with olives. 

The staff is always really welcoming and quick with the refills. 

Definitely worth the trip and inexpensive to boot.
