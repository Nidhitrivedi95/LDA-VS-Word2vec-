vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q Probably my favorite Dim Sum place here in Vegas. Not great, but its decent, quick, and easy. Coming from Southern California I have always had the luxury of good Dim Sum places. Since I'm stuck here in Vegas, this place works for me whenever I have a craving. Never had an issue here yet. Service is good and the price point is decent.
