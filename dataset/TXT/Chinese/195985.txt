zKJ4KcZAfTNBIM7OvkVv3A Took the family there over the weekend for some dim sum. Not bad for Cleveland.

It looked like a typical Chinese restaurant in decor, which involved some fong shui, some western style booths, and lots of old fashion but cheesy Chinese wall hangings. But we were not there for the ambiance. And for that matter, we were not there for the service, which was more than adequate, we were there for the food. 

There were about 50 choices for dim sum including dessert. We tried about 10 different things and all tasted great. We liked the roast duck and the spare ribs. The portions are typical dim sum size and prices are averaging $4 per item. 

Watch out for the neighborhood, which appeared that it would not be too friendly at night.
