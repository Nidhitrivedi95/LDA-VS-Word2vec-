xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw I'm not going to lie, when my sister and brother in law suggested this place after a DBack baseball game, I was hesitant. It's a bar assembly with different meats, chicken, veggies, sauces and spices. You make up your own bowl and the cooks will cook it for you. It doesn't take long, our bowls were brought out shortly. and OMG it was to die for! I savored every drop of that bowl. It was better than I thought it was going to be. 
if you're not sure what you want, they have cards that suggesting you what you can mix up.
Looks like a nice place to bring a date to eat and grab a drink as well. Customer service was decent. 
I will be coming back again!
