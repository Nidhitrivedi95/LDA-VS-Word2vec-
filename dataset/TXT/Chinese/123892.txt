OnGPegQGuQ5_uuFLvezvKw RELAX... do not be scared of those negative reviews. They must have their purpose... I too was afraid to try UNTIL an encourage off one of reviewer Margaret L - Charlotte, NC.  She was right.

I've ordered cocount shrimp entree - man!!! IT's tasty! Rice? Not even so "sticky" just the right kind of "sticky" rice... Jasmine, I think.

I also ordered wonton soup - it scores high score.

And these were take-out - they were very good!

One more thing... they accidentally switched my order with something else but they were very very helpful and corrected their mistake quickly.

Would give it a five but I'm saving it for the next time I get to DINE in. :)

Just go... try take-out first.  Worth your $ and time.
