taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg This is one of my favorite standby's, when ever I want a quick tasty dinner after work this is usually where I end-up.

The dumplings here are second to none and the variety is awesome, This is a great place to with friends, if everyone gets a different type of dumplings and share it makes for a great meal.

I have to admit that the wait staff isn't always the most happy go lucky people but they always get to taking my order quickly. I think the restaurant is family run and the daughters are the waitresses while mom and dad are in the kitchen and I think this adds to the quirky feel of the place.

Speaking of quirky the look and feel of this place is kind of weird it looks like the space had been rented to a wanna be brew pub that failed and as soon as it closed this family moved in and  started making dumplings. It's an odd looking place.

All this being said the dumplings here are some of the best in the city and that makes up for the odd decor and interesting service. Keep in mind that your getting a meal for under $20 (for the most part) so you get what you pay for, in this case your money is going to the food.
