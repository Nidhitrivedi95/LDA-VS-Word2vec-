Km0sT7E_dc2U1BkyRoy1xA If I could give it -3 stars I would. Hands down one of the worst place I've been too. Good /okay service, horrible food.

We ordered the "Shaken beef" which was supposed to be one of the popular dishes, but I honestly don't understand why...... the rice was dry and burnt, no sauce or anything for it & vegetables looked like they were left out all day. I took a bite of the beef, and it was cold.... it was like they literally took it out all the ingredients from the fridge and put it on a plate to serve.
Sushi was ok... even with their buy one get one free promotion. I couldn't even finish a roll of 5.

I regret not looking at reviews before going here, but at least I can give Yelp and future customers some feedback. Hope this helps.
