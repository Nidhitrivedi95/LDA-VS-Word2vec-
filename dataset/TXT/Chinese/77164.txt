GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw I'm just a suburbanite from Cleveland, Ohio so what do I really know about "authentic" Chinese food? Admittedly, not much, but if you're idea of Chinese Food is Panda Express, Mark Pi, or anything else that you may find at the mall food court, then it might be time to expand your horizons a bit and check out some "real" Chinese.

Szechuan Gourmet has some of the best menu selections. Sure, you can have orange chicken, or Hunan beef, or Kung Pao this or that, but if you're willing to take a chance and dive a little deeper, your senses and taste buds will be introduced to a whole new level of Chinese food at Szechuan Gourmet. Dry pot chicken, for example, is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever tasted. It's spicy, but not just for the sake of being spicy. The spices and peppers incorporated into the dish provide a tremendous palate pleasing experience. Another dish that I absolutely love is the Boiled Fish in spicy Szechuan sauce. Delectable pieces of tilapia filets boiled in exactly that, a spicy Szechuan sauce, with cabbage and other veggies stewing at the bottom of the bowl. 

Most dishes are meant to be enjoyed "family style" with portions big enough for at least two; maybe three. I usually go with a friend or two and select a main dish and a vegetable to be shared with the table. I've never left hungry. 

It's a little off the beaten path, and you may have your trepidations walking in, but I promise you that once the food starts coming, those fears will be lost to a distant memory and you'll be enjoying some of the best Chinese food that you've ever had in the CLE.
