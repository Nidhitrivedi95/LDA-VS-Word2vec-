O_Yi95nUeeqSudiMlUfttQ very blah resto... hong kong style bbq joint but the quality was mediocre at best... bbq pork was decent, riceflour roll with shrimp was crap... (2 rolls, thick large wrapper and only 2 shrimp... sauce was tasteless) xia long bao were all stuck together which defeated the purpose of getting them and the 2 bowls of noodles were nothing special at all....  skip this one... theres other options nearby...
