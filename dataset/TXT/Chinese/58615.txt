DDAGwRR0SypD47XD7-ytjA Although I've never dined in, I've gotten take out 3 times. The food is very good and the service is fast. My 3 year old who isn't too intersted in food, LOVES the Hunan Beef. She keeps asking for more. The Mango chicken is also delicious and the Wonton soup we had was excellent!
