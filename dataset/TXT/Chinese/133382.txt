pw9ErdIO1t7CWLrZwNP1fw I discovered this place trying to find a place that delivered sushi-they do!

  I have had delivery sushi from them a few times and they are pretty quick.  The delivery food was good too and fresh.  Usually it is the owner that delivers.  One Friday evening I called and delivery was not an option-a little bit of a bummer.  

I also found this place on restaurant.com.  They have great deals.  You can buy a $25 coupon for $2 on restaurant.com for here when you sign up on their website and they will send you weekly discount code of 80 percent-the website has other restaurants too!  They accepted the coupon here without having to print it which is great, but I'd call and double check before not printing just to be sure.  I did have to do a "dine-in" with the coupon, but it's only exclusive on happy hour-they do include alcohol. 

Downfall- I had to send two items back when I ordered in.  The edamame was overcooked, and the sashimi was mushy.  Also they served their yellow tail sashimi with the skin on-not my favorite.  

What I did really like here was the avocado boat and the roll wrapped in cucumber with several kinds of sashimi inside.  

It will be worth it to check this place out and give it a try at least.  Judge for yourself : )
