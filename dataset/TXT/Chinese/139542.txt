QXAEGFB4oINsVuTFxEYKFQ We saw that the rating was not that high, but decided to stop by anyways. A lot of Chinese restaurants with great food but poor service often suffer on yelp ratings, but the food here was not good enough to balance out the bad service.

We got there at around noon on a weekday and it was pretty full. It took a few minutes for someone to seat us. We ordered some dishes from the carts but realized we had no utensils. It took about ten minutes for us to wave someone over to bring us some. Although the guy who seated us asked us what tea we wanted, he never brought it by and it took another ten or so minutes for us to get someone's attention.

We got beef changfen, shrimp dumplings, spinach moon dumplings, curry octopus and meatballs. The skin on the dumplings and changfen was soft but too thick for the amount of filling inside. The meatballs were flavorful but not very tender. Only the octopus had both flavor and texture.
