GWNmYFQw3WitfTPt5uGMvQ This place sucks. Their speciality is serving cold and stalled food. Worst part is they take 1 hour to get that cold food. The waitress didn't even felt that she took so long. The quality is poor and food is semi cooked. I wish to give negative stars but unfortunately there isn't. 

Stay away from this place. There are better places  to eat.
