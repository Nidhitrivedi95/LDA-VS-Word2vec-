URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg I have no idea how or why this place got such good reviews, but we went here specifically because it got such great reviews and we were so disappointed. The food is bland! Like, so bland that chili sauce, duck sauce, and soy sauce didn't even help. I ordered the Thai noodles and it would've been a great dish if it had any flavor or sauce of any kind on it, and my husband got the Yu Shiang chicken. He thought that the sauce was good but the bamboo shoots were undercooked and woody, and the dish was plain all around. Very disappointing considering that there are a huge number of Chinese, Korean, and Thai restaurants in this city that are much better than this place.
