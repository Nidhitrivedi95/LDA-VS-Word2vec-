If you like fatty, greasy, tasteless food, this is for you.
The experience started with the long wait. Once we were seated, the service was horrendous.  We go out to eat a lot and have a solid understanding of good service, this was awful.  Angry, frustrated staff. No smile, barely a hello. When asked for recommendations on the menu, she pointed to one section of the menu and said this is all good. 

We ordered: 
Hong Kong Noodles: Came out as crispy noodles with shrimp, fat dripping in oil, just lard, yuck.
XO Green Beans: We expected spicy green beans and these were a big disappointment due to lack of any flavor or any spices.
Noodle Soup: Name started with an L (cant remember full name) was the only semi-flavorful item. It was in coconut milk with noodles and chicken. Decent, and actually tasty. The chicken however did not look like real chicken, must be imitation.
Beef with Asparagus: Not good, not spicy, also greasy and definitely not worth $21. 
We sent the Hong Kong Noodles back, we couldn't send back everything obviously, that would be too much. They still tried to slip us the check with the noodles though and when we objected she said we'd have to talk to the manager (keep in mind, this restaurant is in BELLAGIO), after a stare down to the manager they adjusted the bill.

We live in San Francisco and are used to good quality Chinese food and excellent service. We have no qualms to pay good money for good service and good food.
However, this place was a huge disappointment.  Would never recommend and will never come back.
