UPSzbM6D2SkarWAINq1I9A I love this place. Tay Do has the best Vietnamese food in Cleveland. 

It's a little Mom and Pop shop, literally. She manages the floor and he's in the kitchen.  Wait time for food and service can be slow, but be patient. It is worth the wait. 

The food is always fresh and delicious. The vegetable dishes are bursting with fresh cuts of vegetables. You get  Broccoli tops, not broccoli stems, pea pods, mushrooms, carrots, sprouts, celery, etc The tofu is always crisp, I don't know how they do it. 
One of my favorite dishes is the lemongrass tamarind soup. It's sweet and spicy with bean sprouts, tofu, tomatoes, and celery. It's a meal of a soup. Everyone loves the Tofu Me appetizer, fried tofu with sesame glaze.  I'm also a big fan of the black bean and tofu dish,the curry tofu with flat rice noodles, and the bun dishes (OMG! I always eat the whole thing!). My step-father loves 91 and 95 chicken. The chinese dishes are excellent as well. Some of the best Lo Mein. I have never been disappointed. The portions are generous. You get enough for lunch the next day..if you can stop eating. 

I hate to fault the place because they work so hard. The decor is minimalist.  Basic tables, chairs, and a fake plant by the door. But I've been to fancier places the food was more expensive and not as good. Since the food is made to order and they have minimal staffing there is a bit of a wait, like I said. But just go and enjoy your company. Or bring a book while you wait. 

They take credit cards, but for a minimum of $10. 

I've been going to Tay Do for over five years and everyone I introduce it to loves it. The maintenance guys at my work even have their favorite numbers.
