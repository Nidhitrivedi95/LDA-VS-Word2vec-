fnaDx7UD4MiodQlgYHDwsQ Really good Chinese. I myself have pretty specific standards when it comes to Chinese food and Dragon Palace definitely meets those. The chicken wasn't bad or chewy like some places you will find and the egg rolls and crab wontons were amazing. The only thing I would say that could be improved is the flavor of the Kung Pao. It was good but was not very spicy and was a little on the bland side. Other than that this will definitely be a place I will go to again.
