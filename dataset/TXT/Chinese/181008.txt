x9SL1nCaUYM4JP91UrVkxQ My family really likes coming to this place, so we've been here quite a number of times. I usually do enjoy the food here, and I like how the food tastes natural, is not too salty, doesn't taste like there's tons of MSG, etc. I think the prices here are pretty decent as well, because usually we'll get maybe like about 6-ish dishes, and it'll come to about $80 - $90 for 5 people. As a seafood restaurant, they definitely live up to their name! Last time I was here we ordered a tofu and scallop dish, and there were LOTS of scallops, and they were all really big and juicy and tasted fresh. We also had fried rice with shrimps and an egg and shrimp dish, and the shrimp in both were large and plump. Sometimes we will also order a whole steamed fish, and it always tastes fresh and is cooked well.

They will give you free soup to start, and dessert soup at the end (usually red bean soup) which is great. All of the servers are very friendly. :)

Would recommend making a reservation, since this place can get pretty busy, especially on the weekends.
