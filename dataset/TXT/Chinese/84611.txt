HGuHk935tyokX6kveEviJw I've been here a few times and its really just because I want dim sum for a hangover. The service is really hectic which is a little expected but sometimes I'm just left hanging. Its usually really packed on the weekends so expect a wait which isn't too bad since you're already in Mekong plaza there's some options. The food is usually consistent, which means you know what you expect which isn't anything to rave about. The variety is there usually but I haven't been there on a weekday. The common fares (shu mai, hargow, and the beloved chicken feet) are usually bountiful which I know is always a problem at other places when you have to wait for them to make more but sometimes its just one cart of them it seems and you either wait patiently or do like the older patrons and just attack the cart directly.
