n62dcL1e8BQA1_kUEYrldQ My partner and I stopped in for the first time tonight. The food was wonderful!
The service on the other hand was a bit spotty. Server forgot my beer. Our entrees took quite awhile to arrive. A couple who were seated after us (by just a couple minutes) received their entrees well before us. They were almost finished by the time ours arrived.
