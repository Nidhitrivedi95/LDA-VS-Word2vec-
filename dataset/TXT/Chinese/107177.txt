L7EWjxpoyRYAbQABWnCGbw I like the pad thai, as it is a sweet but tasty concoction of noodles and chicken and bean sprout... i like that I can douse it in Siracha and have the perfect sweet but spicy blend. I've ordered it a few times and always been satisfied.

The green curry chicken was a loser though. Hardly any chicken, and oversized chunks of broccoli and carrot (seriously large, like needed to be further sliced into smaller parts to make tolerably edible). It was lacking spice, and lacking flavour. Will not pass.

The spring rolls are decent too, even though the sauce to dip it in is weird, clear, and kinda odd all around. But its all fairly priced and the delivery is relatively prompt given how wide their service area. I'd give the place 4 stars if I didn't absolutely hate the curry. But alas, here we are. 3 stars!
