yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA This is probably the only pho place I visit when I am in the Vegas area and since I'll be moving here I plan on being a regular. Some tips before one gets here.

This is totally a tourist place so weekend be prepare to wait. Lunch time is crazy and there isn't a lot of parking space so car pool if you can. Also has other restaurant to eat around the same plaza fyi

Bowl of pho runs about 8-9$ and they have other Chinese and Vietnamese plates if you don't want pho. Service is decent especially in such a busy establishment. If you have a part of 4 or less you don't have to wait but a bigger party has a bit of a longer wait since you want to get a bigger round table.

Also a perk? Totally 24 hours. Go have fun at a Vegas night and then uber or lyft your way to get over your future hangover!
