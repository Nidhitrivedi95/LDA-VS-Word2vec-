GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw I have been to Szechuan Gourmet so many times. It is not a place for Americanized Chinese food, you won't find Crab Rangoon or sweet and sour soup (well, they probably do, but please don't order it from here, doesn't worth it), it is a place for somewhat real Chinese food, especially if you love Szechuan food and love something spicy and tasty! 

Well, as a general guideline, when you want to know if a Chinese food place is good, check how many Chinese are eating there. Since Szechuan Gourmet is always packed with Chinese people who are from China, that says enough.

Things to recommend: Any dry pot dishes, Spicy Beef Slices, Hot pepper Fish Fillet, they also have a BBQ lamb on their special menu, if you love Chinese BBQ, ask for that! It has a cumin taste in it, really good.  

Also, it is the only place offering "Hot Pot" in Cleveland! Yes, the only place to offer Hot Pot. Hot Pot is a type of food where you cook everything in a broth on the table fresh and dip them in a special sauce. I've been trying to find a hot pot place in Ohio for so long, they only had it in Cincinnati before. I'm really glad they start to offer it here in Cleveland. But you have to ask for the menu and they only offers it when they are not busy, so one star down for that.
