966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA We each tried a different noodle soup and they were all good! I would recommend the Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup with Udon noodles. The Beef Stew noodle soup was okay (kind of a tomato base, I think). The Wonton Noodle Soup was bland, but just what I needed because of a rough night in Vegas the night before :P
And the Beef and Pork Noodle Soup was good as well.
