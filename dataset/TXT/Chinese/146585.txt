S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg There's always something a little different about Hawaiian style Chinese food.  It's hard to described, but it's comforting and tasty.  Wo Fat conjures up memories of the old school Chinese restaurants (many of which are gone now) back in the islands.

The must haves include, crispy kau gee, stuffed duck, and cake noodle with anything.  If you have a bigger party or if you want to take home some food, the ong choy with harm ha and pork and the kau yuk are classic.
