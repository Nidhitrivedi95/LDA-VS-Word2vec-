KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ I've been coming here for almost 15 years. That ought to say something! Anyways, I have never had bad service or bad food. I've tried just about the entire menu and everything is good. If something is ever wrong, they're quick to fix it. All the waitresses have been there since the beginning of time and offer the best service. Definitely my go to Chinese restaurant. The egg rolls by far are the best EVER made.
