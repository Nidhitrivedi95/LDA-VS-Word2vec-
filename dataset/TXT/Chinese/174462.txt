WEw08dCcOiwH3Sw1f_8DKQ I had high hopes for this restaurant however I was extremely disappointed. The portions were small but the prices were steep. I thought the quality of the lamb was alright (the sesame lamb ribs were decent) but we found a hair in one of the salads... The noodles in the Mongolian Chicken dish were extremely soggy and pretty much turned into a doughy mess in the sauce. Don't think I'll be coming back.
