ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ I love The Clever Koi.  They have a killer lunch special - a $5.00 bowl of ramen.  After putting all the fancy stuff in it (meat, egg, bok choi, etc) - it comes out to a still-acceptable 10 or 11 bucks. Delicious. Also, the pork belly bun is also excellent.

Every time we've been there, we were greeted warmly by the owner and had good service at the bar. The bartenders are also excellent there. I really like the French 95(?) cocktail - a mix of champagne and whiskey. Weird but mighty good.  They have a good discount on cocktails at happy hour, too.  

Hands down, the Clever Koi is great stuff. I go there as often as I can!
