vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Went Friday at 1130am to find it closed....wtf. You're supposed to be open at 10am or so goes yelp and your website. How can you have the most reviews of any dim sum place and close on a non holiday week day? Lost a local customer. Call ahead before you go I guess even though it says their open.
