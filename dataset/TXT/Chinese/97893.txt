jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ I eat regularly (3-5 times a month) at Pei Wei, usually in Scottsdale or North Phoenix. My wife's doctor is across the street from this Pei Wei, so we have been stopping in when we go to her baby check ups. It is, without a doubt, the best Pei Wei I have eaten at. It is consistent, they don't get frustrated if you customize your order, and the cooks on always on point. 

Wish this location was closer!
