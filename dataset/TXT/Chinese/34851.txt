aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg Don't tell me to come in at 5:00 when your duck isn't ready until 6pm. We ordered a roasted whole duck one week in advance for Chinese New Year. I get there with my receipt and after I waited for already 20min, an employee comes up to me and says, you're going to have to wait for another 20min for your roasted duck, unless you want to order something additional. I'm just like, excuse me what?!?! Did your customer service regulation go out the window. This is complete BS. Don't tell me this after I wait 20min. Did you give my order to someone else?!?!?! There was absolutely no organization in this restaurant what so ever. When someone orders an item 1 week in advance, they are obviously expecting punctuality. Never coming back here again. Congrats you have lost my business.
