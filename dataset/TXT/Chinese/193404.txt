ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ We popped in on a whim and are so glad we did! The ambiance was gorgeous, the employees were super adorable, friendly and helpful, but most importantly, the food was incredible!! 2 of my friends ordered the Seafood Hot Pot and said it was spicy and delicious. My son and I shared the Kimchi Fried Rice with duck, and Pork Belly Ramen. Both were magnificent. We also all shared the Tuna Chips with Wasabi Guacamole and Calamari Fries appetizers. Every item we tried was seasoned beyond expectation! It was a flavor explosion with every bite, and they were reasonably priced as well! It's hard to satisfy a party of 5. Great job, Clever Koi!
