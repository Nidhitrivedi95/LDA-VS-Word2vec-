SzTbr5cAfX9j8DFhIn7sDQ This used to be my go to hot pot place 5-10 years ago (in its old location at times square). I finally decided to come back to check it out. I rarely go out for hotpot anymore because I usually get all the hot pot food myself and hotpot at home.

We went here for late night. Man, it's so much more expensive than before (I forgot whether it was 15.99 + 2 for weekend or 15.99 for weekend)! (Sep2015 edit: late night is $18 per person!)

Anyway, the food was as expected. Good variety. I'm mostly a lamb and beef person, but I was surprised to find their beef tendon balls to be so good!

I'd come back here again, but like I said before, I usually just get all the food myself and just hotpot at home. I'd probably come back more often if it's a bit cheaper.

7/10 for the food, 7/10 for the service, 7/10 for the value. 7/10 overall (not an average).
