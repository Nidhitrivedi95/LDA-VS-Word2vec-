As for the food... it was good.  We had the crunchy salad, the broccoli, and the jerk chicken chow mein.  To finish, I had the grapefruit sorbet.

I want to be able to give this restaurant a better rating because they have such a good vibe going on inside and I really appreciate the intention of marrying Jamaican and Asian cuisine.  However, nothing really stood out in taste.  The salad and broccoli were just 'good'.  The chow mein was also good, but not outstanding... and actually, I couldn't taste the 'jerk' in the chicken.

The grapefruit sorbet was great, but it's hard to miss on that one.

With all of that said, we will definitely be back because I believe that I might be judging this restaurant way too soon as I need to try more of the dishes.  I found myself eyeing some of our neighbours' food and I can't wait to try those dishes the next time we make it here.
