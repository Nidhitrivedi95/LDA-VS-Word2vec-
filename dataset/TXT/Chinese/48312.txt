C5azlhXSTOlqVAM3nl95nw Decided to try this place it's very small and clean with a cute little old lady taking orders.  I tried the chicken kung pao which i really liked and the hubby ordered the Mongolian beef which is soo good.  The only thing i didn't like was their fried rice it is very bland and very eggy..  but i would still go back and order steam rice instead.
