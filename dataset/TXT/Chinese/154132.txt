td9FZybutwNG7DgocHCiXA Service is very inconsistent - the difference is on the extreme end of the scale. 

Peking duck is what we usually come for, with a side order of foie gras with beef tenderloin. Quality is always consistent, not the best Peking duck we've had, but it tasted "cleaner" than the other restaurants. 

Also got to try their dim sum, their sesame ball is so amazing!
