yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Shopping center isn't all that attractive but inside this place is very nice. Excellent service. Kept my water full all the time. Lettuce wraps were mediocre. Beef Pho was excellent. Broth was amazing. Add a few jalapeños for spice. A lot of food. You don't need an appetizer.
