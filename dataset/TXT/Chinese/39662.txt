aWu1homxB6lciXU6-ZlpSQ I'm dropping one whole star for Wei's because the Beef Noodle($5.25) was pretty disappointing especially when stepping into a Taiwanese restaurant.  I know they FOCUS mostly on Lunch Box and Frozen Food but I wasn't expecting this at all.

I'm hard to SURPRISE but Wei's did it.  When the friendly chef came out with our bowl it had the toppings that made it recognizable as Chinese Beef Noodle, such as the chopped Pickled Cabbage, Vegetable, Scallions.

What looked WRONG was the soup was clear/transparent which is never a good sign.  It tasted like they got the Beef Brisket from a HK-style restaurant which comes with soup and then just poured some of it on to the uninspiring Noodles. 

 The GOOD was that it was an A-OK portion which includes the Beef pieces that was falling apart just by chopsticking them.  If they advertised it as HK-style Noodle then I think it would have worked out.
