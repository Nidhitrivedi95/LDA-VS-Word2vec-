CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I went to Noodles with friends to have a soup+noodle fix after the first night. I ordered the wontop soup noodles and found a tiny black bug. When I told the waitress, she took the dish back right away, but did not offer words of apology - although that could've been due to her poor language skills. They took my order off the tab but that was it. No managers came. Nothing. I was too tired from waiting in line/food to even throw a fit. I guess inspections are not getting done too swell at Bellagio.
