ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ We came here with the entire family for an early Chinese New Year dinner on a Sunday night. This location is better than the one at Yorkmills and Don Mills, not sure why. This is a Asian buffet for Asians, clearly the food taste more authentic. They have many people working and the food is served in much smaller batches compared to the Mandarin, helping to ensure the food is hot and fresh. They have 2 giant TVs in the main dining room - probably making the Chinese clientele feel more at home since every Chinese person I know has a bad habit of watching TV while they eat. Anyhow back to the review. Service was top notch, non aggressive or pushy while efficient and subtle. Interior is very amusing and adds to the experience. Dinner buffet for adults was $29 few dollars more than other buffet but way worth it.
