t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA There's a reason this is the first restaurant that I visit whenever I am in Champaign-Urbana. It. Is. GOOD.

It's a bit disorienting and overwhelming the first time, but easy once you get the idea. There is a table with piles of menus, order pads, and pens. Grab your menus (there is one with the "Americanized" dishes and another, larger one with more traditional/authentic food. Look at both menus. Grab an order pad, sit down at a table, and argue with your friends about what to order. Write it all down on the pad, then drop off the menus back on the menu table and go up to the counter to order and pay. Grab your own drinks (free hot tea!) and silverware (the server will bring you chopsticks), put the number the cashier gave you on your table, and wait a very short amount of time to be brought delicious food!
