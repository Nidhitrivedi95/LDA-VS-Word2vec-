uNjoyF_qlLqOSEEYVpTkLg Have been coming here pretty regularly for the last couple of years for my Chinatown dim sum fix. No cart service but I prefer the order cards anyway. Service always perfunctory, consider yourself lucky if they crack a smile. Quality of food for the most part really good.
Standout dishes are the BBQ pork buns and the Shanghai soup dumplings. Good egg tarts too.
As of November 2015 they have increased their dim sum prices... boo.
Will keep coming back anyway, the food is great and easy enough to snag a table, even on weekends.
