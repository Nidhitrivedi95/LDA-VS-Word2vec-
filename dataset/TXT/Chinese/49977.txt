cdJDKOB0Todcqnv6CiOQTg Pros: place is clean and staff is well dressed. Aprons are clean which is something I always notice
Spring roll- never disappoints. Nice and crispy. Hot with a delectable dipping sauce.

Cons: They are moving over to a self serve style Feb 1. That will be a nightmare I'm sure. They will take your order- but you have to pick it up. They are having difficulty finding full-time servers.
Service is very slow. Not friendly but pleasant and present.Took at least 20 mins to place my order and coffee and place was empty. They don't seem to care if you are there or not.
Never got asked for  a refill on coffee  and had to ask for water.
All in all if you are not looking for great service but decent food. You'll be okay coming here. It's not the greatest but it'll do.
