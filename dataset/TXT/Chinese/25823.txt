4 stars and holding! My family and I enjoyed Dim Sum here so much that we went back for dinner this past Sunday. The menu is very extensive and offers something for everyone. Low mein, chow mein, hot pots, fried rice dishes, squid sauteed with green onions & peppers and so much more. Really what more could a girl want!

The service was great and once again they were very accommodating with my peanut allergy. After chowing down on all the fine food the server brought the bill. To our surprise there was a 10% discount. At first we thought they made a mistake and missed one of the dishes. My brother in law asked what the 10% discount was for. Apparently, on weekend at 6pm they have a happy hour saving patrons 10%! Seriously, what's not to love about this place.
