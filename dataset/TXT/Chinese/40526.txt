B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA Because YELP reviews were good for this place I decided to give it a shot & I fuckin regret it. Yes, REGRET! $30 bucks in the GARBAGE! 

Anyways, ordered food for DELIVERY on YELP. Called 'em & was told it will be delivered within the hour.... ok sure. An hour and 45 min LATERRR I got the call from their driver to come down to hotel lobby & grab my food; oh man wtf. I DID NOT******* want to leave HOTEL ROOM THATS Y I CALLED FOR DELIVERY!!! UGH 

Food:
PORK FRIED RICE -- GROSSSSSSS, I threw that shit out!
GENERAL CHICKEN -- tasted like sweet & sour chicken to me "/ and it was way toooo chewy, it was like chewing gum @ one point.
CREAM CHEESE WONTON -- sad excuse for cream cheese wonton, like a fingernail sized cream cheese inside big ass wonton wrapper

DON'T WASTE UR TIME/MONEY HERE. So not worth it. ZERO STARS if that was possible.
