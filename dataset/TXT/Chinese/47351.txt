bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ I order general Tao chicken, wonton soup, pork fried rice and their pork egg roll. It's by far the best Chinese restaurant in town. The egg rolls are big and fat, they have meat in it, not like most Chinese restaurants that stuff it with vegetables and are small and skinny... the general Tao chicken is not too spicy and it's battered / deep fried. I come here all the time. I give it 4 stars. 
Staff is nice and friendly too
