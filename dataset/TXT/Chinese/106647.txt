l_pR3x7v2mvE3luVdmGuoQ Oh my goodness... where to even begin.

I've been going to OK for years now, and I still go/love this place until today! Love love love. 

The salt and pepper squids, steamed seabass and oysters & lobsters are seriously TOO delicious! No joke. Maybe I really like seafood but those dishes are the bomb dot com! Mmmm. My boyfriend and I been going here for so long, the owners just know what we gonna order. I know some people had bad first experience with the owners, but to us they're extremely friendly, nice, and outgoing. 

I do agree that the price might be a bit high for some, but with the quality and quantity of their foods, especially here in Pgh, it's pretty darn yummy so we don't mind! Def a must try if you're in the area =)
