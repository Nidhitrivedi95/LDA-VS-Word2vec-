This dim sum place was great.  We were a small group seated in the tea room; private room away from the Sunday afternoon chaos.  Honestly, I've been to plenty of dim sum places but this one takes the cake.  The fried shrimp dumplings were succulent and just a tad sweet.  Har gow and siu mai were beautiful packages of yum.  Surprisingly the har gow had no row garnish which was fine by me.  I'll be back soon with my sweat pants so I can eat more. Nom nom.
