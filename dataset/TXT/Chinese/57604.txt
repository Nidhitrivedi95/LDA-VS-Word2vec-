D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA I really enjoyed my visit here. Watching a woman push a cart and offer items like tempura shrimp and sesame balls brought me back to the streets of Chinatown. Here we enjoyed tasty dumplings, hot noodle soup, and tasty roast duck. Washed it all down with a ice cold tsing tao. Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu.

I would like to give this place a another go. Maybe next time im in town.
