U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ We eat here regularly, we bring friends that are new to Vietnamese food and those who eat it regularly too.  We all agree - excellent, freshly prepared food for a great price.

The server /owner makes you feel at home and this place has THE best Pho, Bun, spring rolls etc.. 

You absolutely have to try the green beans and the Chandler rice dish -- SO good!  I highly recommend this place as it is the best Vietnamese place we've found in Arizona to date.
