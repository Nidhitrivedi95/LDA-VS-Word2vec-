The portion sizes are HUGE. I had the deep fried tofu balls. These were handmade and fresh. Tofu and egg with veggies lightly battered. Something I've never even fathomed could exist. There were at least a dozen on my plate. You'll be lucky if you can eat 5.

All in all, a great place for lunch. Everything was made fresh and it showed!
