t_SvwKRaMyNHj2NOMvMv1Q This is great food! They make it unbelievably quick to order and you get your moneys worth! Servings are huge. I have dined in a couple of times and it is quite small. Especially in the winter when there is a draft when the door opens anywhere you sit but I look past it for the great quality of food. They are extremely friendly and I love going there.
