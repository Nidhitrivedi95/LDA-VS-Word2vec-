TTVXY5vOJDqC0_Je8UhK8A If you want pounds and pounds of generic asian take-out, this place is awesome.

This being said, we got two dishes, egg rolls, a spring roll, and rangoon.

The General's chicken was no joke, the best I've ever had. Phenomenal. Solid 4.5 stuff alone.

The steak with orange was on the other extreme however. It had a funky texture and while it smelled great, it lacked any real quality other than being mush. I hate wasting food, but it quickly ended up in the trashcan and was inedible.

The egg rolls and spring roll were dull, which is pretty standard all around.

The rangoon had a lot in them, but were very sweet, far more so than I expected.

This place does deliver though, which is a huge plus, though be careful what you order, as it's very hit-or-miss.

Then again, you get what you pay for, and it's exactly what you'd expect.
