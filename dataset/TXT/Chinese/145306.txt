So since I rated the service a 1 and the food a 3.5, I think a 2 is a more appropriate overall score than my original 1. I forced myself to eat lunch there one more time to confirm that the food is tasty enough to warrant this adjustment, and it is.  I went around 2:00pm-ish to avoid trouble, and no, I did not bring Sam the watch.
