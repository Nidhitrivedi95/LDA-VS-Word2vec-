URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg I live downtown and always WANT to love downtown businesses. I'm also aware of China Chili's status as a downtown institution. But the truth is that I've eaten here 3 times, and 2 of those times the food made me literally sick. 

Needless to say, a .333 batting average where "eating without getting sick" is what counts for a hit is not particularly impressive. And unfortunately, when I checked the County website to give a fair review regarding their cleanliness record, their entire history is no longer available since they moved to their new location. So I have nothing to report to you, folks, other than I've only eaten here 3 times and my Darwinistic instincts will not allow me to go back.

EDIT to add: I don't want to speculate about something that would harm a restaurant without solid proof. But my reaction to the food here is eerily similar to how I would feel after ingesting MSG. No scientific basis for me to say that. But that's what my gut tells me.
