HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Just gonna say Horry chit, da fud is too many yum. The price is pretty decent for the quality you get, the service is very sweet and the wait staff was very enthusiastic about the menu. 


GET THE BAO. All of it. The servings are slider size so it's either meant for sharing or buy 2 for a light meal. The pork bao are probably the best I've had and the same goes for the duck which is easily on par with most joints in the LA Valley area. 

The slow cooked short ribs were super tender and the pickled garnish was a nice touch. Add bacon and eggs to help with the flavor. 

The pot stickers are fresh tasting and home made. The wonton soup was very deerrricious as well. 

The daily special was a pork belly BLT which was pretty amazing as well. Didn't have a bad dish at all. 

Love the FAT CHOY logo, it's comical. Soooo not racist :) 


Definite favorite and will come again when I'm in town.
