Q7PWryGwFr52WMmfzqCBhA Came here for lunch and so far it's the best Dim Sum place I've had in a while. The atmosphere isn't over the top, it's your usual Dim Sum feel, but the food definitely taste much better than the others I've had. 

With other locations you can sorta tell that the food has been sitting/reheating for a good while when you try to digest, in this case, the food tastes fresh and leaves you wanting more. With that said, If a friend wants any recommendations for a Dim Sum, I'll be sure to mention this. Specially cause it's fairly cheap as well.
