PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ I wanted to try a new dim sum place. Yum cha just was not very good. I had 8 dishes all were a little off with the taste factor. Also it does not taste very fresh and the food came out cold. Service was nice and friendly but still slow for how empty it was. I wouldn't come back. Safe to say ping pang pong is way better.
