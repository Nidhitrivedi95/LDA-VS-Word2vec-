zswdqM8Av3KxVv9o7_6ORA I have been ordering food from Rainbow Garden for ten years. Their food is delicious, it's always hot, and delivery is fast! My husband loves the crab rangoon, and I don't think I've ever had a dish I didn't like.

Rainbow Garden is also a great spot for lunch. They have the usual lunch special: soup, spring roll and entree with rice for $6-$8.  The lunch specials are a great value, however they only include the common/popular Chinese restaurant dishes such as general tso's, princess, garlic sauce, etc.  If you want something different, you have to order off of the full menu.  But the food quality here is very good and everything tastes fresh.  I'm a fan.
