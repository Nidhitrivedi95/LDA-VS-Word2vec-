Like how the owner is always standing at the checkout counter, scouring the stock section of the newspaper...grumbling to himself.
How the same lady server has worked there for all of the twenty or so years I've been going there. 
And how the food never varies.
The same dozen or so featured items week after week, year after year. 

Sometimes you need that.
The feeling that while the rest of the world is changing at breakneck speed, there's a respite from all of it. 
A place where you know you can always go where the food, the people, the ambiance will always be the same.
Its small intimate surroundings.
The server, who upon seeing me knows to bring me a diet coke and does so before I seat myself. 
And the warm smiles from the owners when I leave.

Be forewarned however. It's not fancy.
Its very small, and can get crowded at lunch and dinner.
But the food will always be the same, guaranteed.

This place is pure comfort.
