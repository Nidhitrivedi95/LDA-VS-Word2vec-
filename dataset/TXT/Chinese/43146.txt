beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw This place was amazing. Kwan our server was probably one of the best servers I've ever had. We had a table of four and he was extremely friendly and make sure we understood everything and told us what's the best way to get the most bang for our buck. He was always there when we needed it and was always smiling and friendly.  Food was fantastic. We had the lamb and beef combo and beef Combo. The meat was great quality and price was. It bad at all. You should definitely check it out. Make sure you ask for Kwan
