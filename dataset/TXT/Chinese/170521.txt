vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Came here on a late Thursday night with my cousins b/c we were on a mission to find Dim Sum to bring back to the hotel and eat there...

Customer service was decent, but it took wayyyy over 30-40 minutes just to get our food...total cost of food cost us over $116 bux...we didn't care anymore...we were hungry. "$3.88 for 4 pieces of siu-mai? Aww damn, but fu*k it...we got a group to feed," says my bro lol...

While we waited, they served us ice water which was nice, and since we were drunk off the alky and were hella hungry, we ordered wor wonton soup...it was hella bomb haha

Eventually we got our food and ate it back at the hotel...
-Fried Rice: 2 kinds I forget what...simple but good
-Salt 'n' Pepper Pork Chop-a tad bit salty but it was good
-Pork siu-mai-expensive but it was delish
-Wor Wonton-the second time around, the broth was hella salty
-Honey walnut shrimp--delish
-HK style chow mein--I can't believe they ruined my fave dish...hella corn-starchy...and no flavor!! :/

Nonetheless though, we were satiated and sleepy by 3am haha
