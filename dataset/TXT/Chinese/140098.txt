R_Z2wQ5dSBihyGVwDFKaeg Definitely a hole in the wall spot but its sooooooooooooooo good!!!!!!

What did I get...EGG FOO YOUNG of course! They do it right!!!!! (see list in profile). Along with the egg foo young I got shrimp fried rice and an egg roll...all was delicious and I just wish they did Egg Foo Young like this on the West Coast!

Its only carryout so plan accordingly but its so worth it...get your sauces and napkins and go to town when you get home!
