4WmI1fnjvfI5OyV1B6emAQ Go to late night snack place for after drinking in Markham and Richmond Hill area!!

My most favourite item is their Black Chicken Pot. This dish is served like hot pot.. but it uses a "almost medicine-type" broth base - which is really really important.  The broth here is definitely one of the best!!!!!!!!! Has never disappointed any my guests who know of and eat this dish occasionally! I wouldn't claim it's the best. But for a fast food and late night snack place, it is definitely second to none. Hence 5 star rating.

Everything else is 4 stars.
I would also especially recommend fresh seafood stir-fry from here. Different types of clams and shell fish.
