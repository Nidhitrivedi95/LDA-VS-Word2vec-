XC7RBm6or4mf2LyKqQfuUw Went in for lunch.  Accommodating staff and waiter put us at a comfortable table in main dining. We sampled the Capital City chicken and Szechuan pork; both dishes were phenomenal and very freshly put together; you could taste each individual ingredient and the combination of them along with the delicate, delicious sauces- perfect.  White and brown steamed rice as sides.  Dishes were Spiced just right.  Will eat here again, likely!, on our visit to Montreal.

Update! Take out last night including hot & sour soup, wonton soup, ravioli dumplings and beef satay stir fry; STILL five star, delicious, super hot & fresh take out - perfectly executed, such great flavors and attention to detail. They knew us immediately on second sight our waiter and the hostess giving us a friendly "hello"! Nice place.
