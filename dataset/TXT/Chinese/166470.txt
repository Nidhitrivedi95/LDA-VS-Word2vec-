VC-S7T5aSOP9HTKu_TNHKA Probably a 2.5, but the BF likes this place so I'll round it up to a 3 star.

Came here a few weeks ago around 9:50pm. Didn't know they closed at 10pm. So spend 5 mins looking at menu and got take-out instead. Nice enough of them to still take our orders cause some places have last call 10-15 mins before closing. Got a Cantonese Chow Mein & 2 Baked Rice dishes with 2 milk teas (came with the rice dishes). The Chow Mein was average. I did not like the baked rice dishes. The fried rice underneath looked like they mixed regular rice with bits of scrambled slightly burnt eggs.

Came back just after 2pm on a Monday for late lunch before doing some grocery shopping at T&T. Surprised to learn that their "afternoon tea" starts at 2pm. BF got the Beef Noodle Soup ($5.95). I got the Club Sandwich ($6.95). Also got a French Toast with Peanut Butter Filling ($4.95) to share. All came with a drink, so got 3 hk milk teas.

Didn't like the noodles they used in the beef noodle soup. BF also found one piece of pork instead of beef in the soup, so they cook everything in the same broth? The club sandwich was ok. I like my bread more toasted usually though. It was filling. I ate 3 and gave the BF the last one so I would still have room for French toast, which was also ok. Just a slight bit too oily though.  

Service is average. Food came out pretty fast, but is really hit or miss. Lots of their menu items come with a drink though, and prices are decent. Afternoon tea starting at 2pm is good so when I want a late lunch, I can get my "afternoon tea" items without having to wait until 2:30/3pm to cheap out on the drink. Always need to have my hk milk tea when I come to a hk style café. Might come back when I do some grocery shopping in the area.
