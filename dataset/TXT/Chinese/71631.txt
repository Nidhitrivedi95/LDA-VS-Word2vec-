fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A We were looking for a quick dinner before the Penn & Teller show in Vegas. We enjoy Chinese food and thought it would be a good fit, being the performance was in the Rio. I can't say it is a 4 but a 3 1/2, yes. The restaurant wasn't busy or crowed and thought we would be in and out, in no time. Our server was very friendly and helpful in navigating us through the menu. The food was prepared quickly as we had hoped. Chicken and Broccoli is my go to, when I am not sure about the menu. It was good, not great, it lacked flavor and taste. The meal was served hot. The price of our dinners were very reasonable. I wouldn't say I would return, but I am not going to say it's a place you shouldn't try.
