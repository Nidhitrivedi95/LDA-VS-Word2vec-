CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw So I went to Ku Noodle today after finding out that they make Beef Bao Buns. I have been wanting and craving Bao ever since I heard it mentioned in the *cough* prematurely canceled *cough* tv show Firefly when Saffron makes Bao for Captain Malcolm Reynolds.  It's a very modern and almost futuristic restaurant that ironically actually looks like it could be in an episode of Firefly as a restaurant. The prices are cheap for the strip and I was actually surprised that I didn't pay that much. The Bao, drinks, and tea cost me all together 17 dollars which is pretty cheap consider I may spend 50 bucks for that at a place like Tao. The servings were actually pretty large considering that the Beef Bao is actually only an appetizer. It's about the size of a large sandwich and it's very and I mean very filling. The beef was tender and the Bao was extremely flavorful and the Bao itself was a 10 dollar item so really not that pricey.  The tea was delicious and I mean it was to die for. The tea needed no sugar or honey because it was so fresh and flavorful on it's own. It tasted like it was just picked 5 minutes ago. I love this restaurant and while it's more expensive than other Asian restaurants it's a decent enough price that I would come back for the Bao alone and maybe to try another dish like the duck or the noodle dishes. It's a great restaurant and the service was phenomenal. I went around 1pm and it actually was really quiet, there were only two groups in the restaurant; a couple and two ladies that had just arrived and were getting ready to check in. It was a very nice restaurant and whenever Serenity lands at the SLS again i'll eat here again.
