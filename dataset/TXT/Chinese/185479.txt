y_3Csg19MnwCX8M_aMgMHA i wish yelp lets you give half stars cause i would technically rate it 2.5/5

went to this place for some late dinner with my mom and dad. i have ate from here multiple times and honestly im not A HUGE fan. my dad loves it though and he's close with the owner. 

**fun fact: my dad made the chairs and seating booths (the fabric that was used for the booths could've been better though in my opinion LOOL SORRY DAD) 

so anyways this place was supposedly the BEST asian restaurant or whatever in 2013 or something and they even have this laminated newsletter to claim that. they also claim to use NO msg which lets be honest here that's pretty much a bunch of lies because one, i can taste it and two, it's quite hard to find places that don't use msg nowadays 

food is nothing special really...some are too strong in flavour and some lack it. what i do recommend is the shrimp wonton egg noodles and the oyster egg pancake (don't remember what it's called) YALL NEED TO DIP IT INTO THE SAUCE. quite salty but gives it this interesting taste 

but yeah, side note, they give you complimentary soup and dessert which is cool
