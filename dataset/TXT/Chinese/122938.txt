OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Service was really good here! We got a table (10 people) in the secluded area and they did not ignore us at all! 

Their duck and shu mai (I hope I spelled it right) are bombbb!!! I also tried their bbq prok buns (drools) sooo good! Will definitely come back when around vegas!
