W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ A little bit expensive, and when the head waiter says they are not meals he is not kidding, the chicken breast skewers only had 5 bites the size of quarters all on one skewer.

Portions are the smallest I have ever seen, but the tastes are mind blowing

Would only give 2 stars but our waiter gets one all on his own, dude was Very good at his job!
