HgL6gGEGoAUBKGrT6BXU4Q I've wanted to try this place for a while!  I loved Patois... Since it was a late working night in the office I decide to splurge.  $28 got me food to my office, fire roasted chicken and half a cup of soup (basically two shots of soup since it has spilled during the delivery).

The chicken and rice was very tasty,  cold from the delivery but I can't complain given it was terribly cold out.  I do suggest better takeaway packaging--cold food and half a cup of soup for $28 is a bit much...

I had no expectations of how the meal was going to taste but it was definitely tasty; the soya egg which I ordered an extra one was good but too salty IMO.  What was left of the soup--very yummy, wished I had more!  Delivery was definitely not worth it but it did give me a taste that will send me to Jackpot Rice in person
