eLExQY6_KOYaayapWNp5IQ If you love Peking duck, you should definitely give this place a try!

Pros:
Very good Peking duck
Plenty of seats

Cons:
Other dishes just average

We spotted this place 2 weeks before Chinese New Years and thought right away we should try it out.  The place is really big with plenty of seats and was near by for us as well.  

We of course ordered the Peking duck.  A stir fried broccoli and shanghai thick noodle were ordered as well because those are some of out little one's favourites.  The dishes came out lightning fast.  It wasn't too busy at the time we ordered but it was still very quick.  The Peking duck would come a couple of minutes later.

The Peking duck here is nothing short of amazing.  It was one of the better ones I've had in the city for sure.  It's not as fancy looking as some other places, but it makes up for it with it's taste.  I have to commend whoever roasted this duck as he or she definitely knew what she was doing.  The wrappers here are much thinner than other Peking duck restaurants.  I think this is a better thing as you really taste more of the duck and fillings with every bite.  Just be sure you're using only one wrapper and not any more before you start.

The other dishes were just average and nothing to write home about.  I don't have too many qualms about that since their specialty was done perfectly.  You're going to be coming here for the Peking duck and they do an amazing one here.  

This is definitely going to be one of my go to's from now on for Peking duck.  It might be a little bit pricier than what I'm used to but it's well worth it if you ask me.  My only regret of the night was not knowing Johnny L was there at the same time I was.  LOL
