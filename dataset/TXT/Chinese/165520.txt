It only gets 3 stars from me because they don't have the option for combos. When I go to a chinese restuarant I want a plate with like 3 things that I like on it. But this is not an option here. Which is sad, because I LOVE ALMOND CHICKEN, and my husband HATES it. So I never get almond chicken because you have to share all the food. Each dish is a large plate that you share among the table. If they would let me make a combo, they'd get at least 4 stars from me.
