xgZMO4BHn1TCn7hZ62SaiA I absolutely love this place!  I am a huge fan of their quick fast and efficient delivery service.  

I usually run the Sesame Chicken with fried rice.  Because there is a delivery minimum, I usually get two smalls. I like that the Sesame Chicken comes with ample sauce and the chicken is usually cooked to my liking.  Although you might be well served to ask for the chicken cooked crispy as my buddy usually does.  The fried rice is always consistent and is the perfect complement to the sweet chicken.  Though I've tasted the egg roll many times, I am not a fan, not because there's anything wrong with them, just because I don't like egg rolls in general.  

The delivery component is usually pretty straight as well.  The delivery guy is usually there with my food pipping hot within 10 min of ordering.  There have some serious Jimmy John's speed going on with their delivery.  The delivery driver has always been friendly and polite.  

So why am I not giving fortune cookie 5 stars?  The answer is simple, I can't award Fortune Cookie 5 stars, because I've been in the actual establishment within the past month and they had a sanitation rating of 87.  Its low and it scares me.  

However, that should tell you how good I think there food is - I gladly continue to frequent this establishment despite this stomach quivering low  sanitation rating.
