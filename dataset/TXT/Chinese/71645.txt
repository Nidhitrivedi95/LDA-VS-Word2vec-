fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A Came here since we were at the Rio. I was surprisingly pleased with the decent quality of the dim sum though not as good and little pricier than what you can get from San Gabriel Valley in LA. BUT, I prefer this over a buffet. It was a good option in the hotel.
They charge $1pp for tea.
Enjoyed the egg tarts (flaky crust, good flavor), fresh crunchy Chinese broccoli w oyster sauce, shrimp rice noodles, dumpling w shrimp and veggies, sweet pork bun (tasted wine)
Just OK- shu mai.
