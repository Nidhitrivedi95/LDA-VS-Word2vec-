TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA I've passed this place for years and years and always appreciated the old-school appearance--similar to all of those Chinese places I grew up with. The other day we finally got around to trying it.

I was not expecting genuine Chinese food, on the contrary, I was expecting old-school, Chinese-American stuff like chop-suey. In that, I was not disappointed. With a couple of exceptions, their menu could have come out of a Chinese restaurant in the Midwest circa 1970. 

I was, however, disappointed with the food, sadly. This is one of those places I was anxious to like--a real throwback and a survivor. But truly, the food was not good. In fact, my egg foo young tasted a little spoiled. I threw it away and ate the friend won tons they gave us. The rest of the food, according to my family, was not that bad, but nothing great. Even the spicy dishes tasted rather bland. 

I do love the look of the place, and the service was friendly and efficient. I hate to give it a two star review, but I can't muster any more than that right now.
