I wouldn't say it's the best out there but it's definitely convenient to have down the street. The plus side is they deliver!  Even though they're so close to home, sometimes you just don't feel like leaving the house especially with young children. They usually give you a time frame on delivery and it's usually around the time they say. They have family dinner specials and they're pretty lenient with mix and matching certain items on the menu. I think they're also under new management since their name changed.
