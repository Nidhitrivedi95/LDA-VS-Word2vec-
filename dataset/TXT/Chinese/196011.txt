zkU-WMio8g6dpRJ2Y2xqvQ Third time here, prices are high compared to some Scarborough restaurants. We came at 1pm on a Sunday so no early bird pricing, but even so, the bill came to $18/person for 6 ppl. 

Although pricey, the quality of the food shines through each dish. Anything that uses puff pastry is so fluffy - you can definitely taste the butter.

The XO turnip cakes are nicely pan-fried, but I wouldn't say it's better than the fried turnip cakes dish from Congee Queen.

When I ordered the pan-fried onion cake "tainam style," I expected a green onion pancake, but it was a onion wrapped pastry type dumpling. Not what I expected. 

The fried dishes aren't too oily and are still crispy after a while, and the har gow and siu mai are huge!

Worth a visit if you want to try a new dim sum place!
