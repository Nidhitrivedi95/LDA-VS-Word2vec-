bzMO8LJmJtgo3KuyWGKUxA Grab a flavourful meal for under $12 per person with tax and tip. You really can't go wrong. The broth is always flavourful and the noodles are fresh. The serving size is large - I can split one noodle soup with an appetizer with a gf or my mom and we're both satisfied. Big eaters will enjoy the value here. As it is a casual dining spot in Chinatown, please don't go in expecting white glove service. They're prompt (read: efficient) and that's about it - they won't be engaging with you in banter... much like every other place on Spadina.
