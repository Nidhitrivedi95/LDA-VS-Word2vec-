SLH_6FIjptg5BEJbYNld6w Oja is pretty much my go to sushi restaurant. I basically have the same thing when I go. Their bento boxes are great. I usually get the bento box, dynamite tempura, and an egg drop soup. I go there as it's consistent almost every time I go there. I've been going there for about 3 years faithfully now. Overall, it's a pretty alright place.
