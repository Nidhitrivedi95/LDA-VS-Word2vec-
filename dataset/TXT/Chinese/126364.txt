P_8hs6FRRn8IVBg5G6c0rg It's been a while since I ate here but the food left a lasting impression... and NOT of the good kind... I don't remember what I had now but the food was MSG'tastic and left me super thirsty the rest of the evening and complimented me with slightly puffy eyes when I woke up the next day. Agree with Jason, will do in a pinch.. but not a fan.
