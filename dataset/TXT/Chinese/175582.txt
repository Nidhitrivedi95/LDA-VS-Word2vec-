wJnhUJCOYkncLPZAwaMffA I came to Room 112 with a colleague for drinks and an early dinner. She said she was craving sushi and after doing some Yelp searching, this is where we ended up. All I can say is it was a very good choice. We started with chicken lettuce wraps and finished with four different sushi rolls. All of it was just excellent. Add in that the service was great and the fact that I could actually taste gin in my G&T and just wow!

Best sushi in Uptown?  Hard to imagine that it's not.
