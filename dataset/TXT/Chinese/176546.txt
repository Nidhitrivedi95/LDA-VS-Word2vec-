Wqa1JjkSuviehZ7OedhPeA So native Beijingers don't go to dayali for Beijing duck or anything of that sort, and no wonder why because their ducks don't even stand a chance against regular Chinatown BBQ places. The skin was dry and the meat even a bit hard to chew through. In fact Cantonese restaurants are way better at getting the authenticity right. Frankly the other dishes were the basics a babysitter in china could cook. Maybe it was just our choices. 

The wait was definitely not worth waiting for, kinda felt bad for people waiting outside, hope you've a better time. My friend got a VIP card when it first opened and wanted to get rid of it before our course ended. In Beijing, dayali is a little run down, but all of a sudden it becomes extravagantly decorated in Toronto, honestly not worth going for the facade.
