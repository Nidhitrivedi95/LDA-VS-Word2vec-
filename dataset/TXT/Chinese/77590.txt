Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA Went down to american shooters to check out some ARs and got hungry. so drove to thai style noodle to get some food. the inside is pretty small, maybe seats 20 people max. the food here is super cheap!! a bowl of noodles is about = $6 and a thai ice tea is $1.50ish. i ordered potstickers, a bowl of duck meat noodles and a bowl of bbq pork noodles. the potstickers were really crispy but they put too much of the mayo sauce on top so its like eating a potsticker sushi roll. the duck noodle was ok the broth tasted good not too salty a little dark and cloudy though. the worst was the bbq pork noodles. the pork was dry as hell and the broth had NO taste whatsover. overall for the price everything was OK. i would go back and get something else to try.
