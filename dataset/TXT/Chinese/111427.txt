M9fOuiesoUSaouOqNQ3U2w Maybe I went on the wong day?  I went to Wong's Chinese for the lunch special.  There was only one other couple inside which seemed awkward for the lunch hour?  I ordered the 'House Special Chicken' and although the first few bites were tasty, it had a pungent scent to it that eventually turned me off.  I asked if soda pop were available, but was told that the soda machine hadn't been working for 'a couple weeks'?  A couple weeks?  So, I'm the only person in two weeks to have walked in an asked for soda?  Again, very awkward.  The lunch was reasonably priced, however, I don't think I would return for smelly chicken and no soda.
