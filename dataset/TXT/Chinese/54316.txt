Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg Just had one of my worst restaurant experience in GTA. One of the dishes we ordered was their steamed chicken and the meat was salty that we couldn't swallow. 

When we asked one of the waitresses to come and return the dish, she raised her voice at us and gave us an extremely bad attitude!!! 

I understand it's a busy night when we went and I don't usually expect a 5 star service when we go to a place like this. But having to deal with this kind of rudeness from the service staff was just absolutely unacceptable!
