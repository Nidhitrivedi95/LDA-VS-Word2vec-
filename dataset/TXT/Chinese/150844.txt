SXAXzOwp0I2wiA1V3iMtbg Food was good....well the food that did come
My dad made a large ordered which included 3 orders of Cantonese chow men 
EVERYTHING Expect the chow neon came
And when my dad called and explained the situation the man working there played stupid and said "oh it's in the bag it's in the bag"

It was not.
So they scammed my dad out of $25
Will not be ordering again.
