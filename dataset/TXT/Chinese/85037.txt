HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw I don't really care what anyone says, this is the best Chinese food place I've ever eaten. The menu has a lot to choose from the portions are huge and the prices are super reasonable. Everything is made to order,the flavors are great. Those who say their food is bland must have some serious lack of taste buds. My only gripe is that their service could be a bit better organized. Update :Don't know if they got new cooks or what but lately nothing has been tasting as good as before. I use to come in almost every weekend. It's been a few months. I hope they figure it out :/ 6.2 went back and this place is back on their game!
