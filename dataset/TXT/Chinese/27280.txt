88RkIuXwJeDzfzSu9xsyzw Been to asian legend many times in the past and while their peking duck along with other small side dish were good, they really need to reconsider their noodles menu. I got the Beijing za jiang noodles and it was absolutely terrible. The sauce was extremely bland and watery, the noodles were of poor texture and overall just inaccurate. Please dont order this, me and my friend had one bite each before we gave up.
