1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Decide to give this place a try since the line outside Monta Ramen went crazy long and it was not all that anymore.

The Chicken rice is alright, their porridge was good, big portion and tasted legit.

The high light must be their beef ramen.  The soup is not as bold but since they put different type of spices in it, thats why it is not as bold taste as others but it is definitely good.  The ramen was a bit letdown since i wish they can use thicker noodle but for the price, I am not complaining

Their shrimp wonton is good!!  All shrimp wonton in a bowl for $4.95. Crazy.  I wish we have similiar quality wonton in LA but the last good one shut down years ago.

I think if they can let me beef soup with wonton will be the best match but I don't think they will let me do that.  I will try next time when I go and will give an update.
