YKImxc9VimLbDl2sQN1BBQ It is a sad day when you have to say "goodbye" to an old friend.  My Family and my parents before me have been going to Abacus for over 30 years. They have catered more than one event for us.  Unfortunately since the beginning of the (so far) short year we have gone twice to eat and both times were less than satisfactory.  The food still tastes the same, but the service has fallen to a very low level.  Our food was cold both times because of timing. They brought it while we were still actively eating our soup (too soon) but it was still cold. The young person did not know how to serve the sizzling rice soup as they did not know how to portion the various ingredients in it, especially the shrimps.    The water glasses were filled by touching the side of the pitcher to the glass thus transferring the saliva of the entire room to each person's glass.
