QxngAo1AnfcihXqdk3IA-g my family and i were walking around chinatown and we randomly decided to stop in here. we should have done our research better. the food was not good, the service was inattentive, and the wireless didn't even work.

we had the hot and sour soup, salted squid, spicy lamb stir fry, pea sprouts and mushrooms, and lemon duck.

the soup was incredibly bland, the sauce of the pea sprouts was kind of gelatinous. the lamb was decent, and the salted squid was really good, it was crispy and seasoned perfectly.

the biggest disappointment was the lemon duck, though i think it was probably my fault because it's a risky thing to order. but learn from my mistake and don't get it! the duck is battered and deep fried. the batter is really sweet and tastes like cake batter, and it settled in the crevices of the duck and was dense and not at all like it was even fried. the sauce that came with it was a super sweet, little bit sour gelatinous sauce that nobody touched. it was such an intense way to ruin duck and made me really sad.

the service was even worse. we were rushed to order and then ignored for the most part. had to practically beg to get refills on water and tea. the meal ended up being really expensive too, about eighty dollars for a family of four, after tax and tip. i guess we could have ordered less expensive stuff, but that still feels like a lot for what terrible food it was. learned a lesson with this one.
