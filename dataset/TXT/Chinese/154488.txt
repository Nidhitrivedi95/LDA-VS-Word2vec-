Went here for lunch with my wife and mother-in-law because we were in the mood for Chinese food.  Although it was our first time, it may be our last time as well.  I ordered the Kung Pao chicken which as filled with thick sauce which did blend the chicken and vegetable together, but more like made everything taste the same.  My wife had the eggplant chicken which I think tasted the same as the Kung Pao chicken as well.  Should have called it Kung Pao eggplant chicken.  The dinning room is similar to that of a lodge converted to restaurant.  I did order the sizzling rice soup which was good, but there wasn't enough soup as the rice soaked it all up.  Price was a little high for portion sizes I thought.  Although the owner was very nice and cordial that is the reason I gave this 2 stars.  There is very little authenticity to the restaurant as the ROA is a dismal 10%, ratio of authenticity is #of ethnic patrons/#total patrons.
