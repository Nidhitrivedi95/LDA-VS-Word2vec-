PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ I really enjoyed this place when we went for Shabu Shabu that I gave it four stars. My husband and I went again to use our Living Social deal and decided to try the BBQ.

The BBQ  is the same concept as Shabu Shabu. It's a la carte which I like because I like tasting a little bit of everything. I'm also trying to watch my diet so I take a little bit of meat at a time and make sure I don't overdo it.

We got the pork belly, beef and kalbi ribs. They provide a bunch of different types of sauces to dip your meat in but I didn't need it. The meat was really marinated. So much so that it was too salty for my taste. I had a side of fried rice which was good. 

I ordered boba again and the pearls were undercooked. 

The service is attentive and friendly. I love the prices. For everything we ordered, and I was full, it came out to $28 for dinner and that included two drinks.

Personally I prefer Korean BBQ with all the banchan. If I were to come back again it would be for the Shabu Shabu.
