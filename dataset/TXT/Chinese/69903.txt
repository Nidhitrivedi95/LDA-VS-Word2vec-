f0zHPEwKLf3Aguf_IDemRQ Came here for lunch. I was excited to eat some zha jiang mian because I'm beijingnese and I've been craving it. On the menu it claimed to have been cooked from a Beijing chef but NOOOO... It was the most unauthentic jajung noodle (idk what the name was on the menu) I've ever ate. Look my picture and you will see that there is no soybean paste! <U+9171> (Jiang) the second letter in the name of the dish means sauce/paste but where was it?? Definitely not ordering that again. On the bright side it came with a variety of veggies but kind of made the dish more flavour less.

My friend got a pai gu fan which is like pork ribs on rice. The portion was so small and the supposedly "lunch combo" for 14.99 was a rip off. We ordered friend chicken wings and mango fresh bubble tea which on our bill which was (+$2 each). Two piece of chicken wings and a very thin glass of bubble tea. Another order was guan gong noodles which is a beef noodle soup. It was okay but it seemed to look different than the pictures other ppl posted. 

I am very unimpressed with their food... Service was okay though.
