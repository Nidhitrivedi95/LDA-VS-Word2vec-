9q0qW2sbI147hAaUVfVUqQ Dim sum is quite good and great value during afternoon tea at 2-4.  Food quality is quite good and the eating environment is quite nice.  Lots of selection and food is nicely presented.  A little slow in removing my finished dim sum dishes....maybe we ordered too much and ate too quick :).  But overall a good experience.
