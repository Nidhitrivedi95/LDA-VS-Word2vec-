K4-J1A_ZIzG2yNkee0KOaA I stop by here every year when I'm on vacation for my all- time favorite lemon iced tea drink.  Overall the food is good, way better than Chicago style. But compared to other Toronto places, the dishes is more saucy/heavy, but I'm fine with that. 

Tiger shrimp in leaf rice - Huge shrimp and very tasty baked rice

Pork Belly meatloaf - SOO fatty, but soo good and tasty over rice 

Sizzling eggplant with stuffed shrimp - Giant eggplant that comes out sizzling with sauce. Very juicy and crispy. (i get this every year I go to toronto)

French beef tenderloin - beef was soo tender and well seasoned
