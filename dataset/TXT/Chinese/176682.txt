WqXrmUVy5Ay3Scn4GPM9Ug Just finished dinner at The Borough, a pub style gastro pup focused on local ingredients. Had an excellent evening starting with drinks at the bar while waiting for a table. Started with some mini Yorkshire puddings; beef was perfectly done, nice touch of horseradish and the arugula and extra pea shoots added a lovely freshness.  Our party of four enjoyed our individual mains; rainbow trout (daily special), Cornish hen, beef burger, and I had the porchetta special which had wonderfully crispy skin and was perfectly cooked. My sides of seasonal veg and new potatoes were excellent.  Shared their sticky toffee pudding to finish (they ran out of the deep fried apple pie); it was really good, but if pressed I would say it could use a little more toffee to pudding ratio.  All in all an excellent evening with friendly and attentive service. A welcome addition to East Danforth, and I look forward to many more meals here.
