XUDOc980cjB0PZvVS-T6Eg I've been going to this place since they opened (the owners had a restaurant nearby before they moved to this location--I liked their other restaurant, too.) I often order sushi here, it's always very fresh. They have quite a few selections of sushi, but we usually order the spicy tuna roll or rainbow roll. Both are very good. My current favorite is their Chirashi--thick slices of fresh tuna (I get the big eye tuna) over either brown or white rice. Heavenly! Their Chinese dishes are some of the best Chinese food I've had anywhere. The beef with broccoli is amazing: tender strips of melt-in-your-mouth beef with just enough sauce to flavor the dish but not overwhelm it. The Peking Duck might be the best choice on the menu. The skin is crispy, and although it's very moist it's not a bit greasy. 

I hosted a Chinese New Year dinner for my daughter's six friends who are exchange students from China. I ordered take-out from Jimmy Wan's. They each chose food from the menu and we brought it to the house. They loved it (and no, they weren't just being polite--they are willing to diplomatically share their opinions about Chinese restaurants). If six Chinese teenagers approve of the food, it must be good!
