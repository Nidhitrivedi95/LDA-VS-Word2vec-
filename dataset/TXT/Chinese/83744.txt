HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ Quick service, good quality, and inexpensive. I stopped in this place my first night here. The staff was friendly and ready to serve me even though they were closing.

The dinner serving sizes were HUGE and plenty for 2 people. The sushi was yummy too and fresh. They have plenty of options for vegans... with edamame, vegetable sushi rolls, etc. and fairly well priced. 

I ate miso soup and the ACA roll with asparagus, cucumber and avocado. The ACA roll was so crisp and fresh and the miso soup had a lot of seaweed in it so I was happy. They make your sushi order right in front of you, which I like because you know what they are using. Being a germ freak, I was comforted when I saw them wearing gloves and cleaning the surface before and after making each roll.  

I placed an order to-go and it was ready in less than 10 minutes. Oh! And don't forget- make sure to grab a take out menu for coupons!
