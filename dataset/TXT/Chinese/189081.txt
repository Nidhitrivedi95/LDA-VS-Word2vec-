yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Ever since their new interior design, their food has improved! I have tried their chop suey veggies, really greeeasyyyy. chicken vermicelli is bomb. well-done meat pho.. good. BUT Now that I have been red meat free for couple months, I tried PKL's chicken soup (only comes in large, so share) ..it was delicious! i don't even know how to describe it, maybe that i like it more than their pho, it was that good! so glad i found a new fave item here! 

It doesn't take long to get seated. They have a billion workers so your water will get filled and food comes out FAST!
