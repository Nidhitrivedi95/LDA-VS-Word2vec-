An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg As a regular customer at Deer Garden Signature, I come here two to three days a week.  I just love their Malay Laksa Soup with RICE Noodles. Some people may find it too spicy. But i just love it.  

For a price of $10.75 you get noodles and two choices of toppings. I usually just choose double quantities of seasoned pork mushroom balls. It also comes with a drink. A cold drink is extra.  Their side orders that i would recommend are pan fried beef tongue and pan fried sausage slices with honey glaze.  I took away a star because of their service and seating policy.  If you go there alone. They will put you at a two seat table which can be very tight. If someone wants to go in or move out their ass will swing by your table. 

Oh. I almost forgot. If u like spicy you must ask for their XO sauce. It is High quality compared to other restaurants.
