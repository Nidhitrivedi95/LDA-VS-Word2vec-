The skinny
I found this place about 8-9 years ago and have been a fan this place since, it has the best orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp I have ever had. Now I have never actually sat and ate here but I always take my order to go or delivery which is insane how far they go. The orange chicken has plenty of sauce but the chicken is always crispy if you get the combo plate they will add 2 crab puffs egg roll and rice and noodles which are also to die for if you go after 5pm and spend 15$+ they will throw in free crab puffs with coupon and coupon is in menu so just pick one up. The girls are always sweet in front area and are always so quick. 
The bad 
Once the delivery driver was pretty aggressive with the tip he made sure to let me know twice where the tip line was on my check even after I told him I had cash for tip. Another time they got my order wrong and did not give me combo plate but manager made it up by offering free crab puffs next time which I didn't take advantage of as I always use that coupon but even then I wasn't too bummed out this place rocks. They also have gone on month long vacations and have closed for that long which drove us insane lol.
Overall this place is one of my favorite spots and they maybe yours too if you give them a shot.
