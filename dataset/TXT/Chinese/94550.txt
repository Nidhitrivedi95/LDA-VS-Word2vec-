jenDHueIvOhpB-0ivdiRoQ Decided to give this place a shot after we got sick of the two other places in Anthem that are semi good. We went early, around 5:30 and it wasn't too crowded. But soon after we ordered it filled up and so did takeouts. Had the spring rolls which were the size of burritos and so good. A bit of mint really made the difference. The sesame chicken and low mien were great. Entries are big enough to share and served family style. Thought get two if you are very hungry or want leftovers. Food did not taste like typical Chinese and I didn't feel like crap an hr later. Service was a little odd, sounded like they were working some kinks out. But overall worth going back. I only wish their kids drink options were a little better. No milk (ran out).  But not the end of the world. 
Worth going to!!
