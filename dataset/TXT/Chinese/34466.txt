aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ Not normally a place I'd go to, but I was with very unadventurous family members. 

I'll  start off with saying that the service was good and that was about the only redeeming quality.

I ordered the Stir-Fried seafood dish. The seafood and vegetables seemed steamed rather than friend and were dripping in a sauce (the menu said just a touch) that barely had any flavour. 

So for the first time in a long time I asked for the meal to take home, not because I was full but because it was so awful. I had to tip the bowl onto the plate about three times in order to get rid of the "touch" of sauce. I plan to refry it at home with some much needed spices in order to actually create something palatable.
