egxK8E9T6MWLxJyD_iCIVQ They used to be soooo good.... The last couple of times I been here What happened?? Prices are a little high but they used to compensate it with good fresh tasting general tso's... It always Saugy... Still ate it tho obviously... But probably will choose another place. They kinda lost me for now.
