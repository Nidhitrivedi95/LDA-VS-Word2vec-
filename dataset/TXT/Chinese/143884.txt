rsQAS-k7GldsJm7UAtVyYA Pho Con Bo is a Vietnamese restaurant located in a plaza on the Southwest corner of Jane and Wilson. It's kind of hidden within the plaza but once you see the Blue Sky Supermarket, you are in the right area.

Once you enter, it's your typical Vietnamese restaurant in terms of decor and set up. You write what you want from the menu onto an ordering slip and someone comes to pick up the ordering slip and when the food is ready, someone delivers the food to your table.

i ordered a medium Pho Dac Biet ($6.75 plus tax) and a small order of cha gio which are deep fried spring rolls ($3.75 plus tax).

The pho was pretty good, definitely above average and authentic Vietnamese pho. Noodles were cooked right, quality of meat wasn't too good but the broth was pretty good even though it was slightly heavy handed with the msg. The deep fried spring rolls were decent, good filling but the outside could have been slightly crispier.

My rating is actually a 3.5 out of 5. The food is definitely above average and authentic Vietnamese food and the prices are really reasonable. In Toronto, there is a slew of Vietnamese restaurants that aren't too good but Pho Con Bo even though imo isn't one of the top Vietnamese restaurants, it's definitely better than most.
