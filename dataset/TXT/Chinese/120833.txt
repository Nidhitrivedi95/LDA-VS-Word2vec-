O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw Rol San is absolute mayham on a Sunday at noon. Ladies wielding bamboo steamers navigate through the tables and the hungry patrons standing and waiting for tables. Standing, in the middle of the restaurant. Really. 

The SO and I managed to score a table after a 20 min or so wait. 

We sampled shrimp dumplings, some shrimp and pork, the eggplant with shrimp paste, assorted veggie dumplings, the steamed egg custard and bean curd, sticky rice, fried pork dumplings, tofu with shrimp, squid tentacles and tea. To be honest I was really disappointed that we did not go to Markham. The dim sum was really "meh" - with the veggie options being particularly sub par. The squid tentacles were the standout.  Food came fast, but it was also on the pricier side. I was full, definitely, but not really impressed. 

And GOD I hate plastic table covers. If you are stuck downtown and need your fix, its alright. Not at all worth the wait however.
