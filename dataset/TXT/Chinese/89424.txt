I7eqTdTmRTWYwF9HNZAHxw Good! I wouldn't say the best place but it's definitely solid. Pretty pricey though. I may be forced to go somewhere else based on price alone.


*** Update: the last few orders have been pretty bad. Their chow mein is inconsistent. Last order had way too much sauce and drowned everything else. General Tao's was a tiny portion, they are stingy on the rice and the Kung Pao was terrible. No flavor. Spent almost $50 on sub-par food and didn't even have left overs. Time to find a new place.
