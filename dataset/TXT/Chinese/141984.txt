rIeXMt92PLNjZbemWKRXcA I ordered delivery and was pleased to get the food fairly quickly. Orange chicken, Honey Walnut Shrimp, potstickers, dumplings and spicy wontons. Kind of a generic order to feel the place out. When the food came it was hot and everything was really good, especially the Honey Walnut Shrimp and the potstickers. I also was pleased with the price which was a little less than the place that I usually order. I gave 4 stars because we didn't receive very much sauce and I don't know why but I was expecting rice with the entrees  ( probably because the other place that I order from has rice with the entrees and fortune cookies ). I will make the necessary adjustments before I order next time.
