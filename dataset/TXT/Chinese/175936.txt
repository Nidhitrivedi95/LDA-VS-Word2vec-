wlUiXdH1Cfj4do5kNxrOtw We've been here several times for lunch but had dinner there last night. We've liked the place in the past but were disappointed this time around. The hot and sour soup was fantastic, with just the right amount of tartness, but our entrees (black pepper chicken and diced chicken in hoisin sauce) were only so-so; the latter dish was notably bland. Our server seemed to find it difficult to manage a smile on her face or in her voice, which made us feel unwelcome. We had heard from a friend that the place has gone downhill, and I'm afraid she may have been right. Our search goes on for an East Side Chinese restaurant that rivals our old favorite in Lakewood, Szechwan Garden.
