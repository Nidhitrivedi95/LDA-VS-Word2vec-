IoUtQRoXPuDcAsfp-Q7CLQ Love this place. Portions are big and pricea are cheap. I always get their sweet and sour chicken which always comes out super hot ans fresh. The sauce is always on point with a good mixture and of sweet and sour. There are also alot of sweet peppers and pinapple too. It comes with either cold soy milk, chinese soup, or cold sweet Chrysanthemum tea. Chrysanthemum tea is great for skin cleansing! My sweet and sour chicken is $6.75 + tax. This place is located in the food court and gets busy during their peak hours during lunch and dinner.
