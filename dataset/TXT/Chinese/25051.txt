75SBuDApJU5ca9tGC1Pw3Q I've been to Phoenix a couple of times, but always the location on Woodbine. this is the first time coming to this location, and was surprised to see how nice the decor here is! 

Hainanese Chicken Rice: 
This is probably their most popular dish. The chicken is one of the best I've had. Not only is it lean and tender, the meat is deboned for you! Definitely a bonus. Can't go wrong with this one.

Ying Yang Pork Chop Baked Rice with Cheese:
This dish probably tastes exactly like it sounds and looks. The concept of incorporating the ying yang sauce on pork chop rice was interesting, but I don't think it matched well at all with the cheese. The sauce was too sour in my opinion, and it almost made the cheese taste like it had gone a little off. Definitely wouldn't be a dish I would get again.

Crab Roe Seafood Fried Rice:
This dish was probably my favourite. We actually ordered this because my cousin's Ashley and Hana (6 and 8 year old girls) came here a while back and said it was the best thing they've ever had. So obviously it was something I needed to try. In a nutshell, it's a glorified seafood fried rice made with lots of teriyaki sauce, topped with crab roes for extra texture. I liked it, it came together well. I now declare this dish both adult and child approved. :)

In general, the food was quite good. I'd say the portions are a little small compared to typical chinese places, but definitely enough. Apparently the ice cream crepes here are also very good, so I anticipate coming back here next time to try!
