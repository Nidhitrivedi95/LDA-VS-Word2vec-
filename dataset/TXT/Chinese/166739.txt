vehk1EdzfzlkWjlBoZumag Place is closed with sign on the door saying sub landlord has taken possession of property for non payment of rent!

Stinks too as I was looking forward to going after a report from my son who went for dinner a few weeks back. Now, even if they get it together, it would make me nervous about going if they reopen. If they're skimping on the rent, are they skimping on other things too?
