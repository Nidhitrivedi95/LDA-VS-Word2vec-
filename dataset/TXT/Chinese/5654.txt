0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA My boyfriend and I love trying new restaurants and especially something that is far from classic American cuisine.  The first time coming into Cyclo, we were hooked.  Justina is there every time that we come to eat and she makes sure to go to each table to either take the order personally or just chat with the table and make sure every one is happy.  I recommend going and letting her "surprise you".  We have yet to actually order, everytime we go she picks our meal and I have yet to have the same thing twice.  Everything is AMAZING.  Absolutely Mouth watering.  Cyclo is BYOB so be sure to bring your favorite wine or beer and enjoy the best vietnamese cusine you have ever tasted!
All the staff is attentive and friendly , the artwork is local and beautiful and the feel of the space is inviting, friendly and just happy.

I give it 10 stars!
