ZL9sk7Imc42BNRhcjgnqPw Ownership/management changed a while back.  Food not as good as it once was.

The wait staff are pretty good, and as others say - service is very FAST! 

Nothing to go out of your way for, but one of the better Chinese options in the area.

Some dishes are far too oily (and I hate to think what type of oil they use).  Would be great if they would address this issue.
