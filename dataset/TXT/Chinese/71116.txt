fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ We were itching for some Chinese food and had never eaten at the Wynn, so we decided to try Wing Lei. Our meal was great! We had spareribs and potstickers for an appetizer. Everything is served family style, so for entrees, we ordered Kung pao chicken, general Tao's chicken and Mongolian beef, along with veggie fried rice and chow mein. Everything was delicious, although I didn't love the Mongolian beef, but that's just me. The general Tao's was fried but very light.

This is a good place if you are looking for a bit pricier Chinese in Vegas. Also an excuse to check out the Wynn, which is beautiful!
