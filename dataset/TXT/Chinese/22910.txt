6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ Good, solid Asian fare.   We were there at the tail end of lunch time on a Sunday so while our service was excellent we may not be the best data point since the place was almost empty.   Food was delicious though and the lunch specials (~$9 for soup, egg roll and the entrée with rice) might have been the best deal of our entire stay.  

I noticed they were doing a ton of takeout orders - this struck me as odd.  Where do you take your takeout food to when you're in a Vegas resort?  You're not allowed to bring food in the pool so where else?  Your room?  Weird...
