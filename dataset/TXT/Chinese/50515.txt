ceuvH6NpDhpT1p4q1w93pA A solid Chinese restaurant with reasonable prices. Not a fancy place, especially compared to its neighbor Ichban. OH has an eclectic menu that serves both American-Chinese food and authentic Chinese food. Again, my review only apply to authentic items. It might be difficult to tell what the authentic stuff is, as they mix all items in their menu. I suggest you ask the servers before you make your orders (their English is not perfect, though). 

The highlight of Oriental House is everything in their Dim Sum section, a new addition to the menu after the restaurant changed owner in 2013. The steam pork bao or pork-crab bao is the best in town, and nowhere you can find real Chive Boxes (highly recommend) in a 100-mile radius. One of their chefs come from Norther Chinese city of Tianjin, which is know for flour-made cuisines like dumpling and baozi/bao. So they get some real stuff here.  

My favorite thing is their "weekend breakfast" during Sat-Sun 10a-2p. You will get a chance to explore a real authentic Chinese breakfast. Make sure you order the hot soy milk. 

Beyond their Dim Sum and breakfast, their food is good and authentic, but just average compared to other Chinese restaurant in town. Thus, 4 stars.
