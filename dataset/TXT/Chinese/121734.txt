I cannot speak for items other than the orange chicken, all the sides/appetizers, and the soups. So if you're a person that likes honey walnut shrimp, I can't say I would ever have it and if it's good or not.

I'm super picky on my Chinese because I often get super sick when I have it, I never have that problem here.

This is an EXTREMELY good lunch spot or typical chinese food takeout. If you're looking for a fancy place that you can instagram this isn't it, I think the $15 bill for 2 people is a good indicator that this isn't that type of place.
