lv3h7WwuxPyJNLTeWeL5LQ Came here today for dim sum. I haven't been since last August because the food wasn't so good and the service was none existent, we couldn't get anybody to refill our tea pots. Today's food was all ok. We arrived at 10.45 am and the place wasn't too full. If you put your order sheet in before 11.15 am then all S, M & L dim sum are priced at $2.50. There are a few carts that float around. There was the congee cart and a couple of others with egg tarts, fried stuffed peppers etc. We ended up chatting for ages and I wanted to get some take out for my kids.  So I asked the waiter to take down my dim sum order. He said that because it was after 1.30 pm, all S, M & L dim sum dishes were priced at $2.50 again. But if I wanted the kitchen to pack it up, I would be charged the regular price. So he told me to just put in another dim sum order sheet, let the food come to the table, and then to pack it myself, to get the afternoon tea price. He said that he was trying to save my money. I thought that was good of him but that's a really stupid rule. 
Overall, the service has improved a lot too and the food is not bad for $2.50. It got quite packed for the afternoon special but because it's such a big place with lots and lots of tables, you shouldn't have to wait for a table..
