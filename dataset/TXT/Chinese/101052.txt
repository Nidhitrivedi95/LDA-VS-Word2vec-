K4-J1A_ZIzG2yNkee0KOaA I am here nearly every week for the happy hour special.  This is the only HK Style Cafe that allows you to pick any drink on the menu during happy hour for no extra charge!  That's really amazing since I enjoy ordering cold drinks.  Most HK Style Cafes charge a dollar or more for cold drinks.  Below in the photo is what I get every time: The Shredded Duck with Rice Noodle in Soup (23 on the menu, that's how often I get this!) and the Black Jello Drink with Ice Cream.  Yum.  

I've also been here for dinner and the food is pretty good.  I have no complaints.  For the price and quality, I will keep coming back here.
