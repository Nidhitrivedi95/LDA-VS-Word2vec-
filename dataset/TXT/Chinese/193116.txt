ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Addiction happens. 5/5 people become addicted to the banana fritters served here. You can't quit them. They are so hot, yummy, so sought after, and perfect that they should be the new bitcoins of foodie culture.

Many have claimed cleverness, to be the best, world-famous, and yet they deceive me. Lies. How dare they.

But here, there is truth. There is yummy. Every. Where. 

Grapefruit lemongrass soda - genius
Spaghetti and meatballs - fun, fresh, smokey grill goodness with exploding flavor tomatoes
Tempura pea ramen - light, refreshing, delicious
Banana fritters - they are really the best freakin malasadas humbly under the disguise of "fritters"

If you've eaten too much and decide to skip dessert, then you are not worthy.
