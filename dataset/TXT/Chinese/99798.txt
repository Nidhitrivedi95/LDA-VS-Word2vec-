JWK6s12oq4gntsCCxOkMOg Seriously tasty Chinese!!!! Our hotel concierge recommended checking this charming restaurant out... we liked it so much we came back a second night. You have to order the dumpling chicken in peanut sauce. It's a tiny bit spicy but each bite gets better than the one before!
Ask for Tony as your server.. he is extremely fun and upbeat. 
We can't wait to come back!!!
