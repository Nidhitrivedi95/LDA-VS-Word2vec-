Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ I came here with a group of 7 people for dim sum. We were the first people here and they seated us horribly. The carts of dim sum was neglecting my half of the restaurant and I waited 30 mins and we only got 7 plates. The carts would either go right past us or they would completely dodge our direction. And when my friend kept trying to wave them down, they would not look! SO DISRESPECTFUL! We even informed our waitress and they by passed us again. That was the last straw and we left. This is my first time where I never tipped. My group was extremely pissed off. This place needs to GET IT TOGETHER .
