kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA Completely overrated! Trust me I wanted to like it so much, but it was the biggest let down of our whole Vegas trip! 

The reason I'm even giving two stars is for the friendly waiter George and the great service from the busboys! My meal ended up being close to $100 alone and was well....in one word...BLAH! We had a table of 5 in for a bachelorette party and were very excited for the meal! 

I ordered the egg and scallion fried rice which had zero flavor! I had to ask for sesame seeds and soy sauce so I could make it the way it should have been prepared and have some flavor! I also ordered the sweet and spicy scallops which were tasty, however the scallops were almost raw! Not seared and limp very big letdown considering the cost of the dish and the caliber of the restaurant! 

The dessert is where it really put the final nail in the coffin! Per the recommendation of the waiter we ordered the most popular dessert which was the mousse, and it was terrible! It was as if it had been prepared the day prior and stuck in a fridge. He gladly took it off the bill and apologized for the issue. 

I would not recommend this restaurant in the least bit! I wish I had a better review to write because I can see other people have enjoyed it! The hype is really not worth it here!
