D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw It's a Malaysian restaurant that not only serves Malaysian dishes, but also some Thai, Filipino, and even a Korean BBQ dish! I only tried the Malaysian dishes here, so I can't speak for the other ones.

I think their satay is pretty good and their peanut sauce is not bad. I had the prawn mee, but I thought this dish could be improved. It definitely smelled like prawn mee, but when I tasted it, I felt like something was missing. Also, the broth looked really red and spicy, but it actually wasn't spicy at all.

Their food is actually not that bad, but I wouldn't call it 100% authentic. I think the price is reasonable, but I think their food could be improved a bit to be justified at that price.
