JF26V4OaZNTJIaDL8950HA Word of advice, ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER. Sounds kind of silly for a place that prepares your food in front of you. But I came in during their lunch rush, the line was almost out of the door & half of the food was still being cooked from the rush. Ordered multiple orders, got all the way back to work to realize they gave me an empty container. Had to drive all the way back just to get the food that they forgot. No offer of a meal on them, free drink, not even a sorry. I mean come on, it's definitely a hassle to have to drive up and down Sunset at lunch time for someone else's mistake.
