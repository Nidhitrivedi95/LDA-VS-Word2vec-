I started with the hot and sour soup. It was a cold evening (I live in TX so it's all relative) and I was looking for something to warm me up after my chilly walk from my hotel. I specifically asked for a small bowl of soup. Keep in mind I'm dining solo. Well small here equals a bowl large enough for 4+ people. I asked if this was the smallest they served, yes. Really what a waste of food. Before my soup arrived I asked the waitress to help me order. I explained what I was partial to something spicy, noodles and chicken. Her response it's all good. Look the menu is overwhelming and a simple suggestion or two would have been helpful. Well my gigantic bowl of soup arrives and it is fabulous. A minute later here comes my entrée. I explained to the waitress I was not in a rush, the restaurant was 2/3rds empty at the time. Her response a smile and she leaves. The entrée was equally good and large but I expected that as I saw other plates being delivered. I also asked for a water which was served with no ice and was at room temperature, what the heck? And lastly they don't accept AMEX. Hey your new location is smack dab in the middle of multiple hotels which I'm sure is being populated by people on business most of whom use corporate AMEX cards. 

Bottom line great food, servers are there to only deliver food as fast as possible, and bring your VISA card.

I did bring two large containers of leftovers back to my hotel and the folks at the front desk did enjoy the leftovers.
