bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q We were very happy when Singing Panda opened up. The food was very good. We have returned various times but after awhile the service was not good. The owner does not even talk to the customers only too a few not like at the beginning. My favorite appetizer calamari is not as good as before. Not happy!
