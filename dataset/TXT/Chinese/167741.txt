Server was fast and friendly and usually checked up on us to see how we were doing.

The plates and silverware seem a little bit used and it's surprising with how busy this place always is they can't afford new ones, some renovation, or deep cleaning.

If you're hungry and want some decent "Asian" buffet at a decent price this is the place.
