Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg I had a a lovely time at Rice. The food was good. I was sang to, given a birthday card & green tea ice cream for my birthday. The audios my man ordered was watered down so we ordered some hot sake & all was well.  We had vouchers but we will be back to thos restaurant the next time we come to Vegas. I loved the sesame seeds in the spicy tuna roll. Everything was great.
