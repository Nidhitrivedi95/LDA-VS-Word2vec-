yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Place has definitely remodeled.  I guess the catchy name of the restaurant or word of mouth of this place actually got around where people love coming to this place ha.  I came here one day when it was super packed.  We had to wait over an hour.  Ridiculousness!  Finally, we got seated and we waited awhile for the waitress to come.  My friends ordered the typical pho bowl while I got my fave dish, bun thit nguong.  It was delish!  

When it came time to paying our bill, we asked the waitress to charge certain credit cards to the specific dishes we ordered.  She had to ask us a number of times and then finally got it, supposedly.  Then when the charges came back, we realized the lady just split the bill into thirds.  Sheesh...
