9HWCSPtMP2tU_cTDsEU1Cw Super cute place - although a tiny restaurant, its very charming and well decorated.

Excellent food and service:
The cucumber salad is to die for and the buns are delicious.
Portions are great (not too much but definitely enough).
Prices are fair.
Service is extremely friendly.

Only downside: not all method of payments are accepted.
