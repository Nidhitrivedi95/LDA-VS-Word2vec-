r5qUfdiSL2_hHfdqXBJAMA Hands down my favorite place for Chinese food in Madison. Consistency is key for me and IG is always consistent. The pace is slower than some restaurants, but it's worth the extra time. We eat here at least 4-5 times a year and it's always a great night with great service. 

Cashew Chicken, egg roll, shrimp rangoon and a glass of wine = LOVE!
