LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA The Princess and I have been huge fans of Flo's for years, since the original Flo's next to Osco on TPPW before they moved across the street.  This location is our local favorite and try to get over from the NW Valley at least once a month. The Saturday $5 lunch special is truly the best lunch value in the value. I really admire her business acumen for recognizing the need to pack her place during the economic downturn, provide excellent jobs, and still make good money on volume rather than GM%, but I digress.  If the food wasn't good, it still wouldn't be worth $5 and it is.  We love the food and especially the generous discounts during happy hour.  My favorite on the menu is the house chow mein with shrimp, chicken, and beef-extra spice. It is one of my all-time favorite things to eat.  The Princess always gets the spicy ginger beef, kind of a play on mongolian beef, it's excellent as well.  Make sure you get the salad with their amazing, one of a kind ginger dressing, you'll want to take some home (and yes they will sell you a container of it).  Hat's off to Flo's! Fantastic food and excellent service!  Well done!
