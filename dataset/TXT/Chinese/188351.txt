yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA It was good! Not the best, but I liked the price for what I got. Good, solid pho place. I also like how extensive their menu was, ranging from rice plates, to pho, to hot and sour soup, to even fried rice! It's a good place for big parties where not everybody wants pho. Since the place is also really big, the waiting list moved along quicker than expected. Thank goodness!
