HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw After shopping at Mekong the family decided they were hungry.  I thought we were going home, but NOPE!  So checking to see what was nearby I spotted this place with 4 stars.  And it was just across the street!  So we put the groceries in the trunk and walked over.

From the outside it looks pretty ordinary.  A neon sign tells you that you are there.  It was very crowded when we walked in, but a booth was open so we grabbed it.  Within 10 minutes there were even more people and some had to wait for tables to open up.  I figured this was a good sign.

First impression:  slow service. Dive.  Shabby interior and it took a while to get the menus.

Extensive menu. Lots to choose from.  Which is cool.  It took a while to go through everything.  Even then it took a while for them to take our order.  They probably need a third server, at least during dinner.  The wait was unreasonably long.

Once ordered it took a reasonable time for the food to show up.  At least assuming they are cooking it fresh (which I'm assuming).

The food:  big portions, simple but good flavors

I can't really rave about it.  It was good.  We were all happy with our choices.  Mine was supposed to be spicy (it had the red pepper symbol on the menu), but it really wasn't.  It was still good, though.  Was this "as good as it gets"?  No.

I could probably go to 4 stars if we hadn't had to wait 20-30 minutes to take our order.  It only took 10 minutes to go over the menu, and they didn't check on us at all until at least 20 minutes.  Food was tasty, and portions were large, but the wait was excessive.
