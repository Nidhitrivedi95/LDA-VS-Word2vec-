gtcsOodbmk4E0TulYHnlHA Really loved this warm, friendly spot on Bloor near Christie Pits Park.

I came here with friends on a warm summer evening. By 8 p.m. the patio was full, but there were plenty of seats inside.

We stayed through the evening enjoying beers and conversation. The place got full, but never terribly crowded. Inside the decor and ambiance are tasteful and inviting.

The staff here are friendly and knowledgeable. They have an extensive selection of draught and bottled beers. I also hear that they do amazing cocktails. Maybe next time! Northwood is definitely worth a return visit.
