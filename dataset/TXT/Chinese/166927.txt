VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA Really solid place.  I'm typically pretty biased in my judgement of Chinese cuisine but this place gets a thumbs up from me.

In addition to the standard dumpling potstickers and bao zhi you'd see in a big city China Town, this place also has some really great authentic noodle and soup dishes.  My wife and I had the chicken lo mein and it was as good as my mom's!

As others have noted, the prices are a bit steep but they must have to have higher prices to cover the costs of the premium location in Hilldale.

Still, it's a great weekend spot or place to grab lunch on a weekday.
