meK_kwDzNrke0hQNEpn4dw Ok, this is a small little place with 4 tables, TV's and menu board on the wall, very nice little place. 
Very friendly staff. 
Got the Hot & Sour soup, finally a place that can do that right. Fried Chicken Wanton, General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef. As I sat waiting for my order, the lady brought me 2 peanut butter cookies. The food is on point, this will be our go to whenever we want Chinese food. Since we live right around the corner that is just a bonus for us since they also deliver.
