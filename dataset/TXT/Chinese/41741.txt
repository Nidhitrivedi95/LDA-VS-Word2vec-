Me and my boyfriend have been to a lot of Toronto's popular restaurants but it's been a while since one actually blew us away with every dish. Especially with new asian restaurants their food was nothing special but with a big shiny price tag at smaller portions- but Dai Lo was not one of these.The food had a familiar feeling but was also extremely inventive; the tasting menu was very generous and filling. They made sharing multiple plates easy and most importantly everything tasted amazing. The staff are also very friendly and informative. We'll all be frequenting this spot as much as possible!
