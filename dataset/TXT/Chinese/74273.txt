fnaDx7UD4MiodQlgYHDwsQ This place is kind of buried in a dead little strip mall opposite of Joe's Grotto and can be a little less than eye catching from the outside. Once inside, you can tell it's has been around for a while. However, I have been here 3 times with my family and every time the Kung-food and the service here has been no less than amazing. 

The older gentleman that runs the place is always accommodating and friendly. My boyfriend is allergic to shrimp and they are more than willing to cater to his needs and make substitutions when necessary. The quality of food is always consistent each time and is by far the best that I have tasted in Phoenix. 

They generally aren't super packed which is confusing given the quality of the food here, although they do have a lot of business on the take out side. We generally get the family style meals which include several delicous items. The one we usually get includes Wonton soup, the Poo Poo Platter (lol), Mongolian beef (which my boyfriend swears by), Sizzling Shrimp, House Special Chicken (best chicken ever), Mushu Pork, and Peking Fried Rice. And they top off every meal with these little banana filled glazed turnover squares. 

Prices are decent all around which is also a plus given the quality of the food. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who would like a delicious, memorable and authentic Chinese meal.
