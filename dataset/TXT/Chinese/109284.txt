lmfyEVKm3CDGWg18LeRhgA I only recently discovered that I do not hate Thai, having never tried it, so this place was right up my alley. It's literally 1 mile away from our home and has a pretty extensive menu. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but if you're a fan of pastels and the early 90s, you'll love it here. You may even want to move in. Our service was a little slow, but the friendliness of our servers (yes, multiple) made me feel ok about waiting a little bit for a third beer. Overall, I'd say this gets a thumbs up from me and my other half.
