BH0K6SxPnY3wTRB7tA27hQ This was a very poor experience for my girlfriend and I. There were flies swarming our heads. We were the only ones in the place and the service was slow (we were there for an hour and a half and ordered nothing special). 
The worst part of it was our waitress taking off her shoe and sock to show the owner some sort of foot problem she was having. About 2 minutes later, she was serving our food. I was cringing... it was rough... I will not return.
