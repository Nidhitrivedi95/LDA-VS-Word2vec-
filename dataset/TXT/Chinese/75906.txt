fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA My boyfriend and I came here this past Monday night and it was packed. Even groups with reservations were kept waiting, so keep that in mind if you plan on going.

Overall, we were pretty underwhelmed by the food. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but everything was pretty mediocre and we couldn't figure out why everything seemed so expensive for the quality. 

We ordered the soup dumplings, shrimp & pork dumplings, pork buns, steamed Chinese broccoli, diced chicken fried rice, and the fried squid tentacles. We enjoyed the dumplings, which came out first, and then everything went downhill from there. All of the other dishes had some kind of issue with their preparation. The broccoli was really undercooked and difficult to bite through, but the light garlic sauce was good. The pork buns were also undercooked, and some of the bun was gooey as a result. The fried rice was bland, and there were maybe 10 pieces of diced chicken in it with way too much oil - and certainly not worth the almost $14 we paid. By far the most regrettable dish we ordered was the fried squid tentacles which were way too tough to be edible. They were really disgusting to us, and we love squid.

Needless to say, this place fell short of our expectations and did not satisfy our cravings like we thought it would. Although we enjoyed the dumplings, there were too many other misses for us to consider returning.
