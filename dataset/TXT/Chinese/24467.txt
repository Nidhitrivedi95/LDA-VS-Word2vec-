6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag What happened to this place? Haven't ate here in awhile, but stopped in with the family and family friends last weekend. Our friends never ate here before and we told them such good things about the food. We ordered combination chow mein, chicken chow mein, mabo tofu, sesame chicken, beef broccoli, and twice cooked pork. The last three dishes were awesome! However, the noodles tasted a little sour and the tofu tasted like pepper overload! If that wasn't bad enough.. Service was worst! We were the only table and waited forever to get seated, get water and tea, everything! It's a bummer guess we won't be back here for a long time..
