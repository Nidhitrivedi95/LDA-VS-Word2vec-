These masseuses are not afraid to use strength. I got the 60 minute full body massage and, wow, that was certainly different from my previous massage experiences (spas). 

They really located where you are tense and PUSH it. It can be quite uncomfortable, especially if you have a lot of knots, but it's definitely worthwhile in the long run. I've had a few large knots down my spine that two massages previously haven't really reduced. I feel like this one session got them significantly down in size.

While it wasn't the most pleasant experience during the massage, it was good for me in the end; definitely a unique experience when comparing it to a spa massage where it felt nice and relaxed during, but with little benefit afterwards.

Plus, it's so cheap! $60 for a one hour massage is a more than fair price.
