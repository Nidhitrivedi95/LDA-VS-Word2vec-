ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ Chatime, my first love.  It got me into the whole bubble tea craze.  I've had over 100 drinks from here throughout my life, making me a Chatime Elite member.  

My usual order: Regular Pearl Milk Tea, no ice, low sugar.  It never dissapoints.  The taro has a nice texture to it, some people complain that it's gritty but I love it.  Their toppings are always on point.  The Tea of the Months are pretty hit or miss.  The slushes are pretty weak, just avoid them and go with their great milk teas.

While it's not my favourite bbtea place anymore, it still holds a special place in my heart.
