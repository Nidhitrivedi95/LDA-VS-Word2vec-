Their club sandwich is like the ones in Hong Kong with their crust cut and beef inside.  It's really good.  Most of their dishes are really good but I like their baked dishes like the pork chop and rice.  Their beef tongue is really soft so I like to get it with their pasta and mushroom white sauce or their gravy sauce.  Don't get their plain white sauce.  It's not salty enough.  The salted chicken with Hainan sauce is really good too.  
But, you have to try their desserts.  They have crepes and waffles with ice cream that are really worth the price.  You cannot go wrong ordering one of their desserts. Enjoy!
