DwmAsemahJywywhuqv5J1Q I can only comment on their lunch specials to go.  I have stopped in here several times in the past few weeks and have been very satisfied.  Lunch specials are about 6.50 to 7 bucks and are very filling and absolutely delicious.  The food is authentically spicy, so if that's not your thing be sure to look for the items that are marked non-spicy.  I particularly enjoy the spicy fish fillet.
