Kxop0nGA-BUrwYD4EGhyPA I found this restaurant while walking along Dundas one day with my girlfriend. She spotted photos of noodle on the sandwich board outside and on a whim I suggested we try it out. Entering the restaurant leads you down a set of stairs, so it's always hard to know what you're getting into, add to that Chinese Traditional Bun has these large plastic strips over the entrance for the sake of the guy they have making noodles at the front of the restaurant who sets them to cool outside.

The hand made noodles is what really struck me with this restaurant. They tasted so fresh and sweet that all the dishes I had with them (usually very spicy) tasted better than any other restaurant I've had them at. That includes the steamed dumplings (very comparable to Dumpling House which is the other restaurant I order dumplings at and that I highly recommend).

The restaurant has what you would expect from a basement restaurant in China town. The washrooms are small and suspect, and there's a ton of boxes stacked against the wall on your way to them. The tables are covered with plastic sheets, and the servers don't speak a lick of English. It's still easy enough to indicate what dishes you want, or to ask for extra water or napkins. I find the hostess/owner very friendly as well, she always smiles and asks me how I found my meal.

Switching gears, there was a murder in the kitchen sometime last year, which I find unfortunate and ridiculous, but not something to stop me from coming back. I've taken large groups of people here and we've had great times talking over tasty food.
