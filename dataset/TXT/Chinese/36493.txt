Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg We Decided To Try This Place Since We Had A Free $20 Credit From The Play Book Luxor Gave Us Upon Check In. As We Walked Up We Asked To See A Menu To See What They Offered, The Prices Are A Little On The Higher Side. We Decided To Try It Out And The Hostess Had A Little Bit Of An Attitude Because We Asked If We Could Use The Coupon. Well Don't Offer It Then If Your Gonna Be Rude About It...But Anyways We Ordered A Plate Of Chicken Teriyaki For $22 With Rice And Vegetables...It Was Okay Nothing Special For The Price I Think They Fall Under The Same Category As PF Chang's. I Wouldn't Suggest Coming Here It Just Isn't Worth The Money...I Would Suggest Someplace Else.
