vgc-XO64Uw7otc3sxmns1A The sushi here is decent, nothing overly great or spectacular. The hibachi dinner was okay - salmon tasted so fresh, pretty bland though. Everyone was very friendly, though the service was not great. Did not get one water refill while we were eating dinner. Wouldn't come here for the hibachi show, they don't have many hibachi tables. Overall, it was an okay dinner but we won't be returning. If their prices were lower, maybe but for the same amount of money, I'd much rather go to Kabuto or somewhere. Oh, but they did have a nice atmosphere, nice sushi bar with televisions.
