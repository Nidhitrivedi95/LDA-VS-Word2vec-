V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA I really dislike going out for noodles because they are so dang cheap. I mean really - you can't get ramen 10 for a buck any more, but still, even if you make a fancy dinner with the craziest, most decadent sauce you can imagine, you can treat your entire family for about what a single meal would cost. Unless maybe you put some sort of truffle on it or something. Even then, you always spend more eating out, and that's not really the point - noodles of any sort are just way worse than anything else.

At Nothing but Noodles, you can choose from all variety of noodles - you can get your Asian noodles or your noodle soup or your Italian noodles, so anyone in the family will be happy, and you can customize it to your heart's content.
