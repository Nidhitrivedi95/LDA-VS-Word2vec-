lv3h7WwuxPyJNLTeWeL5LQ Read the reviews about hit and miss. Definitely a miss for me. The food was to me low quality and not too flavorful. We had the standards rice noodle roll, siu mai, etc. 

Not a return for me because even a hit would not be that good. That's how bad a miss it was. 

I personally wouldn't recommend this place.
