1skTxDMBQSpElbLfhBgmVQ Unfortunately, I don't have a smartphone yet.  If I did, I would have skipped this place and I hope you, dear reader, do too!  I was heading home and wanted McDonalds when I saw this place.  I figured "why not?" and went in.  The menu on the board in front of the register is not the same as the carryout menu (the carryout menu lists more options).

I ordered cream cheese wontons, sesame chicken, and chicken chow mein, adding up to $22.00, which I think is ridiculous considering the quality of the food!  Of course you can't really screw up cream cheese wontons, so let's leave them out of this...

The sesame chicken almost tastes like corndogs and I mean that in the weirdest way possible.  It's something like 90% breading and 10% chicken.  Speaking of chicken, (which I happen to remember ordering because I never order beef or pork) I'm not sure where it was in either of my entrees.  The meat-like-substance was weirdly chewy, discolored (not undercooked), and straight up weird.  Hey and I guess if you're really hurting at home one night for some Chinese food, you could just throw together spaghetti and soy sauce and call it "chow mein."  Why not?  It's what they did!

If you're reading in disbelief that they *actually* used spaghetti, please believe me when I tell you that it is 100% spaghetti... And not even whole grain!!! 

Obviously, I won't be returning!
