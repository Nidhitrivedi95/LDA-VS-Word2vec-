vX-FwyJ7eINXn_Gn6CqMFg Today was a first for me at Little Hong Kong - I got delivery. The woman that answered the phone was very polite. I ordered 2 Orange Chicken lunch specials (Fried Rice, Egg roll, and Orange Chicken and a side order of Crab Ragoons. I was told the delivery would be about an hour which I thought was a little steep but it is Chinese/Filipino afterall. (Quality takes longer) 

The delivery man came at about 50 minutes which was sooner then the estimated time and he was very cordial and friendly! (One of the nicest I've had in a while, even called me by name through out conversation.) He was asking me for prices on some of my units (Storage facility) and telling me what he's paying now is too much. Needless to say he has excellent customer service and I'm sorry I didn't get his name. 

Alas, the food. The fried rice is uh-mazing! It's so great I couldn't even spell a-mazing correctly! The egg roll has more of a spring roll and was packed with all the right veggies, it was a little heavy on the garlic - imo. (But still very good). The Crab ragoons are good as well. I'll admit I was a little scared because they weren't shaped like others but as they say looks can be deceiving. For the grand finale, I always save the best for last was the orange chicken, sadly, I was let down. The breading on the chicken was not crispy (as the menu dictates) and the sauce doesn't have much flavor. This is the only reason why I gave 4 out of 5 stars because the main entree was not great. I will state, however, that I'll definitely be back to try out more items on their menu especially now that I see they have lumpia!
