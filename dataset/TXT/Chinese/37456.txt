aObwBM6rLOd9gbj36ghwzA Yung Sing Pastry Shop - filling the U of T student belly for pennies since 1968.

The famous buns (BBQ pork, curry beef, tofu, veggie...) aren't the world's greatest. The fillings are good but the buns themselves alternate between stale and soggy. There are probably better and cheaper bun bakeries to be found along Spadina or Dundas, but for ambiance, none can compete with this vintage shop front on charming Baldwin Street.

Personally, I'm partial to the non-bun menu. I like to buy little packages of steamed seafood rice wraps, dumplings, hot and sour soup and other similar daily items. I like the sesame balls and egg tarts, too.

Tourists to Toronto may note that Yung Sing is very near the Art Gallery of Ontario: this would be a good spot to fuel up on a snack before you head inside. There's a solitary picnic bench in front of Yung Sing or you can carry your grease-soaked paper bag to the steps of the AGO.
