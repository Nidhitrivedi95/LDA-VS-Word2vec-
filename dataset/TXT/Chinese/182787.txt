XjmHPe0H91BlJ3gwJb7OiA 4 and half stars...

this place is pretty bomb... prices are quite good.

breakfast and lunch here is a must if you want good HK food.   They have a franchise and several locations... all busy and all with cheap good eats.

although the milk tea is a hit and miss sometimes.. sometimes diarrea sometimes not.. u take the risk.. no pain no gain my friends.
