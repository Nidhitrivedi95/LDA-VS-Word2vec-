0R87tcWUqkWXAD5z0vZcuQ Average HK style cafe.  It's tucked into a little plaza right next to ServiceCanada.

Came in on a Thursday night with a party of 3 and it was fairly empty.  
They have this deal where if you buy $30 you get a pork-chop rice for free. 

1. Oxtail in Red Wine with Rice
- The sauce was generous and very creamy; the oxtail was not cooked for not long enough and was very chewy ):
2. Hainese Chicken with Rice
- This was actually not bad; the hainese "flavour" you usually get from the chicken but it was very passable.  
3. French Toast
- YUM. The French Toast was thick and huuuuugeeee.  It was warm and doughy - The perfect way to destroy your carbs for the day.
4. Pork Chop Rice
- Ehhhhh... 2 huge pieces of pork with rice. For it being free it was pretty good. It came with gravy and filled me pretty well.

This won't be my A option - I still feel New City Restaurant is my place.
