0eZHVYDyACtVVOIgoBlV3g Ran into this place after no. 1 Boba was closed just to get some milk tea boba. Let's just say I will never go back to this place. The service was terrible the guy at the register was not very friendly and was rude to me. It's a shame because the boba was good and at a decent price but because of the way I was treated I will never come back here.
