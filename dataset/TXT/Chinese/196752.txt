zpaXQga1MIqPc5nAWZXtdQ Just cannot believe such customer service exists! I paid for the delivery fee twice and called to ask after waiting for so long, and the manager mostly shouted out at me through the phone, saying that they were making big $$$ and they wouldn't take care of my order anymore and I had to come to pick it up! They said the delivery guy called when he came but in fact no missed call showed up!
The food quality may be good, but how they treat customers must be improved!
