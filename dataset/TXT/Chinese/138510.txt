QOmojzu24dTI2coPjOtu2Q I think we all know that dives are where it's at.  This place looks like somewhere I would never go.. but it was awesome.  The food was fantastic.  I had Mongolian beef and Kung Pao. We have now gone twice and haven't been disappointed yet.  Be aware..  you need to order in advance and come and get it.. just do it.  See other bad reviews to understand.. but the food is really good.
