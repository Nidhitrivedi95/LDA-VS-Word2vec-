NyGlEmuYcpZSKfk6IwJeSw Sorry to report this review at a negative and I am not trying to be, so I do apologize  
I'm from Osaka and one thing I have to say is that I'd happen to like the tradition when it comes to Japanese food and as someone that is a  specialist in making Okonomiyaki and I'm a guy that loves to make Okonomiyaki to make for friends and love ones. I am not a meat eater but I am good at making. Okonomiyaki was missing some ingredients and felt short. I wasn't happy to be serve  an dish that I paid for my dear friend Kei that came a long way from Japan to not have a good experience. She even agree that it wasn't as good as my Okonomiyaki. These Fusion restaurant can cause some confusion when understanding the ART of Japanese food and what I'd mean by that is, The right way and education ways to understand the real taste of Japanese food before making fusion meals. This place, I will most I will return to give it another spot since the restaurant was fairly new to the City of Madison. But servers were not very professional and seem to be lost at time. I'm a Photographer that travels quite a bit all the time and does eat tons of difference cultural meals and this place Tavernakaya is just like some other fusion place and I will quote this "Nice try, but not good enough" Make it was the cook I can't really tell you but it was ok experience for the both of us. Now drinks were excellent and place was clean overall but i really wish my waiter pay a little more attention to us because when we did needed a refill on drinks, it took about 5-10 minutes. Now plating was excellent to when food was being serve to others that were there are the experience and I like the colors on the dishes and great vision for the sushi bar.
