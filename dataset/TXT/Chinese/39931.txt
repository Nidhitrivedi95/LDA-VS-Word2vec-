Axd4Ggd3H9dLAWD__UHYVQ Came here for a bubble tea fix as they had a special : $3.00 for passion fruit bubble tea. 

Though the price was nice, I was thoroughly let down with their tapioca. There was absolutely no flavour in the tapioca and it was just squishy ball of nothing. The tea itself was okay. It was a pretty standard passion fruit flavour, so nothing out of the ordinary. 

Their location looks nice and cosy. It could be a decent place to study with a drink in hand. 

Though I was let down by the bubble tea, I may consider coming back and trying their dessert. I did, after all, get what I paid for.
