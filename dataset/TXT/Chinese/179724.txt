X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I was at Hakkasan last night to see Dada Life.  I was nervous to go there after reading all the bad reviews, but I have to say...I had a good time.  I didn't get there till about 1:30 cause I don't need to be in a club for almost 4 hours before the headlining DJ finally starts.  I got in very quickly and everyone was routed to the elevator.  Security was nice and courteous. I was able to find a good spot to get a great view of the DJ's.  Dada Life did a great job and the lighting effects were awesome too.  The place was busy, but not overly packed (maybe because it was mid-week).  The crowd was definitely into it which made it a better experience.  I rarely club anymore, but I'd go back to Hakkasan again.
