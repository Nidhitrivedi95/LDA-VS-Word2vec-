8PNXDkWz3hyZFi7E4tYhjw The food is great.  It's my go to for chinese. The crab rangoons, pot stickers and hot and sour soup are all great. They give you the little fried things to dip in sweet and sour sauce. I usually get Ho Fun but this last time, they changed the noodles from extremely wide to almost like Pad Thai noodles. It was a disapoint but was still okay. 

the restaurant is usually quiet and  clean. Service is always great. There is convienent parking although getting out of the plaza can be difficult if  you are trying to go left.
