Hiqb7coNwQgEoAR9bn5XMg The dumplings and fried rice are my favorites.  The dumplings are filled with a delicious mixture of pork and they really fill them well.  The fried rice has a flavor, almost smoked that sets it apart from others I've had.   All other foods I've tried are delicious too!  They spoiled me for other Chinese restaurants.
