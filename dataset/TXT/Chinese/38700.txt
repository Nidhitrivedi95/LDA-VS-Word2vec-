AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Food was very flavorful but I'm just not the type who can eat faux meat regularly... I had the crispy beef and my sis had the shrimp. Funniest thing she thought she was ordering real shrimp and when she tried it she still couldn't tell the difference until she had a few more bites. So I guess that's a good thing. Good place overall
