zRGCIIez1z4ve5Hppa7eVQ Best Chinese food in Aurora hands down. Not too salty or overly sauced - perfect flavour and everything is super fresh. No old oil taste. Love it!!!! Bonus - the staff is exceptionally friendly and polite. They truly value their customers and make you want to return for more!
