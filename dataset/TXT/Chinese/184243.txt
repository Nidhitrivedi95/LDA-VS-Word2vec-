xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A As a college student who was walking distance away, I loved going to Lulus! Okay - it didn't really have the most authentic Asian food but I wasn't expecting that to begin with. I wanted a place to get tasty noodles and that's what I got!

The dishes I liked:
- Crab Rangoon
- Beef Chow Fun
- Singapore Rice Noodles
- Spicy Basil Noodles
- Lulu's Pan Fried Noodles
- Thai Curry

Dishes I wasn't a big fan of:
- Dr. Fu's special: Not all that special 
- Udon Soup: kind of bland

The service was always adequate when I came - whether it be in a group of 2 or 10. We were always seated relatively quickly and the food came out quickly as well. In a place like this I don't ask for much else.

This also used to be my go-to bubble tea place (before Rose Tea Cafe) and that was good too. Not the best - but good.

If you go to any place enough you will find foods you like and foods you don't. I don't love every dish on the menu but I keep coming back to Lulus because it has a variety of noodles I actually like and I can get a large quantity of them for a reasonable price!
