_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Arrived outside Noodle Asia... line outside could be a good thing?  It moved quickly too, which was nice.  

Tried to order a few things family style...

Hot & Sour Soup - Neither hot (spicy) nor sour.
Seafood Soft Noodle - this didn't taste like anything, except maybe for oil.
Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice - best entree, but more sausage/egg/veggies would have been nice.
Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce - Not bad.
Siu Mai - Nope!  All out.
Har Gow - Nope!  All out of this too.

Ugh.  Nothing was terrible, but nothing was that good either.

I went here since I couldn't face Grand Lux for the third time in as many days...  but afterwards I wished I had.
