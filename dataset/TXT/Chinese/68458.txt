eS8OuIk6_fMNNslFnj8noA Love love love this place! A really really good Chinese place to eat at! Not really popular and kind of hidden from the road to see but it is truly amazing! The portions are huge but worth all the eating and the chicken teryaki is amazing and the sauce it comes with is beyond good. i really would love to eat inside to see what it looks like and definitely to try more things here!
