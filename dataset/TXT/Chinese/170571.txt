vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I don't know what people are talking about with the service, but it was top notch. My husband I came here for dinner and had the Honey Walnut Prawns and the Mongolian Beef and it was great! Also had the pot stickers for an appetizer and they where huge! Could have just had those and I'd be full. Our glass of water was never empty, someone would always come by to refill it without us asking. The only thing is if you want white rice, it's extra 0.75 cents. Other than that, food was awesome! Will absolutely come back to try other dishes soon!
