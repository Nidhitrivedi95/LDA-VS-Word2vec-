hPTx2Y5e4Czbr21XcbDN8g I love their handmade noodles here, and the service was fast and efficient. We got our food very quickly and it was flavourful (maybe a tad bit too salty). The only thing is, the restaurant smells very strongly of stinky tofu, so if you're not a fan of the smell you might not be able to endure it.
