aS4t4ee3xqQXgNHNxi9gAA Best Chinese in town.  Yeah, I know, Madison is short on good Chinese.  However, this place has good prices, decent food and great service.

1 - Great customer service.  I put that first because it is difficult to find at carry out places.  

2 - I had the steamed dumplings as my appetizer.  Delicious! HOT (temperature)! and very satisfying.  They are large in size and 8 in an order for $5.99.

3 - For our entree we ordered Chicken Lo Mein and Combo of General Tsao's chicken which came with a pork eggroll.  Everything was delicious and fresh.  The Lo Mein was hot and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  Nothing was over done.  The General's chicken came with pork fried rice.  You could tell everything was fresh.  It had great flavor. 

The Flaming Wok was not anything new, but it was good quality.  The food was hot and delicious.  It was a fair price and the counter guy threw in some extra goodies.  

Not to mention, after a long Target trip, you can call and your food will be ready in 15 minutes.
