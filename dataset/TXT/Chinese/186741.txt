yBxzqKXHhvNVaFnEOd4f7Q I am surprised this place got 4 stars overall for slow service & poor quality.
When I came for lunch, there was only 1 server who was also the cashier. The set up was terrible that I had to walk by in front of people while they were talking face to face with each other, or leeching all around to find my way out the door.
Anyways, she seated me at a table that wasn't even clean, because the booth section I asked to sit at wasn't open at the time. A couple mins later, a gentleman sat at the booth, and she decided to move me over to the booth section. Yay! It was close a min ago, now it's open!
I ordered hot & sour soup (L), and beef with broccoli (came w/ rice). The soup came after 15 mins od waiting. 5 more mins (20 total) passed by, and still no beef w/ broccoli. I went to the front & asked her when my food would be coming. She was surprised that I asked for my beef/broccoli to come at the same with the soup. (I supposed she expected me to finish the soup first then she would have brought out the main dish? Mind you I ordered a large bowl of soup, not a cup like at Panera Bread).
A few mins later, she brought me the beef w/ broccoli. She commented that everyone else was waiting as well, so she actually did me a favor, I guess?
As far as the quality of food was just terrible. The hot & sour soup was mostly liquid. No meat, no mushrooms, no shrimp, etc. Hot & sour soup from ChinaOne would be 10x better than the soup here. Mind you she didn't bring out the soy sauce (You must add soy sauce; otherwise, you just taste the vinegar. I was too afraid to bother her!!!! The beef w/ broccoli was very plain. The broccoli was old, I could taste it.
I will never come back here again. I would not recommend this place if you take someone out on a first date (even if you were so broke), or you might not get a second date. LOL!
