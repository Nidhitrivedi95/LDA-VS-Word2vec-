Every time, I usually ordered Malaysian dishes as I, particularly like Malaysian food so much. This place really gave me a good dining experience every time and I felt so fulfilled with my ordered food - KL Fried Noodle, Mango Fish, Prawns with Yellow Curry, Spicy Devil Fish, Black Pepper Crab and Bak Kut Teh. You will never forget its finer flavor...
