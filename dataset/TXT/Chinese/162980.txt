uP2-0N59oW5lggIyvdfWkQ Chung King Garden, (hopefully not in any way associated with Hong Kong's infamous Chung King Mansions)  is another of my SO's family favorites.  This place holds a place in his heart, and rightfully so. Its the "Pekeng Duck place" The place that we take ANYONE who even mentions that "I haven't tried real" or "I do not like" Chinese food. This is more the real-deal than anything and is a seriously delightful experience.

*Disclaimer* I do not eat duck. And a Hoisin-sauce-filled lettuce wrap just isn't enough for me. So as I see my dining companions drooling over, eyes rolling, mouth watering, lip smacking over the duck I cannot actually provide an opinion on the duck itself.  That being said, the other offerings that I have sampled on the menu satiate my lack-of-duck-tasting-tastebuds.

For anyone that doesn't know the first thing about Peking duck, you order it in either two or three courses. Read Erin K's post below for duck laden details. Me+crew generally go for the  "two course" with an order of crispy fried beef.  I (don't eat beef or duck) enjoy the whole fried fish with their version of a sweet and sour sauce, several of the shrimp dishes, saute green beans, pea shoots and their soft tofu dishes. 

They barely speak English, its true. They only take cash, yes, thats true too. The service is not exactly attentive. However, we usually go in groups of 4-6 and Our bill is generally in the $100 or less range including duck and doggie bags.  Everyone is always extremely impressed with their meal and it is a lot of fun to bring our friends. As per anything Pacific Mall, there is plenty of parking but it does get busy, and this restaurant is the same. Come at off-peak hours. Large round tables for large-ish groups. I haven't been given a fork yet.
