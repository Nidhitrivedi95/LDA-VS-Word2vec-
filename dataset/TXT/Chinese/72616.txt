The dumplings are freshly prepared for all passersby to see. Chewy with the right consistency and on point and with 15 in a plate choose wisely! You want to try other things right? Portions are huge - Chinese pancake,  broccolli , tofu with soy sauce, fried rice all top notch. Never been disappointed with anything Ive had here. Service is quick, helps to know what you want since there is a lot to choose from.

Pace yourself though or you might have a hard time getting off your seat and dont forget the CASH. Cha ching!
