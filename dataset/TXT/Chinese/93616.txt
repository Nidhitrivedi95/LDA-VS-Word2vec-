j3SHAiF8OIlY3kUPnAAlKw Time to update my review.  It's only fair to give a higher rating to a place that I routinely frequent.  Recommended menu items:

VEGETARIAN-
Spinach Dumplings
Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (add broccoli or other veggies for more well rounded meal)
General's Tofu (ask for extra extra crispy - even non-vegetarians will like it)

NON-VEG-
Chicken Lettuce Wraps
Anything with Spicy Garlic Sauce (ask for extra, it's delicious)
Orange Chicken or Sesame Chicken (ask for all white meat if you prefer that - they're happy to accommodate)

Dine-in is SIGNIFICANTLY better than take out, especially for fried items.  Service lately has been a lot better and friendlier.
