N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ Was excited to try this new restaurant and it didn't disappoint... for the most part. Described as "Caribbean meets Asian soul", the food itself was pretty amazing. Though we were told the $32 yardbird special (1/2 order each of jerk and fried chicken with slaw and dirty rice), was suitable for one hungry person, my friend and i decided to share - and we were glad we did. It was definitely enough for two even without the Jamaican Patty Double Down, which we ordered at the recommendation of our server - just "to ensure we had enough to eat". This is even after we had the Kimchi Potstickers "Pierogi Style" as an app. All this to say, we had plenty of food, with a couple of pieces of chicken left to take home. I would recommend everything we had because it was all really quite delicious. I also loved the little sides of spicy celery and watermelon pickle.  A couple of minor cons: for a $9 glass of red wine at an establishment of this price range, I would expect more than the splash that showed up in the glass. I don't think it was any more than 5 ounces. You're better off sticking to beer or the cost of your dinner will add up fast. Lastly, we sat at the table in the window and I was slightly turned off by the state of the floor. it wasn't just dust from the street - it was downright dirty. The rest of the restaurant seemed clean though. Overall I definitely recommend Patois and will be back!
