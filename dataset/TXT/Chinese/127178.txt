pAQwza9U8OLY65Q73pAnxQ After reading all the low reviews, I was ready for some bs as I slowly wandered in here for lunch on a weekday. I was greeted right away by 2 servers and seated immediately. After looking around, I realized how big this restaurant is, not only on the outside but also inside. It's decorated very nicely and it has a modern feel. It also doesn't look sticky and disgusting like most chinese restaurants do. 

We ordered hot milk teas, and I also had this roast duck noodle thingy.. boyfriend ordered the baked chicken portuguese curry rice thingy..? LOL sorry, I have no idea what the real names are. My boyfriend's food was delicious (yes, I snuck some) and the chicken was super crispy and the sauce had a perfect amount of spice. My dish was HUGE- honestly I was stuffed and looked back down at the dish and my boyfriend said it looks like I didn't even start it. It was the small too.. the whole dish could've fed 5 people (with appetites like me) It wasn't amazing but I didn't mind it. The servers came to me 3 times and asked me how I was doing and tried really hard to make conversation. I think they made have had a bit of a crush on me because my bf didn't get the same treatment, I'm flattered :D The menu is huge and offers a lot more than many congee places offer. 

Anyways, miss congee wasn't bad but I only went once, when it wasn't really busy. Everyone I know that has been there in a busier time has also told me that the service is extremely slow.. I'll definitely avoid it during rush hour.
