QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw Very nice hot pot restaurant, they do a great job here with options and organization. If you're new or experienced with hot pot this a a great option for you as this is their main thing.

If you are new, you pick your broth, sauces, and ingredients then cook it in the broth at your table. There are stove tops where you sit, your sever will detail you on what you need to do. Watch a few videos if you still need clarity.

The spicy broth was excellent, they balanced it correctly compared to some bad that I've had in the past. As I mentioned this place is very organized and everything was very laid out so you can have the best dining experience possible. I would definitely go back again.
