pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og Pretty restaurant. Waited 20 minutes for one drink and another 5 minutes to find out my cocktail was not available (from their cocktail list) as they were out of the right ingredients. Our tiny, but tasty calamari appetizer was finished before our drinks arrived. My gin and tonic was $7 and made with just a splash of tonic and no lime- not good, unless you wanted a shot of gin. 
We received our neighbor's food and then waited another ten minutes for our entree. All of the food was quite tasty, the prices were a bit high. The service was disjointed and quite frustrating.  We will return, but not for a few months and not without some kind of a discount.
