lkvHG6proAFP8_evKhdxKA Very rube staff on the phone. I tried to call and reserve a birthday cake. The clerk cannot address questions, did not want to reserve the cake, did not even write down my name, didn't even tell me when the store closed or if the store takes credit card. And it wasn't she didn't understand, all the rudeness was spoken in Chinese. 

Will never visit here again.
