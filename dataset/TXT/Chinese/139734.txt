qy6RM3qsgXTanVH-TlJaXQ We're here in Las Vegas for the WFG Convention and we're looking for a great Chinese food place that delivered to the hotels on the strip. Boy did we luck up on this place! Gary was amazing, from order to delivery he took great care of us. Not only did he drive farther than usual to bring us our food but he even threw in a special treat. To eat, we had the veggie fried rice, Mongolian beef and honey walnut shrimp. All taste fresh and delicious! Thanks for a great experience. Next time we're in Vegas we'll be sure to dine again.
