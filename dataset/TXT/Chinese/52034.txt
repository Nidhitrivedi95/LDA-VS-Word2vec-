cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A Really I don't get the good reviews. I mean 5 star? So they are the top of the bottom? I realize I can't compare the place to T-Cooks, or Elements but come on. For fast food, dive type places it's ok. Really only reason to go might be to say you had Mexican Chinese food. If you are not a regular the menu is a mess, you have to figure out what you want to combine and what sauces to put on it. The employees are very helpful though. None of the ingredients are fresh. The beans barely have any beans left, just a mushy slop with decent flavor. You will feel this food in your stomach for hours after. The place is dirty, not sure how they pass health inspections, I'm afraid to look up their record online. It's crowded and obviously has fans. I just don't get it except that it's unique and fun in a gimmicky way. So once you see past the gimmick you realize it's just bad food. Now maybe if they were open at 2am I'd have a whole new appreciation for the food.
