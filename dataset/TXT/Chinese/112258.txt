mF2EW3twSrFPmT_RVV1-Qg Good food, but prices are driving us to search for other options. Sad to say, but when we ordered from last summer's menu & saw our total go from $65 to $88 we were SHOCKED!!! Good was good, but not good enough for such a HUGE price increase. No wonder the restaurant wasn't busy @ 6:30pm when we picked up our order. Sad...
