zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Two years ago when Toronto experienced a wave of Ramen and Izakaya restaurants, Momofuku was by far one of the most anticipated ramen places as they built a very strong reputation in New York.  Unfortunately, the reputation from New York did not translate to Toronto.

For a place that sells Ramen as one of their main items, their noodle is by far the worst compare to the other 3 I have been to in downtown: Santouka, Sansotei and Kinton.  Momofuku's biggest problem with their ramen is they add too many non-traditional toppings into their noodle, i recall seeing toppings such as Kimchi and this sauce shaped into a small egg (you can see it in the middle in the photo).  Soup based also tasted a little weird and being salty and spicy due to the ginger and kimchi.

Their second well-known item is the Pork Belly Bao!  The Pork Belly Bao on the other-hand is very good, the pork belly is very tender and the sauce added inside the bao makes the overall bao tastes very delicious!!

Environment wise, the decoration is much more modern than other the ramen places in downtown and as usual, the place is loud, but I am cool with that,

Overall, just 3 stars.  Ramen is by far not as good as the competitors in downtown but the Pork Belly Bao is a must try if you do come for a visit!
