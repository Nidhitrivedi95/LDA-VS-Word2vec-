1uPQTz5XZSWr0ti7kUpaDw They really get 2.5 stars.

Came here on a Friday at 11:15am.

Service: We were seated right away and food came out fast. We asked for tea and were told that they were not serving tea because in the past few days the temperature was quite hot outside. What? First, that day was cool and rainy, so tea would have been quite appropriate.  Second, does a city stop serving hot coffee in the summer? I live in New York where we have really hot summers and they always serve tea at Chinese restaurants.

When asked for soup dumplings they told us it was not available for lunch and only dinner. WTH?!

Food: The seaweed and cucumber salad were good. The beef and cilantro fried dumplings were good but not amazing. The pork steamed dumplings and the shrimp, scallion and eggs dumplings were mediocre.

This place was disappointing; proceed with caution.
