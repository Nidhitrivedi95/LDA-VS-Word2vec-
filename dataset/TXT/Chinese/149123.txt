sOaeX1zQWuqbPcclvjtdeA This review is based entirely on customer service OR lack thereof.

I had a new direct report join yesterday 8/1. Both of us are in business attire. During lunch we are sitting across from each other, talking business. After lunch, the server brings the check... One check. He NEVER asked us if we wanted one check. He then proceeds to hand the check to my direct report- a guy. Of course!! I quickly reach for the check. My direct report protests and asks to split. I overrule and pay anyway. The server then proceeds to make a joke about how, "She.'s made up her mind"... Yes, the little lady has made up her mind. Sexism and patriarchy at its worst.

Usually, I choose to ignore BS. But this offended me on so many levels; 

1. First, two Indian Americans walk in and despite the business attire and business chatter at the table, you assume they are a couple. You bring one check without us asking for it. This has happened to me before with people pointing to random brown kids and telling me how beautiful they are (Um, thank you but they arent mine).

2. Second, you immediately assume that the man will pay the bill, in this day and age. Leave the patriarchy at home. 

3. Third, even after my employee tells you that I am his boss, you treat it as a joke. As if, I couldnt possibly be his boss. 

Worst thing was, this server had a new guy shadowing him.
