0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ My favorite restaurant in Mississauga and my favorite Hakka restaurant I've been to so far. I highly recommend the Pad Thai and Butter Chicken. Every time I've come back to this place the food has always been made consistently well. The value in this place is incredible you're really getting your money's worth and the portion sizes can be generous.

Service is really friendly and servers are pretty welcoming. They do not hesitate to refill your water and are attentive. If you're willing to try a new place or are in the Mississauga area this place is a must.
