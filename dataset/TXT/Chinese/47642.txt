BzZNKx6Des02RuAtT-uOPw I can't imaging that I haven't reviewed Fate before. The prices are pretty good, the food is also a favorite of mine. I agree with DK, it tries to hard to be cool, but with little else to eat on roosevelt, I guess it has to. They can't seem to keep good staff, the host(s) have the amount of brain cells you expect them to have when you see of the- yes, I'm trying to be artsy- outfits they go out in public in. Just get the food to-go and you'll be alright.
