But here comes Flock & Fowl which came highly recommended by my two LV aces Chris V. and Rod U. (HI) who steered me into this tiny off the strip joint for a hearty lunch. 

With my choice fatigue at its peak, I was so relieved to see the limited menu of chicken dishes. My decision making took less than a minute as I gladly ordered #1 Hainanese Chicken Rice $9.99. The plate consisted of a beautifully poached free range boneless chicken, a mount of savory seasoned rice, tangy pickled vegetables and three sauces to accompany the main attraction. The white meat was delicate and tender where you are able to taste the freshness of the chicken. It didn't have that in-your-face seasoning. 

On the side, they served three homemade sauces: ginger scallion, chile and soy. All of them delicious in their own way but I'm more of a traditionalist and gravitated to the ginger scallion. 

I can understand how the price or quantity doesn't add up but once you have a taste of the chicken you'll be able to taste the difference of this "cleaner" version. 

Very simple process of ordering and pay at the counter, grab a number, take a seat and the staff will deliver your dish. The restaurant is very small and crowded but was efficient to get diners in and out without any delay. I noticed more take out orders than dining in. 

The only disappointment is they're closed all day Sunday and Monday and do not serve dinner. There goes another choice I gotta make for the next meal! 

In this case, life is not about making choices; it's about making the right decision.
