First of all, the customer service is always fantastic. The lady (I am so sorry, I do not know her name) that always checks us out is so genuinely sweet and kind. 

The food is so good! And the amount you get for the price is well worth it, honestly, one of their dinner portions could easily feed three people. Lunch is affordable and again, feeds more than one.

I've never ate in the restaurant but they do offer a buffet and I've seen the BYOB signs so that's pretty cool.

If you're looking for good Chinese food, check them out!
