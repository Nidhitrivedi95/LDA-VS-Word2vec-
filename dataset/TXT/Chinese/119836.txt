NyGlEmuYcpZSKfk6IwJeSw Drinks are really good could use less ice though. Went during Restaurant week and the food was very meh. The Tofu Bun starter was crap. It tasted like microwaved tofu with nuts. Ramen noodles were very bland, spicy miso broth was good though. Sushi is pretty good. Chocolate cake redeemed the meal. I don't really understand the hype for this place considering the price and all the great restaurants in the area. I guess Madison is pretty starved of Asian cuisine. Also, they are overt about who their target audience is (cough millennials cough).
