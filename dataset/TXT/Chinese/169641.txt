I know places in Chinatown are always getting hit and they usually clean up their act but sometimes entropy kicks in and you're risking it. I'm trying to focus on the food here.

I went for dinner during the week and during dim sum on the weekends.  I prefer this place during dim sum, it is a huge 180.  They are kind enough to let your order off the menu if you have weekend favorites and it's like Tuesday night, which is very nice.  We got their roast duck, calamari, Chinese greens in oyster sauce, and the crispy pork. OMG that crispy pork and dipping sauce, I can't remember what the sauce was but it was good.. and the pork! Crispy skin on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside.  Great family dinner.  I just hope this place stays clean, if I weren't a little scared I would have given it another star.
