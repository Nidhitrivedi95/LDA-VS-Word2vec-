gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw Came here for the first time today. A Starbucks Barista recommended it because my local fav Eastwind closed :( and my brother and I loved it! The Yellowtail Jalepeño roll is simple, delicious and super fresh. Rainbow roll was delicious (one of my personal favorites) and my brother loved the Eel Avocado roll. The prices are super affordable. Definitely definitely check it out. Will be coming back soon!
