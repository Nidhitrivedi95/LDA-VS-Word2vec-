kKCJvvktaKxZ5iFKv3lxuA I would definitely recommend Pei Wei if you're looking for fresh quality ingredients at a very fair price.  I've tried just about everything on the menu and it's all really good except for the green curry which I found very bland to my taste.  Other than that everything else has been really good and the prices are more than reasonable.  Two entree's will run you about $17 with tax (no drink).
