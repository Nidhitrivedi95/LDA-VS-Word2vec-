TxNeo206T0jMvRRQ4nKSIg We went during a time there was no line and got a table right away.
The waiters there are extremely attentive, every time a plate was finished, there was someone to pick it up already.
The live cooking was an interesting station as you could choose whatever items you wanted in your dish along with the sauce you wanted.
I thought that there was a smaller than expected variety for the sushi station but it did have more to pick from compared to Mandarin.
I did like some of the selections of the buffet, especially the noodles.
Overall, I did like it and would maybe come back, only during special occasions!
