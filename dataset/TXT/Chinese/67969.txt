ePCa7c2zvroyiwECOek5wA I can only speak for the delivery - but the food is really fresh. I ordered the general's chicken and fried cream cheese wontons. A lot of Chinese restaurant food tastes like they use old grease. Not this place! Very fresh ingredients and the crab Rangoon was so light and yummy!
