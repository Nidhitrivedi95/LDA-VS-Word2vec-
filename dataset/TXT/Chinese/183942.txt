xuD16x4Jlc__QMtl-AY6Xg Came here for dim sum on Sat. I would recommend either coming just before lunch time or after the lunch rush. We got there around 11:45am and had to wait about 10 min for a table. It was crazy as soon as the noon hour hit, lots of people waiting for tables. 

The food was decently priced paid about $16 per person for about 10 dishes. We were so full and even had to take leftovers home. The service was fast and efficient. It one of those places were you order dim sum on paper.

I was pleasantly surprised that the dim sum here tasted good. We ordered pigs feet in the ginger and sweetened vinegar sauce and this was the best one that's I've tried from any dim sum place. The pigs feet was tender and the egg wasn't rubbery. The balance of the sweet and sour of the sauce was spot on and delicious. We liked it so much were ordered another dish of it. 

Other highlights of the meal were: the cheong fun (rice noodle roll) with shrimp. Only complaint was that it was cold, but it still tasted good. We ordered har gow (shrimp dumplings), really enjoyed the turnip cake as well. We also got this pastry dumplings with BBQ pork, which was also good the pastry was nice and flaky and the filling good ratio.

Overall enjoyed the food here and would come again.
