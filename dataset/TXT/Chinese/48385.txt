C5bmtDRAtl5iMGmBCF5prw Sometimes you just want a smorgasbord of Chinese food for $8. I always get my lunch to-go, and it's good for like 3 big meals. 

The menu is simple...like, really simple. One small page of very few items, and no seafood, not even fried fish or anything. This is a cheap buffet in every sense, but that's justified by the price. 

So you're pretty much limited to variations of fried/grilled chicken, sweet & sour pork, and noodles or rice. I love the grilled chicken the most, but everything else is hit or miss. I guess my biggest issue is that sometimes, when it's busy, I'm getting something very fresh and tasty. But during slower hours, the food was borderline inedible. We're talking rock hard sesame chicken that I'd cut open to reveal some of the driest meat ever. Like, leave your food out in the fridge exposed for two days, and then microwave it to oblivion. It was THAT dry. 

In the end, I really want to dislike this place, but I came back. Twice. In two weeks. If I show up at the right time, and seek to satisfy my Chinese fix on the cheap for an entire weekend, then I suppose this will do. And that's why it's seemingly the oldest buffet in the area.
