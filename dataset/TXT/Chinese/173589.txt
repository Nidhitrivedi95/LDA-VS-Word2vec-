W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g The new owners have done amazing work renovating the inside of this location.  Clean and modern, with very personable and friendly service.  The food is extremely flavorful and good portion size.  Their lunch specials are a steal and a great way taste their menu.  At the time of this review, the lunch specials were only $4.99 for a complete lunch.  The green curry was some of the best I have tasted across the country, and if you like it spicy they are not afraid to accommodate.  That is my usual complaint with Thai food.  I want it spicy, but don't worry if that is not to your taste they only spice mine up at my request.  Summer rolls have always been very fresh and refreshing.  The soups, bright and flavorful.  So far there hasn't been an entrée that my husband and I wouldn't order again.

Location on Google Maps has been wrong.  This location on the South side of Baseline, West of Lindsay Rd.  

This is a family restaurant run with family pride.
