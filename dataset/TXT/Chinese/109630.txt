LpdW1vh1AVm5QznEL5j03g I actually enjoy this place for quick meal on the go. Food may not be authentic but it's tasty. My big problem with this fast food place is the checkout clerk never listen to you. The last three times I have been here I have asked to please have some of the Hot  Chili sauce packets and I get home and open my meal and guess what nothing there. My visit tonight was the same again. Now I do understand that a fat, rude, disgusting family was in front of me in line and that created chaos for the staff and everyone in line behind them. That should make the employees more attentive to the needs of the customer behind the rude pigs but it seems to be without fail that the polite customers to follow are always the ones to get the lesser service in the end. I say put the Hot Chili packets out in front of the register so the client can get them themselves.  If the employees don't listen then take it out of their hands so that the customer can still get what they need regardless of the employees or the rude patrons before them.
