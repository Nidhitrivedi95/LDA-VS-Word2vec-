cykzJbkgweJvZsvkrHMR7g I feel terrible giving them 3 stars, since the waiter was over the top amazing! The food however, wasn't 'bad' , but my husband ordered basil chicken and I ordered another chicken dish ... And they both had the exact same and so did the chicken lettuce wraps.  :( The Tum Yum was spicy, with not much flavor. Bummer, as I live right down the street and have been dying to find a good Thai place close by.
