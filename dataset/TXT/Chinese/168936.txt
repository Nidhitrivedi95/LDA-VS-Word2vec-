Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA I went there since I didn't wanted to do mac d since i was not finding any deal under my budget of $ 6-$7. I actually had my lunch in  Retail outlets which was fab food and healthy with veggies and rice at $6 i guess. I didn't order to go considering i will get something at the strip at dinner time. However i guess i should have picked from there. Here i paid $9.67, not good food, with very less vegetables and less portions.I was better of doing junk at Mac D's opposite Caesars Forum Shops.
