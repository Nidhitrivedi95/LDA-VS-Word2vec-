Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Not a bad place to get your Dim Sum fix.  Its certainly cheaper than places on the strip for the tourist...aka..me.  Having tried Changs as well, this place is a little better and a little more expensive than Changs but way cheaper than the wallet draining strip dim sum places. (Bellagio, Palazzo, Venetian...etc)  

Arrived here on a weekday at around 11am and plentiful seats was to be found. By 1pm the restaurant was 3/4 full. I imagine being busier on the weekends.

 At least there was a selection of teas (Heurn Peen, Teet Goon Yum, Bo Lei...sorry for the ching-lish translation...lol) aka not the typical green tea,  tea bag in a kettle tea.

Ordered:
Har Gow - Shrimp dumplings - 3/5
Sui Mai - Pork Dumplings - 4/5 - Pretty good
Ha Cheung - Shrimp Rice Roll in Soy Sauce - 4/5
Dan Tat - Egg tart - 2/5 - small and custard was too firm/chalky taste
Chow Mein - 2/5 - Oily but tasty
Pei Dan Sow Yook Jook - 1000 year old egg, pork congee - 3/5
Jeen Dui - Sesame Glutinous Ball - 2/5 - wheres the filling?
Boa Loa Bow - Pineapple Bun - 4/5 - Yum!
Fong Jou - Chicken Feet - 4/5 - Tasty

And a veggie steamed roll ...name escapes me in both Chinese and 'engrish'...lol4/5.

Atmosphere was typical Chinese dim sum with a few yells here and there from the servers.  Don't usually recommend sitting by the kitchen anywhere else, but its a prime spot for dim sum restaurants as you get the first picks/selections and everything is steaming hot.

Total with tip was $35 for 2 people.

The selection was certainly there and could of tried much more...aka spring rolls, veggie dishes, stuffed green peppers, tofu dessert...etc but 10 dishes for 2 people was 'pant sized-up' enough...lol.

Certainly far from the best Ive tasted but passable to get your fix in.
