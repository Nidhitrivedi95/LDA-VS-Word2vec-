44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw My family and I have been going to Nee House for years now and it is one if not the best place to get real authentic Chinese food in Phoenix. Some of our favorites are the Singapore noodles, beef chow fun, crispy pan fried chow mein,mandarin pork chops, wonton soup, and the salt fish and chicken fried rice. Prices are decent but I would say it is worth it. If your looking for some good Chinese food then you should check this place out!
