Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ I love that they have dim sum all day. Only been here once and it was just okay to below average. I ordered my usual favorites: calamari was cold and greasy, though very crispy, probably would have been quite good if it were hot and fresh.  Fried taro wasn't very good, outside was not light and fluffy at all, and I didn't like the filling.  Sticky rice wrapped in leaves was okay, but I've had better, did not detect any mushrooms in the filling which is my favorite part. Shu mai was good. Shrimp dumplings okay. Leek dumplings were greasy. The chicken bao was good but could have used more filling. The shrimp rice noodle roll also lacked filling. The congee just didn't look like there was much it it so I didn't get any. The 8 dishes ordered and hot tea came out to $30 and some change. Just a side note...I felt pretty queasy after eating there. Chang's is better!
