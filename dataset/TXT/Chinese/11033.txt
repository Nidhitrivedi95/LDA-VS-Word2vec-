2cetuQgbP1Bnzm-uMRlocQ This is a nice Asian restaurant. It has a nice variety of foods, ranging from Chinese to Korean to Vietnamese. The restaurant's pho is exceptionally good. The environment is very clean, the waiters and waitresses are attentive, and the service is excellent. I highly recommend if you are feeling Asian food.
