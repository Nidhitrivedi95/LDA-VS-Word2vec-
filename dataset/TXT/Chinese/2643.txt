_fTBHNW58xuw0MMbgZTz9w I gave it 0 Star. Arrived at 5pm and got seated but no menus were given. At 5:10pm asked for menus. Ordered food at 5:20pm. Got my 2 Thai Iced teas at 5:23pm, nice service is picking up! At 5:45pm asked why food hasn't arrived yet and was told that they are backed up and seeing the table behind us which ordered 10 minutes after us getting their order. Walked out at 5:55pm and still no food. Sad place for restaurant, could not even get a Shrimp Fried Rice in 35 minutes.....
