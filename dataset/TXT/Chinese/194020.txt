ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ I've tried going to this place so many times in the past on the weekends and it's always so packed, I didn't want to wait in line.

I finally got to try it last night and I wasn't disappointed. 

I ordered the Taro Bubble tea and it was so good! It had bits of mashed taro in it so it was like drinking a tea-taro shake!

I love the customization of toppings, ice, and sugar level. I hate drinks that are too sweet so I always try to order with minimal sugar.

The tapioca pearls were nice and chewy. I didn't finish it so I kept it in the fridge (it says on the cup to consumer within 2 hours for best taste, but I never follow instructions anyway) for this morning. Pearls were still
