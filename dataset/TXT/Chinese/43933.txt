bI4emjU96ZvGQRTwxItd2w My boyfriend and I went to this place after Comic Con. The place is fairly small and had about 15 other patrons inside. Our drinks, appetizer and food came out pretty quickly and so did the check. 

After we finished our food, we'd planned on eating dessert. Unfortunately I counted the time it took for our waitress to come back over and check on us. It was OVER 30 minutes! So why didn't we just leave? Well my boyfriend had a very Ghandi like approach to things so he says to me we're not in a hurry. So I grin and bear it because crazy girlfriends are not in style ever.

Finally, a lady who looks like the manager comes by and asks if we're okay and my boyfriend tells her we wanted to order dessert. So our original waitress gets a menu off of the next table and hands it to my boyfriend. When we were ready to order dessert, she was M.I.A again. 

I know people exaggerate about time spent and I admit to the judge and jury I have no patience BUT we actually waited 30 minutes. So here we are waiting for our dessert. 

Anyhow we only tried a hot pot soup which was alright and some potstickers which were delicious. So the food I would say is pretty good, but the service Geezus! Again Um still waiting on a damn dessert and this place is zombie dead! The food is way over priced and to top it off with the service I won't be back.
