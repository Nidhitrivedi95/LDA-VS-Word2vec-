cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw We have been coming here for 2 years now and we love it! It's so hard to find a good NY style Chinese place in AZ and this comes close. We always get the twice cooked pork, general tso, sweet and sour pork it's perfect every time. They have great lunch specials and their positions are very generous!
