HyoPFfBHLK0lKVHWEdFpvQ Good food great people. Very very clean resturaunt . Large portions great prices . Try the fried calamari with some sriacha hot sauce . AWESOME !  $5.95 lunch specials every day . Lots of regular local customers eat here . Me too almost every day . There is a reason the place always busy . Everything on menu is good . Like curry spice ? Just tell them and they will put curry on it for you especially curry fried rice. They do local deliveries . Just try it . Oh, and try a frozen drink like a Slurpee ed a "BoBa" . Mocha coffee as well as fruit flavored .
