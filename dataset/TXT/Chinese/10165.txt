1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Great food at great value!!! Don't be fooled by the price. Service is what you would expect at most Chinese spots: friendly but inattentive. 

Seafood Udon - The dish looks simple but full of flavor. It was both sweet and savory. True seafood flavor. 

Chicken Rice - It was good but did not leave an impression. I guess I had this dish at too many other places that it is hard to stand out. 

Some food critics came in and just had the chicken wings. Gotto try that next time!
