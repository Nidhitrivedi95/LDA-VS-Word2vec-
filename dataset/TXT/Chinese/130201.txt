I tried a little bit of everything (and racked up a great bill for it) with hot and cold items, but out of it all I would stray from some of the cheaper rolls and stick with their signature items. I didn't have much that I didn't like and I didn't feel rushed, I sat at the bar and people watched, there were a large number of post Cirque show watchers that came by. 

An interesting mix of people, but nothing out of the usual for Las Vegas. I would suggest to sit at the bar because it's quicker for many things - and the bartenders are excellent here. Multitaskers to the max here. 

The fusion is here, but I tasted less of the Brazilian side of here and more of a French european flavor. Still - worth checking out. 

So when next walking through the shops of the Venetian, make a stop at Sushisamba - and maybe the Hawaiian Cookie Company cause they're a great post dinner snack.

Enjoy!
