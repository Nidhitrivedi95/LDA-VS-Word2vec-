qy6RM3qsgXTanVH-TlJaXQ I had high expectations for the dumplings due to rave reviews. The pork and cabbage dumplings were okay. I thought it was bland. The shrimp dumplings were a surprise...I questioned if it had any shrimp in it since they were over powered by the ground meat inside. The pan-fried dumplings lacked a crisp. I preferred the steamed ones more. 

Beef chow fun in black bean sauce was 3 stars okay. The flavor was not as rich as I had expected. The beef in it was very tender and juicy, and quite enjoyable. 

Mabo tofu- good, but maybe I hardly get blown away by this dish as a general item. It was underwhelming when it was first served, so we asked them to make it look more like the photo. The owner was super cool and remade this dish, which was a significant improvement. 

Fried calamari- was not bad either. Good stuff. 

Sesame chicken- good. Nice crunch and chicken was tender. 

They have an endless selection for their smoothies with boba. I got to try 5 different ones, and I gotta, say the cantaloupe was my favorite, with black sesame coming in second. 

Great service, owner is super nice, and very clean. We got a real kick out of the koi fish paper posters in the frames.
I may be back, but will try more of the authentic dishes that others have reviewed.
