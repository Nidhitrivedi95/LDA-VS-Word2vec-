DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA This place has a lot of haters and I can see why. The service is poor, the waiters look pissed off all the time, the water is definitely from tap and they charge you 75 cents if you use a credit card with less than twenty dollars in your bill. But if you do come here, don't come for the service, just come for the food. The roast duck is decent and a lot of their dishes are fairly inexpensive. Is it oily? Hell yeah. But those who frequent real Chinese restaurants should expect that. Don't come here if you're gluten free, on a diet or have special instructions on your meal. This is a no frills Chinese restaurant and they're pretty much just here to serve what they want to serve whether you like it or not. This place is pretty authentic, right to their servers. On a good note, the hot tea is free. So give it a try and appreciate their fast service, a plus if you're in a hurry or really hungry!
