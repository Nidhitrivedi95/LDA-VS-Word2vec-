K4-J1A_ZIzG2yNkee0KOaA Haven't been giving this place a proper review mainly because it's already packed and having to wait in the crush of pushy Asians for 45 mins isn't much fun.

Nevertheless, this is my staple for dinner. Just high quality food with great value and fast service. Mostly like a HK style cafe with your wonton noodle soups and sweet and sour pork but also some more unique dishes, like fried milk bars (not exactly what it sounds like) and pork-bone soups  boiled over many hours to extract "the good stuff" that Chinese mothers always refer to when they forced you to drink a certain broth. 

Really, this place is representative of the best of Chinese cuisine in the GTA which puts it on par with Vancouver and better than any place state side.

Great food, great value - the two axioms of good Chinese food.
