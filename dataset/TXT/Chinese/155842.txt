tNUEKYfbwL0VBU-yfWQrUA Bad week, Good Year. I tried this place out after a disaster of a few days, ending in my oven exploding. Great excuse to try something Good!

Good Year has a standard Chinese Takeaway format. Don't expect anything out of this world. But as Takeaways go it's pretty good. For a start I completely agree with Gibson about the staff. I also had a really great, smiley service. The place itself was nice and clean and smart, which is something I always like in a takeaway.

The food is decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Fairly standard for a Chinese takeaway, but maybe a little less greasy than normal. For vegetarian dishes expect to pay on average around £6, which might seem like a bit too much (I think it is) but this is a bit better quality than your average Chinese.

A slight cut above the rest. Very friendly staff. I might just give this place another go.
