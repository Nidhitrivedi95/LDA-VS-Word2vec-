VDdX2TGa9hNHwjzrnVSC_A This Tea house is absolutely incredible!!! We had hot tea and iced tea, both were perfect. The Hot tea was just incredible and it came with a lesson in how to drink tea properly. The ceremony as a whole is absolutely beautiful when done properly. The tea was incredible as well. I strongly recommend stopping in for tea and assure you that it will be an experience that will exceed your expectations. You will never look at tea the same way after the Zen experience that you will have drinking tea here.

Thank you so much!!!
