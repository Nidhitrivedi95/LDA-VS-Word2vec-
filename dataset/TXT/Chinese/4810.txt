_xt4ZyvtgY8Xu_O6SpSB5A O.M.G! This is comfort food! Their congee is amazing and really cheap! I love the seafood special, and I absolutely love the fried donut they give to go with the congee. If they do not give it to you, order it! It's worth it! Besides the congee, we have also tried the seafood, garlic fried rice and we really liked that too! CASH ONLY! Parking can be hard...but you eventually get it. The portions are humongous, still we order individual ones because we love to bring home the left overs! Highly recommend this place! 

When it's busy, you may have to share tables, but this is not a minus. I love the community dining experience. Their ambiance is casual and cozy. And their restrooms are clean, that's always a plus!
