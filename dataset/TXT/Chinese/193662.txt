ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ I was there a week ago, service was good apps were good the noodle bowls a little salty but ok. I got the peach fritter and was disappointed it was like a donut hole but too dense and just a speck of peach. A peach fritter should be easy here is a suggestion how to do make it if you have not already fixed it,  use fresh peaches probable from costco, cut into wedges, dust with cornstarch and use a tempura batter made with peach nectar and a little vanilla  I hope this helps and good luck with a great concept
