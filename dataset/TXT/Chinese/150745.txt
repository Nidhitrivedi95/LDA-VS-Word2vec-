Sw-OqRcaKL8pG5sqIa9p4w I had the Tom Yum soup and guess what? I had food poisoning!

Not only do those guys not wear gloves, they touch money and then make your food!

With my Tom Yum Soup, the soup tasted like it was made from sewage water and seasoned with disgusting tom yum paste. The shrimp they added, was frozen and not even CLEANED PROPERLY BECAUSE THERE WAS STILL POOP. 

So if you want to tear your arse a new one, you can go to general thai for only $11.50!
