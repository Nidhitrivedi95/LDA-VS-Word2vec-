Wa2X66syShuMSVUYAj1C-Q Horrible customer service. Food okay, but with the rude lady, it made it taste worse than it probably was. I haven't been back in over a year because the last time there I was charged for water. Really?? In Az it is not legal to not provide water. I asked the lady and she said she charged for the cup and lid. Really? I tried to explain in English to her why they could not charge for water and she argued with me. I told her that was okay, she lost a few customers over $.25. There are a billion great Asian places to eat that now have my business and my family's business.  I know petty for me over such a small amount, but it's the principal and her attitude.
