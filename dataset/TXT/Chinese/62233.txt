DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA I been here several times. Every Sam Woo BBQ is almost the same. Got Won Ton Noodle Soup, Beef Chow Fun, Jook w/ thousand yr old egg and shredded pork, and 2 meats (BBQ Pork & Roast Duck)

Won ton noodle - noodle is egg noodle and seems to be diff than what i get in LA. i like it, its yummy! broth could be stronger

beef chow fun - i think they may need a new wok, could taste the wok flavor...kinda metalish?  this dish has to be in super super high heat in order to do the right stir fry. could be the wok been overused.

jook - watery consistency and not as thick as it should be. still tasted good though

2 meats - bbq pork was tasty, duck was just the bony side rather than the meaty side. i prefer the meaty part

service is good. not many people at the time we went since its btwn lunch n dinner.

they remodelled the restaurant a few yrs back which makes it nicer but seem to not draw enough crowd.
