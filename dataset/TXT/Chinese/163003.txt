5 stars for the service. My server was very attentive, helpful, and had a sense of humour.

1 star for the food. I was with a group of friends, but two of them started vomiting in the washroom, so we left early. When we went back, one of them kept on vomiting and started crying because of the pain she was in. I wasn't sick, but if you look online, there was several reports of being sick from eating at this location! Try to eat food with a high turnover (hot food and the ones that's made in front of you) and avoid the ones that aren't as popular (kelp, pickled veg) to avoid getting sick if you are coming! 

1 star for the grill chef. Burnt me with hot oil and just sort of stared at me with a blank face. To be fair, she looked like she was a high school student or something but at least you could have said sorry.
