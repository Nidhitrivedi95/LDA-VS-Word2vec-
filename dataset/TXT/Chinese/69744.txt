F_D-hssVHgarfpqWbFdXow This place is amazing! The outside building is incredibly impressive. When we went inside, we were happily even more impressed. I have been to all sorts of Chinese buffets, but nothing like this. The presentation of food is exquisite. This is not the normal food slapped into a steam tray.  Here each station is a beautiful presentation. The serving areas were spotless, but even so there were people constantly polishing and cleaning the food areas. 

Then to the food itself. Each item I selected would stand on its own as being excellent if ordered from a menu. Plus the variety is amazing. Then there is the staff. Each one we encountered was very friendly and had a smile for us.

The only negative things I can say is that we don't live anywhere in the area, and unfortunately won't be able to return for a long time. If we did live there, we would certainly be regulars. The other negative is that my stomach would not expand to accept all the other dishes I wanted to try.

Before going here we read the various Yelp reviews of other competing "similar" restaurants. I really don't understand how they even can be mentioned. This place is fantastic and I am so glad we did not succumb to the reviews for the other restaurants.
