kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A The food is absolutely fresh and incredible. However, the service leaves something to be desired. I understand the restaurant has extremely limited seating capacity, but as paying customers, please give us at least a few minutes to gather our things before staring at us as if we are imposing on them and not leaving quickly enough.  And please stop asking us every minute if we are ready to order. Give us a few minutes and we will figure it out I promise, but it's impossible to order when after you ask us if we're ready you stare at us the whole time.  Also, 3.50 for a 16 ounce tea with no refills seems steep, but the noodle dishes are only 8 dollars, so I guess the price points balance out. Overall, great food if you don't mind a little awkward staring and rushing you out the door. My advice? Takeout.
