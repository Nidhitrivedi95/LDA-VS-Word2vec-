XpgtXP2e1nWslXW6-YZWuQ Ordered spicy crispy tofu with rice and had a taro bubble tea. Service was fast, food was hot and all was good! The tofu was delicious.  The bubble tea was just okkkkk they added some extra lychee jelly because they ran out of tapioca which I wasn't a fan of. I know for next time to ask for no jelly. Been here a couple different times, usually busy and always open late. I would come back again.
