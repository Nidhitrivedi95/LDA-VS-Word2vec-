URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg Ok, so I lived in Chicago and California with the best Chinese food. Been in Phoenix for six years and haven't found good Chinese food until now!!! China Chili is the best!!!! They make amazing Shrimp Fried rice and Orange Chicken. Good service and great atmosphere. You have to check this place out.
