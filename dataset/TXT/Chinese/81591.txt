H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag I found Bobo on Yelp. I went in exhausted after a very long shift at work to pick up dinner for my family. I arrived 20 minutes before they closed. As I was waiting for my food to be prepared, the lady working the front asked me if I was hungry. I replied "Oh Yes, I just got off work". She walked away and returned with soup for me to eat while I was waiting! Kudos on the over the top customer service! She could have very easily been irritated with me for ordering a family size meal just before they closed, but instead, she treated me LIKE family. And the egg drop soup was delicious
