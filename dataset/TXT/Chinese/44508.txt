BJLjRP7HvIbdQOZc9UoVNA This is an old standby near our home. Good, cheap, fast comfort food. Expect no frills and borderline washroom. I sometimes order takeout from the back and wander about the mall for 10 minutes while they prepare it.

Tonight we went with a few favourites:
Deep fried salty squid
Bbq pork rice noodle roll
Ying yang rice

I am stuffed and we have leftovers to take home. Under $30 taxes in. In and out in 45 minutes - they were a bit slower than usual tonight. ;)
