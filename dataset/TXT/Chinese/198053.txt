ZVGbouYqiY577WGCYZJbTQ I dined here on the way to have my health card renewed.
 As a regular fast food customer, I rate Panda Express highly. My three plate dinner including chow mein, kobari beef topped off with hot mustard, and fried rice was the bomb. And the portions of food was decent.
  At the crossroads of Boulder Highway and Lake Mead Parkway (I-215 east of US 95) and near a Walmart Super Center, it was jumping. The abundant seating and pleasant environment did a good job of making me relaxed in a busy restaurant.
   This visit to Panda Expressed got the job done. As I head into the monotony of having my health card renewed, I am now filled up and relaxed.
