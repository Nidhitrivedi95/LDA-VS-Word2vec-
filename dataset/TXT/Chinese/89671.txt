I8TOosBLYKxZMAYNNyGEyg Great food for a hole in the wall Asian restaurant. The reviews on here that express a very late delivery are most likely referring to ordering through GrubHub. I used to drive for GrubHub and let me tell you it is a crap company. Everytime my husband and I have ordered delivery through the actual restaurant, delivery has been phenomenal. Anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes, which is pretty standard for delivery in this area. I love their sweet and sour chicken. Probably the best I've had from this quality of restaurant.
