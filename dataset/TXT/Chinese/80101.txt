go623pgRx2nfIpsV4ePHXg Ate here with a friend last week, and was extremely pleased. I agree with Jenn T. The staff here was very pleasant. They automatically start you off with hot tea, which is wonderful. Unlike many places which serve regular (like Lipton) tea, or green tea, these guys served us black tea, which was very nice. We actually wanted to take some of it home! 

The prices were appropriate for dinner, but the servings were much large than expected. When you find a good chinese restaurant, there's nothing wrong with having some left over to take home! I started out with wonton soup (which is a must for me!) and it definitely made my top 2 list of best wonton soup I've ever had. I'm actually not a fan of the green onions, and typically eat around them, but this wonton didn't have it "standard" which I thought was great.  I then ordered the chicken and brocoli, which was ready as soon as I had finished my soup. 

The bottom line: The service was great and prompt, the price was right, the portions were huge, and the food was tasty! I'm upset that I don't get to the City more often, just so I could frequent this place.
