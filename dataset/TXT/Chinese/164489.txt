UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ This is my new favorite place!  Drove by there yesterday at noon and saw their sign for lunch specials $7.95.  I didn't have time to stop but talked the family into trying it for dinner last night.  We are hooked!  We started off with the potstickers.  Let me just say that these are the closest things to PF Changs potstickers, which are my favorite!  For dinner we tried a few different things .. The house lo-mein with shrimp, chicken, pork, and veggies.  Delicious .. the sauce was perfect and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Sun Devil chicken .. not many places have this dish, so when we find it we always try it.  This is by far the best we've ever had!  We asked the waitress, who was very friendly and helpful by the way .. what she would recommend for the kids.  She said the Miona's chicken was a favorite.  Now it's a favorite of ours!  Lightly breaded chicken with a sweet and sour type sauce.  We will definitely be back!  Fresh food, all made in-house, no pre-made food.  Super friendly staff, and very clean!
