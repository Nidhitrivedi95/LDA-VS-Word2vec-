URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg Yeah not so bad Chinese food, big portions, family style.  The service, does not go out of their way but does their job very well.  
This would be a classic 3 and a half stars.  
I like plates that come out sizzling from the heat.  This is a nice place to have a larger group sit down and eat family style.

Look for their sign off 3rd st.
