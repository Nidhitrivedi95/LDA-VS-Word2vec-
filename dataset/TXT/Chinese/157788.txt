However, after a dine-in visit last Sunday, I can see they are back on course. The restaurant was clean and tidy and the condiment/utensils area was well stocked. The service was very friendly and quick. Someone even came running over to us with a bag after noticing me trying to juggle the takeout boxes wih our leftovers in them. Now if only they would bring back the curbside pickup!
