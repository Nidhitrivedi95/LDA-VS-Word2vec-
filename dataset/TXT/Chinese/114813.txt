mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w Ok, I'm determined to eat here until it comes up to at least a 3.5 star for me due to the close proximity to my house.

1st visit was for dinner and garnered a 1 star for lack of service and lack of food, literally (see my original review).

2nd visit was again a 1 star (though I did not find the time to write another bad review), this time for dim sum. Everything was cold and tasted like frozen quality dim sum.

Now 3rd time, again for dim sum. Getting better. Selections were at least the right temperature. Note: my mom and I were extremely hungry so may have clouded our judgments, but I'm ok to at least give it a 2 star.

PLUS the ladies pushing the carts are the most pleasant ladies I've ever encountered at a dim sum restaurant. If you eat dim sum a lot, you will know what I mean when I say I suspect most places pay based on commission of getting rid of the food in their cart or that the ladies actually HATE their job. Not here, the ladies were friendly and went out of their way to get us dishes from other carts!!
