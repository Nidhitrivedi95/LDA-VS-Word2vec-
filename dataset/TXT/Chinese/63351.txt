dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ My sister and I frequent Orient Sushi on the regular! They have great prices and friendly service. I really enjoy how their menu describes every roll unlike some restaurants that keep you guessing! They have happy hour pricing all day long and even offer an all you can eat sushi menu. Personally, I've never had it but if you can eat I highly recommend it!
