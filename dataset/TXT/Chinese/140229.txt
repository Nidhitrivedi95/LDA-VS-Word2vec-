R4EhR8xhONLFqqI6ZnzNWw Dumplings are juicy and I enjoyed both steamed and fried dumplings. We also ordered stir-fried snow pea leaves with garlic and deep fried chicken with hot pepper flakes. Snow pea leaves were a bit overcooked, thus too stringy and fibrous. Chickens were nicely cooked. Everything is cheap here without sacrificing the quality of food. Portion sizes are generous too. The place is quite big but I have never seen it being fully packed. 

Overall, a good place to grab a quick bite.
