I opted for eating in so as to get the hottest freshest food possible. I also ordered from the whiteboard specials menu. These options are usually all spicy, wish they didn't have everything on special be spicy and an extensive menu otherwise. For the price at $9.50 for a regular combo, they better serve ginormous portions. Granted, they are pretty much the only game in this area for Chinese food. They have to compete with good Chinese restaurants that are downtown that have prices for food ranging from $3.50 to $4.50.

I had the udon noodles with chicken as the special, but it only came with the noodles & chicken, after my waitress said the special was the same as the combo and would include everything. There definitely was an understanding barrier, but she was nice. They did make the meal the way I wanted with the spicy sauce on the side.

I had just tried another Chinese restaurant last week that had good specials served all day, several courses for less than what I paid for here. I'll go back to the other restaurant next time, at least the service was good at Jacky Chan's. Fun name anyway.
