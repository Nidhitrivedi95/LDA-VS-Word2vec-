x9SL1nCaUYM4JP91UrVkxQ Ok, so I have to say, that I wasn't physically in their restaurant.  However my family went, and brought me some take out.  I'm not someone who is "crazy about soup" i'm not ranting and raving about soups, nor am i avidly looking for the best soup kitchens, etc.  But as mentioned in the reviews below, my aunt brought home this melon soup, and it was badass it was probably the most delicious and tasting light and fluffy soup I've ever had.  The pieces of melon were so tasty and flavourful.  She showed me pictures of it on her camera, what a unique item to eat.  
When I come back to this restaurant another day, I will update my review some more but I honestly JUST HAD To say something about that soup!
