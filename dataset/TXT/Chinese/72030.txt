Upon walking in, if you are getting takeaway, you will be sat down in some comfortable chairs with some sweets and magazines to wait for your food to arrive.  This will not take long and the ordering is a pleasant experience.

If you are getting a takeaway there are two things I would point out.  The first is that if you can order for as many people as possible.  There are always different offers on for spending different amounts of money starting at £9 and if you have a decent amount of people you can usually get a reasonably large amount of stuff chucked in for free.  In addition you might want to do what we do, which is to chuck rice on and then come down to get the takeaway.  The rice from here isn't particularly cheap, but everything else here is brilliant value for money.  You really can't go wrong with the prices here.
