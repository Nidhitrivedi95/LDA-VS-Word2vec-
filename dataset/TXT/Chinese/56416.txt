czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA I went to this place today... The service was good although I didn't expect to be eating out of a styrofoam box with plastic utensils.  The food was good and although I wouldn't eat there again I would rate it a 4 for take out .  I will order from this place again but this time take out or delivery only.
