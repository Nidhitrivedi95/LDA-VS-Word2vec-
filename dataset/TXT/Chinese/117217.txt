nd3FuTBL1ezKFmfhLmJY2w I went to the China China last night trying out the Chinese hotpot with some friends. The range of food was quite good but they were not all fresh! The salmon was defrost before it was put there; the fish was quite mashy! I ended it up having other things. The food was not bad.
The used and emptied dished were piling up during the course. We wanted to order more drinks. There were no sight of a waiting staffs !!!!!
The atmosphere was like an oven. There was NO air condition nor fan...we all sweated during the meal... I thought I was in Southern Asia?
We bought some bottle herbal tea; they were sold in Chinese supermarket for a pound and we were charged two pounds and fifty pence per bottle...... 
I noticed my bill there was 10 percent service charge in my bill?????Service charge for what!!!!! No one come to serve us. No collection of dirty dishes for ages. 
One thing for sure! we are not going back!
