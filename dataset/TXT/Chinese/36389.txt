Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Had a coupon to try Rice and Co at Luxor. Headed over for dinner. Nice upscale restaurant. Staff's energy level could have used a pick me up. Maybe because it was a Mon and slow they were not feeling the need to be as attentive.  We had the Peking Duck, Low mien, Stirfried veggies, Mongolian beef. Overall everything was good. The only thing that disappointed me was the paper mushu wrap they coupled with the duck. Normally you wrap them in thick soft sweet buns.
