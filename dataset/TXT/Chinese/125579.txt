Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w Tremendous selection, absolutely huge. Not much here thats any good at all. I've tried it several times and its been consistantly disappointing. For my tastes, they should cut out about half of the selections and concentrate on making the ones they keep taste better. Hint: when someone gives it 5 stars and talks about their good salads and soups, don't value their opinion about the chinese food ! The food isn't that good, and it costs too much.
