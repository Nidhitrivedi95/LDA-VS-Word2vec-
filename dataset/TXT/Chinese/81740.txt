H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag Came here last night & I love this place! I'm from the east coast and have yet to find any Chinese food restaurant that can compare except this one! The service was great and the woman who was running the place was hilarious. All the food was so fresh and delicious. I will definitely be back for more!
