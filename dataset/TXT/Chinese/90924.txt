IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Yummy Singapore Noodles and pork dumplings. I love the little hot sauces they have on the table too, great for mixing with rice/noodles/ etc.
SUPER friendly service. Expensive -sure but still cheaper than the main restaurants! 
Save the money - don't eat at Shanghai Lilly -just eat at the Noodle Shop!
