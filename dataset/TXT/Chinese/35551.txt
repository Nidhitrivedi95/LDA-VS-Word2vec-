AEYNihHmGIjmUciRFo3qwA I live less than a mile from this place and only recently became a regular customer. I am sort of a Chinese food snob, and this strip mall is a little shady so was hesitant to go. However, since we discovered this gem, my husband and I have loved all the dishes we have ordered so far, especially sizzling rice soup and house egg foo young. 

Do not be put off by the appearance, or the fact that there are few wait staff. On busy nights you may have to wait for a bit, but it is worth the wait!
