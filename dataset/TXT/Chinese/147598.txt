SbS0cnxFStrlidtwek6b6w Awesome food with awesome service.  Owner came out multiple times to ensure our food was good and waiters asked us many time about our feedback for the food.  We had 5 people and we all finished all our food even we thought we couldn't finish it when foods came to our table at first.  We ended up give them $20 tips for $60 of food from their awesome service.
