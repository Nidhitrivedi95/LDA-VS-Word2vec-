Ysz-Xvo6QT9oaQDH4ephlw Simply amazing and far exceeded our expectations. Everything was just perfect, so we just kept ordering one more fish. Do yourself a favour and just order 2 orders of the pork soup dumplings right off the bat to save having to place another order. I'm mad at myself that we waited for a few months to try. Best addition to the strip in years and will become a weekly meal in sure.
