fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A I was pleasantly surprised to find this dim sum restaurant in the Rio hotel.  It was very crowded on a Sunday morning so be sure to get there early.  The restaurant is clean, and service is ok as expected for an Asian restaurant. They push around the dim sum carts and you can just point to whatever you want to eat. The quality of their dishes are pretty good and the price was reasonable.
