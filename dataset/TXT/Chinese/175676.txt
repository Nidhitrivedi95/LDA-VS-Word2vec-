wJnhUJCOYkncLPZAwaMffA One of the best sushi restaurants I've been to in years, inclusive of some of the best spots in L.A. and S.F.

They don't offer omakase, but the nigiri is excellent. I started with edamame and some cold saki, which hit the spot. I followed with toro, sake, etc and it was unbelievable. 

Go. You won't regret it...
