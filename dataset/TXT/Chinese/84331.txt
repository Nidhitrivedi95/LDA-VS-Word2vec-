On the first visit, they had the right and authentic dark sauce.

On the second visit, they had sweet black sauce on the table; the other option was light soy sauce.

When I asked for the other dark sauce, I was told by snide waitress lady that "the chef says this is all we have".

Well then.

This place is literally next door to Oriental Harvest (an Asian grocery store with like, ten brands at least of the right sauce). Jackpot has zero excuse. 

Anyway. Don't bother with this place, if looking for authentic chicken rice - Jackpot is just another poser in the city.

And what on god's green earth is "French Kaya Toast". For the love of all things good and pure.
