Very tricky tricky Just to start people off, for dim sum, they offer combo A, B and/ C. The combos are basically a mix platter of typical dim sum food. Great for two people to get a variety of dim sum, or for the dim sum nubs to try multiple things in one go. For lunch, lunch combo A, B or C is good. Each combo has main, congee and three side dish. A is fish, B is crab and C is lobster. D seems over priced unless you really want to eat that type of fish. And they say it's for 2 people, realistically, I would say 3 people really. Finally, for dinner, go for <U+4E59>combo, three side dish, lobster, fried oyster and chicken. Right now for grand opening they are giving away fried squab for order over $50 after 5:30. Can definitely feed more than the 4 people they recommend. 

If you come here, think dim sum earlier in the day. Lunch and night would be Chinese seafood combo.
