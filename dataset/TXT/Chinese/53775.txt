cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg I am excited about this place, even though I have not had many opps to try northern style Chinese food.  Think dough, and don't mistakenly believe it's the same dough steam/cooked/fried/stuffed in different ways.  
The kind owner lady proudly told me each of our 3 dishes was made w/ a unique dough recipe... 

At first I was worried all the dough would overpower my tastebuds, until I asked for some dipping sauce... they kindly made me a black vinegar, ginger, and scallion sauce... that just upleveled everything.  Who knows if it's traditional or not, but I implored the owner to start dishing this out when Americans like me (smiley face) come over and eat.

The off-menu items are written on a small whiteboard sitting atop the freezer stuffed w/ to-go dumplings... luckily the folks there speak English, so I'll be working my way thru this secret menu and who knows.. this might go 5 stars!

SW corner of Ray and Alma School, next to the JCC.
