Considering it's the only Pho place I have been to in Vegas, maybe I'm just too spoiled coming from SoCal where there's Pho places everywhere.  The broth had a different taste to it...and it was much heavier.. more msg?  The noodles weren't as soft (even after letting it soak in the broth for a while). The meat was okay, but there were pieces that did not look appealing.  The service was okay, they were nice.  They were very quick in seating 9 of us, but took forever in coming back to take our orders..We had to flag them down.  Also, they seemed a bit hasty in clearing our plates (maybe they were running low?).  It can be kinda awkward..especially when I'm still eating and they're trying to take my food away... Overall, it was okay.
