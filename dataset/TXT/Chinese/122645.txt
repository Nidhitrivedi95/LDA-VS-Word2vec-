OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I know another Five Star from Ryan, but Yelpers just like me seems to come back to this place every time they're in Vegas and looking for some Dim Sum.

I was reading one of  the Yelp reviews and it mentioned that they are the best Dim Sum west of the Mississippi, and they are!  I have visited so many dim sum in the East Coast and West Coast and even Hong Kong and I can say that this place is on the top of my list.

Every time my family and I are in Vegas we have to make a stop and eat at this place and really early.  I've heard about the wait, but have yet to experience it since we get there before they open.  Once we get seated I see the place gets filled up quickly within a matter of minutes.

It is your typically Dim Sum with carts going around, but what make it different is the freshness of the food and not too salty for my taste.  Even the dessert is not too sweet.  When I go there I usually get the steam buns, sweet tofu, congee and some chicken and vegetables. 
My kids love their egg rolls and the vanilla pudding.

And, the best is the price!  It is very reasonable and they have it displayed, not like other dim sum place where they have it in chinese!

So when you go, get there early and enjoy.  I haven't been here for dinner I only rated the dim sum.
