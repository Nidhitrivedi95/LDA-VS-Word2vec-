beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw I love this hot pot place! there are several hot pot based that i get to pick. i got entry level to hell and my husband got original one. we all got individual pot and the awesome part about this place is its sauce bar and its ergonomic sauce tray. it made the dipping sauce part interesting and its great variety of sauce option made the good even more delicious.

All the ingredients are really fresh, i love its lamb shoulder especially. it is so tender and fresh. tried it black cod it is extremely fresh. i am usually super picky when it comes to seafood bc i care so much about its freshness. i gave five star for its freshness. it has great variety menu items to choose from. i love its entry level to hell soup base, it is actually really spicy already not sure if i would be able to handle the regular spicy level.  this place soup place is similar to little lamb magnolia but better.  


I would definitely come back again! and the price is reasonable considering it is in Vegas
