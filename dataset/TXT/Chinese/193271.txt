ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ My friend and I popped in here on Friday night around 9:30pm for a snack and some cocktails. It was my first time but my friend comes often and raved about it. I can see why!! Loved the ambience and the relaxed, modern decor. My friend had her service dog in training with her and the staff was awesome, very respectful and accommodating. We requested the patio and it was nice and cool outside with the misters. Very friendly service and awesome food! We each got a trio of the steamed buns. I had the soft shell crab, chicken and waffles, and pork belly for my selection. She opted for the crab for all three of hers. We also split an order of the calamari fries and ordered extra Yuzu aioli for dipping--amazing. They have a great selection of cocktails, beer, wine and sake. I had a Bellini and an IPA. I can't wait to go back to try more of this awesome menu.
