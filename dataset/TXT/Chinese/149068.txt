So_VSzbyBHfEIr5hEHn7Gg We had dim sum here today and the food was okay but the service was quick. We headed to restaurant for around 12:30pm. When we sat down, carts rushed to us and provided us with sui mai, har gow, congee and many other items. I like how their dim sum was served cart style instead of menu style. They also offer dim sum all day. As I began to eat, I noticed some of the items were not as hot as I would like them but perhaps it was due to them being in carts. The dumplings were filled generously and the service was attentive. For seven items, the total came to $37. For a person who lives in Toronto, I was shocked at the price however seeing that there aren't many dim sum options in Brampton, that may justify the price.
