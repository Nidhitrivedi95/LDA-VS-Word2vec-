ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ Got the sizzling steak combo...great deal...comes with a lot of things, definitely too much food for one person. Would also recommend the cold HK style tea. Afternoon tea specials are a pretty good deal, from 2:30-6pm, the dishes are $1 less than the dinner price. We also ordered the satay beef instant noodles and it was better than we've had at other HK cafes...definitely will come back to try some other dishes!
