d0_yLkH7u16tlcvvU-zIxw Good Chinese food and a big varied menu.  Lots of different dishs with an emphasis on veggies.   There is a combo upgrade for $1.50 with egg roll and pork fried rice.  And a complete meal with won ton soup, bbq rib, egg roll and pork fried rice for $4.50 more.   Most meals are $8.95 to $11.95.  They have specials for $11.95 that have everything.   You will need some time to figure out the menu. 

Ok the food. Tried the pupu sampler with teriyaki beef, bbq ribs, shrimp toast, crab Rangoon and egg rolls.  It comes on a wooden veggie tray with a flaming mini grill! ! It's as good as it looks cool (see picture). I tried 8 jewel chicken (mushrooms, water chestnuts, baby corns, celery, peanuts, cashews, carrots, green pepper and brown sauce!  It looks good and tastes better. Very unique dish.  The shrimp egg foo young was average, needs more flavor.  The fried rice was another thing that could have got more flavor.

  That's why we are at three stars.   It should have been higher, but is worth another stop.   Try the specials,  or more unique dishes.  Going safe here does not pay!  But go and try it out is good restaurant.  Total bill for two $32 with app and two dinners.
