td9FZybutwNG7DgocHCiXA Went here again during the holidays.  I've said it before: I can't really tell a large difference between dim sum places.

Lai Wah Heen has a wonderfully clean interior like something you'd see in a 5-star restaurant, with very attentive staff. 

Presentation of food was very good and they had a few more specialties that you won't find at most establishments (foie gras, duck, etc.) but I couldn't taste enough of a difference to return any time soon.  Case(s) in point: Lobster dumpling was cooked to perfection but the dumpling wrap was a little chewy, wagyu beef dumpling (waygu on their menu) came in a tasty oil, but I believe the beef on top was had little flavour and appeared to be poached too long.

Price is substantially more than the rest (any where from $3-5 per piece), but again their ingredients are bit better quality.

Our dessert also took the better part of 1/2 an hour to come, as we watched it being given to another table.  Oh well.
