We also ordered green onion pancakes which had the right amount of crispiness.
The curry noodle dish was outstanding. 
The mapo-tofu spicy & soft.
The red bean pancake for dessert which we ordered with trepidation turned out to be delicious as well.
One waitress was nice but the other one had a continual frown & behaved as if she was doing us a favor when we ordered something! 
Don't need to go to Chinatown Toronto if you live in the suburbs of Markham or Richmond Hill.
