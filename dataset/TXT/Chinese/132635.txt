pOMZLGX5A0CGHKHzX2561g Cantonese chow mein - food poisoning.  Maybe because it was mid afternoon and this dish involves so many different kinds of meats and they cut a few corners on some if them?  Either way, I could tell right away that a few of them weren't fresh, i just didn't know how bad they really were until later.  Last weeks BBQ pork slices?  Rancid chicken?  Check, check.  Maybe their other dishes are awesome?  I will never know, since I won't ever be returning.  This place had a high rating on urbanspoon too.
