vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q I was craving for dim sum and decided to yelp for ones located in Las Vegas's China town.  A couple different options popped up so we just randomly decided on Cathay's.  We arrived around 1pm and dim sum carts were making their rounds and the smell of propane was in the air! They sat us right away and we were served cart after cart after cart. I was very impressed that we didn't have to wait for the next cart of options to come by or for the cart that had our "favorite" dim sum to come back.  We tried almost everything and it was great!  Our water was never half empty and someone was always there  to help as soon as I  looked up to ask a question.  

I'm from San Diego, so our restaurant choices for dim sum are few  and most are just average with horrible customer service.

We had a great experience and I definitely love the food that we ordered.  I can't wait to go back!
