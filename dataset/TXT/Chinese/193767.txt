ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ I only go here because it's close to my work but I know there are better bubble tea places elsewhere. I always get the red bean with tapioca, which has been consistent but that's about the only good thing I have to say about this place. I'm giving this place a two because of how horrible the service is. They only half listen to what you say and half the time they got my order wrong. I remember one time the cashier took someone else's order before mine even though she wasn't even in line. I can only congratulate them for their lack of consideration for me as a paying customer and for their ability to truly not care whether you leave happy or not.
