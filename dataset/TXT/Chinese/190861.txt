YpnvKqeVD7dqZ9Mr0SGw6A Portions have increasingly become small and the quality of the food has deteriorated. We have been eating here for several years. After receiving "hot and sour soup" that tasted like Campbell's beef stew we decided to call the manager, who's name is "Tawni." I explained the portions of the food were small and the soup was horrible. I pointed out that we spend at least $30-$35 every time we order out from this restaurant and expected much, much better. She was only mildly apologetic and DID NOT offer any compensation of any kind. Calls and letters to the corporate office are a total waste of time. They do not return calls nor do they want to speak to unhappy customers. Stay away from Pei Wei or at the very least, from this location!! They are only interested in profits.
