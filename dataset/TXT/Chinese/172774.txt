W8xPHUqL088jdcmNZyH-eA Closed at 3:15 on a Monday with no hours posted to indicate their hours of operation. I have been here before and loved the food. Very disappointed if this place closed down - the food was great! Will be willing to edit my review if they are indeed still open and post their hours of operation on their door in the future. Oh, and actually remain open during the hours they say they will - or leave some type of note explaining the closure for their customers. Very unprofessional.
