1MGhb6z2XSTsyLvQgylXiA Stopped by Wang's last night for take out. Hubby order the Volcano Beef (spicy) and I took a safer route with the Orange Chicken. Since we ordered these as combos they each came with 1 crab puff and spring roll (though they called it an egg roll). We were not impressed with the overall flavor of the food. It really was a 2-star rating: "meh". Even though the bill came out to about 17 bucks I still felt like we could have used our money towards some more flavorful food. Will not be returning.
