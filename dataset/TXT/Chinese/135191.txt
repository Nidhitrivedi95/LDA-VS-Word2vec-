qAJ-denev24k4RN-DMoaGA Would have given 3 stars but my husband saw a bug (not a flying insect) crawling on the desserts. He didn't tell me until we were in the car. Sweet of him, right? While I understand that bugs happen on occasion, it changed our overall impression. We came at 1 PM on a Tuesday and were seated right away at a far table in the small dining room. The rooms is small and decor is dated but it serves it's purpose. The table was sticky, dirty trash under the soy sauce dispenser on the table and the poor server was the only person for all of the tables and looked very overwhelmed. We did have to wait awhile for drink refills and our check but she was super sweet and it's not her fault that they were understaffed. Price was really affordable at about $8.50 per adult and our 2-year-old was free. 

We thought that coming at a prime lunch time would mean fresh food, but not so much. Here is the good and bad:

Bad:
Fried zuchini (soggy, cold breading)
Fried scallops (soggy, cold breading)
Crab Rangoon (the flimsy dough with no crunch or texture, cold, and no taste to filling
Veggie Egg Roll (cold and mushy)
Pizza (cold, soggy and undercooked) 
Banana pudding (odd, artificial and metallic flavor)
Ice cream (scooped individually in plastic cups in a deep freeze. Frostbitten and overly hard)
Fried rice (undercooked rice and no flavor)
Orange chicken (extremely tough, over cooked meat)

 Good:
S&S chicken-great white meat and warm sauce
Some sushi (California and Philly were the freshest of the bunch)
Meat egg roll
Fruit selection (most was canned but a few healthy gems)
Steamed white rice
Coconut shrimp
Green beans 

While their were a few tasty items, we won't be back due to primarily non-fresh food and the appearance of Mr. Creepy Crawly. Not enough making this place stand out from competition.
