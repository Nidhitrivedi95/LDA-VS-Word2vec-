bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Food is great! Prices are great and the Las Vegas like show is super fun! This is such a little gem in Chandler! Order the calamari and I hope you get to experience Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline song ... we will come again! Great place to celebrate a birthday - they have wine and even beer pitchers  Kid friendly too, Elvis will give your kiddos little pandas!
