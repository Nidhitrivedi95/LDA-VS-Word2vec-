Ih7a0qOMLFnYAec8qyq2Gg A good North American Chinese restaurant has been sorely lacking in the neighbourhood. Upon arrival I immediately heard the reassuring noise of a jet engine coming out of the kitchen. A roaring hot wok is always a good sign. First time here so I had an old standby, General Tso's chicken. Very easy to screw up so a good metric to judge by. When it arrived first thing I smelled was vinegar, another good sign. Not too sweet, great balance. Chicken very crispy with a light coating of batter and sauce, vegetable were firm. Egg rolls and spring rolls were great, tasted like they were made in house. Tried some of my wife's food, equally good. Next time will be more adventurous and try one of their seafood dishes. Bravo, please maintain and I will be sure to return.
