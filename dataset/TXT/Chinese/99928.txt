JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA I have loved this place for as long as I can remember.  I mean, I even gave it it's own nickname: Mongo.  I can always tell when amateurs are in line, because they don't quite know how to smash the meat and other ingredients down to make the largest bowl of noodle goodness as humanly possible.  I know the recipe for my favorite Mongolian sauce by heart and I will drive many miles just to taste those warm noodles.  I know there used to be a few more choices of veggies and things on the line, but after talking to a manager, he told us about their rising food cost which caused them to have to take away some of the things that were previously offered.  Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to keep costs under control.
