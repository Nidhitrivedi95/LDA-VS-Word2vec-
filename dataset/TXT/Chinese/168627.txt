Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA OMG, I don't even know where to start. But this place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!! This place is a hidden gold mine, but I have found it :D Pan Asian has been bearly open for a month, but I can see a bright future ahead of them. 

Wherever  the cook came from, she is a GOD. All the orders are made FRESH to order, you can see her make all the food from scratch, and uses only the freshest ingredients. I had the Tiger Shrimp Mango salad and I have never been more in love with a salad EVER. The pineapple fried rice was also super mega delicious. Good thing is that everything is perfectly proportioned, so you won't end up with an entree that only has a two pieces of meat or whatever. They definitely don't take a cheap shortcut.

Restaurant is obviously new and very clean, the kitchen is balling and huge (the kitchen itself is bigger than the dining area). Menu is very clean and easy to read. Prices are a bit high but reasonable since they use fresh ingredients, cooked to order, and just taste damn good. You do get what you pay for, and every penny is worth it here!

Pan Asian where have you been all my life, I would totally ask the cook to adopt me so I can eat her cooking everyday. This place is a MUST try. I will definitely be back here many, many times.

5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
