JOsBOphWK14yjq7FC1zL5w Ordered SHRIMP egg fu youg, had it delivered. When we opened the  bag the smell of shrimp was strong, as I was eating I noticed a smell of Ammonia.  I smelled a couple of shrimp, they smelled so strong. Not that I was going to continue to eat, but I  went online to see reasons why shrimp smell like ammonia...they are spoiled!  The worst part was when I call the restaurant the person there said "we freeze the shrimp until we need them" REALLY? I immediately drove over and got a refund and let them know I will not be back.....all while being told there was nothing wrong with shrimp, she "was sure of it".
