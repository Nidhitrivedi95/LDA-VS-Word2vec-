7U73RqIg6JA0WThxWUV3uA What a beautifully decorated restaurant! This is a great place if you are a vegetarian. There is so many options, what a surprise!! The pad thai, tofu dry pot and dry sautéed string bean dish are all incredible. I was also pleased with the wonderful service. I will definitely be back.
