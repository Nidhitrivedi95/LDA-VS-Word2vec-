zrJDRWzP0P4wTFq8-N_mzA The ventilation is much better than standard hot pot restaurants. As well, the service isn't bad; servers pro-actively circulated the tables to fill our chrysanthemum teas and the hot water for our pots. Onto the food.

The food selection wasn't bad. Their "hand-beaten beef" is one of my favourites as it is very tender and soaks up sauce well. I also enjoy their "alcohol-dipped chicken wings." The food wasn't bad at all, but I stayed away from the seafood deal in which everyone talked negatively about. I didn't get the impression that the vegetables were dirty or any of the food was poorly prepared. However, 2 of my family members had cramps afterwards which may be from over-eating or having squid (which the rest of us did not have). So just keep that in mind.

The soup bases were intriguing. I rather liked the tomato corn soup which goes well with a lot of meats or vegetables. The soya milk one is interesting too, but it's not extremely flavourable for everyone. However, I liked the milkyish taste.

Honestly, I have been to Kim Dao before and I had terrible service for the last 2 times. I've also been to Rolling Pot and iCook or something at Warden and Steeles, Doh Heung at Commerce and another Little Fat Sheep or something (lol). All of them were over-humid and the tables were sticky even before we ordered the hot pot base! Some of the other hot pot places have pretty messy food preparation ..so in comparison, 100 Degrees isn't bad.
