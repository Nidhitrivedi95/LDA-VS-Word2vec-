EhlOUjd2dh52SV_XfoORSA This is my favorite dine-in American-Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food here is always on point and the service is always attentive. You have to go upstairs to get to the restaurant but the little climb is so worth it. The decor here is very inviting, not bare and minimalist like many other Chinese restaurants and the restaurant is very clean. Everything I've had here has been delicious and fresh. Surprisingly, the pad Thai is good here too. I, however, have never ordered sushi here as it wasn't always part of their menu. Delicious, high quality American-Chinese restaurant.
