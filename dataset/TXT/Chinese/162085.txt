UkpkgsNWiurnsNRkDzevmg I went here because I read good reviews. I ordered congee with a fritter and hk style milk tea. I really liked the food, especially the congee. The place could look better but the food is great. Would definitely come here again for morning, afternoon of night for food. Definitely satisfied my craving for congee!
