7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA We are from the Washington DC area--not a hot spot for Chinese unfortunately--but were very happy with our meal here.  The Braised Pork Shoulder in Mild Spices* was absolutely awesome, tangy and wonderfully fatty.  The ma la pepper-spiced cold bamboo shoots salad was spicy and delicious as well.  The ma la or Sichuan peppercorn (which is really another plant and not a true peppercorn) has that very unusual spicy and numbing that I vacilate from liking and not liking, but ultimately think that anyone who likes spicy, hot food should try.
