ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ The food at Clever Koi is fine....I've been twice and not been wowed either time.  BUT--tonight we had the bananas foster fritters with miso caramel and they were OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I will come back simply for these fritters.  Also, the service was top notch--the servers were so kind and attentive and super knowledgeable about the menu.  I wish I liked the food better, but the dessert and service were worth the 4 stars!  Also, their patio is dog friendly!
