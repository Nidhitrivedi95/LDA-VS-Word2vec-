QRSuHZnzHeuS4lHw8RHWWw i tried three times at this restaurant, the short ribs noodle soup is pretty good.  but today, i tried again, the soup base changed, noodle feels not the same as i previous had, and the short ribs..is tough.  hope it could keep up with the quality of the food...it is unique in town..
