zG3GJiIrF01bwgP0tQdkZg Great place for anything Asian-- sushi, sashimi, chinese you name it. Food is very flavorful. Megan Stone is great. Our server Jenn was flustered a bit at the start. Got me the wrong beer and wrong sashimi dish as well. As the evening progressed, she showed a bit of humor. Drunken fish very tasty. Seaweed salad another winner.
