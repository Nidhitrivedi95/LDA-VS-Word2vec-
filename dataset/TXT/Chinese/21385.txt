68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw Asian Legend was were we went for our first meal in Toronto and I was very impressed.  I kind of resisted the idea of going to Chinatown thinking that we would be disappointed since we're used to the caliber of Chinese food in the SGV.  I would say that Asian Legend is good enough to make it in the SGV.

The menu was huge so we had a little trouble deciding.  We finally narrowed it down to:
-Steamed Soup Dumpling with Pork, Luffa and Scallop (Very beautiful to look at but not enough soup inside and the flavor was average)
-House Special Crispy Chicken (The bf liked this a lot; I thought it was a little bland)
-Beef Noodle Soup (The noodles were ok, the soup was good and the beef was fabulous)
-Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef (Wow! This was so good. We ordered it to take it to go but ended up devouring the whole thing half way through the meal. It was definitely the best thing we got).

Four items cost about $45 w/ tax and tip. While it wasn't the cheapest Chinese meal ever, we were so satisfied.
