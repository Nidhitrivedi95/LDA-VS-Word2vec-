Perfect date night spot. It is dark and intimate. The loud atmosphere forces you to get close to who ever you are with... or yell. 

I have tried most of their menu items (they haven't changed much with the exception of their specials). My personal favorite is the three cup chicken. It is a huge portion of chicken and rice with a tomato salad. Other favorites include the dumplings, wood-fired oven pizzas, and pretty much everything else on the menu. 

Don't miss it. They don't have a sign, but the atmosphere will draw you in from the street.
