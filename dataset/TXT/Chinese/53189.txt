cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw I can't believe I haven't written a review for my favorite Chinese Food restaurant in the East Valley.  I must go to this restaurant at least once a month.  It is so good and it is around the corner from me.

The lunch specials are an amazing deal and the dinner portions are huge.  My favorite is the chicken & broccoli, house fried rice, sesame chicken, and the egg rolls.  Let me go back to the egg rolls for a minute.  They are some of the best you can get.  I think I went there once and got just egg rolls and rice.  Yep...they're that good.  I love this place!!
