tw8I1hZdlGpwO2QaAIeQWg We never ever go to a buffet because I am always afraid of the freshness and quality of the food you get at them. But we heard about this place and decided to give it a try. 

Well..... our buffet fears were unfounded. Fuji's food was fresh, delicious and the variety was fantastic. It was well above average and the price was outstanding. They have a happy hour special for seniors that is $6.99 including your drink. You can't beat that! Regular adult price is only $7.99 for lunch and $10.99 for dinner, but still a bargain. 

What is great is that they also have a Hibachi Menu. You pick out what you want and they cook it in front of you. It includes beef steak, chicken, shrimp, crabmeat and fresh vegetables, rice and noodles. 

They also have outstanding sushi. No fishy, slimy taste that can come from old sushi that has been sitting around. They make it in front of you with a large selection of specialty rolls. Their sushi rolls are fresh with quality ingredients. We were pleasantly surprised. We will definitely return.
