yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA 24hr pho in Vegas? Definitely a need when you've had a few drinks for the night, which is why my friends and i came here. It's not too far off the strip, which is a plus and it's open 24hrs.

Food wise i would say this place could do better, but it's not bad. The only problem i have with this place is when I ordered a Large Pho Tai i was given only 6 slices of meat (lol a large and all you get is 6 slices of beef??)

The prices at Pho Kim Long is a bit pricier than i'm used to for pho (around $8 a bowl), but since we were in Vegas I wont be complaining that much on the price

Overall it was a decent experience and i would recommend anyone who has a hangover or is just drunk to try this place out
