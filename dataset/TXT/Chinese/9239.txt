By reading these reviews you probably know there's a salad and dessert bar at the back of the restaurant. Our waitress failed to mention this and we only found out when going to the washroom near the end of our meal (we were seated near the entrance) 

The selection at lunch was fairly limited, service ridiculously slow for AYCE (we got our taro chips 30 minutes into the meal), sushi rice was FALLING APART, and our torched sushi was way overcooked. 

Regardless, their fish tasted fresh and some of their bizarre maki rolls were tasty. Definitely not planning on coming back, but not the worst place to go if you're really craving sushi.
