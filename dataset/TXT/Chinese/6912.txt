0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw Just finished the best takeout ever and it deserves a rave.  The sweet and pungent chicken was recommended and a very good choice.  We ordered it slightly spicy,  Next time more spice but still a ton of flavor - not quite orange chicken not general's either.  A citrus sweet makes your mouth pucker a little yet spicy combo taste.  The chicken is thinly sliced pieces in a portion  enough for one very hungry teenage son or two meals for me. Will get this again and maybe I'll get more than a taste next time before it vanishes,

Got the shrimp fried rice too.   Big flavorful shrimp makes this a winner.

The owner stressed everything is chopped and made up fresh for each order.  15 minutes is not a long wait anywhere.
