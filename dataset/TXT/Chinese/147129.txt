They do no salt for my Mom's dishes and when they found out I was vegan they offered to make me veggie spring rolls instead of the usual pork ones.

also, the salt and pepper tofu entree is AMAZING. crispy fried yumminess.

I always go take-out (order on your way to grocery shopping and it will be ready by the time you get through Smith's checkout) so I can't comment on the decor. Dated but clean.
