TWkL-VHo6P-WwL8iTvqlYQ Pei Wei certainly is more of a "fusion" restaurant than authentic asian. That said, for fast food they have a decent menu. My own preference is the Thai Dynamite with chicken. I always ask for "extra spicy" in order to turn up the heat - but it's still not what I would call "Thai hot"!  :-)
