wNgzPOtnHE1prmh3bzWR1g Happened to be in the area and was craving Chinese at the time, so I thought I'd try this place. "How bad could it be", you can't really go wrong with Chinese....Boy was I wrong. The food was awful. I had the Won Ton soup which was very bland, and it didn't have green onions, like the typical Won Ton soup. I also had the beef fried rice, which lacked in flavor and was more of a steamed brown rice. The beef wasn't edible being that I couldn't chew it. Lastly the spring roll was cold and tasted as if it had been sitting for awhile. I hate giving bad reviews, but this place was horrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
