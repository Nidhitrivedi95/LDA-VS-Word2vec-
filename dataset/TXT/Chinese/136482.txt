qGLEE1yA1bK0YdlGI-S39A Was looking for some Chinese comfort food in Sauga and Wonton Chai Noodle hit the spot, right on.

I'm from Scarborough and frequently visit Chinese places in Markham/Richmond Hill and since moving to Mississauga I have struggled to find the same quality, price point, and overall experience in any other Asian restaurants out west.

The restaurant decor is nothing special/spectacular but they're not trying to be anything pretentious and you're not going take your date here for your special anniversaries either. 

Wonton Chai Noodle is the real deal with authentic handmade egg noodles and quality made dumplings and wontons.  The menu is on a small card with limited but specialty choices with varying portion sizes including an option for "extra noodles" for $2 :) (which was fantastic btw).

We'll be regulars to Wonton Chai Noodle from now on.
