CuIPocteo1F3LEn1OqUoHg Can't say we'll be coming back to this place anytime soon.  Hot and sour soup was thick and oily - hard to taste any flavor with that texture.  Biggest complaint with the General Tso's was the size of the chicken.  Too large = too little breading to chicken ratio, plus the sauce was a cheap imitation.  I didn't try my wife's szechuan chicken but she didn't seem enamored of the dish.  We'll be looking elsewhere for our chinese fix in the future.
