I didn't really know what I was getting into when I bought a groupon for Mystical Zen. I thought it would be more like a traditional massage, and it wasn't. She explained the service as acupuncture without the needles. It was interesting....maybe not something I would do all the time, but if you are looking for this service, this is a great place to get it.
