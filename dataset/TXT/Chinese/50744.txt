cGQKUOAZm_VHcQOJWbatog First of all, I LOVE pfchangs, but I  recently visited here and had really bad experience. The waitress hardly paid any attention to us. The hostess had to like help her. I even wanted to order a to-go...but I couldn't find her, so I just went up to the bar and ordered it.  I'm a server myself, so maybe I had high expectations. ..but I still tipped her like 12 on 30. I still love it though.  I'm not gonna be an asshole and say "I'm never coming back" bc I know i will, lol.
