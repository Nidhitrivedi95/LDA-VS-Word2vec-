OnGPegQGuQ5_uuFLvezvKw I've had food from Shun Lee since I was a kid. If you are looking for a new take on american chinese cuisine, it's not gonna wow you, but if you like old school style, it's the place for you. I personally love the Royal Chicken. The menu has good variety and I've yet to be disappointed by their food yet. If you are in the area, give it a shot. It might just surprise you.
