ruHEkBY2ysclSFIcai4tfg I ordered a few items off the menu for delivery through Just Eat and was told that the maximum waiting time would be 45 minutes. After nearly an hour of waiting, I called the restaurant to ask if our food was on the way and they said "yes." They honestly must have started cooking our food after we called, because the delivery man didn't show up at our door for another 40 minutes. 

As for the food itself, it was incredibly bland and perhaps the worst Chinese food I've ever had. 

I would not recommend this place to ANYONE.
