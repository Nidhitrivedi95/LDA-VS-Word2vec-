ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg The food was great, the service was better
Ordered Kung pow chicken 4/5 the monkey mushroom 5/5 
Chinese green 5/5 n the Iran noodles 5/5
The best part is view 
Best seats to view the fountains 
When in Vegas do go here for the view, when they start the music plays in the restaurant too
Overall a pleasant dinning experience 
Only negative a bit pricy for the quantity, but it's Bellagio
