When I got there friendly greeting by the host but than when it came to the server; he got to our table gave us waters and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else to drink but automatically asked if we were ready to order our food . Excuse me first thank you for the water but shouldn't you ask if I want something else and than out of that time getting our drinks give us time to look at the menu. Than when we actually placed our order I understand that there specialty is tom yum soup so I understand they have a big batch ready to go; what i had ordered was tom yum, Mongolian beef and shrimp fried rice . So I understood the soup was coming out ahead of the rest but 20 mins ahead come one I didn't order much and I don't only want soup . Thru out those 20 mins of just having soup he did not once come once to ask if we were ok or if needed anything else and I observed around there was a big party 8-12 people who look to be enjoying there food and I seen when they brought there feast in and so I was ready for mine . Than when I finally became annoyed of just having soup 20 mins I finally decided to cancel the rest of my order. Than when the server asked why I stated that I didn't just want soup than he tried and justify by saying the soup always comes first which I told him yes the soup maybe ready before because you have a big batch but it's common curtesy you bring all food together just like they brought the huge party the soup with the rest of there food . My mom wasn't a big fan of the soup so when I said " ok wait for the rest of the food" and 20 mins passed and I was eating the soup by myself believe that ; that was not the lunch I wanted to have with my mom on our day off . Point being soup was a 2 1/2 out of 5 . & I will not be coming again and will not recommend.
