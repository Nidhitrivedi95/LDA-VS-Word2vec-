eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g I came here for dinner on Saturday, the whole restaurant is full. Better to make reservation. 
The front reception has no smile We didn't feel welcomed as the first time customers. 
This is my impression when I stepped in this restaurant.  The decor looks modern and clean. I enjoyed walking through the corridor with fish and seafood tanks along my way to the inside area.

Food quality : average
Price : overpriced
Service: average 
Will i return to dinner ? I think it is not worth to spend this much on seafood. Can give a try.
The lobster is deep fried, all I tasted was garlic , salty sauce and fried meat . I cannot recognize the taste of lobster . You can order steam.  The oil was excessively used on vegetables , we had veggie in soup but it is covered oil on the top. That could be improved. The excitement of seeing huge giant lobster maybe over the excitement of eating. The taste is nothing special. 

But I will return to try their dim sum.

** thank you for your follow up !looking forward to try the dim sum
