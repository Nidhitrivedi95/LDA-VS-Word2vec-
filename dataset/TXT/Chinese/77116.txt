GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw This place has really authentic Chinese food! I am not a huge spicy eater but they cooked it in mild upon our request. Was still a little spicy to us but food was fantastic. Had loofah with mushrooms, three pepper chicken, and water spoiled fillet/fish. Loved them all!!! Service was attentive as well. Would totally return if I am around!!
