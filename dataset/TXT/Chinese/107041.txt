L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA This Chinatown restaurant is well-located, easily seen from the street, and right next to my favorite tea house and Vietnamese food-to-go place.  However, I never felt the inspiration to stop by; last night a girlfriend was raving about the egg noodles, and so we ate here today for Sunday lunch.

The interior is definitely not as hopeful-looking as the exterior.  The service is pretty sporadic, you definitely have to make an effort to get the attention of the servers if you need something.

My friend was right about the noodles.  They were as fresh as egg noodles go and perfectly cooked (egg noodles are usually overcooked in most places).  I ordered the BBQ duck and pork & shrimp wonton noodle soup.  The wontons were a good size and very delicious.  The BBQ duck was all right, a little on the bland side.  The noodles certainly were the highlight.

I also judge Chinese restaurants by their complimentary tea pot, I believe it gives me a sneak peek of how much effort they put into their food.  Cafe Noodle's tea was made with tap water, I could taste the Vegas pipes, which means points have to be deducted.  

So if you crave egg noodle soup, stop by, but try to order everything you need all at once, and get a soda or bottled water for your refreshment.
