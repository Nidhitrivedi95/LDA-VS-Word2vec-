Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA Fifth time here now.  
They can never seem to get my order 100% right no matter what I order.   

Example -
Forgot my salad on two visits. 
Forgot to bring ice coffee until end of meal. 
Ask for level 3 spice on squid salad and they bring me level 69 of hell.   
Every time is something.   

Food -   it's no Lotus of Siam but if ur craving Thai beef noodle soup or duck curry, this place will do.
