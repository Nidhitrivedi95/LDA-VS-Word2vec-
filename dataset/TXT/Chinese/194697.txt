zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ The best thing on the menu --- WATER.

Came here for Winterlicious on a whim. 
We tried out: the BBQ pork bun, chickpea fritter bun, mushroom dan dan mian for the both of us, and the Milk Bar soft serve.

Let's begin with the "highlight of the day" -- Mushroom Dan Dan Mian. I feel like a camel while eating this because it seemed like salt didn't cost anything and I probably ingested a week's worth of sodium. Definitely PACKED with some salty flavours. Desperate times call for desperate measures and my friend asked for hot water in hopes of diluting the sauce. Response from our waiter: We don't serve hot water. Are you kidding me...

We thought we could end things on a better note with our soft serve because how can you mess up ice cream right? For some reason, our first reaction when we tasted the ice cream was: BAMBOO?? Except pandas probably have tasted better bamboo. After a while it started to taste like milk that has been drenched in corn flakes cereal. To each their own but not really up my alley. 

However, the BBQ pork bun and chickpea fritter bun saved themselves two stars. I think I was just relieved it wasn't packed with salt, but they weren't bad. A busy and hyped up place in my opinion. Nice decor though, pretty modern and industrial but damn those chairs are heavy.
