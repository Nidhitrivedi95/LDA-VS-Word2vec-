CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw Was at the SLS today in search of a good lunch.  As it was chilly in Las Vegas I was craving a huge bowl of hot soup.  The menu at Ku Noodle appeared to be the answer.

We decided to split jumbo soups and make that lunch.  The Congee soup was 5 star while the Superior Wonton was 3.  The Congee soup had a lovely thick texture with flawless flavor.  The Chinese sausage and crunch water chestnuts? combined truly worked.  We both loved it and scraped the bowl clean.  The Superior Wonton soup had nice wontons and bok choi.  However, something was amiss with the broth and it needed to be served a few degrees hotter.  

We had 4 star service and the prices were fair considering the fact we were at a Jose Andres establishment.

I shall most definitely return as there are many items on the menu I wish to try.
