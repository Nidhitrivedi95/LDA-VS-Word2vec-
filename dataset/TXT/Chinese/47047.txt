bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A They have never messed up an order, which is huge, for over a year and a half, when I discovered them having moved from LA.  Never ever.  As well, always consistently delicious.  Super fast delivery!!!  Not pretentious, NO MSG, white meat chicken!, and best of all a super sweet staff.  Not one error ever.  That says something about a joint.  The best, and AFFORDABLE, on the Westside.  If you go anywhere else it's either for an 'atmosphere' thing.  Or you want cheap fast food Chinese like Panda Express.  Otherwise, the best in the biz.
