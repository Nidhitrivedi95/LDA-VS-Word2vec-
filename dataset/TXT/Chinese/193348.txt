ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ I am from the Bay Area where we are almost snobbish about places that try to have a hip foodie vibe. So imagine my surprise when I not only found a place outside of NorCal that pulls it off extremely well, but it's in Phoenix AZ no less. Place has a really cool vibe good drink menu and really good food menu. Can't wait to go back.
