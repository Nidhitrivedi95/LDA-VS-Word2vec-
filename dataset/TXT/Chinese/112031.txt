MDInVOKvIetk_OIpKd2Ofw Visited on a Saturday night with my partner and it wasn't too busy. We had D2 the spicy hand pulled noodles with beef but there was barely any beef and not spicy at all. The noodles were nice and chewy. 

The reason I gave 2 stars is the service was severely lacking. Two tables that came after us received their food before we even ordered. The waiter asked us what we wanted to drink but he forgot and we didn't receive our water until another staff member noticed. I ordered D2 and my partner ordered D3 but one of the servers made a mistake and served us both D2. My partner was tired of waiting so he ate it anyways. The staff noticed once they brought out D3 and they apologized. 

Overall, food is decent but the service was awful. There's better places for hand pulled noodles.
