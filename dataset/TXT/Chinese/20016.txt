5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ Went here last night with my boyfriend. We were celebrating our 4 year anniversary and were just looking for some drinks before the blue man group show started. We sat at the bar and started off with a Cosmo for me and a White Russian for him. Those drinks were on point, but we decided to try something more adventurous, one of their signature cocktails called the Mango Dragon sounded nuts. Can't remember all the ingredients, but it had mango, rum and jalapeños. Our bartender, Wayne (who was pretty much the coolest most down to earth guy in all of Vegas) warned us that it was pretty spicy. I said go light on the spice and it turned out to be one of the best drinks I've ever had in my life. Fresh jalapeños garnish this baby and the flavor combination is something I never expected to work, but it so does. We liked it so much we ordered the full strength version just to compare. My bf loved it, me, I'll stick to the weaker version. So if you ever find yourself in Vegas, at the Monte Carlo, hit up Wayne and ask for the Mango Dragon! You won't regret it
