s0kM86trPEkOKv3quDnoGw Typical Hong Kong style cafe. Interior is pleasant. Price very reasonable. Breakfast is Ok, but otherwise, the food is just so-so. Overly salty in most cases, especially Spaghetti Bolognese, which is supposed to be a tad sweet. Milk tea was really good one time, but disappointing (stale and too milky) the next...inconsistent quality.
