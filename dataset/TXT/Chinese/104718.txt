KPtD6L5GpfbNV5stjyIK6Q I ate here probably hundreds of times in the early 90's when this place opened in the River Square Plaza and was called simply "Schezuan". 

After a several year hiatus (due to geography) I was happy to see that they were still around and had changed the name to the snappier "Dragon".  

I don't know if there was a change of ownership along with the name change, but the service is a friendly as it ever was, which is to say VERY.  

This is really good greasy spoon Chinese, with some random Thai dishes thrown in.  The prices are really inexpensive, and usually orders are are ready in a very short amount of time (10-15 minutes). 

Despite being just a little bit farther away than three or four other Chinese take-out places, this has become our go to spot.  Check them out.
