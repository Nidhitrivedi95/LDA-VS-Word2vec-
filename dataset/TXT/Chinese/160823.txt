uBZjhmmqzIwxdTeIKopCEg I really enjoyed my lunch today. I had Orange chicken, fried rice, crab ragoon, and egg roll. 

The Orange chicken was very good. Lightly breaded and fried WHITE meat. It was covered slightly in a nice Orange glaze served with real carrots, onions, zucchni and real orange hunks too. It was not overly fake orange flavored or overly sweet. It was alot like Bamboo Grill's orange chicken. (One of the best I have had)

The fried rice was good but didn't have a real flavor or any kind. It was a little bland. (Maybe ask for spicey fried rice)

The egg roll was good and I am not a huge fan of them. It was full adn cooked perfectly. It had a good flavor too. 

The crab ragoon or whatever they call it was good. Nothing special. 

The best thing was the price. $4.13 after a 15% discount for trying them out. NOT BAD AT ALL. 

The deliver too. (As mentioned earlier) 

PS They serve breakfast too. American style breakfast.
