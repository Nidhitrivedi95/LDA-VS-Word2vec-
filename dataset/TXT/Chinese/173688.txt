W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g I did not particularly enjoy my meal here, but on the other hand, it was not bad.  Hence the three stars.  The food was OK and average at best.  The minced chicken lettuce wraps were good.  The fried tofu with vegetables were good and plentiful.  The calamari with chilis were good too.  All the food was seasoned alright but could have been a little more spicy.  But for the average American palate, I guess it was seasoned OK.  We also ordered an order of chicken satay which was a huge disappointment....don't ever order this dish here.  It was three skewers of chicken meat fried in a frying pan with no flavoring; and they do not have Thai peanut sauce to accompany it, although the menu says it does.  What a disappointment.

The place also was very cold.  The inside temperature was about 68 degrees and they have no booths, only small tables.

I don't think I will return for another meal, with so many other Asian restaurants with better food.
