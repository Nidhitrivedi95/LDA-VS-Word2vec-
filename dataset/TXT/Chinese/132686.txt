pr4ZaLR1Zxi7InMCPYMm-A Glad to have stumbled upon this neat-o place. Bummed it doesn't have more activity though. I'm used to the hustle and bustle of China Town in L.A and S.F.
The supermarket there has ready to eat food, ie: duck and pho. Other neat things to buy too like tea sets, pots, fresh live fish, crab, clams, gooey duck, etc and a bakery.
