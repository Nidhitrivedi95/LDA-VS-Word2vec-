Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Ok, here's the deal. 
This place has a great selection of traditional dim sum choices.  Not the best in the world, but still excellent. 
Here's the kicker. . Orchid Garden serves their dim sum from mid morning until LATE in the evening.  
This is a great concept, seeing as many times I want dim sum at other than the traditional serving times. 
I have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. 
Try it, you'll love it! 
Staff here is very nice and prompt.
