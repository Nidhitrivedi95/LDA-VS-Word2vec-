cJzv3fbd7jL2ZHyFosFkOw Food was a bit pricey.  Shrimp Lomein was dark colored and thinned tasteless noddles.  They didn't deliver something as simple as duck sauce!  And the wonton soup was horrible!  Wontons were kinda like dumplings, except they don't serve dumplings.  And the texture of the "wonton's dough" was thin, and tasted nothing like a decent soup....  Anyways; the eggroll was really good!  I think they gave us a 3rd one for free, and it had me craving for more!  

But unfortunately, I doubt we will order again from them.
