OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw How do you rate a place you ate at when you were highly inebriated? The food at Chang's was solid from what I could tell, though maybe cardboard would've done the trick the state I was in. I didn't try the dim sum, but the string beans Szechuan style,
deep fried whole fish, Szechuan Eggplant, and short ribs with garlic were all good, nothing terribly gloppy or oversweetened like some Chinese joints. I have to say, however, that the paper inside the fortune cookie was WAY underseasoned. Can't a guy eat a decent fortune these days?
