c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ When 5 drunk girls are starving at 5 in the morning, Victorian Cafe is the mother truckin' jamalam. All the other ladies had the 3 egg special and I had the steak and eggs since I'm extra fancy.  I never order rare steaks but apparently Drunk Shannon has other ideas but it was delicious in direct proportion to the price  ($6.99.)  SO much toast! My only complaint is that we never got water refills (and I NEEDED water for real) but overall I say Victorian Cafe brings the cheap eats with true Vegas aplomb.
