q_c2ZvPJJxYEFPoWMKY2vQ being turned down right in front of the door, it was really unpleasant experience. you should make sure the NO KIDS sign in every of your restaurant advertisement even for tourists . some tourists walk and look for the direction hard enough and tired enough with hungry toddlers to find that you not accepting any kids. maybe it would nicer if you understand what our feeling at that time by recommending other place nearby so that we don't need to spend browsing a new place to eat!
