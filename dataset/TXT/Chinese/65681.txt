Honey seared (battered and fried, really) shrimp was okay (though over sauced and got really sweet/heavy near the end), but lacked the chili oil kick and rice stick crunch it was supposed to come with.  Brown rice was well cooked.  Snickerdoodle cookie was tasty.  Water cup was tiny, and their water irks me in that you have to load the cup with ice as the water comes out warm.  The cashier didn't know what was in menu items and directed me to the takeout menu that listed ingredients.

Sadly, they keep removing things from the menu, including my mom's favorite Korean beef lettuce wraps.  She said the current chicken ones are too bland.
