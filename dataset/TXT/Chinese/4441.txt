_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Pros - Very tasty at a good price for the set meal of 4 for the Lobster & Crab menu. Couldn't finish it. 

Cons - they don't take CC.  WHAT! They said they were willing to take USD.  So by the end of our meal, the hostess counted the $$ in front of us to make sure we had enough CAD to pay our bill including tip. 

My waitress never came back to check if we needed to change plates.  By time I was a full, another waitress showed up and was very apologetic that it wasn't done.  

Would come back because the seafood was so good; just don't expect exceptional service.
