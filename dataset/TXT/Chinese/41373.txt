B41kSVjdFOwOrZTuJaTF7g We were told about this place when visiting, and it was only 3 miles from the hotel we were staying, so give it try.  Very flavorful and with large portions.  The price is very reasonable compare to the states.  But it is a very busy restaurant on the weekend (with limited staff).  So we ordered take out (note it takes a while wait as well, but the wait is worth it).  I think you can order online and pick up, which save times.
