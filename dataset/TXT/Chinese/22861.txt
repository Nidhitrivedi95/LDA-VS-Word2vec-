6qkNhpgMYE6y3eHurFq6yw I've had Mai Mai before but this visit was definitely my last!! Ordered the Cantonese beef chow mein expecting some crispy noodles at least. Noodles were overlooked and mushy and zero flavour. General Tso tasted exactly like sweet and sour sauce not general Tso whatsoever. And the chicken fried rice was extremely burnt and no flavour at all. Don't come here.
