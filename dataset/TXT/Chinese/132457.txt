pofDmHoIsdvPcSKzb2iMag I've been here a couple times now, and I'd have to say it's okay. I wouldn't jump up and down and rave to friends about it, but it's a good deal. It's on the top floor of what I call the chinese Eatons centre at Dundas and Spadina. 
It's really a place for dim-sum on the weekends, and they have some interesting dishes moving around on carts, not just the standard steamed everything in little baskets. It's definitely catering to a more chinese crowd with more visits from ladies with chicken's feet than shrimp dumplings. 
The food isn't fantastic, but definitely better than boarderline. While it's chaotic, they do service you well. I'm sure I'll end up here again soon.
