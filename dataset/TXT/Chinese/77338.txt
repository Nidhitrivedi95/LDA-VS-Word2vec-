GeZiOW34ZL6jC9g-mq9QvA I've been eating at Hop Hing for more than ten years.  I always get the sesame chicken combo with pork fried rice and an egg roll.  Sometimes I will get a side of beef lo-mein or won ton soup.  
The sesame chicken always tastes fresh and you can tell it was fried to order opposed to sitting under a hot lamp or in a crock pot.  The chicken is good quality meat and generally there aren't any fatty or grissely pieces or any grotesquely large pieces.  The sauce is a standard sesame chicken sauce.  The egg rolls usually come steaming hot.  They are well sized crispy and tasty, sometimes I will order an extra one.  The beef lo-mein is very good.  It comes in larger portions and its always hot.  The beef pieces are good quality meat.  The won ton soup is good as well.

Great place to go to for quality chinese carryout.
