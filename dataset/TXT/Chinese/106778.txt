l_uAw0K2lkOsyVJATcnwsA I'm not a big fan of ramen but lover of spicy food.
This place have a serious spicy broth.
Similar to a hotspot place, you pick your toppings like fish balls, vegetables, noodles and such, than you proceed to the counter and you may request for more protein option, broth and herbs like cilantro or green onions.
You will get your spoon and chopsticks, pick a table (communal) and you wait for the meal to come to you. Food taste is good, nice presentation.
This place used to be Tera Lab Japanese modern food. Decor is still the same.
I would come back again.
