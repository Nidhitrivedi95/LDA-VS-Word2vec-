bPLyOh-ul8azUSgZmyR2vg Decent Chinese restaurant. Lunch specials are reasonable and come out quickly. Dim sum selection is good but can be a bit greasy. BBQ pork and roast duck isn't bad. 
Not a lot of Chinese restaurants on the north end of Markham which is why I eat here more often than I normally would if there were other options.
