p2OOk46G_AOO0nCWl-eVlg Pei Wei is a decent Chinese restaurant in Arrowhead. I am always disappointed at the long waits and sometimes there are flies. I once waited almost 45 minutes for take out. Come on.. One should never wait more than ten minutes for Chinese. Other than that.. Food is good and the portion sizes are big.
