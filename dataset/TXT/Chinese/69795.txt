F_D-hssVHgarfpqWbFdXow I've been here a few times already while visiting since my family lives just up the street. I went last Wednesday (92/15) and was just as pleased as previously.

The food was fresh and cooked to perfection. Clean and presentable. Lots of options. Our serve was nice although he never came back and asked if we wanted refills. We only saw him when we initially seated and then when it was time for the checks. I had my 1yr old nephew with me and they were extremely accommodating. They did charge us $2 for feeding him food off of our plates (he had like 3 French fries)

Overall I think it was well worth the price. Next time we will go on the weekend so we can get some crab legs.
