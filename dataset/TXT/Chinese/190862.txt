YpnvKqeVD7dqZ9Mr0SGw6A A lot of people working, but seemed no one was in charge.  Place only had 5 sets of customers, yet took forever to get our meals.  Staff used rags to wipe tables to hold our plates.  One employee kept wiping her nose with her finger over and over.  I wonder if she has a food handlers card.
