zs710LuQ8y10YsQHIjxjyw Food is cheap service is fast. Ambiance is lacking obviously since it's like a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. But i think that was the feel they were going for in order to offer their customers cheaper prices. The food was really good and for the price that you pay it's pretty worth it. We had lots of dumplings for 4 people. Some of the noodle dishes and also the cold dishes were excellent. I have nothing but a good review for this Dumpling House because anyone can eat here without having to feel pretentious. The food is honest and fairly quick if you're super hungry.

Con:
Though this does not relate to the restaurant itself but the Plaza is really difficult to find parking space. I noticed most of the drivers coming to this Plaza can't even drive and end up honking at each other constantly LOL. Just a word of advice if you're coming during Peak dinner time then I would come a little bit early before 7 otherwise it's pretty hard to get a parking space here.
