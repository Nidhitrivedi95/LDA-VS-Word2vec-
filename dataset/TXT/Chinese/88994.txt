I2ymNzdo4nZG30U1TAmSew We have been going to this place regularly for a couple of years now. The food is always fresh and tastes great. We usually just order take out and pick it up ourselves and sometimes eat in. The dinning room experience isn't the best the service is good just the place fills up with beer drinkers watching the game. 

Don't right off this place on the curb appeal. We did for many years and so glad that we have them a shot. This is our goto place for a great Chinese food.
