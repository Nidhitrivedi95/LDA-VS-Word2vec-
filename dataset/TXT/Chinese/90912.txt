IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Needed soup after a three-hour drive from Utah with a sore throat. Noodles seemed like the perfect place. I got the Duck Noodle Soup and it hit the spot. It wasn't seasoned much, but a scoop of chili sauce helped clear my sinuses. 

My friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken, which she wasn't impressed with. The smaller chicken pieces were almost entirely breading and were very hard. She wished she had ordered my lunch. 

The staff was polite, took our order, and brought our food out promptly. I did not have any issues with the service.

This place is pretty good, but you should make sure to order its namesake- NOODLES.
