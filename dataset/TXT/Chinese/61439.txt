You want healthy?  You got it.
You want vegetarian/vegan?  You got it.
You want your food to taste amazing?  You got it.
Service?  You guessed it.

A spicy cha cha might sound like something you might want to avoid, but don't look over this menu item at Loving Hut.  I don't even remember what was in it, and frankly I don't care... it was simply amazing.

Start with a variety of the spring/summer/egg rolls and get a few different dishes, because you're going to want to try as many as possible.

Next time I will definitely start with dessert.  I could see how you'd always end up too full after dinner, but they look too amazing to miss.
