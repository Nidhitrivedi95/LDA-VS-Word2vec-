Hope is an awesome bartender. She was a real sweetheart. We really enjoyed the drinks that she made us. They were unique and tasty. 

Random - two gentlemen next to us ordered beer and it was served in a tea kettle with tiny little cups. Super odd and dainty. I asked them and they weren't a fan either.
