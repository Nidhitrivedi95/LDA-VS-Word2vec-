DL7V1_chkWkZtyG4_xNYfw Good food for lunch, but I would not eat dinner here. 

I like the almond chicken, the cashew chicken and broccoli beef. Avoid the white rice. It is not as good for you as the brown, and Pei Wei tends to leave it in the pot too long after it is cooked. Which means my white rice was mushy and crunky at the same time. Bleagh!

Fast service from the time of order to the plate-slam on the table. Get in, get full, get out. 

This place is about 6 blocks north of the 7th Ave. exit from I-10, so it is possibly a rest stop for the through traveler going somewhere else.
