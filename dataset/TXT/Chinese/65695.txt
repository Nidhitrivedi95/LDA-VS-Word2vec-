ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw Wow ~ from Pei Wei Asian Diner to Marketplace.  What interesting yummy food changes and the property is beautiful and very chic.  My son let me know we are going back again today.   He was all about the meatball sandwich and sweet potatoe fries.
As always ~ way to go Pei Wei, you keep current with the times and your customers likes.   This is a winner.
