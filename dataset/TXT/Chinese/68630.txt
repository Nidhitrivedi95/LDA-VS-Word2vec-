eV-5b1Bjtnn-QePN3t3taQ I absolutely love this place!!!! Everyone is always super nice. You can dine in or make a to go bowl. If you dine in for dinner it's all you can eat. They have a great variety of fresh vegetables you can choose from. Also they give you the option of different meats for you to choose from which includes chicken, beef, turkey, and pork. They have a few different sauces you can choose from for flavoring as well and a ton on noodles. You also will get the choice of white or brown rice or no rice at all. Everything is always cooked to perfection and they have different hot sauces and sweet chili sauces for you to put on top as well! If you go get a rewards card because after 10 stamps your next one is free! It's very inexpensive around $10 a person and it's something quick and healthy!
