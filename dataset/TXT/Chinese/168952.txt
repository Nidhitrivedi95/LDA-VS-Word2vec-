Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Outstanding food and a wonderful owner who sets the positive and friendly tone for the restaurant. I had the Tom Yum soup (#[17) and drunken noodle (#40). Both excellent but watch how hot you want it. They'll make it to your taste - but I d advise 3 unless you like it very spicy!
