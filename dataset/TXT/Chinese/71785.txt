fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A We were party of six. We were kinda worried because the server got an attitude.  We ordered our food. Server asked us if we want tea we said sure why not.... First of all he didn't tell us it cost $5 for the pot second of all after we filled our cups he took the pot without asking us, when it was still has tea.  He brings our food it was good. Than charged us for the tea that we were not able to finish and for the rice which we didn't order he just brought it with our food!!!! Before we left there was another table arguing about the same thing the rice and the tea. They didn't know they were being charged for those items as well.
