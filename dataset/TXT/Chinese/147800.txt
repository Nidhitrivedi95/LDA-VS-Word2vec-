Tianjin Fine Food is a small family ran fast food dumpling place inside First Markham Place Food Court. Everything is made to order here, you can watch how they busily making all the dumplings from scratch.

Leek and Pork Dumplings and Xiao Long Bao ($6.25 each)
- Both of them has really heavy and doughy skin.. and a little chewy too
- The fillings has a lot of seasonings... more on the salty side
- a little more pricier than other places... but they are bigger in sizes... and are quite filling too!

So if you want a more homey dumplings... you should give Tianjin Fine Food's dumpling a try... but if you like those dumplings that has thinner skin, you would not enjoy them at all!
