U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ Great place to eat.  Family owned business.  We have yet to be disappointed.  The prices are reasonable, and the portions just as reasonable.  We always enjoy ourselves and have gotten to know the staff -all of them are great.  Our usual hostess is single BTW.  Ask her out on a date.  Tell her the guy who drinks Vietnamese iced coffee late at night suggested it (and it is delicious BTW).
