IFXL6wMLBgBSGSiLBjtViA I will never come back to this restaurant. 

The food was mediocre and the service was even worse. When I spoke to the manager, I learned that he was mostly employing his friends. That would explain why nobody was attentive and every single time I needed something, I had to go running around the restaurant to find a server. I saw "staff" out front playing with their phones while I was trying to flag them down so they could take my order. Terrible.
