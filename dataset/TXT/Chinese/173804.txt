WAb6ox5RrBtF7m5Cb6p56Q Way overpriced, and underwhelming, the staff is very nice however. 

Me and a friend ordered from here twice, and both times, the delivery times took forever (45 mins-90mins!), the food was greasy and underwhelming, also we found gross charred remains in our food (probably fell off from something in the kitchen)!

I don't know how the rest of the menu is, but you couldn't pay me to eat here again!
