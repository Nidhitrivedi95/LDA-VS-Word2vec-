88ntJxZNxRIY8W_hji9pzg Terrible terrible service. First off, I've found a piece of hair on my tea cup. When I asked for a new one, the waitress took her time to replace that for me. Then. it took us over 30 minutes to get the food. When we wanted the waiter to check with the kitchen, he spoke with the chef and did not even come back to give us an update on it. Waiters and waitresses were avoiding our table until the food was ready from the kitchen. Service is completely unacceptable!!!!! If we weren't very hungry when we first got here, we would have walked out. I will not recommend anyone to come here.
