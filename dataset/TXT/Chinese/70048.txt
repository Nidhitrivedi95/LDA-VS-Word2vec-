f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ The food was delicious and waiter was so sweet and friendly.  They were serving pot stickers not dimsum because we were late.  I asked the waiter for tips on what to eat and he recommended sizzling steak and told me it was his favorite dish and that he hoped I liked it too. So adorable and the dishes we ordered were great too. They served hot tea which was delicious too. Then the waiter gave us a warm dessert to try. It was very nice.  We enjoyed the food and service.
