E-wETrdq1uImd6lX6x8Qxw Had my all you can eat dinner here with my family to celebrate my sisters birthday- they never miss to keep our belly full, the taste, quality, quantity and service is always consistent. Down side I wish we don't have to line up to pay for the table, other than that me and my family will keep coming back. Best Mongolian hot pot so far I've been to in the city. Worth it.
