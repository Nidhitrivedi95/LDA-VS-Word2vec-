I haven't dined in here but did phone in with a fairly large takeout order. The waiter was very helpful and courteous. The food was prepared on time and was ready for me when I arrived, packaged and ready to go. Surprisingly they use plastic containers for some of the dishes, not just the cheap styrofoam boxes (I think they use the plastic containers only for the dishes that are prone to having some sauce spilling).

Here are a few noteworthy items I tried:
-Veggie fishes on iron plate - Basically deep fried bean curd-like stuff with some soy weed to give it a fishy taste, topped with some sauce/gravy of some sort. I've had something similar before at other veggie restaurants and this was pretty good.
- General Tao's chicken - standard breaded and deep fried soy chunk with a General Tao sauce; yummy; probably the highlight of the meal for those unfamiliar with vegetarian food
- Stir fried green beans with soya chops - some of my friends really enjoyed this
- Mock beef w/ bean sprouts and stir fried rice noodle - meant to be a take on a popular Cantonese dish; the noodles were done decently but I've always found the mock beef to be lacking in terms of its texture and flavour

Servings were very generous and the price was terrific value.

It's not the best Chinese vegetarian restaurant around (there are better options in Markham or even close by at Kensington market - if you want more unique experiences go there instead), but the value is excellent here. It's simple, nofrills stuff, but tasty and hits the spot.
