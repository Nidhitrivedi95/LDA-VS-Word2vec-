pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I came here with my boss and coworker during a business trip in Vegas. Boss was not a huge fish fan but agreed to go after I nudged him a bit about it. 

We ordered the sea bass, a couple of entrees and some appetizers. I can't remember exactly what they were but one of the appetizers (hamachi) was so freaking amazingly good. The sauce was spot on. I finished the fish but kept the sauce as a dip for future dishes. It was that good. The sea bass was also delicious and everyone at the table agreed on its excellency. 

Price wise, of course it's more pricey $$$ but worth the ambiance, service, and sushi.
