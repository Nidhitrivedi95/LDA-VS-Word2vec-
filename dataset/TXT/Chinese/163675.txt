URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg Very surprised by the current rating of this spot (4 stars).  People always raved to me how amazing and authentic this place was.  After living in Phoenix for 2 years - I finally gave it a try.

Space - pleasantly surprised.

Food - My mom wondered aloud why she would be served dog food bc she's a person too

Wont go back.  

Go to New Hong Kong or Szechuan Palace or Panda Express or PF Changs for better asian food.
