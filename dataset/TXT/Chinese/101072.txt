K4-J1A_ZIzG2yNkee0KOaA USED to be good.

Walked in - loud, head-banging music (techno. pop crap) just about drove us insane.  Came in, said hello, was ignored.  And ignored more.  Cups/cutlery banging in to the used dishes bin by someone who looked as though she didn't want to be there.

First time in a long time.  Got up, and quietly left.  Miserable vibe.
