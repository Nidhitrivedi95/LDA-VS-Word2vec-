VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg Wanna start it off by saying their pork belly moco is the best. Sets me off that they're so inefficient. I had 1 order, and they had a big order right before me. Could've done mine 1st before starting the big order, now I'm waiting here for 20 min just for 1 plate. Better management skills are needed, that's it. Foods great.
