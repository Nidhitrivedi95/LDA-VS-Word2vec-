N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ After trying to come here for a while i  came here tonight with my friend and we had the jerk lobster, coconut rice with oxtail and the jerk cantonese chow mein.

The coconut rice with oxtail was my favourite. This dish reminds me of west indian cookup rice with pepperpot and some chinese bbq pork skin on top. However the rice portion was really small! The rice had to be like 1/4 cup and the grains were small and broken. The oxtail was soft and sweet and pretty good.

The jerk lobster was second fav. Coated with loootss of breading it was kind of cantonese maggi sauce because it was quite tasty but really salty after a while even of sharing. A bit too greasy .. best to share this out!

Least fav  was cantonese jerk chicken. It was like reg canto chow mein but the sauce was not spicy at all and there wasnt much chicken to speak of. Didnt really like the sauce. My friend said it tasted bland.

Auto grat of 20% to a two person bill was kind of awkward. My friend asked if she could enter the tip amt and the 2nd option was still 18??? Thats a new one never seen that.. service was good but place did get reallly loud.

As someone who is chinese hakka also caribbean roots  restaurant had some hi and low points. Hakka chinese places abd jamaican places  are both generally way spicier it was a bit of a hipster cop out on some dishes.
