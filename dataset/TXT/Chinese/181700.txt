XEKx5litKe1KkfJpqtmJUw Food is consistently good.  Price is reasonable. Service needs improvement.  Establishment needs major renovation, especially the bathroom.  Needs to get rid of their carpet.  

We visit Toronto annually and have been coming here for the last 5 -6 years.  We've dine in as well as order out.  Our visit in 2015 we were served by one of their worst waitress.  I think she was a new hire.  The woman appears to hate her job.  Our food were practically thrown at us.  Brought us the wrong order but act as if she'd done nothing wrong.

We came back again this year.  We had planned to order out since got there late and did not want to wait.  They did not have a take-out menu so I asked to "borrow" their regular menu for my friend to browse (since I cannot read Chinese) before we placed our order.  The skinny old man refused to loan me the menu.  He said "You cannot take the menu outside of the restaurant, you have to come in." What is the big deal with a customer taking a menu out of the store?  It's not like I was going to sell their menu. 

I can tolerate the bad service but this is just ridiculous.
