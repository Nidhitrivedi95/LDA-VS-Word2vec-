eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ Going to become hooked. 
Hipster-ramen atmosphere.

Waitress was attentive.
Tried the spicy burrito and was AMAZING. The ramen was also outstanding.
Fresh, great, full,  flavor. 

Not really into the fact they lacked a variety of NON-alcoholic drinks (I understand to keep their hipster style they wouldn't enter a corporate agreement).  The matcha tea was $4 for "unlimited", but I noticed the second glass they made burning hot as to limit my "unlimited" consumption. 

The $1 charge for a "spice bomb" (spicy chili paste concoction) was absurd to say the least. Next time I'm bringing my own hot sauce.
The brunch sides were great for my child to eat at brunch. 

Will return.
