1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA The service here is really lacking and their food is not good enough to make up for it. I think the reason this place garners such glowing reviews is simply because of their prices.

We ordered wonton noodle soup, salt and pepper pork chop, fried wontons and curry with roti and the total was only $28. So definitely a steal. But idk, the server was pretty rude to me. They brought me the wrong dish at first and when I told him it was incorrect, he made some comment under his breath and when I said, "What?" he waved his hand and took the food away. The wonton noodle soup wasn't that great.

Overall, all the food was just very average but the service puts it at a 2. I don't mind horrible service at hole-in-the-walls when the food is spectacular, but when the food is super average AND the service sucks? No thanks, I'll take my business elsewhere.
