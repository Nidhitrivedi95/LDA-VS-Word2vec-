bI4emjU96ZvGQRTwxItd2w I ordered the Orange chicken and soup.  The soup was just good - I wanted a little more punch (either a bit more sour or a bit more heat or both).  It was definitely made in house which was good.  The chicken was very good.  I had it delivered and they delivered the chicken, rice and sauce in separate containers.  His kept the chicken from getting soggy which was a great way to get takeout.  Flavor was good and the portion very generous.
