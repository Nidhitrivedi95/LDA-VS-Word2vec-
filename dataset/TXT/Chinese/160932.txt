UC8SLfl2dpMd7ZXWvFYAUg The older woman working there is crabby. The food is below average Chinese. We have never had Shrimp Egg Foo Young with shrimp floating in gravy. They must not make the egg patties fresh. 
Egg rolls are gross! 
I never had sweet Szechuan. Where's the heat??
Won't be going back
