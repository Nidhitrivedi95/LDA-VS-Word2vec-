cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A I've never been a fan of fusion food. Fusion food has always struck me as overhyped and odd tasting for the sake of being hip. Then came Chino Bandido.

This place is amazing! Before you order, make sure to ask for samples. When I initially walked in, I had no idea what to order, but the girl at the register was super nice and helped me figure out what to order after testing out some of the meat options. I ended up getting a delicious combo meal with a side of rice, Jade Red Chicken, and a quesadilla with machaca. All of the flavors seem to fit perfectly together unlike a lot of fusion food experiments.

I'm not sure if this is a standard thing, but they even gave us a free snicker doodle cookie with each entree!! Way better than a fortune cookie in my opinion!
