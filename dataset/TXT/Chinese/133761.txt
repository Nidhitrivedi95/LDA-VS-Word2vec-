PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg Visiting Phoenix from Houston durring Spring Training so we were looking for somewhere that wasn't totally packed. Ran across Quik Chinese. We were a bit skeptical because it's a little hole in the wall in a shopping center and appeared a bit shady. It turned out to be an excellent decision! The wonton soup broth was some of the best I'd had. The General Tsos had great flavor, although it wasn't a "typical" General Tsos sauce. The egg rolls tasted like they had a hint of horseradish or wasabi, although the waiter couldn't confirm, that gave it a unique but tasty flavor. Overall, very very good.
