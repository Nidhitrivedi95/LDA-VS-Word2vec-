wShT0KXCW0ZAnNKdJr_1pg When we walked in the restaurant was really clean. Windows were clean, floor was clean, restrooms were clean. Really friendly staff. Food looked freshly made. Store manager was very polite he asked how were we doing, he asked us if everything was ok with our service. Very helpful manager.
