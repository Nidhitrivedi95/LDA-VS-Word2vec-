eC-duRpbiVsCD14oGYiDOA My boyfriend and I tried this place for the 1st time yesterday. We both ordered hibachi, I ordered chicken and noodles and he ordered a combo platter with chicken and shrimp. Staff worked quickly and were really friendly. The place was not packed however there were some people there. We did go on the early side though! The food came out quickly and it was yummy. Pretty standard hibachi, tasty and fresh. We did not try the sushi, they had a small sushi bar. Next time we will try it though, it looked very fresh. I think this place might be byob. I didn't see a drink menu. So I think it would be a great take out option for LV. My only complaints are there was no hibachi table and with our entrees we got salad that I did not eat because the lettuce looked like it had seen better days. We will try it again in the future though!
