NyGlEmuYcpZSKfk6IwJeSw We really need 1/2 stars. I'm torn between rounding up or down, and opting to round down until my next visit. 

It's a pretty decent venue with a minimalist approach, and definitely a break from the usual square options. They've got an okay looking cocktail menu, but nothing that really cried out to me. Beer selections were decent, as were the wine options. I'd say the pricing was pretty fair, but the cocktails seemed a little steep for what they were. 

I didn't think it was too busy for a Thursday night, but I'm told weekends pack in pretty well. Given how pricey the local real estate runs, that's gotta be crucial to long-term. The staff was polite and genuinely seemed to be having fun. 

My skewered shiitake were okay, as were the edamame and pork gyoza. They were fine, just nothing that makes me say that they were outstanding. Presentation didn't really exist for these dishes compared to some of the more involved ones like the tuna tartare, so I wasn't taking pictures. 

For the menu itself, this is where I get lost. They do a lot of standard items, such as your edamame, gyoza and buns. Then there are the skewer options, noodles in broth, and a selection of sushi/rolls. I had higher expectations of what I'd find here and it sorta fell flat. 

I'm not sure I understand how this can be labeled a gastropub, but I suppose the inclusion of wings, a burger and a steak & frites dish are now qualifiers. I appreciate the concept of the General Tso's cauliflower, but I think the cauliflower thing has been done too often at a lot of other restaurants. Outside of a few items, everything else was standardized Asian fusion, and I've had equally good options with less fanfare and easier parking. 

It's a Food Fight location, so take that as you will. I'm just not feeling very excited about it. Between the two options from Ding, I'll stick with Umami.
