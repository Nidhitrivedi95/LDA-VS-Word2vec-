taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg I was looking for some competition for my current favorite dumpling place, and unfortunately, Qing Hua didn't even come close! I guess I should've tried what everyone else ordered. 

We had the beef and onion fried dumplings and pork and green onion steamed dumplings. Other than the onions and green onions, they were totally flavorless. I'm not a huge fan of the sauces, so I'm looking for dumplings that can stand up on their own. We liked the fried dumplings much better than the steamed, which tasted a tiny bit funky.

Otherwise, the chairs were insanely loud and screechy--they need some feet!

Service was friendly and attentive.
