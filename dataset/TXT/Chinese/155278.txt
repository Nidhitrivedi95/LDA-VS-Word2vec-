TjuSHnbPtB83R-1FzdBBgA I had heard that the food was good here so on the weekend my husband and I have it a try. We tried the springs which were fresh and hot. We were given a sample of the salmon mini pizza sushi which was yummy. The salmon was very fresh. We split a hot pot soup which was really delicious. The soup was sweet and the veggies and meat were plentiful. We are trying to come up with another excuse to go back again soon.
