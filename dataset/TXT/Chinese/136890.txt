All in all a great place for healthy tasty Asian food. I have to stick with five stars. Too bad the don't ever run specials. Returned with five adults and one baby a two-year-old and we ordered a lot but $150 they are still pricy and for a Saturday night full but no wait also we left a $22 tip. Went for birthday got two free birthday desserts. Ice cream and banana fritters. Had American Express gift coupons.
