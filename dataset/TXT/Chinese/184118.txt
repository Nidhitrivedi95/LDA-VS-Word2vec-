xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I ordered Kung Pao chicken which is one of my favorite Chinese dishes. The  vegetables were fresh & abundant and the chicken was properly cooked. However, the meal was utterly bland and completely lacking in soul. The boba tea wasn't bad though it did have a bit too much ice. Service was the bright part of this dining experience - my waiter was quite efficient and polite.
