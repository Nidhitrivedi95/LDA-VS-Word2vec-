PM5vkmr8FqOIWE0pe3C2Fw We came here on a snowy afternoon so it was perfect for hotpot. They have a good selection of soup bases to choose from which is awesome as some other places I've been to have very limited options.

Once you've chosen your soup base you can order your food items from the waiter who is equipped with a tablet to take your order.
The selection of items to choose from is broad and the ingredients are pretty fresh. As with other hot pot places they forgot to bring some items that we ordered several times. We asked for multiple portions of items but they seem to always give us one serving. The worst was the lamb and beef which seemed to get less and less each additional plate we ordered.
My favourite items were the wonton, Spicy beef balls, the Taiwan tempura, and the ice cream for dessert.

Oh also don't forget to get your sauce from the sauce station. Lots of choices so there's bound to be something you'll like.

I would recommend this place as food and service was good as they came to refill our pots often and checked in to see if we needed more food. One more thing to note is that they only take debit or cash in case that affects your decision in any way.
