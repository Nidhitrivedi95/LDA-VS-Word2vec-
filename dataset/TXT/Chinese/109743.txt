LQ-gMAQLbPVxjrBYCJ1ApQ Yummy!!  We ate here on Saturday night and it was packed!  The food is sooo good even though it is not in that great of an area.  I ordered the orange chicken combo which came with egg drop soup (delish!), veggie egg roll, fried rice and a huge helping of orange chicken.  My husband also got the combo but with Mongolian shrimp and he enjoyed his dish as well.  And we took home a to-go box with another meal for a midnight snack!  :)   It was a very modertate price for the quality and quantity received.  I totally recommed this place and will be eating here more since it is really close to my workplace.
