DZWAS8k2F18CrAojI8meuQ Pretty decent food. They were very nice and friendly. As I walked out the door with the food I ordered the bag broke the lady came and picked it up went back and gave me new food without a blink of an eye. Wonderful service. It was a fair price too. The wontons were delicious. I will definitely go back again for the service they provided and while I was waiting on my to go order they gave me a free shot of some delicious alcohol beverage. :-)
