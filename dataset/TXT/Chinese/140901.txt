RAKSBqeNb-p_ZABwAWH_jA Came here for lunch many times as they have great lunch deals! Can't recall the exact details but I think I got 2 regular rolls, salad, miso soup and egg roll for $9.99. There's always 20% off check total coupons in local clipper magazine. The sushi here is decent but you can't beat all that food for just $9.99! You definitely don't go hungry and I usually can't finish all the food.
