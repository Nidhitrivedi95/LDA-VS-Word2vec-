fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg Surprisingly good! When I first saw this restaurant in Downtown Summerlin, I honestly didn't think the food here would be great. All of the good Chinese restaurants are in Chinatown aren't they? Although the food is not as awesome as what you would find in Chinatown, I thought it was pretty tasty and filling. My usual order is the BBQ Pork Fried Rice and the Steamed BBQ Pork Buns from their Dim Sum cart. The fried rice is always full of flavor and never dry. Portion size is what you normally see at a Chinese restaurant. I always take home leftovers! Kind of hard to screw up the BBQ Pork buns, but they are usually hot and fresh. One time it seemed like they were sitting out for a while and did not taste as good. It's kind of weird that they even have a Dim Sum cart when the restaurant is small and the tables are so close to each other. Although I have not tried it, my husband likes to order the roast duck here.

Prices are definitely high, but that is expected because they are in Summerlin. Service is unfortunately hit or miss. Sometimes the employees are friendly and attentive. Other times, the waiter or waitress will take your order and then you never see them again. 

I shop at Downtown Summerlin, so I will definitely be back!
