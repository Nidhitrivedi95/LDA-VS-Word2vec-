OXW2erFOPT-Oov6wChxWYA Came here on a busy Saturday night. They seated us right away and we got a little booth. The menu is expansive so you really have a ton of choices to suit your tastes at the time. I went with the pork belly bao to start followed by the pan fried pork dumplings. A double dosage of pork, I know, but it was worth the health splurge. The pork belly bao was better than I've had anywhere else. I liked being able to put it together and add as much sauce as I'd like. The dumplings following were also delicious. I wouldn't call them the best dumplings I've ever had but they still got the job done. My friend got a similar mix for their meal and they agreed that the pork belly bao was the best. 

This place seats a lot of people so it was quite busy and from the time we sat down, there were multiple people that came in and out. The food came out really quickly but I didn't feel rushed to leave which I appreciated. The restaurant was very clean and the service was great. We really enjoyed our meal and I would recommend this place if you're looking for this type of food and want quick service in a comfortable environment.
