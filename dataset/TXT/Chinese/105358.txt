kVXyz0mYd7NaGuGdM_VMeQ Asian Sweet Bakery is a nice little Asian cafe and bake shop in maybe a not-so-well-known area of Madison, but is worth the trip if only for their buns!  Everything in their glass showcase seems to be housemade and tastes exactly like the type of buns you would get in Asia or in any major China-town area in any big city like NYC.  They're big, fluffy, subtle (but delicious) in flavor, and incredibly inexpensive.  The couple who runs the Bakery is also very sweet so it only adds to the positivity of their already awesome goods.

For actual real savory food when you don't have a sweet tooth - their broths are fantastic.  I would definitely suggest grabbing one of the noodle bowls if you head by this way!  The one time I went, my friend and I ordered the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup and the Salt and Pepper Shrimp and man oh man, I could've drank all of the soup in one gulp.  The individual components were fine on their own, but the broth brought them to a whole new level.  It was beefy and seasoned, and just tasted of what real Chinese food should be.

The Salt and Pepper Shrimp on the other hand was unfortunately not as OK.  I was so thrilled to see they kept the prawns with their heads on, but unfortunately they tasted old, as if they had been cooked earlier or on another day, and then reheated up in a microwave for the meal.  As a result, the flesh was very tough, and not pleasant to eat at all.  This is also one dish where the salt content was just a few levels too high.  I could feel my blood pressure climbing even just from one bite.

That said, you can't go wrong with their baked goods or soups, so dig into those!
