uA9tzuzID3t5yZ8rhZ1bQw Truly a great General Tso chicken. Lunch prices are great, dinner is a great place for take out but pricey for take away. All in all been many times, always good. Soda was flat on my last visit, and the owner-manager-server did not agree, it was flat i tell ya, but do not come here looking for the staff to agree.. they just setve it up.
