XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA This place gets quite busy! Came here for dinner on a Thursday and luckily we got a table for 2 in 10 minutes. The menu is pretty simple (which is awesome) and they took our orders while we were waiting.
We ordered the jellyfish and I got the thinnest noodles while my friend got the third smallest. I really enjoyed the thinnest noodles because it gets all the flavour in while my friend liked the thicker ones because they were chewier. Although we both got small bowls there was soooo much food that we didn't even finish it all! Jellyfish was also good. I ordered it spicy and it wasn't too hot - there's extra chili oil on the table for those who want it spicier. The only downside is that because the place is quite small and they get pretty busy - the waiters put the bill on our table and stood there until we paid even before we finished eating to get us to hurry up! Service is meh but I'll come back for the noodles. :)
