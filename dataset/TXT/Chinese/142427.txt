RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg THE WORST SERVICE IVE EVER HAD. overall the food isn't bad for the price but the service is the reason why I won't be coming back to Tata's. I went to dinner with my cousin (who hates mushrooms) and when our order was being taken she specifically said she didn't want mushrooms and when the cook came to prepare our food at the hibachi table he told us he was going to cook it all together and that she can just "pick them out" . Right then we should have left. Then at the end of our meal we asked for to-go boxes and the busser who was grabbing them for us rolled his eyes at us and shook his head as if we were bothering him. The prices are decent but they take advantage, this was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant.
