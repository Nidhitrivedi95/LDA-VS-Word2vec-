dazGlP4Rk4nxlyMtlvkpvA I've been to dragon i twice. As other people had mentioned, the service needs to change. The staffs were friendly but they seemed like they don't really know the menu.

Also, my friend won a gift certificate to Dragon I during a cultural festival. However, the owner set the expiration date a week after we received the certificate. It seems like he wasn't too willing to give out that certificate and hoped that we won't remember to use it before it expires.

When we were there, we ordered beef pho, chicken curry, and kimchi fried rice. Overall the food quality was good but I think their food is a bit overpriced. It is worth to mention that they have karaoke there. It is not a bad place to go with your friends to hang out on a weekend night.
