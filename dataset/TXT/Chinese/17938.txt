4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A Have been here many times... each and every time they are always out of the expensive stuff. Or if you order an expensive item they are magically out of it on the next plate. 
The have new menu items which also are out of on the regular. lol 
The service is not friendly at all, everyone has a pickle up their butt. Lol 
 Come here for the after 10pm special.
Before 10pm it's not worth $25 the meat is so dried out it sticks to the plates you can tell it's been sitting for a longgggg while in the fridge.
