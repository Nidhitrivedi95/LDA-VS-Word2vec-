So_VSzbyBHfEIr5hEHn7Gg This use to be my go to Chinese dimsum place.. so I decided to go last night (new years eve). Their food is delicious I have to give that to them but their service is horrendous.  We order our food and the first three dishes that came out were bbq combination (bbq pork and roasted pork) then bbq pork fried rice and fried noodles with beef.. like i said the food was good but what are we gonna do when the bbq combination comes out first and wait 20mins for the noodles and rice (and we were hungry) we ordered dimsum we got our chicken feet after 20mins waiting then the Lotus ball and squid tentacles 30mins later.. the waitress even said we ordered alot for only 3 people but if we waited any longer we would end up leaving starving.. 2 tables left cause all they got was rice and waited for a long time for the dimsum. So i got fed up and said to my family were leaving when I went to go pay our bill the lady at the register was rude I told her I wanna pay my bill and if I could get a discount for waiting so long for our food her respond was dimsum takes 1-2 to come out.. that's bs. I tried to explain to her that we waited for a long time and the servers never told us it would take that long or check up on us if we need tea or water. Then the lady asked if I'm taking the rest of the stuff I ordered I said no I'm not waiting any longer I want a discount and going to eat else where.. she gave me 10% off not even the taxes.. we got three dishes rice noodle and bbq and dimsum 2 small dimsum and 1 large and came up to 50$ it's too much for small portions of food and adding rude and lazy customer service.. not going back any time soon
