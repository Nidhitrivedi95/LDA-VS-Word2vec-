B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA I have been a here a couple of times for lunch.  Both times were while I was in the area for a business meeting.  This last time was a mixed bag.  The food was good but service was sub par.

My boss and I each ordered a lunch meal and a cup of water.  Our soup came out fast enough but we were never brought our water.  We were still waiting for our water when our meals came out.  And now, if the water situation wasn't enough, we were waiting on utensils too.  No napkins, forks, knives, spoons, water.  Craziness.  We had to ask again for our water and then for our utensils.  They seemed to be short staffed which could help explain the lack of service.  There were two guys in the back cooking the food and one girl upfront taking orders in person and over the phone.  She was on the phone an awful lot leading us to believe it was a personal call at one point.

When we had our utensils and were able to eat our lunch, it really was good.  A good portion of rice and entree for the $5.95 it cost.  And the taste was on point.  I had hot and sour soup and red curry chicken.  The soup was actually hot and sour and had my sinuses feeling it.  The curry continued the trend.  It was all served hot and fresh which I can't in good conscience complain about.  Disappointment was never related to the food.  It was all about the service, or lack of.
