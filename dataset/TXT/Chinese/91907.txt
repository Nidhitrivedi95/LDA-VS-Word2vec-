ImzivIgEc3XHpAYJyMQnxA I got delivery and ordered sweet & sour chicken. The chicken was the standard chicken that all Chinese delivery places have, but the sweet and sour sauce was like warm orange jello that tasted like water. No joke. When I called to order, their phone was buzzing which made it even harder to understand the lady who was already hard to understand. Next time I'm just going to make an effort and just go to Evergreen for Chinese food because this stuff was gross. I feel super gross and sick now. #Regrets
