fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA I seriously cannot stop eating dumplings. Yes..I think we all go through phases of food. Maybe burgers..maybe ayce sushi...maybe pizza..but no matter what phase, I always love dumplings!!!

Now, I am not a professional judge of xiao long bao, but if I were to guess, I would say Ding Tai Fung does these very well. They are hot as hell at first because of the soup inside, so please, if you havent had them DONT JUST STICK THEM IN YOUR MOUTH. I was a noob, and this is what I did lol. Wait for it to cool a bit, then eat it. 

Once it cools and you eat it, you will find that the soup inside is just heartwarming, body warming, and still slightly hot..It is rich and a little bit fatty and has a strong sesame oil flavour which I really enjoyed. 

Aside from the ever popular xiao long bao, there are many many other options. If you like noodle soup like I do (my current phase!!), they make a GREAT noodle soup. The braised beef noodle soup is pictured below (#49 Or #47, cant remember). It is a tasty concoction of hand pulled noodles with loads of tender braised beef. At under 10 bucks, its another great bargain

Everytime I visit Ding Tai Fung, I leave full to the brim. With so many appealing options on the menu, you really can't help but to try (too many things).
