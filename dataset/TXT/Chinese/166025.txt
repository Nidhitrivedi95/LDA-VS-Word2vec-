The food has been consistently good - Peking duck, sweet n sour pork chops, snow pea pod shoots, green beans, daily fish, and beef chow fun.  We don't really change up what we order too much as my family are creatures of habit, but I'm not complaining.  The vegetables and meat are fresh.  My parents don't usually order from the menu, but this place can make what you want - if you don't see it on the menu, just ask.  The worst thing they can say is no.  

The restaurant is small and service is spotty, but you should always expect to receive your food within 10 minutes or so.
