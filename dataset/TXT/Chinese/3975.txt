_Ss4d4dYzehTmWJGpkqL7w Alright, so I've unwittingly returned to this restaurant twice after selecting it at random the initial time I went here. I'm going to chalk this up to the fact that it when you're in Chinatown, it is nearly impossible to distinguish one restaurant from another if you don't read Chinese, so my brain must have somehow remembered the general picturization of the restaurant sign from my first visit, and was recalling this very instance.

The food here is quite good. I generally get the Sizzling Szechuan Fish, which is thoroughly excellent. The shrimp with eggplant in spicy sauce is also delicious. The fried noodles and fried rice are also great. Basically, I haven't had anything here that I didn't love. Extremely flavourful and yummy. The service isn't great, but isn't terrible. That's about as high as you can expect from a restaurant in Chinatown. 

I'll keep returning to this wonderful restaurant.
