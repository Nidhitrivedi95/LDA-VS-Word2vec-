AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Great place for vegans!! Everything is vegan! Overall very tasty and amazing flavors. Decent prices, lunch is cheaper $8.75 for selected dishes but smaller portions. Dinner is roughly $12. For someone who eats meat I can verify that this place is delicious! 

1. Orange chicken: most famous and it's obvious why it's famous. Taste exactly like regular phage chicken. A must try!! 

2. Spicy crispy eggplant: amazing flavor!!! Another popular choice. Taste and looks exactly like fries but healthier and tastier. Bit sweet and spicy and crunchy! Definitely eat it in the restaurant because it will get soggy if you take away.

3. Veggie pan fried noodles: AMAZING. Very hot (temperature), crispy, excellent gravy, and tons of veggies and sit shrimps. Another must try! 

4. Curry tamarind fish with veggies: Nice curry taste but too sour for our liking. We ended up changing the order to regular curry and it was much better. The fish is soy and wrapped in seaweed for the "fish" taste. Not bad but not my favorite because of the tofu texture which throws off my taste buds. 

5. Kung pao chicken: Excellent flavor! The soy chicken has a wonderful flavor being marinated in the sauce. Tons of veggies too. Another must try!

Overall, I will go again!
