I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg LOVE IT! I always have shave ice when I'm in China, and it's great to see it finally land here in the Valley. 

For those who don't know, many countries and cultures in Asia and across the world have shaved ice desserts. They may range from Filipino halo-halo, to Korean bingsu, and to Chinese bing-sha. Most of them involve finely shaved ice with sweetened condensed milk, fruits, beans, and other toppings.

Snoh takes it one step further by providing flavors of shaved ice! I loved their green tea and taro snoh, especially paired with toppings like mochi and red bean with a glaze of sweetened milk. Highly recommend this place.

The decor is bright and trendy with cool artists displaying their work on the walls. There are TVs on the walls and overall, it's a great place to socialize with friends and just chill.
