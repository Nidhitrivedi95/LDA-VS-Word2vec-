The dim sum lady put a plate of beef rice roll on the table.  It was fresh so that was good.  It was not cut but I was fine with that.  She proceeded to cut it with her scissors.  Since there was no soy sauce on it yet, I noticed that her scissors left all these black specks in the rice rolls.  I told her the scissors were dirty but she continued to try and pick the specks off WITH her scissors!  It only made it worse.  I told her I don't want that plate anymore and she said no, I can't return it.  I was about to ask for the manager until she finally took it back and off my bill.  She put that plate back on the cart, now with soy sauce.  Onto the next customer?!
