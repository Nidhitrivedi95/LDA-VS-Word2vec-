Jtj8qgXzuWKjO2DYIn45dw Love everything here, for lunch I usually get the teriyaki chicken rice bowl for like 4 bucks! Dinner is always great here whether It's the usual orange chicken, house lo mein or something new to try, and if you're ever under the weather a big bowl of the egg flower soup is the best remedy.
