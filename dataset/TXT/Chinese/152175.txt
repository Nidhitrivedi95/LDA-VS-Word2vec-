The ambiance is very comfortable: a big room with tables everywhere, always buzzing with students, professors, and locals. Order from the sweetest, nicest cashier ever, Sophie, and ask her if you need help with the menu; she is very enthusiastic, and more than happy to help. Grab a seat, serve yourself and your friends some hot tea or water, and get ready for heaven.

Best dishes? We always order crispy tofu (a couple plates of it actually), salt and pepper chicken, pepper beef, dou miao or kong xin cai, the honey walnut shrimp, and whatever else looks good in the pictures. If you ever need help finding something new and delicious, Sophie knows what to get, and you can follow the facebook page for Golden Harbor that she manages (rather, curates) for news on what's cooking, what's hot, what's in season, and what's good. As a bonus, every so often you get a handful of cute posts, pictures, and videos to brighten up your days of the week, and that's always a good thing.

What more is there to say? This is the place to satisfy your tastes. I graduated this year and live in San Francisco now, but I still miss eating here. Do yourself a favor and choose Golden Harbor!
