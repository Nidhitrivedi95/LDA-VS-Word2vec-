2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w Delicious!!!!! I luckily  ran into this place. I live here in Surprise and there are closer places but not even close to this one as far as good food and five-star customer service. I have been here two times and both times the food was delicious. The people are so friendly. It just doesn't get better. I recommend the Kao Pao chicken steak shrimp plate, the Po Po sampler platter, and the spicy wonton soup.. but everything else looks so delicious.
