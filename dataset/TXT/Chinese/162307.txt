I would've liked the noodles a little chewier, but it's still a lot better than dried or refrigerated noodles you buy in the supermarkets. The soup for the beef noodles tasted a little bland. Surprisingly, I liked the soup of veggie noodles better. It has a nutty taste and reminded me of Thai curry. Portions are large.
