Food is a 4 / 5 considering the PRICE. I find it a bit too oily, but regarding the portion size, it is perfect.  I had the Korean Chicken, Jap Chae, and kimchi. The Kimchi was NOT what I expected and it was more of chopped cabbages. Aside from that, the rest were decent.

Price is probably the lowest I'll find within a reasonable walking distance. 1 Main, and, 2 sides  for approx. $6.

You can tell that they are a popular place to go because even at 1:30 they still had a line up. 

They serve manly Korean dishes, so you will be able to find bulgogi, chicken katsu, fish katshu, bimbimbap (But it was in a Styrofoam and I wouldn't order bimbimbap unless it's in a stone bowl), and tempura. Spice level was good. I would come back here again for sure.

It's a cheap lunch and does the fix.
