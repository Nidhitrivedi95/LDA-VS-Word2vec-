3FekhBpUmAWXBCvXBhuqVQ I've been to Da Hal Yee a couple of times and I must say, this is truly an understated little place! This place is located inside a plaza diagonally across from the Chako plaza at Midland and McNicoll. 

At first when you step inside this foodcourt, most people would probably be turned off by the looks of it. As it looks quite worn down but you'll be surprised at what they have to offer. Da Hal Yee is very generous with its portions, and the prices are quite reasonable as well. $3 for an order of regular pork rice roll, you can add an extra $1 to add egg into that. Which I highly recommend! That is my ultimate favourite! If you order one of each (with and without eggs), don't be alarmed that the one with eggs would be much more fluffy and "big" compared to the regular one. I also tried the BBQ pork and egg rice roll, it was a little messy but still quite good. 

I forgot how much the congee was, but portion wise, you won't be disappointed. However, if you are someone who likes stronger and more savoury flavours, you might find their congee a little bland. Their rice rolls are much more recommended in comparison. 

Rice rolls have always been one of my breakfast or dim sum staples. I love it and am very picky with it. Most places can't make them as thin and soft because they generally have rice rolls pre-made/frozen, and when you order, they reheat it for you. The quality of their rice rolls remind me of freshly made ones from China. Which, all rice alls here indeed freshly made as you order them. Which explains why they are always very fresh, thin and delicious. 

Another cool little thing about this place is that they offer complimentary tea and or soy milk for their customers! I am from downtown, tea is usually not a surprise but soy milk tooo! How can you pass on that!

PS. I recommend their pork and egg rice rolls! =D (in case you're lazy to read my entire review!)
