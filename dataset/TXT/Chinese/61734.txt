DsT7r6NlTWzA1RTwkze8VQ First time here. Came in on a rainy day. Me and hubby had a taste for Thai. I ordered summer roll, egg roll, red curry and lemongrass chicken. We had jasmine tea. The waitress is also the cashier. She greeted us and told us we could sit anywhere. We were the only customers but a lot of people came in for pick up. The egg roll was a standard Chinese egg roll. The summer roll I was one of the worst. It was basically a bunch a lettuce rolled up with 2 pieces of shrimp. I had to bite it twist before I even tasted the noddles and mint leaf, definitely NOT worth $5. I will never order their summer roll again. The lemongrass was delicious and spicy. The red curry was pretty good but could have been seasoned better. The beef was good. The chicken was that standard slippery Chinese mystery meat. I hate this type of "chicken". They got the spicy levels right :) I asked for extra spicy and my nose was running LOL just like I like the heat. Not sure I would drive here again. There are a lot of restaurants in the area so many options.
