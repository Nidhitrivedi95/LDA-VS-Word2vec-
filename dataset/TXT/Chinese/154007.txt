td-NOo-k4xhfVmO5X92uAg This review is from when I frequented a few months ago so don't hold it against me. 

The staff was friendly, prices were great, beyond reasonable. 

Their beef soup was really good. I had to steal the my husbands plate. 

The place itself is very casual and relaxed. There were only two other dinners when we walked in, it was about 2 p.m., we ordered and the food came out about 10 minutes later. We spent about $20 for two meals, three drinks, and two appetizers, not too shabby.
