eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ Went to dinner at Unami with my husband.  We ordered the special appletizer (Korean BBQ sticky bun), and it was awesome.  Also ordered an large order of dumplings (chicken and Shitake) as well as an order or Ramen (pork).  The entrees were good, but not over the top.  I'd return again, but I can't say it's my favorite Asian restaurant.  Service was very good; waitress was very patient with our questions.  Very cool that they source their noodles from down the street!

We were told previously that it isn't a good place for kids.  While I didn't see a kid's menu, I did see other kids there, and they certainly were welcome.  We didn't bring our kids this time, but wouldn't hesitate to bring them in the future.
