RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw Ok this place is no joke! Be prepared during usually eating times to wait! A while even! 

The congee here is amazing! The food is super tasty and comes out so fast you wonder how many hands are back in their small kitchen! 

They even have a six grain congee with wild mushrooms! Sooooo good! 

Their noodles are to die for. Doesn't matter which ones you get, crispy, rice, thick rice... They're all amazing! 

I highly recommend making the drive out to this place. 

One of the best Chinese joints I've been to in a long time!!
