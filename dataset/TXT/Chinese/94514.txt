jDZJsIyc3jXjcTtJk_p8ZA This review may not be really fair since all I have ever ordered here has been bubble tea (I do not like Chinese food in general). I always get the mocha bubble tea, and it is always consisten and pretty good. After moving from California to Pittsburgh, it was hard to find a good bubble tea. But I finally achieved my mission!
