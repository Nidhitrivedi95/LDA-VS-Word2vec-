zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I was super excited to come here as my friend was telling me about it for the past 3 weeks before going. We decided to go for lunch, though much to our dismay, the entrance was flooded and we couldn't get in, leaving me super let down. However, we tried again and came right as the restaurant was opening- around 11:45, and boy was it a pleasure. 

The interior was very modern and sleek, with communal tables (cringe) and a somewhat open kitchen. The "greeter" was pleasant and said we could sit wherever we wanted, and our actual servers (we had 2) were both beyond kind. 

I got the extremely spicy noodles, and can I just say THESE NOODLES ARE PROBABLY THE SPICIEST THINGS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE, and this is coming from an Indian who eats spicy food on the daily!! PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING. My mouth was on FIRE and I had to order an extra shot of soy milk (the waitress was nice enough to give it to me for free) to control the heat. With that being said the actual taste was great, and the pieces of kimchi at the bottom were a nice surprise. I had to go to the Milk Bar after and it was such a treat. I even got a pin! Momofuku Noodle Bar is definitely the place to be.
