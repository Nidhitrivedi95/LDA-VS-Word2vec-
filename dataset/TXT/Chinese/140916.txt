RAKSBqeNb-p_ZABwAWH_jA Not great, but fairly good. Certainly worth the money. I had some different basic nigiri (tuna, yellowtail, salmon) a few rolls and a few hand rolls. Pieces are correctly sized (most sushi is made too big) and 2 to an order. Fish was lovely and fresh. Rice was good. Price is appropriate. Nothing nearby like it, so I'll go again - it was worth it.

If you seek ambiance go elsewhere - place is ugly as a bowery bar.  I don't seek ambiance, so the Pizza Hut origins don't bother me.  

Somehow I think they could be better - given the paucity of good sushi in Charlotte, I hope they do.
