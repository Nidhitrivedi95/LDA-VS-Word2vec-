qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA My first impression of the place was it looked pretty with ample of booths and tables,we were seated right away and got a big booth to ourselves.It was a Wednesday night around 9:00 pm so they were not really full.Our Server was all smiles and we took our time to decide what we wanted (considering they close at 10:00).

We decided on Beer(Hefeweizen) and Mai Tai (cocktail with white rum,dark rum and pineapple juice).The cocktail was refreshing and Fruity with the right amount of Rum.It was well made.They also have a Good collection of Wines.

The Crab wontons are lovely i especially enjoyed the sweet and spicy plum sauce they were served on.We also had the Chang's fried rice(take your pick from chicken,pork,beef,shrimp),
Garlic Noodles(egg noodles tossed with garlic and pepper flakes) served with cucumbers on the side and Dynamite shrimp(Crispy shrimp with a tangy sauce).

It was a good experience and i would gladly be back for some Chinese food.
