C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ I'm not huge on buffets... but this particular buffet was ok.  

the spread is a little bit of all the choice asian cuisines.  mostly chinese and japanese.  they also offer a dessert/ and fruits section.. as well as a soup section. the sushi was pretty fresh considering its a buffet

servers are there to serve.. 
not to show their friendly.. so, in this setting it works for me.  

it's busy because pricing is fair  and its located on eastern.. a very busy street.  anyway... not the first place on my list.. or the 10th either.
