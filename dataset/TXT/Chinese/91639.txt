iJziJyLGEbcgTw79t5a-hw We ordered the popcorn chicken for $6.99 in medium spicy level. While the order took a little long (only a few patrons), the flavour made up for it. They make the chicken fresh. 

I would describe the seasoning as eating instant noodles on fried chicken. Portion size was good for the price. 

This is comparable to the ones I had in Taiwan. Definitely worth checking out.
