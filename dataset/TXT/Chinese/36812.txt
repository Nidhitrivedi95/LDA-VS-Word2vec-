AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw ...Northern Cali resident, 3rd time here for a repeat of my favorite late night tap brew & good grub combo. Once again, good as the 1st two times.  I always get the Noodle Bowl with Curry Chicken spicy.  The ambiance, the staff, and the music all gel just right.  Not too many places play this music (i.e. Deftones, Sublime, etc) at a cool bar while you order Asian fusion food.  Tonight my server (she also was my bartender) provided awesome, beyond friendly service.  Three-peat happy customer here; Right on Chop & Wok!
