AKMvsVr_9meoSmawkEBe4g I honestly like this place a lot. Like, a lot a lot. I always suggest this place for lunch once week, and I always order the same thing. I love their baked spaghetti with meat sauce. It comes with a bowl of soup (did I mention I love HK cafe cream soups? LOVE), and a drink to wash it all down. 

Now let's understand this spaghetti. The sauce holds minced carrots, minced beef and minced onions like nobody's business. It's not just your plain ketchup sauce that they put on top of a fried chicken steak (which is also good, by the way) - it comes with texture and vegetables that I don't get anywhere else. It is SO good. 

So why did I knock it a star when I can't shut up about the dish? Service is mostly good, but sometimes they can be really busy and we've had to refill our teas or get our own bowls on a few occasions. And sometimes their consistency is off (one time I ordered my spaghetti and got angel hair pasta instead, which was also more watery). 

But take me here any way and I'm a happy happy person.
