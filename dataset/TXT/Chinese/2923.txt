_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Holy Wong Fei Hong Batman!  This place is popping with Asians and Asian noodles! Pow!  

Don't know Wong Fei Hong, no worries I gather many "Westerners" wouldn't.  However, they do know one thing -- this place.  Noodle Asia is located inside the Venetian Hotel in Vegas.  I wouldn't think such a restaurant exists in The Venetian, but you know what; it works!

Noodle Asia reminds me of the 24 hour cafes located in California.  After a night out for drinks you need some grease!  Noodle Asia has all the classic Asian dishes from Shanghai, Black Peppered, Fried Rice, and Dim Sum too!  Needless to say, this place doesn't play around when it comes to Chinese food.  Tab bit overpriced in my opinion for what you get simply because the protein almost drowned out by the carbs.  Granted I enjoy my carbs, just not too much.  Also, is it me or do I need to drink a lot of water after a meal here?  I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's salty!  Guess that goes well for the "American" diet.  

There seems to be a line during the day which is not bad.  The restaurant is located right next to the sports betting area so a quick glance over to see the score is awesome. - Enjoy!
