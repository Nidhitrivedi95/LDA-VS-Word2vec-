Q7PWryGwFr52WMmfzqCBhA Came here for another feast tonight, AMAZING (see photos). All the dishes were big and very authentic, very tasty. The consensus seems to be that they offer cheap dim sum to draw in the seniors crowd and have some pretty awesome pre-order dishes.

If you want anything special just call in advance and they'll make it. Really good soups available and seafood is always fresh.
