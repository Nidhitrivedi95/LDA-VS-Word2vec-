K3J4zvnQ_G1d5xfffPf2Wg Service was excellent believe the man at the front was named Sky. He immediatly recognized me and greeted me with a welcome back. The food is absolutely delicious definitely a different twist then the normal rice bowl places u will go to. At first the fact that the food was not piping hot confused me at first but it made it extremely easy to eat. So tasty that I forget to take a before picture! Will definitely come back trying the gyudon with spring egg to die for
