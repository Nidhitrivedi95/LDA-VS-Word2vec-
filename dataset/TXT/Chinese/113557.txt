MpT8KheTjs7TSDWIoMUFxg I have ordered from here dozens of times. Every other order there is a mistake; nothing to stop me from ordering again, but white rice instead of brown, not enough sauce, forgot the ginger, etc. This last time... Will be the LAST time I order from them! Horrible customer service, the woman on the phone blatantly told me I was a liar when I said I had used the Yelp email coupon for free delivery and even showed the delivery guy what my total should be in confirmation as opposed to what the receipt he wanted me to sign said. When you give your order over phone, they barely speak English so often have to repeat multiple times and when you question, she walks away from phone or says ok and then gets order wrong. Delivery guy speaks no English either. It's so frustrating! But to treat a customer so blatantly ugly is just inexcusable. 
       Oh yes, she tried to call me back and say she made a mistake, only after eat24/Yelp called them and told them to call me, but too little too late... You can't call customers liars and be rude and expect them to be ok with it!!!!! Epic fail by China aaa....better off ordering from somewhere else and getting what you ordered every time!!!!!
