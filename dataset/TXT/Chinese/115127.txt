N_ML37GOTOLtGKWqRnbJRA This wasn't my first experience, but it is the last one. I initially walked in to grab a shrimp fried rice with no onions. To my surprise I get my food and it's stuffed with onions. I show them, the food is remade, no harm no foul. But today I ordered with Uber eats, I marked the same meal and added without onions of course. 30 minutes later I have my food, and surprisingly there is a tag on the bag that says No Onion. Great, they paid attention. SIKE, I LIED. The food is fully consumed with onions. I called and advised them and the response was, "the cooks get busy sometimes and don't look at the special request field." Well hot damn, isn't that the point of the special request field, to be viewed. All in all, two poor experiences regarding the same issue at different times. I'll pass on a third time.
