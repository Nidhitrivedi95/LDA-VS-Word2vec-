3a3ZSTEhFNnmvBhMwW3fSA 5 Star food & service! The best Indian-Chinese food in the GTA -- we've been to many Indo-Chinese restaurants & can vouch for it. Susan, the owner, is very friendly & gives a lot of personal attention. The vegetarian Manchurian balls are crispy on the outside & soft inside. The spicy pepper tofu was delicious, the veggie hakka noodles outstanding! We'll certainly go back with friends.
