UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w I used to go here often but with better choices available, I haven't been there recently.  We went here this evening.  The food is OK.  There are no real standouts.  Like other buffets, the variety of food has been cut back.  This was very noticeable at the salad bar.  Much of it was ice with many fewer bowls spread over the area.

I was going to get some jambalaya as I had in the past, but it looked liked there were cubes of processed ham instead of the sausage they used to have.  I skipped this dish.  I did get some salt and pepper fried oysters.  They were very tasty, but the breading was quite think and soft--a problem with some buffet food items.

They did have some nice vegetables--cauliflower in a cheese sauce (a little watery) and brussel sprouts with pieces of cooked bacon.  

A summary would be that the buffet is OK.  The food is very standard cafeteria type with nothing really outstanding.  I think the lunch buffet is a better value.
