QTYA1yCbsCjRU6BYDdQJuw Just had a banana and strawberry smoothie, mixed Sango dumpling, creme brûlée. Can taste the strawberry and banana in the smoothie. Very fruity in the best possible way. Sango dumpling was unique. Creme brûlée was great. The service was what beat everything. Tiger (the waitress) was extremely helpful. She stayed and made sure we knew what we were ordering. Even brought out samples of other desserts she thought we might enjoy, and as expected, was amazing. Defiantly going to be my new dessert place in the area.
