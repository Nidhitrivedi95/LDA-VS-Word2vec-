T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw All I have to say is SNIDERMAN, SNIDERMAN, SNIDERMAN! Literally, one of the best waiters I've ever had. My mom and I shared a great meal here the other day, made even better by a waiter who knew everything we needed before WE even knew we needed it! THATS what you call a great waiter. Find his section! And if you're new to PF CHANGS... their Kung Pao shrimp will change your life!
