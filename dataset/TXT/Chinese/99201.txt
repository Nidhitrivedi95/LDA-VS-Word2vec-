Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ This place is probably the worse Chinese food I've ever had. The menu smelled and I should have walked out at that point but I stayed because I was starving after a 4hr drive. I figured I should play it safe since I've never been there before and ordered a shrimp fried rice and some green beans. The rice was absolutely disgusting. No taste what so ever. No salt, no flavor at all. The green beans were ok. The waitress seemed surprised that we barely ate and we didn't want to take our left overs. The next day I went to a hair salon and they all agreed that this place has terrible food. Honestly next time I'll take my chances and opt for gas station food if I have to. This place was the worse. Do not eat here!!
