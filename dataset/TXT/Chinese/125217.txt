oWWLfYxmUpahdF-5FexnpA OK. Let's start with the fact that I ordered a whole wack of food, and it started coming to my table fast and furious. And it was gooooood.

I came here with four other friends and we ordered a total of nine different dishes. Every single one of them were good. We had from noodles to beef, lamb and shrimp skewers to been sprouts and beyond. We almost finished everything. All that was left on the table were three skewers and some soup. With that we all had beer (always nice when that's available) and the total at the end of the night was about $80. 

But the food was good, and so was the staff. Am I going back you ask? Short answer yes. Long answer yeeeeeees.
