ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ I had come here for lunch six months ago and decided to give the dinner option a try. I've been here for dinner twice in the last month, and I must say that, for buffets, the food is quite decent here. One major issue I had was with the wait times, specifically on my first visit where reservations were made for 7:30, and we weren't seated until 8:00. The worst part was that it was so busy, we had to wait outside in the rainy, soggy weather. Despite this, I was pleasantly surprised with the selection of sushi and sashmi, hot foods that included deep fried oysters and peking duck, as well as the tasty noodles made in-house. The dinner price is a bit on the pricey side but if you can eat a lot, it's well worth the money then. I also liked the fact that the food was constantly replenished, so wait times for refills were short. The lineup process I cannot fault the restaurant as it is more of an issue of the people eating there as I noticed several individuals cutting in line and pushing through. I think it bothered me moreso because I have children and when people push, I immediately push back. Nonetheless, the atmosphere is like any other buffet. Four stars for the food and service, one star for the behaviour of the other people eating there who don't understand the concept of waiting in line for your food.
