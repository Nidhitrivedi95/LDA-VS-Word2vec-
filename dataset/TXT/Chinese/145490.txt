S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ We had a new server than the usual old Vietnamese guy here, he was awesome and very polite. I will definitely be coming here more often now that their customer service is better. I ordered the sweet and sour catfish, Banh beo, Banh mi, and Banh Xeo and all were delicious. Definitely my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in LV!

This place would have a higher rating if we had better customer service. The old Vietnamese guy who takes the order is always so rude. He always just cuts you off when your talking and says "just say the number!" In addition to that he does not even try to hide the fact that he is annoyed, constantly rolling his eyes and speaking in an angry Vietnamese tone. Half the time my boyfriend who is Vietnamese will tell me what rude comments he is sating. The food is delicious but I hate coming in when he's working, I'd rather order take out.
