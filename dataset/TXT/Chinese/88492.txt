I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg I tried this place out last week with my sister since we were in the area. The the place was cute and they made our order pretty quickly. They had so much on the menu that I had a hard time figuring out what to order. I finally ordered a chai tea and it tasted ok. I know they had other fruit drinks since my friends had brought me some there before , but because the menu had so much on there I had a hard time searching for it so I went ahead and order the first thing I saw that I might like.
