URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg Wow! what a great meal last night. Kinda nervous to go back after being there a cpl of years ago for lunch and not loving it. BUTTTTT 2 words: Boiled Wontons. Order these and u will prob crave them for days. Spicy broth with boiled wontons in a light peanut sauce. I also ordered my fave, Peking duck. Very impressed with the quality and will be going back more. They do bring the food out superman fast so you kinda feel rushed but other than that, i see why they are sooo packed.
