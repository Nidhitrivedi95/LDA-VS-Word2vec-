FcNtrDGaWmkDzlHaq9F1UQ Not sure how authentic this place is as far as Szechuan cusine goes but I found the food here to be top notch. The crispy beef here was the best  Ive had and after tasting it I went on a lame quest around the GTA to search for a place that had the same dish which would have served as my cheaper alternative. Though I did not find something of similar quality, I did find a few spots that filled the void.

This place has a take out sort of setup for those who do not want to dine in restaurant style but I've never tried it. Everything else I tried was good though a tad oily.

In a nutshell, great food albeit a bit too fattening to have everyday.
