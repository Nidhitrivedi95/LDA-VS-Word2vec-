01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ Came here for a tasting. (Eating Chinese food in a group setting is always best so you can try lots of dishes!) The food is really good. I especially like the peking duck. It's a seafood and BBQ cafe but I didn't get to try their seafood items. For this reason, I'll be back and will see if they should get 5 stars.
