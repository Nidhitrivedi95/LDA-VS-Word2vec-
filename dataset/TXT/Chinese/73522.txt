FjG32sJivL1xBemPo9hlrw An update. Tried their curry and also the Kuala lumpar fried noodles, baked portugese chicken on rise, the skewers on the appetizers, roti canai, and cheesecakes and milk tea. The fried noodles were spicy and really tasty, actually had a kick to it. I would order it again. The curry was good also but more about average. We didn't mind the skewers but it was nothing special. 
The roti was great, as usual and we ordered two, knowing full well we would devour them both. Their milk tea is similar to Teh Tarik which is made the Malaysian style way where they mix it in a shaker (or two cups) by using long pours between the two halves of the shaker (or cups) (and repeating it a few times) in order to create some frothiness in the drink. 
The baked Portuguese chicken took awhile to come, as they have to make it, then bake it and it was pretty tasty. 
The service was great and I can't wait to try more dishes.
