dVMP0_oELc7hf77NYCgudg Visited Pearl for dim sum, and can say I was not disappointed. Tried a variety of dishes including shrimp dumplings, shrimp rolls, rice noodle rolls, and deep fried tofu. All were on par or better than average dim sum restaurant. The dumpling shells and rice noodle rolls were especially well made. The inside of the restaurant is also nicely decorated and seemed clean. Only drawbacks are it is small and can get busy at peak times (especially for large parties) and is a bit pricey.
