2UaMR7lOJ3IcXizaDpv7KA Probably some of the most uninspired and on original Thai food I have ever had.   The Satay was deep fried.  The Thai barbecue chicken, it is not barbecued. It is cut up into small pieces and deep fried. Exact same taste it has the satay but with no peanut sauce.  Mee Krob Was essentially noodles with sweet-and-sour sauce on it.
Some of the vegetables that we had, they were wilted and notably old.  There are better options out there, I would not waste your time here.    I will upload a photo of the barbecue chicken
