rIeXMt92PLNjZbemWKRXcA Nice clean establishment upon first time walking in. Ambience and decor has a really nice rustic look but also bringing in Chinese culture to mix it up. This place has an open view kitchen which gives it a unique experience. I wanted to get a light meal before work. Ordered lamb skewers, which was pretty damn good. I love my lamb medium and they cooked it to well done. But it was still really tender and flavorful. I also ordered some pork and cabbage potstickers. Those were great as well. Flavor wasn't overpowering at all. Some places over season the pork and cabbage mixture. But they executed this very well. And lastly, salty pepper wings. These are def my favorite dish at any Chinese restaurant. And these were pretty damn good. Really crispy and fresh when they brought it out. I would say it's lacking some fried garlic, but it could be that I love garlic a bit too much lol. Service was great overall. Really attentive and even threw out suggestions and seemed to know the menu very well
