-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ Actually this place is pretty good.  Not only the food is delicious and simple ..price is also decent. Not to mention you can tell that the  place is a must go if you are around the area because there is a pretty steady flow of customers coming in and out if this joint. I got me a salmon skin salad . At first I was like mmm what is it? But after I got it yummmmm the salmon skin is crispy and sooo good !.....crunch crunch with your greens. The place is not something you have to go out of your way but if you're around the area, go for it :)
