fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ The BEST restaurant on the strip!!!

WONDERFUL service
AMAZING menu
WORLD CLASS cuisine
TALENTED staff

Especially wonderful were: the crab spring rolls, the hot and sour soup, and the sea bass entre. 

My only complaint: We were a quiet table of 3, and we were seated next to a very loud, very obnoxious party of 12 young people having a very loud, drunken time... This was our one splurge meal on our vacation, and this loud annoying group really ruined it for us. We couldn't even have a conversation at our table  because of how loud they were. Please, next time there is such a group, seat them in one of your fine private rooms on the side of the restaurant- they will be more comfortable, and the rest of your guests will really appreciate it.
