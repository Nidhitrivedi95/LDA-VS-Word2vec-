BjbR39fp7BnurXAq9gNNEg I have hear that this place was REALLY bad. 

But I tried it anyway. 

They just added a mongolian grill. You know. Where you pick your veggies and spices then choice the meat you would like. 

That wasn't bad at all. 

the rest of the buffet was kinda questionable. But the grill I had was good.
