CBOsWj63K1_O1m2Ounz7bQ Finally! A place downtown Montreal that serves decent Hong Kong cafe style food. 

I had a great ying-yang (half milk tea, half Hong Kong coffee) - best I've had in Montreal - with a side of fried pork chop noodle soup. Tastes exactly like it's supposed to. Egg tarts are also delicious. I can't wait to try the congees and the other HK-style desserts on the menu.

The place is newly renovated, very clean and neat. It also offers free high speed WiFi. The only thing I'd say is that it is a bit more expensive than what you'd get in Toronto, for example, where the cafes there offer a free drink with the meal (not the case here) - but it is definitely still very affordable. I am excited this place has opened in Montreal, and looking forward to going again.
