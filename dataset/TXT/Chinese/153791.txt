tbMAjldMYhvDUS2gG5Fdxw So delicious, very consistent, very fair portions and prices. Have never eaten in but order out often.  The young girl up front tonight was very nice and good customer service doesnt go unnoticed. My go-to take-out restaurant, thankful for this in the nw valley, would recommend! Oh and the ma-po tofu rocks :)
