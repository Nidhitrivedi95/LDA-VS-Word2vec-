BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA From out of town and first and only time I've come here.. The dumplings were great!  Nicely cook with a variety of options to choose from. Great for vegetarians and omnivores alike. Price is average and good amount! Regular service speed. Would definitely come back regularly if I lived around.
