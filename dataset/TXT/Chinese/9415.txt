1rbb8ntTOpSolQv60CGcsQ I loved this place the first couple times we went. However, the last and only time we went I ordered the calamari. It came in a big heaping portion as they usually serve but I noticed a black spot so I leaned in and sure as heck, there was a dead roach on my food. Needless to say we will never go back. How disgusting!
