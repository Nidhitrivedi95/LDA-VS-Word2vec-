bsjBLLHR4TMVR5eAeLAI9w We came here hoping for some delicious dim sum. They never gave us a high chair for our kid. We ordered 6 plates & the food never arrived. About an hour later they gave us 4 small plates for $23.00. The service was unbelievably terrible. We paid & did not leave any tip & they chased after us outside the door and asked for tips. We explained to them about their horrendous service & food quality, and left.

Please don't waste your time or money at this place. It's a business and not a restaurant. They were more interesting in seating you right away and getting your money rather than sharing any quality food or service. It truly was disappointing for us.
