O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw One of the best dim sum I've ever had!
They come steamy hot just the way I like them. :D

We ordered:
-Har gow (shrimp dumplings) 
-Siu mai (pork dumplings) 
-Bamboo fungus and mushroom dumplings
-A soup containing some crab meat, shrimps and a pork dumpling wrapped in a lettuce 
-Lotus leaf sticky rice 

I thought all the dishes were really good except the soup took a little getting used to of the taste. Dumplings were all yummy goodness.  

Food was 5 stars out of 5 stars. Service was fast. My boyfriend did warn me that this place is not your typical date spot though. They didn't have the best tea or the best tablecloth but who needs either of it when you got delish dumplings. Go for food, not atmosphere. I'd definitely come here for dim sum again and I'd try their non-dim sum food as well. They accept credit cards for bills over $20.
