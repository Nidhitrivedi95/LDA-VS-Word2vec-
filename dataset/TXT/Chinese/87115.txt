ALWAYS super busy, with a rather small parking lot. Makes finding a parking spot for dim sum near impossible!

For the food, being allergic to crustaceans kinda limits the amount of food you can eat at dim sum (as everything has shrimp in it!). I personally love the Chrysanthemum Jellies they have for dessert though!

Pretty good service, but usually have to wait a long time to get a seat if you don't reserve ahead of time.
