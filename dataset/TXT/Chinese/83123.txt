hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q I was between a 3 and a 4 for this place. I've come here multiple times now and have tried the following: beef and tendon noodle soup, pork belly slider, soup dumplings, pork belly and rice, various dry noodles, and scallion pancake.

My main complaint is that the noodle soup was really salty each time I tried it. I thought the first time might have been a fluke but it doesn't seem to have been the case. I'm generally someone who likes my food on the salty side and even this was too salty for me.

The pork belly slider was okay but next time, I would probably order it without peanuts, as I didn't like how the texture went with the rest of the slider.

The soup dumplings were good, and I really liked the scallion pancake. I'll definitely order the scallion pancake if I come here again - they're crispier and thicker (with more layers) than most places make them.
