The roast suckling pig had crispy skin, which was good.  Slightly disappointed that there was not enough "white" meat - most of the meat was close to the bone and of the darker kind.  The other two appetizers, the fried crab claw and shrimp with scallops were well made, except the so-called "jumbo" scallops were hardly jumbo.  But they were nicely presented with crispy snow peas and yellow zucchini.  The special order winter melon soup was tasty but too much meat and not enough seafood.  The crispy skin chicken was superbly done as were the double seabass - perfectly steaned,  Lobster was fresh and tasty, big enough for twelve.  The highlight at the end was the fried five grain rice and the melt in your mouth warm peanut cookie, obviously made in house.

Overall a good dinner with responsive service.
