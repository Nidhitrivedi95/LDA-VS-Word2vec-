0kag5JGemji05P3oxx4lpg Let's be honest, no one orders Chinese delivery for fine dining. You order it because you have no food in your house or are too lazy/drunk/hungover to drive somewhere to get food.

When they screw up your order it truly sucks. New China Gate screwed up my order in several ways, and for the price it's just not worth doing business with them. They did overcooked noodles, spicy when I asked for it not to be spicy, didn't write my address down correctly, & overall mediocre food.

I've ordered from there a few times, & at this point I am done. On to the next Chinese delivery place New China Gate. It was not me, it was you.
