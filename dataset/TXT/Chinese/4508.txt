_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Is this place expensive? Depends on what you mean.  If I get excellent quality lobster combined withe excellent service what kind of a price would you put to that?

For $180 for a combo including a big armed lobster with salted fish garnish, steamed sea bass, snow pea leaves with gogi berries, dried scallop fried rice and a couple of pop.  Tips included.  For a group of six people,   This is pretty much a steal we even had to take stuff home.

Service was phenomenal.  I didn't have to ask much except for water and things just kept coming in.  Even photo support.

I'll be coming in here again soon for a friend's birthday party as well.
