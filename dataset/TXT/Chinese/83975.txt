First off the breaded shrimp were light and fluffy, and came with a ton on sweet and sour on the side.  Hot and sour soup was perfect, lots of additions to the broth, and the broth itself was not too thick.
The orange chicken was crispy but not overdone, and was very orangey for a change.  And the piece de resistance, the noodles were not oily, and had plenty of the tofu I requested extra.  Overall the bill was just over $30, and was delivered in about an hour.
