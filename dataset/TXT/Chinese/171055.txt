vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I really want to give Ping Pang Pong a good rating since most of their dishes are quite good, and their dim sum overall is probably one of the better ones in Vegas. The problem is that the service here is simply atrocious. The waiters and busboys are not well-trained and it's clear that management does not care about providing good service.

I used to come for the food anyway and ignored the service deficiencies (it's a good test of character!), but it's gotten to the point where I just can't visit this restaurant anymore because the bad service is so aggravating. The best example is how all the runners/waiters (especially at dim sum) play a game where, when they bring a new dish to the table, they just start putting the dish down even if there's no space on the table - forcing the guests to scramble to drop whatever they're eating and move stuff around before the new dish touches down. They might as well just announce that you have 5 seconds to rearrange your existing dishes, otherwise that siu mai basket is getting dumped on your pineapple buns. I even had one incident where the runner used the dish she was delivering to brush my chopsticks out of the way before setting the dish down on the table!

If you do decide you're masochistic enough to visit, the 'dragon well shrimp' and the salt+pepper pork chops are terrific. If you're into lamb stew, it's really good as well. My other favorites are their XO sauce dishes - there's a calamari one and also one with shrimp and noodles. I would avoid the ma po tofu though, as it's subpar.

Side note:  If you are sensitive to cigarette smoke, this place is a no-go. The ventilation system in the casino blows all the smoke off the floor right into the restaurant. Every time I visit Ping Pang Pong, I smell like I've been hanging out with chain smokers all day.

IMO, a pity 2* rating is actually very generous for this place even in consideration of the good food. The service is really that bad here.
