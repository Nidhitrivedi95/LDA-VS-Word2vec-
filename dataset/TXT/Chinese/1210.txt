Its a huge open hall with over 100 round tables and 2 huge golden dragons in the background.  You go there for the amount of food that is placed on your table. We had our 2 kids (12 and 14) and we ordered 2 menu to share for 2, it was menu A and the Peking Duck dinner for 2. I can tell you that we had way too many plates on the table. It comes with dessert, not sure what it was, since they never served it. Oh we did get 4 Chinese cookies. We took home a huge doggy bag. The food was good and tasty.  Yap, I'll go back.
