O3PiNOj1vv5dCCywdw3_og Is this a 5 star restaurant...no, not at all. But I'm rating it on whether or not they deserve an excellent rating for what category of restaurant/food service they intend to deliver based on price per meal, the type of food served etc.

They get 5 stars for the following:
- good customer service
- consistent food quality and taste 
-freshness of food served
- cleanliness of restaurant 

Smiles at every turn...yeah they were fast but never rude. And if they were ever less than friendly - it's a fast food place with 8 dollar plates...if you want to build a relationship with someone - I'm more concerned for you and why you'd want to do this at a fast food place?!?

Food tastes just like the mall, just like the other stand alone restaurants and is consistent with what they promise...fast, fresh, Americanized Chinese food. Better than a burger or burrito most days and makes you feel like you are at least making an effort to not eat crap everyday.

I was impressed with the transparency of the veggie fridge and the cooks in the back...high fired woks and chefs preparing very nearly as they probably do in higher dollar restaurants. If you have a hankering for Chinese, Panda Express is always a quick fix with satisfying results...this location is no exception. Swing by, it's clean inside and the food is good.
