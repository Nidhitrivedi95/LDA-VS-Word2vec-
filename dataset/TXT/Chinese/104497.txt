My uncle, cousin, and I grabbed dinner here after I had spent an entire day wrangling the children (boy aged 3.5 and girl aged 1.5) with their parents (my cousins).  Oh, it was the best babysitting reward I could have asked for!

To start, I ordered the Seafood Wor Wonton Soup.  My uncle ordered the Dungeness Crab and Sweet corn Chowder.  My cousin ordered the Shark Fin Soup (although not on the menu -- the price probably would have scared everyone half to death anyway).  All delicious.

We then ordered for the table: Pan-Seared Fillet of Sea Bass with Spring Onion, Fried Rice with Barbecued Pork and Shrimp, and Beef Brisket and Turnips (claypot).  I'd do almost anything for a delicious claypot and this one did not disappoint.  The fried rice was pretty standard (and my standards are fairly high).  And the sea bass was delicious and flavored well.

After this.. Fiamma for dessert!
