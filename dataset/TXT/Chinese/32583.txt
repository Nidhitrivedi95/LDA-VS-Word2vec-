a0Jm-rlHOKk_1fm4hzxskg Very solid Chinese food. The lady with short hair who works came around and talked to everyone.  She was awesome and seemed to care about our general experience.  This place can get a little busy so i would suggest a reservation if possible.  Also, they do not have craft beer, but many different beer from Asian countries.
