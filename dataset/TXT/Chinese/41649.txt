B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ We came by here during a visit to Cleveland. We had heard a lot about this place from our friends, both from Ohio and Michigan, about the spicy Sino-Indian food dished out here, reminiscent of the street/comfort food dished out at home (Mumbai, India). 

From the get go, there was nothing comforting about this place. There were a grand total of two staff members for a place where I counted a seating capacity of at least 40. One of them was a gentleman who was really brusque and snappy when I asked him for time to decide my entrées after ordering the appetizers. Is it ever a good thing when you are slightly afraid to place an order?!

I'm 80% okay with bad service if the food makes up it, but the Inchin isn't going to be getting Michelin stars anytime soon, so could they please at least be nice to their customers?
Everything we ordered was either greasy or lukewarm. The Manchow soup tasted stale and we sent it back twice before just giving up on it altogether. The chili garlic noodles, spicy potatoes and drums of heaven fared only slightly better. We didn't stick around for dessert because we are not masochists.

Also, everything is ridiculously overpriced.

If you're here to satisfy your culinary nostalgia, you're better off waiting till you actually visit India. If you're here to get some good grub, just AVOID IT.
