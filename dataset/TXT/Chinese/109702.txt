You can see the chefs hand-pulling the dough to make the noodles as you wait in line. I got the #5 beef shank noodle soup. I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought the soup base could have been better. It didn't really have much depth of flavour, but for about $10 after tax in a mall food court, this is amazing. If you're looking for a quick bite in the area and are tired of your standard fast food choices, I'd come here.
