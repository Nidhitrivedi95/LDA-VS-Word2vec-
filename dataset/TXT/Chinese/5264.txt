079CV1EE5WLdQqVEVYFeHQ Really good food.. 
This place is a total hidden gem in Phoenix.. more like the real Chinese food you'd get in places like LA, SF and NYC.. not the typical AZ buffet crap..

Prices a a bit high but the food is delicious.
Their hours are a bit strange and they often look closed even when they are open.. weird.

Many times Ive been here I was the only person in the place, which I don't understand, the food is really good.. Esp like the Egg Foo Young

The portions are much smaller but the food quality is much higher.. If your used to eating at Panda Express or China Buffet you won't like this place.. 

But if you grew up in Seattle, SF, LA or NYC you'll def appreciate The Prime. Its not as good as those places but its the best damn Chinese food Ive had in Arizona and Im wiling to pay for good food.

Im a big fan of The Prime Chinese Restaurant...
