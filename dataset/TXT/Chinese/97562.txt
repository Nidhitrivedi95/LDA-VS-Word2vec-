JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw Yup, I'm gonna be that one person that doesn't like this place ... ~_~

Came here with 2 Chinese friends (1 lived in China for 10 years and 1 from San Francisco) and they didn't think it was "amazing" either. Not the best noodles in town for sure, even if they are hand-made. Cool concept though but nothing new. 

I specifically ordered the Dan Dan Noodles because I LOVE Dan Dan Noodles. However, this dish left so much to be desired. (Shhhh .... Yunnan Tasty Garden on Spring Mountain has the best Dan Dan Noodles that I've had in LV. Trust. Their sauce is ah-mazing!)

The Wonton Noodle Soup was probably the best thing we ordered but not so great that I want to come back for it. 

We also ordered the cucumber salad and it was drenched in a thick peanut sauce, I think. Yuck, I didn't like it at all. 

I was really excited to try this place based on reviews but I won't be coming back. The place is super cute though and you can see them beating and twisting the noodle in front of you but I'm not here to watch a show.

I'm not being harsh. I just have high standards and Vegas being a major tourist attraction with millions of visitors a year should deliver nothing but the best.
