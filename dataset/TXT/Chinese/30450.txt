9BBWtaSvsootDkKTVBgv_A The food here is decent. Somethings (like the Salmon and rice) were fresh and very tasty. Somethings was just not made to my liking, don't mean others won't enjoy those things. I really enjoyed this location, hence the 4 stars. What stood out the most was the cleanliness of this place. It was cleaner than a lot of dine in restaurants and this is a buffet. They have a hibachi and sushi set up where they make everything in front of you by request. If your ever in the Charlotte are and don't know what you want to eat, this,would be a good place to hit up.

Oh the service was cool too. I mean it's a buffet yall. They were on point though
