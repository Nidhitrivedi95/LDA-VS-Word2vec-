tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw As you can tell by my other reviews I seldom frequent large factory restaurants..but, when driving around Keirland trying to make up your mind what to eat at close to 8:30pm,  P.F. Changs to the rescue! 

My wife and I sat at the bar, 45 min. wait for a table was too much...sat next to the service bar, the young lady bartender at this station needs a medal!  She was pouring drinks for servers, talking to servers, bantering with customers next to us, and verbally taking our order without a miss!  Had a good laugh with her regarding the fact a guy couldn't do that! (it was a joke men, really!)  So to say the least service was great!

The food, well....(**insert shrug**), One of our dishes was extremely salty, commented to our amazing bartender and 2 min. later the manager came up to us and said, "we will make you a new one to go for you, give us a minute."  Now that my friends is the way to handle a customer complaint!  Very cool, and I will think fondly of PF Changs just for the way they handled our complaint!

As for the food...from my previous experiences the appetizers are all  good, some of the entree's are overly sugared, but good..noodle dishes are usually good.  My favorite being chow fun.
