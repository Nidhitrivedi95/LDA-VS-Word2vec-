sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg I was in the area and wanted non chain Chinese food in hopes of finding something with flavor. 

I saw the menu on the window and liked what I read. I went inside this place it is small but very clean. The tables were wiped down and shiny, there was dishes and condiments on each table.  I had the Salt and Pepper Crispy Chicken and asked if I can substitute the rice for steamed veggies. The gentleman said yes. My total was $8.00 and I took my order to go and waited for a few minutes until a gentleman walked over to hand me my bagged order which had soy sauce, napkin, fork, menu, and a fortune cookie. 

The taste was really good and spicy. I will return to try more of their dishes. I think it's say better than Panda Express flavor wise and less expensive than Pei Wei.
