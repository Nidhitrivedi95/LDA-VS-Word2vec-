fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A Pretty large portions at this spot.  It was only my first time, so  I have to come back and try more dishes.

Har gow = fresh, good size, and tasted good.

Fried Meat Ball = huge here.  A little more of a tang to the meat, but the outside fried mochi was nice, thick, and oily; just the way I like it.

Shrimp wrapped in big noodles = wasn't warm enough; and didn't taste fresh.  Not enough sesame oil

Preserved Duck Egg & Pork Porridge = a little on the thin side, i like my porridge thick, but flavorful w/ no soy sauce needed.

Pork buns = yuck, not too my taste at all!

I will be back to try more!  This place is a fairly large establishment where you are able to come and not have to wait very long.  Although, I did come on a weekday, so I'll have to check it out on the weekends; probably on a Sunday.  Will let y'all know!
