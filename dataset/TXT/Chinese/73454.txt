fJCsDc353UC6eUn-kCBrGw I recently was treated to a meal at this PF Chang's. We ate here specifically because of the gluten free menu. I had the GF egg drop soup which was perfect. The entrée was the GF Cantonese Chicken. Also equally delicious. The service was great! I'm giving four stars only because the coffee needs improvement. A bistro of this caliber should have impeccable coffee and this was not. I even asked the waiter for a fresh pot which was provided with little better results. I think a better brand of coffee or a new brewing method is needed. Overall the experience was pleasurable and I would recommend this PF Chang's to others. Especially because of their decent GF menu.
