fxZ8B05ROM1BSAdlh7p1MQ Fast food joint....Great at fast food Chinese. Nuff said?  Consistently good fast food is what Panda Express is all about.  If you have a Chinese craving and need to fill that void fast this is the place to do it.  
I like chow mein, fried rice, and orange chicken: the main staples of fast food Chinese. 
Glad to have one in Surprise as a selection for a quick lunch or dinner spot.
