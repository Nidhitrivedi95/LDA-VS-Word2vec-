QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ Yummy dumplings has very reasonable prices and lovely staff.  Unfortunately the dumplings and buns didn't live up to the name for me. We tried several variations and only the xiao long bao inspired me - admittedly they were great but the rest were bland or had a really doughy taste.

Which is a shame because the service was so lovely and the prices so cheap. In my opinion there are much better options in China town which are probably just as well priced.
