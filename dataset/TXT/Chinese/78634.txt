GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog unexpected delight! stumbled in here with no knowledge of the chef or the restaurant. Everything was so fresh, unique and delicious. Not sure about the low ratings, every dish we had was superb. Hearts of palm salad, pea shoot salad, and the dan dan noodles. We wanted to return for dinner we loved it so much!
