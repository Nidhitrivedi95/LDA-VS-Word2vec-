FiEcKfGo-rbYyhoKHw_0MA They have no idea what they are doing.... It really seems like they need someone who knows how to run a restaurant. Waited forever to get our food ordered. Food came out wrong many times. The waitress just looked so confused. Even the waiter said he's been gone for 2 months and doesn't know much... wtF!!! Food was awesome but was frustrated with the service. Also its BYOB. I guess they normally charge corkage fee but the waiter didn't charge us. i don't think he knew anything. If you are patient and willing to overlook the unprofessional service then I totally recommend it.
