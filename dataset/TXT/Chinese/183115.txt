XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw I was craving soup dumplings and saw this Dumpling King on yelp so my bf and I decided to give it a try. I liked the tables and chair, my bf and I noticed that they had Christmas decorations up as well and I just guessed it was one of those places that kept up their decorations year round. Anyways we got tea, beef patties, beef soup dumplings, regular beef dumplings, and shrimp fried noodles. The tea was very refreshing and the shrimp fried noodles were very good. My bf liked the beef patties, however when I tried a bite it tasted bland to me. The beef soup dumplings were good, it was my first time trying them I'd like to try more I was expecting a little bit different flavors but it was still good. The service was ok, the waitress did come over and boxed up our left over food when we were finished. Overall an good experience.
