AbgNPAnuq8X90DUw5FQ2sQ This restaurant was highly recommended by a friend so we decided to give it a try.  We were there for afternoon tea and was quite pleased with everything they had to offer.  We were there on a weekday so it wasn't overly packed so the service was great.  

We ordered the BBQ pork with rice after seeing that they had BBQ items were made on-site.  The pork was tender and juicy since there's a bit of fat in it which makes it so tasty.  We also ordered chicken pad thai - the portion was generous however I had to deduct a mark here because it was a bit on the tart side.  Don't get me wrong, it still tastes good, but I prefer if it was less tart. 

Drink and dessert was included in the afternoon tea.  I love how you didn't have to pay extra for cold drinks and dessert was a bonus!  I didn't expect that but it's always great to finish a meal with dessert :)

There are many items I would love to try, so I'll be back!
