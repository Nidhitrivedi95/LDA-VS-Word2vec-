Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg Food, service, and price really aren't that impressive at all.  Not sure what all the hype is about, but there's usually a line-up on Friday/weekend nights...

Their food quality is mediocre, tends to be on the salty and fatty side, and almost always comes out a bit too oily.  Their service is pretty non-existent, and their tea is honestly horrible, lukewarm.  

The price is really what sinks their boat, for such a mediocre restaurant, their price really isn't competitive and is on the high end for such simple dishes. 

You're better off trying some of the restaurants nearby in the plaza, than going here.
