keQlXWfz2K7GukqaReVyow We were wanting real Chinese and this rocks! Friendly staff and good service. Try the potato strings in hot sauce appetizer. The tomato and egg and Hong Kong style seafood soups were uniquely flavorful. Order a bit of each and share. As another reviewer said this and Fugu Asian are the real deal. We will be back.

BTW, if you aren't adventurous there are plenty of items on the menu that can work for you.
