wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw Wonton Gourmet is my favorite Asian restuarant in Cleveland's Asia Town.  If you're looking for a place with delicious Chinese food, good portion sizes, and reasonable prices, this is the place to go to.

The restaurant itself is pretty small.  At dinner hour, it may be difficult to seat a very large group.  The servers are friendly.  Ordering is easy - pictures of the dishes are on the wall so you know exactly what you're going to be eating.

The jade tofu dishes here are my favorite.  You can either order this dish with pork or fish.  Jade tofu is an egg tofu that is fried on the outside and soft on the inside.  The gravy with this dish (and most of the dishes here) is delicious.  Vegetables are included too.  I also think that the noodle dishes (pan fried noodles, beef chow haw fun) are very good.  When my friends go here, we also frequently order the spicy fish and the Szechuan eggplant (with or without chicken).  The spicy fish dish isn't my favorite in Asia Town, but it is really good.  You get a lot of fish.  Recently, I had the beef with Chinese broccoli and was happy that the meat was very tender and tasty.

So if you're looking to try a good Chinese restaurant with a small group of friends, check this place out.  You won't be disappointed.
