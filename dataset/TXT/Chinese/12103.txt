2nQ2_o5pPUMByU86bDjOeg This Chinese is our local take away. The food that I tend to get from the Chinese is excellent (chow meins, crisp shredded chicken/beef, fried rice, spring rolls). Knocked 1 star off due to the pictures on the menu not reflecting the dishes at all. A friend ordered the Pad Thai which came in a sweet and sour sauce (not listed or shown in the picture). I would recommended the deep fried shredded chicken!
