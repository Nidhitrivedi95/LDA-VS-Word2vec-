rXVLgV4Og3l98OTy6N2dJw My definite go to wonton noodle restaurant in the area. Their wontons (along with dumplings/fish paste etc) are always fresh and made well / consistent . And for that price (5.5 for one ingredient, 6 for two) you are getting an ample amount of good food. 

Service is like any other Asian restaurant in the area. The restaurant itself is a good size - never have to wait for seats/food. 

Hits the spot every time
