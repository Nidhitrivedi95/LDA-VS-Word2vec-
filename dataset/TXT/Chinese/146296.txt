S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A YUM. delish, fresh hand-pulled noodles. parents are from Taipei, and this passed their verdict as well.

pick your noodles (original/sho lah, knife-shaved/dao hsiao, among others), meat (lamb, chicken, beef, beef tendon), and preparation (broth, pan-fried). of note, the noodle broth comes with cilantro and pickled vegetables, which some may prefer to order without.

highly recommend the dao hsiao - is as good as the quality you'd find in L.A. wish this were in Chicago.
