YmX3UDKy4CeFQ7guNlrw4w Probably the best Sichuan restaurant in Mississauga (but again there isn't much Sichuan restaurants in Mississauga any way). My go to place whenever I am craving for spicy food. Most of the time, the food quality is good (don't go on Monday, they seems only fail me on Mondays. Maybe the head chef is not there?). Don't expect much service (typical Chinese restaurant). My favorite dishes: spicy fish pot, Kungpao chicken, bamboo shrimp and the spicy whole fish. If you are in the area and love spicy food, give it a try!
