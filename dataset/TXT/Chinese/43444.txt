bFBV-rYwr6qKT7u0ovZhQg Was here earlier for lunch, had the Thai bowl, YUMMY!! Sent my daughter back for dinner. My dinner selection was lacking...everything. Upon returning, I was greeted with great customer service, and a remake of my selection, which came out tasty and great. I was given a coupon for my inconvenience which is always awesome. Either way, I Will definitely be back again!!!
