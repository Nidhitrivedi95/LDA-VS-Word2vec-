Pei Wei box dinners from walmart are tastier. The wife got four pieces of shrimp in the Szechuan shrimp. My orange chicken seemed to have been frozen-fried and doused in a molasses and marmalade mix - yuck. The fried rice had 2 peas a one carrot chunk in it.

Not even if I was starving would I come back!!!
