O8Nh1NB9Gbtq6xjd9oeI3A Wow- wonderful new restaurant. Will definitely return to try various menu offerings. As others have commented, it's a huge menu but the choices are clearly described- and some have photos. Many varieties of Pho- I had the rare beef and cooked brisket. Beef quality was excellent and the soup broth just delicious. Also had a chargrilled pork which I liked as well. Look forward to returning!
