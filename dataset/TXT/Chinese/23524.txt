6vV13vQlpcDtfOIVyDruvQ Back again for lunch and end up getting cheesy baked rice again. I ordered the chicken and shrimp version last time and it was great. Today the seafood version is on the lunch special menu and I was skeptical at first. But it turns out just as good. Rice and cheesy sauce was tasty. There were a fair amount of shrimps, scallops and squid and the pieces were not shrivelled up nor over cooked. Very happy with my choice. Chinese soup was good, not too salty and even got some extra large pieces of tender soup pork in my bowl.  Hot milk tea did not disappoint either.

Husband got salmon steak w/2 fried eggs served with rice, corn kernels, and gravy on the side. Each part tasted fine individually but husband thought its a somewhat strange combination on one plate. Egg with garlic salmon? Gravy for the egg and salmon?? I'm used to of seeing fried eggs and even corn used to complete a meal in HK diners. Brown gravy for egg and salmon is indeed a little strange and I don't think it's very necessary. I saw the next table ordered cutlet pork chop (humongous) w/plain spaghetti and got the same gravy. Hehe. Guess the restaurant just throw in this stuff to any meal that's not already covered on sauce.

Even when it's busy, the ladies serving still maintained their well mannerism and service tone (for a Chinese eatery, it's good enough when they aren't talking hasty, responding like zombies or slapping food on the table).

No old chinese songs this Saturday afternoon, just a silly old Stephen Chow movie on Fairchild TV.

Will still keep coming back, maybe next time I will try their dinner offerings of mixed grill or steaks.
