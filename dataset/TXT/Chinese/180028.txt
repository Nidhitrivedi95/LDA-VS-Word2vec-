X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Really good club.  Paid $63 for two day passes. One for Hakkasan sat. Tiesto.  One for Omnia sunday. With Afrojack.  Overall this is the best club in the west.  Have been to 15 clubs in Las Vegas. And 30 nightclubs in Los Angeles and Hollywood.  Good music. Good drinks and price accordingly. Will come soon again.  Good club inside the MGM Grand.
