safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg Hubby and I decided after living in the area for over 6 months that we should finally try the food here. They have quite a few options of eating there, take out, delivery, and dine in. Saw there delivery menu after walking in and was excited being so close we could hopefully have a good place to order from again. 

We decided to dine in for dinner. Place is not huge but not too small of a location. They have  good assortment of choices for food. I was glad to see they have pad Thai one of my staples I go to at any Asia style restaurant because I like to try them all around. So I ordered that. It's said it was spicy but even for my weakness to spicy food I had to add alot of chilli paste to spicy it up. But otherwise it was quite tasty. 

We were pleasantly surprised it was so good. But also glad to have our Yelpers help in such a good previous review.
