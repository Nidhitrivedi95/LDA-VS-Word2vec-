68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw Best Hainanese Chicken Rice in Nevada. Hands Down! Trust me, I tried it all here in Vegas!  I used to eat chicken rice everyday in singapore since I was 7 yrs old. I tried hainanese chicken rice everywhere I go.. This restaurant nailed it. Chicken was perfectly cooked, rice was seasoned and cooked the right way, they offer the sauces that goes with it and it also comes with the soup. I'll definetely come
here often.. I hope they open at night too so I can order my food here because it is close to where I work. Oh well. You guys have to try it!
