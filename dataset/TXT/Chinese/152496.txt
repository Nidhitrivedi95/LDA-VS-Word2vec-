T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw We had a happy hour here last night and had the best time. There were seven of us and we had requested individual checks so we knew that the server would need to be on top of his game.  And Marcus was just that.   He was able to keep up with all the  orders even when several guests were a bit late.   He kept the water filled and the orders were filled in a timely manner.   The manager, Andrew, had our table ready on time and every thing was done to perfection.  Loved every minute of our evening.   Well done.
