QvEoE_oGwHPXvw5IylllNg As for myself, I like this restaurant very much.  Good food, at a good price.

Of course everything has to be taken in context, this is basically a family run takeout restaurant, so one should curve expectations around that fact. Furthermore, this here is Mesa Arizona, and if you haven't noticed, we're not a major culinary center of the United States. Duh! Don't ever expect the level of cuisine one gets in New York City or San Francisco. 

That said, when a place like New China opens up, I'm actually quite happy. Is it authentic? That depends on your point of view. Compared to chains like Panda Express, this restaurant is worlds better. And New York Chinatown? Well, they're not quite there, but on a scale of 1 to 10, I'm happy to give them a solid 7+. For Mesa, that's pretty darn good by my estimation.
