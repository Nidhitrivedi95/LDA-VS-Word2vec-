hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q Myself and my family eat here on a regular basis, one of the things that we enjoy most is how the owner Kelly takes the time to get to know her customers. She not only knows our family but all of our friends who come in as well. We love the MAJOR improvements that Kelly has made since she bought the place. I have read a couple of the negative reviews on here and all I can say is....They must of had a bad day prior to coming into Kawaii. Also, everyone has an off day at some point. 
Kelly...keep your head up! The food is great, people are great and prices are AWESOME! i love how you continue to look for ways to improve your place. We are customers for life!
