Q3zZTpHQBSbiPq2lLaTtgw So good. Staff is very friendly. We dined in last Friday 4/14/17 & I got the General Tso tofu. This is the only place I've been to in the PH/Monroeville/Verona area that does this well. The outside is very crisp & the inside it tofu so its on the softer side. So many other places make it so soggy and the outside isnt crisp at all. This is by far have the best. I will be back and i will get the tofu again! I loveeeeeed it!!!!
