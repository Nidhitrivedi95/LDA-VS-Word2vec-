iRFaq249LVEFGeXLzPULnQ Great Chinese food and good value for lunch specials. Can say all the dishes I ate were delicious but the dinner portions are a little skimpy, lunch is a better value. Tried the sweet walnut shrimp, curry beef stew, mixed seafood, hot n sour soup, and the beef hot pot. All yummy.
