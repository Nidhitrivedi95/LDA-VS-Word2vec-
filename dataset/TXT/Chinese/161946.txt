uiShreF9oKvzuqxWWxECAw Delicious steamed buns... as far as the eye can see. :)

Their specialty is the pork steamed buns.  I ordered the seafood ones and found them very tasty.  Jenny, my server was amazingly informative and helpful for choosing what to order.  

I had individual soup (chicken broth) and took another soup (Tianjin Hot and Sour) to go - both were delicious.  

Desserts were not too sweet and were going quickly on a Friday night.  

Price seemed reasonable to me.  They have cheaper lunchtime pricing.
