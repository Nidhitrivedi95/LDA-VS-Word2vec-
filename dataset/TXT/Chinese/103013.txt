KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw Went for lunch special  - Ordered General Tsao;s  Chicken - served with either Chow Mein or Fried/Steamed Rice for 6 Bucks.
Opted for Chow mein instead of rice.
Served w/ Soup, Fried Wontons (several side sauces plum, duck and serious mustard).
Way too much for lunch, so took half home and was great for dinner!
Tasty, Spicy, 3 kinds of peppers (chinese, serrano and jalepeno)
nice Jasmine Green tea.....
Great Value and nice atmosphere.
