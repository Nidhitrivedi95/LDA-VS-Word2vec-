ZZF5iqlKFBWJSGSZzWHMzA With the re-opening of Lucky Red, and since I come around pretty frequently,  decided to make a pit stop.  Have they improved from the last time?  Yes.  Is it a place where I would be dying to come back? Not.....really.  

Now don't get me wrong, the place is fine.  I see that the layout has changed more into a restaurant and a lot less of what Banh Mi Boys is.  They've focused more on the dining in part which I thought was a nice change.

As for the food, since I was pressed for time, I did take-out and got a Fried Chicken bao.  For 2 for $8 (and maybe it's me, but they're a bit...tiny?), it's a bit pricier than I thought and it seems like these Bao Orders now come in orders of two, as opposed to be able to order 1 of something.  A slight miss there, but I like fried chicken.

The bao is good, goes the Korean route with Kimchi, Scallions and a slight spicy mayo/sauce that's put into a bao with fried chicken and cucumber.  Overall product is good, but it's still oversauced (not as bad as before).  The chicken was fried nicely (not overly salty).  However, I wasn't completely blown away by it.  

All in all, it's definitely impoved but I don't know if I'll make a return visit.
