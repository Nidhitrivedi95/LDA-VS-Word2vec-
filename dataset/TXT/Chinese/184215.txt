xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A After eating at Lulu's Noodles, I can definitively say that I am still looking for a half decent Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Rather than expanding into Japanese and Korean cuisine, they should focus on getting better at Chinese first.

I ordered a Mango & Strawberry Jasmine Green Tea Boba with Normal sweetness. The drink was completely syrup based with no mango fruit and only small remnants of strawberries. It was too sweet, and I recommend all future customers to go light on the sugar. For $3.75, it is overpriced.

As for the entrée, I had the Dr. Fu special. It comes with thin egg noodles, chicken, scallions, and bean sprouts with a side of hoisin sauce. The dish was mediocre. Traditionally, Chinese stir fry comes with 1/3 noodle, 1/3 vegetables, and 1/3 protein (meat). The Dr. Fu special had too much noodles and lacked any vegetables. I felt comatose after eating such a carb-heavy diet. 

Never coming here again.
