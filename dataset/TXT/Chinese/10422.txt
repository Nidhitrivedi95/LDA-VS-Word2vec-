1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA This has got to be one of the best valued meals you could ever have in Vegas.  $5 for most of the menu items ranging from wanton noodles soups to curry roti to to Hainanese chicken.  The shrimp wantons are good (more shrimp than fillers) and the salt & pepper wings are very juicy inside the crisp, slightly spicy skin.  It's cheap food, with good portion sizes, cooked perfectly and served with a smile.  Great when you're broke from a night of befuddling.  I just wish they would change the overhead lights.  They were so dim they almost gave me a headache.  Sit by the window.
