PM5vkmr8FqOIWE0pe3C2Fw I went to Morals Village on a Sunday night for hot pot, after having visited their Markham location a couple times. 

I'd have to say that this location is far superior mostly due to the service. 

We had a waiter named Ryan who provided excellent, attentive service. He tried to make the most out of our experience by suggesting menu items that we had never tried before. When we told him that we really liked one of the items, he continuously followed up with us to ask if we wanted to order more - a true example of anticipatory service. 

As an FYI, this location is slightly different from their Markham one. The sauces and spring rolls are self-serve, which we were a little hesitant about, since there was no glass sneeze guard. However, the ambience is great. There is exposed brick which makes it a bit more hip vs the Markham location. Also, the staff speak great English and Cantonese, which my group found particularly useful (the staff at the Markham location mostly speak Mandarin). 

Overall, I would certainly return! Thanks to Ryan for a great meal and a fantastic customer service experience.
