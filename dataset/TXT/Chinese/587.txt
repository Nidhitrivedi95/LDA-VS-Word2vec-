-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw Kudos to Chatime for building such a strong brand worldwide with so many competitors out there, but I just can't see the difference between all the different bubble tea shops. Chatime is known for better quality bubble tea (but it's all still powder says my inside source) for a higher price. The average for a regular size is $4.20 and a large is $4.70. All the add-ons are an additional $.50. I find drinks across all chains to be pretty consistent, and there's free wifi at every store.

Given that this location is right by Yonge and Finch which is a predominantly Korean night life area, you can find lines that go out the store on weekend nights. Even if there aren't any lines, there's very limited seating! Parking is a mess. There's street parking if you're lucky to find any spots in front of the store, or you can take your chances and park on the side street in front of the high school one block ahead (you may or may not get ticketed), or behind Shoppers Drug Mart one block before Chatime (60 minutes for Shoppers customers).

The good thing about Chatime is that their drinks aren't too sweet. I usually get 50% sweet for bubble tea drinks, but this one is quite good with 80% sweet. I get cravings for bubble tea quite often, but I can go months without having a craving for Chatime in particular.
