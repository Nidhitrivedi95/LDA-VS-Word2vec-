lcSsIw_oC-OT2veksCtRwg My family and I have been going to China Way since 1996 and they had the best Chinese food around in Chandler and we tried them all. Their prices have always been very fair and their food has always been consistent and good. Unfortunately, that changed recently  with new owners. My favorite has always been General Tso's which has always been wonderful. Tonight,that all changed. The Chicken was cooked different and without much flavor. This was the 2nd time this happened,and it won't be a 3rd time. I wish the new owners good luck,but sometimes,you have to stick to the original recipes or you will lose old loyal customers. Also,just a note,please get rid of the Curry dishes,it is not needed in my humble opinion.. Sorry,wished I could have liked the changes.
