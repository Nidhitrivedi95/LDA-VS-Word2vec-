fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA So Mother Dumpling across the street had a long line up and we didn't want to wait, so we wanted to give another restaurant a try. Seeing that the Dumpling House received a 4/5 star rating, we said "why not?". 
As soon as the food came, we knew immediately that they were poor quality. The fried dumplings aren't even closed properly, so there wasn't any juice or substance whatsoever. The boiled dumplings have more dough than meat/veggies. It was very disappointing. There's a reason why Mother Dumplings across the street is so popular. 
And the service... wow... so to preface my review on the service, I am of Chinese heritage. I grew up going to Chinese restaurants. This is not typical Chinese restaurant service. This waitress kept trying to take our plates away even when there was food on the table. We kept telling her no and she kept coming back to try to take our plates away. 

Never again will I return. Go to Mother Dumpling across the street. This place is extremely disappointing. The food quality is disappointing, and the service was horrendous.
