rdifwelsxkuUf-tw2O4o1g The Tom Yum Goong here was good.  It had a great balance of hot and sour, along with generous portions of mushroom, tomato and shrimp.  At spice level 3 out of 5 my lips felt some fire, but my tongue didn't taste much heat.  With this being the first dish brought out, I felt that it was a strong start to the meal.  The other highlight of the night were the Chop Chop Original Thai-Style Chicken Wings.  The sauce was good; the chicken, not so much.

My palate and experience for Thai food is admitedly limited, since I always like to order Panang Curry and Pad See Ew whenever I'm at a Thai restaurant.  Due to that habit I've come to form my own expectations for these two dishes, and those expectations were not met at Mr. Chop Chop.  The Panang Curry had a sweet flavor, and the Pad See Ew tasted like noodles that were just heated up; not much flavor was present.

One thing that was different about this meal was that each dish came out on it's own, as if each dish was it's own course.  We were at the restaurant for two hours, and much of that time was spent eating.  Out of the five dishes we ordered, four of them were ordered at the same time at the beginning.  I don't know if they usually serve their food one dish at a time, but I was definitely expecting most of the food to come out together.  Two stars says it all: I've experienced better.
