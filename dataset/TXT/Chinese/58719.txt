dfDmylDjZAccgMyhYPbZaA While the food here isn't anything particularly special, the consistency of the food keeps me coming back for more. The staff is always very friendly- quick to seat me and explains any menu items I ask about. I tend to come in groups of 3 to 4 people so we can share a bunch of dishes. That said, if you come alone, one or two dishes will be more than enough to fill you and you will find yourself bringing home enough leftovers for another small meal.

I typically order: Thai Beef Steak, Pad Thai, Chili Garlic Chicken, and Chinese Broccoli in Oyster sauce for a group of three of us. In all cases the portion sizes are great and everything tastes good. (If you hate spiciness you may want to stay away from the Chicken.)

If I were to rate this restaurant on quality of food alone it would be a 3/5 overall, but the consistency of the food, large portions, big menu, and excellent service keeps me coming back for more and bumps it to a 4/5.
