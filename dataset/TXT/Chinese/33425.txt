A5lD3y2eREchEdMcvWPXBA a good classic place to go to for a simple lunch. i first went with my family when they just opened, had to wait 45 minutes to get a seat. they pretty much operate on congee and rice rolls. they originates from GZ china, so that was refreshing. my favorite congee place in toronto for a simple lunch would be the congee place in market village, the small mall next to pacific mall. i would say this place would be up next to my go tos now. they have a good selection of congee and rolls. the texture might be different from what you would order from yum cha places, but this texture is actually what i first had in GZ china, so i'm probably more use to it. but ppl who shun this place because of the "sloppiness " or because of the "mushy" texture probably won't value the culture behind these dishes. theres a reason why they are classics.
but anyhow, no negativity, all in all i would welcome their addition to the neighborhood. 
and decor, on point with their old school but clean chinese influence.
