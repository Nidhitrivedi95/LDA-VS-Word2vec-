The first time we came to this lovely establishment we were the only ones there and were given a half-assed, curt as hell greeting and the chef threw our menus on the table. Thinking he just had a bad day, we thought nothing of it and continued to order. Food was decent but the customer service gave us a sinking feeling in our stomachs (not unlike incessant gas)

We then decided to come back, craving some curry, however, the chef decided to up his petty ass game and decided to give not only waters to the three tables of ~6 people but also took their orders even though they came in about 10 minutes after us. 
We decided to leave and as we exited, we heard the chef laugh. 

This came as a surprise seeing as I, an obvious Asian, frequented this place nearly every day with my ASIAN FAMILY and were treated with utmost respect and even with occasional jokes from the chef. 

Honestly, I hate playing the race card but my party wasn't 100% Asian. We were the only group comprised of non-asians and it was blatantly obvious that we were treated differently. 

If y'all want some quality food, just go across the plaza to Japanese Zen Curry. We were seated immediately and enjoyed the great customer service that made us feel welcomed and the entire place has a 10/10 vibe. 

tl;dr: if you're not Asian, don't.
