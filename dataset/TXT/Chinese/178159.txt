X2zVoSi1X-Hgz_95hzvF8w I ordered from them despite the crappy reviews on Yelp. Neighbors said it was decent Chinese food. Wrong. It took forever to get here. Won ton soup was flavorless and had an odd after taste. Fried rice was hard and crunchy. They charged me extra for white sauce and didn't deliver it. Chicken broccoli was less than average and vegetable low Mein was sub par as well. Will not order from here again.
