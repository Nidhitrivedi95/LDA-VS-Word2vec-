KUqInLEY1y7SkyZyDoGn0Q This place is really okay. The service is okay if you are some sort of regular. The food is okay. But the tables are really crowded and there's no room to walk in between. In terms of the variety of dim sum there is a bit of variety and specially item compared to other places. We tried their steamed rice roll with fried tofu in the middle and fried glutinous rice. Both seems to be okay pretty tasty. The portions of their dim sum is on the small side, if you are not full can always order fried rice or noodles. We tried their fried meat dumpling this time and the colour is a bit off. It's either over fried or the oil is old. Their spring rolls and fried sesame ball dessert is pretty good too. This place is a bit crowded for me and their quality is a bit inconsistent, not to mention parking in the parking lot is horrendous, there are some pretty bad drivers that frequent this lot, once in a while is okay.
