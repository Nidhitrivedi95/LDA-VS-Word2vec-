FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ It's really gone down, I used to come here when I was a kid and the food was always fantastic. 

Today it's really changed. 

Food: Bland, Watery, Tasteless. Everything is so clearly mass produced to fill the demand that they've skipped over crucial components of dimsum. I had the curry octopus, curry was watery, bland not even spicy or a hint of fragrance. 

Service: UNBELIEVABLY SLOW. like I'm talking we sat there for an hour for dimsum, that only slowly trickled in. The servers were dazed and overworked. A server even came up to our table asked if we ordered soy sauce, we replied yes and they put down hot sauce in front of us taking away our soy sauce which was clearly on his platter?? 

We got hungry as we waited for our next plate of dimsum which had 4 and we had like 5 people so one of us never got to eat lol for another 15 minutes

Decor: Average nothing's changed just the quality and speed has changed. 

SUM IT UP: not going back, I'd rather go somewhere else. Foods meh, food comes out slow, and servers are too tired.
