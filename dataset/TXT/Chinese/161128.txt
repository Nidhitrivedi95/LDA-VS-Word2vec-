UcIrRf2mWgqqlg-HNoDl0A I get food from here once a week. Never find fault. The delivery service varies from day of week. Up to 90 minutes sometimes so don't wait till you're starving. My go to is the chicken in hot garlic sauce. Yummy. My husband can vouche for the orange chicken. 
Always friendly staff and dining area is good.
