QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA Good chinese food. Luckily they have a few vegetarian options. What put me off this place was the staff. They do not understand what we are trying to tell them. They can understand our orders only if we point at the name. Though it takes a great deal to work in such a setting there is a communication problem. Service is a little slow.
