ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ best bubble tea in the area (downtown)!
it comes hot or cold, and you can adjust the sugar too.
my favourites are the roasted milk tea with grass jelly and the brown rice tea.
they're always busy with lines out the door sometimes. but they're very efficient at pumping out drinks, one time I got my drink within 30seconds. 
however, i find the decor eye-searing, and i'm not a big fan of the purple.
sometimes their drinks can come out really sweet (?) so make sure to ask for less sugar.
