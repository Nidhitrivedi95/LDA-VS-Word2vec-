rEAFZFziiOWxSLsOLohccQ I don't give 5 star reviews very often, but Ann's deserves one from me. This was my first time in being highly recommended. I am pretty particular about my Asian restaurants having lived in Asia for some time but Ann's really exceeded my expectations.

I had the Garlic Noodles and asked for chicken to be added. Wasn't a problem (I've actually been to some Asian restaurants that said no substitutions!). The Garlic Noodles were fantastic and an ample portion for me to share with my girlfriend.

Also ordered Combo Fried Rice, Pot Stickers and Coconut Tapioca with Watermelon. Huge portion of fried rice and six pot stickers. Taste was perfect and were served nice and hot. The Coconut Tapioca was a fresh (no pun) way to put these tastes together and was just refreshing for a summer Phoenix evening. Sweet but you didn't feel as if you had to roll away from the table after a dessert. Loved it.

They've only been there 5 months and I can see they will be a favorite of mine.
