eS8OuIk6_fMNNslFnj8noA Moved to a new area and am in search of good everyday (pick up on the way home from work), and special occasion Chinese food. Our first stop here was in eat and nothing to write home about. But we gave it another chance and did take out and were more impressed. We have done pick up several times now and one more dine in and have only been slightly disappointed once! I think like any other place, you will love some dishes and other only so-so. So once you find what you like there, stay with it!
