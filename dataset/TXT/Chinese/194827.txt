It was our first time eating at Momofuku, and we were really excited to check this place out. The restaurant had plenty of bench style seating. We came on a weekday in the afternoon, so it wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. 

Momofuku ramen: tasty, innovative, and fun dish. Pork belly, pork shoulder, egg, fish cake. I loved it! The pork was fatty and savory. The 8 minute egg was poached nicely to add the runny goodness to my ramen. The noodles were well made to al dente perfection. All swimming in a tasty broth.

Momofuku pork belly buns: served with hoisin, scallion, and cucumber. The pork was juicy and delicious, with generous portion size. The scallion and cucumber added a refreshing and fresh crunch to the dish. The hoisin sauce gave it a touch of sweet flavor. 

Soft serve cereal milk flavor with cornflakes: Omg! So brilliant! The flavor of the soft serve was phenomenal, and reminded me of Horlick drink, which I am totally addicted to. And add the corn flake topping? Yes please! A super fun dessert to eat that imitated cereal and milk breakfast. Loved this. 

Oh yes. Then we visited the Milk Bar upstairs for a galore of baked goods. So many yummy cookies. And the crack pie was melt-in-my-mouth to die for. So good.

Service was prompt and friendly. The environment was friendly. Atmosphere was clean and modern. 

Overall, I am in love. I wish they would open a location in Seattle so I could get some Momofuku goodies more often. Xoxo:)
