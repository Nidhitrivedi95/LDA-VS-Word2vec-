NKHvmp19c6wrm0dZXcLtmQ OK, so today I went for take out and ordered the durian rice roll.   I'm watching the guy at the counter make my dessert.   I see him put the durian on then lick the excess durian of his fingers and continue on. I tell the waitress I don't want that one,  the guy just licked his fingers and touched the rice roll.   she goes tell the guy to make another, once again did not wash his hands,  I pointed it out to the waitress, so after 2 attempts the guy finally washed his hands.   I mentioned to her you might want to let management know,  but she seemed kind of lost, hence I'm posting this here. 

I usually enjoy this place but after watching them make my dessert I'm a bit turned off by this place now
