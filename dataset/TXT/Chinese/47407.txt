I am originally from NY and as you knew we have some of the best Chinese food there. We ordered Family Dinner B with Won Ton Soup- full of flavor!!, Fried Rice- BOMB!!, Orange Chicken & Cashew Chicken. I forgot to mention the egg rolls best in town!! The food was amazing! The service was very friendly and quick. I will definitely return!!
