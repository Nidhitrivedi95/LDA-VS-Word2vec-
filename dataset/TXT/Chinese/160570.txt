U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q It's stupendous for all day dim sum, noodles, and so much more! Manager Chris was very accommodating.  I often dine alone and prefer to sit at a bar when available. Unfortunately, the bar server had gone home so the bar was closed but the manager made an exception for me and gave me 1st choice.  Thanks!
