7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ I've been daydreaming about Chef Natalie's crispy southern fried chicken. It may be the best restaurant fried chicken we've had in a very long time. It doesn't need Frank's RedHot but a little dash takes this chicken over the top. 

We thought the sriracha mac and cheese was just okay, but the collard greens & spicy chow chow was a much better side. 

#FATurday tip: order the shrimp dumplings with the fried chicken. That way, you can sop up the dumpling sauce with the cornbread muffins. 

The next time we're in Vegas, we'll definitely stop by Chow. Hopefully we can save room for dessert!
