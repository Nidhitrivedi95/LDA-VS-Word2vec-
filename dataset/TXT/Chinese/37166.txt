amYsBUq8cHsmvadFZ8Ky7A Just looking at this picture is making me nostalgic of my study abroad days.  I can't say that I tried much else from their menu (actually, I had a mapo tofu that was decent, and some other food that I've since forgotten), but I had about 50 bowls of their takeaway wonton soup during the three months I lived in Edinburgh.  I can safely say that it was a pretty tasty bowl of wonton soup--hit the spot when it was cold!
