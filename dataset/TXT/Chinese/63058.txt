DwmAsemahJywywhuqv5J1Q This place has some extremely authentic food and it actually feels authentic inside. However, I believe it's a bit pricey for the servings they give and I wouldn't say the food stands out. It's service is also subpar and can be not the most professional. However, good place for a casual dinner out with friends!
