MLVBJjbgk3sLZYyxqBD4XA Marathon Cafe is known for their award winning HK milk tea.  So I was pleasantly surprised when they opened up in Richmond Hill.  

Today I ordered a Ham Omelet combo. They were kind enough to make a custom omelet for me as I had asked if they could add onions/green pepper inside to make it less boring.  I am unsure if I had to pay extra but my total came out to $5.40 after taxes.

The food came quickly.  The omelet was a bit hard though, the onions were slightly undercooked, the toast was the non-HK type which was hard and not soft/condensed.  Did not try other items on the menu so I cannot comment on overall food quality here.

Marathon Cafe is different than other restaurants as you need to go up and pay for your food before sitting down.  The place is clean and nice, the staff was very friendly especially when compared to their Scarborough location.  There is free wifi and LCD TV's showing chinese programs.
