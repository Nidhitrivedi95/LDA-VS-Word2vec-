e8cFfRySb8n9lMXRnyzeIA I've tasted couple of Chinese place and it's nothing compare to Chin Chin. The food is good. Is not greasy like others. If you don't want your food spicy make sure to let them know before hand. I'm a NYer and this is close to the same in NY. Wouldn't change Chin Chin. The food is also inexpensive.
