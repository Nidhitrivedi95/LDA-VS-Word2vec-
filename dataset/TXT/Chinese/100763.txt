k2c7nIIDgY-FD6Yk-I_3Ww When I ordered delivery Chinese food in Chandler I wasn't expecting much. This was hands down the best Chinese food I have had in Arizona. I ordered the Chow Mein Noodles, Honey & Sour Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, and Tossed Crispy Cauliflower. Don't worry, it wasn't all for me, but I wish it was. I could have finished the Crispy Cauliflower myself had I not had greedy children paws fighting over it. The Kung Pao Chicken was so flavorful and delicious. I thought I had ordered enough Chow Mein so that I could have leftovers for lunch tomorrow, but I wasn't anticipating it being so good. (and by the way, it was a very generous portion). Thank you Wok Inter for restoring my faith in Arizona-Chinese food. Yum.
