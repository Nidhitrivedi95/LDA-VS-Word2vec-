VGZ_MJ7P3vSQMYyQf-mNjw Came here with my in laws because we wanted to try a different dim sum place. As others have stated, the restaurant was hard to find unless you go directly to the underground parking. It is an ok size, not too big not too small and the tables were not crowded together. The dim sum was delicious except for the BBQ pork bun that did not taste that fresh. I really enjoyed the chicken with spinach siu mui.  The price was also reasonable.
