EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ We were looking for an authentic place in vegas after a week on the strip.  We found this place on YELP.  Pulled up and my daughters and I both thought the parking lot was sketchy at best.  We walked in and were more concerned.  Decided to stay and give it a shot...thank goodness we did!  The gentleman who sat us  was very helpful, explained the dishes and was spot on with his recommendations.  Brought my wife and girls a thai tea and thai coffee, on the house so they could try them.  When my daughter just wanted soup, he said the order would be too much so he would just bring her an extra bowl and if she wanted more, he would get it.  Everything was delicious and we argued which was the best dish with my wife and I loving the pad thai and my son and daughter loving the chow mein.  Everyone loved the soup.  Turned out our waiter was the manager who was friendly, helpful and ensured we will be back next time we visit vegas.  Trust me, you may not be sure, but you do want to visit this place for dinner!  Awesome!
