nDT0T3yW6G89vzdx4p_P4A My wife and I frequent here or get take out at least once a week Never had a bad meal and the Staff is awesome...  The Owners are the friendliest couple.
The wife and I are Gluten Free Dieters, and the owners will cook anything un-breaded for us.... and the food is always hot and fresh...
Definitely give it a try..  you will not be disappointed.....
