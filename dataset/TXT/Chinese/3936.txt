_sgSZE1zzSCxwghYEuAeEQ A newer location amongst the Asian cuisine on St Catherine in the stretch between Guy and Atwater. It has most of what you'd expect for a noodle place on the menu, plus the secret "Chinese" menu written only in Traditional.  It should be noted it is cash only.

Unfortunately Becca H has hit the nail on the head with the service issue. My entire meal took north of 90 minutes, frequently having to wave the server, or attempt to get their attention, often to my dismay to have them see it, then immediately look away and dart back to the kitchen.  If it were busy, this might have been more agreeable, but for less than half the tables sat, I felt intentionally ignored.  

Foodwise, the place is just OK. There's nothing magical here, there's nothing great, it's cheap, and a you get what you pay for kind of experience. Placing it somewhere above say, fast food, and somewhere below everything else in that area. 

This one will be a pass for me in the future.
