3pYZMSbOKh6rBo_DapMlyw Great price for more than generous portion. Ordered the congee with preserved egg, stir fried beef noodles and cheung fun. Congee was bit bland but I didn't mind it. My favourite was the cheung fun which they made it really good. It would be 3/5 for food but plus 1 for the portion and price.
