JQrh2cmndqRKwTpVveHPDg Only come before for the duck. It tasted good but they don't slice it in front of you which should be part of the experience, I believe.

The rest of the dishes were definitely subpar. Service is slow (other than food service). The place is usually crowded.

Cash or debit only, be aware.
