wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw I'm beyond sad to write this review. This used to be my go-to place to introduce friends to Cantonese food for 5+ years. Salt bake pork chop was my favorite, along with Spicy shrimp, wood ear mushroom and melon, shrimps and bitter melon; and the earnest and chatty owner and his staff.

That is until the change of ownership about 2-3 years ago. 

After the new owner took over, I come back to check in every once in a while to see if things turned around. No, the food has never recovered to its previous glory.

Take spicy fried shrimps for example. There is too much breading. The shrimps were 3 times bigger in the previous version, and the breading was very light. You want to taste the shrimps, not the breading.

Salt bake pork chop - all you taste is the fry breading. Where's the pork?

If you've never been here under the previous owner, I suppose you don't know what you are missing. It's like a Tribute Band to a rock star who passed away - they can imitate, but they are not as good as the original.
