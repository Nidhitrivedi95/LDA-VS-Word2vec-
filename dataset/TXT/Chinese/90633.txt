Decent food and really friendly owners. We got two rice boxes that came with two items. We got a bbq pork + roasted pork rice box and a bbq pork + soy sauce chicken rice box. We also had the option of veggies or tofu and we both went with tofu.I thought the bbq was on the drier side which was a bit disappointing since the reviews looked really promising. Chicken and roasted pork were average too. Good portion sizes though! My rice box lasted me two meals. 

We paid around 15 dollars for the two rice boxes that came with soup also. 

Might be hard to find if you're not familiar with the area, but it's the store farthest away from the foodcourt. Parking is also tough in the plaza.
