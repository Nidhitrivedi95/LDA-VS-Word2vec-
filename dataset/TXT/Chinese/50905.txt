Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA It's been a long while since I've visited the Chang.  Went here a few days ago with work colleagues for lunch and ordered the beef and broccoli lunch bowl.  This entree comes with either a hot and sour soup (my choice) or egg drop soup.  I found the soup to be 'meh' -- not great but not bad.  The beef was very salty and I found myself drinking a lot more water the rest of the day to combat the thirsty feeling I had all afternoon.  This place is exactly how I remembered it: a decent choice for a meal that is in the mid-price range.  You won't get standout food, but you probably won't die of any diseases either!  Our server was friendly and came around often to refill glasses/drinks.  

None of my colleagues were 'wowed' by their lunches either, but most of the food was consumed, so I'm guessing no one was super picky either.
