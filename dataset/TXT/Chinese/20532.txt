The traditional dishes including fried rice, orange chicken, and chow mein are tasty and fresh. My favorite is the vegetable chow mein with tofu and double cooked pork. If you get the cravings for chinese food, there's a panda express down the road but unlike panda express, this place is not fast food, and it is prepared when you order. When you're in the area, this is a great place to have a nice meal while watching their flat screen T.V. .Or I guess you could actually talk to whomever you're with.
