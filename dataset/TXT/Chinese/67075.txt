elpS_xeOX_S5obTwx55kjg Love reading the reviews on here.... If your ordering the Kung Pao or Orange Chicken... Let alone cheese puffs.. Then do yourself a favor & just go to Panda Express! This place is close to the house & some what authentic enough to pass for Chinese.  If I don't have the time or energy to get real Chinese from Chinatown... This place works in a pinch!  Yes.. Real Chinese.. Not American Chinese. What I mean by real.. - KJ Kitchen, Cathay House, Bund Shanghai...
