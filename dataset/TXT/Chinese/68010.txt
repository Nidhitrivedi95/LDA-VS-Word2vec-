ePCa7c2zvroyiwECOek5wA Wow really impressed with this place! Really tasty food that doesn't give you that "I hate myself" feeling after eating Chinese take out.

Not terribly greasy, fresh veggies and tasty sauces that aren't overly slathered on their meats.  We had an awesome smorgasbord of spring rolls (delish), egg drop soup (one of the best I've had), general tso's- unique but very tasty!, wonderful chicken lo mein, very healthy portion and the Mongolian beef was a bit overly onion-y, but we enjoyed everything and delivery was even early! Check this spot out.
