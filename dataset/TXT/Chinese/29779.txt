966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA Always on the hunt for fresh, local (not chain) Chinese dishes. The search lead my party here. We ordered the Shanghai Dumplings & Popcorn Chicken to start. The popcorn chicken promised to be a standout in flavor and crispness but tasted like it was fried in old oil. The Shanghai dumplings were exactly what I was looking forward to.  

Tried the Tom Yum Goon Fried Rice - that was delicious, if not a touch sweet for me. The best part? The seafood - all tender, flavorful and fresh. Everyone at the table gobbled up the delicious seafood on this dish!

The freshness of their ingredients promises some above average dishes in their soup, clay pots & desserts menus...next time! Will definitely be back to try some more exotic offerings.

Service was average- what you expect of service but not a standout. All in all, A solid 3.5 experience this time.
