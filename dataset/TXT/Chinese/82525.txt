haa0u6VwTWBXbIW0mxlSGw We ordered take-out from here last night, and were blown away by the flavor and quality of their soup!  Also had an order of egg rolls, which were pretty good, but their SOUP ... Oh-Em-Gee ... Their soup won my heart and my tummy with the first spoonful.  

We ordered the Wor Wonton Soup and Hot and Sour Soup.  Both were incredibly flavorful, chock full of goodies and an amazing $$$ value!  The wontons were freakin' incredible and tasted like they must be made in-house on a daily basis.  The Hot and Sour was perfectly rich, spicy, dark and delicous, and loaded with eggs, tofu, mushrooms. If you have a stuffed nose, this soup is the cure! LOL  Their Wor Wonton Soup also includes snow peas, pork, shrimp, mushrooms, carrots, etc.  But the wontons themselves were what blew my taste buds away, along with the perfectly balanced broth!!! Next time I will order the traditional Wonton Soup.  Can't wait!

Seriously ... Try their soups!!!
