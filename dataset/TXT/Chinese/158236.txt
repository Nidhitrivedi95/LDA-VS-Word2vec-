Food is okay-some repeated items in the hot food area, but if you count the noodle station, and the grill station, then there's quite a bit of hot food.  

But for me, the hum dinger is the sushi station!  The sashimi is always being refilled which I like because then I know it's fresh.  And of course, the usual rolls are there too.  For the little ones, they'll love the soft serve ice cream station, hot waffle bar, chocolate fountains, and the refrigerators of cakes and puddings!  

Lots of fun, lots of food-not A+ quality food, but still the quantity and variety makes up for the quality.
