0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw I blame me for the average review. 

After passing by DD countless times, usually in favourite of the deliciousness of Square Boy, my friends and I finally decided to drop in for dinner last Friday. 

I'd never eaten Hakka before, but we liked the description enough to give it a whirl, ordering everything labelled Hakka from the menu. Now, this was a good idea in principle, but I think we would've been better served asking our server for some guidance. 

The good: Manchurian soup. a great hot and sour soup base with chicken. The hot and sour base was less viscous than most (a good thing), but it could have used a little more heat. Overall really tasty. 

The bad: Manchurian chicken. I didn't like the consistency of the sauce and the chicken really turned me off. Goopy and spongy isn't good. 

The average: everything else we tried. pork spring rolls, sizzling beef and fried paneer, though the latter was a bit above average with the nice green chutney. 

The service, as everyone else has mentioned, was great. Very attentive and friendly. 

In the end, I'm still going to give it a chance, but this time I'll do so with the assistance of the staff and if you haven't been, I still say you should give it a chance too.
