They use the plastic cups with the plastic sealed cover which is nice.  The milk green tea was just right...not too sweet.  

The experience is pretty consistent here.  It's worth dropping in.  I like the fruit green teas also.  My favourite flavours being grape and blueberry, and almost always with tapioca.
