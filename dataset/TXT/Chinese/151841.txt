T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ I was very impressed as I walked in. They have a nice little koi pond! Very clean and spaciousness seating area. It's really beautiful for an East Side buffet. They have a wide variety of food to choose from. From salad to sushi! The food is very delicious. At lunch before 3:45 it's $10 for adults. Children above 42 inches are half price. Children under 42 inches are free! So that was great! Only payed $24 for two adults and 3 children!
