3TRgD3KLVis61eGvMZrykA My Dad raved about this restaurant since they came here before with my other siblings for a Mother's Day celebration. I on the other hand have to disagree with his love for this place. We came here today for lunch after a graduation. We had a party of about 25 people and there were about 5 other people in the restaurant. The free soup they gave was cold. We had to send back an order of pan fried noodles because it was burnt. Food came out very slow. We had 3 tables and we ordered the same for all but they kept on messing up. Not all tables were getting their order and when we asked about it they questioned every little thing including checking plates to ensure we haven't received the amount we orders. I asked for silverware and water 5x before I was given water and the utensils I got myself at the counter. 

To top it off, it's 110 outside yet it was hot in their restaurant. Felt as if their AC was not running

It was a waste of money! I will def not be back!
