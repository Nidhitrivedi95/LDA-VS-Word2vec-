Oyo5CWthu2upxxaf69MfIg After visiting Anna's Garden a few times on 2 trips to Vegas in the last 3 months, I can firmly say 'two thumbs up'.  Each time I've gone has been a completely different experience.  (I suggest going for lunch before or after the typical lunch rush hours.)

The 1st time was with a Chinese friend and his parents.  They go every week and I was lucky enough to be invited along one time.  The 4 of us ordered 8 dishes so they could take home a bunch of left-overs for the week.  Obviously, they love Anna's... mostly because it's authentic and has no MSG!   

The 2nd time was with a group of non-Asian friends, English and Latin mostly.  Again, everyone really liked their food, especially since we went for lunch and most of the dishes we ordered ended up being only $5-$6 each!

The 3rd time was with a mixed group of friends, some Asian, some not.  Again, we went for lunch, though this time I knew to go later to avoid the rush.  We arrived at 2pm and it was perfect.  Again, everyone thought it was delicious.

So all in all, I've probably tried at least 15 dishes at Anna's in the last 3 visits.  My favorite is their pan-fried noodle with chicken and veggies.  It's the hard noodle that softens when you put the sauce on it.  I used to not like that dish much, preferring rice noodles to egg noodles but ahhh, how times have changed!

See ya there!
