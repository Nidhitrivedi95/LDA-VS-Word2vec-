xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I have eaten from this restaurant twice before and the first experience wasn't the best, so I really did not come back having high hopes for the second meal. As expected, the food was undercooked (specifically the potatoes in my Thai curry), and the pad thai was too salty for my liking. As a huge thai food lover, I was thoroughly disappointed with my experiences at this restaurant and would not recommend the thai menu here for anyone.
