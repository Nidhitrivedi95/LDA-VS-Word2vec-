ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw Very disappointed at this location which is unfortunate because I LOVE PEI WEI. I always get a salad, frequently I get the Asian chopped salad with the pei Wei spicy chicken which isn't that difficult but the staff made it seem like it was the end of the world to ask for such a thing (even though I've ordered it frequently at other pei Wei locations). Then we received our salads which were suppose to be the regular size but when they came out it had to of been small because it was tiny with only a few pieces of lettuce and few chicken pieces but ok np. I kindly asked if this was the small and they were like no that's the regular very sarcastically. There's no way that was the regular because any smaller would not have been worth purchasing . I literally had to take it to go because it was all drenched but no lettuce so I went home and used my own lettuce to make it an actual salad. Very disappointed. 

The waiter was nice... that's about it.
