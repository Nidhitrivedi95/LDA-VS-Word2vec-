The lady there was super sweet and made sure she attended to all the customers in a very timely manner including myself. The food was good and was comparable to the other Hakka restaurants I've visited. However, the chow mein was a little too oily and the biriyani was a little plain. Overall, it was a pretty good restaurant and will definitely be visiting again. I rate this place 4/5 because I have had better but hopefully during my next visit I can rate this 5/5.
