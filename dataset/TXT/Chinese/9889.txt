1vBvO5QrLzbtg9MTMdB2EA I paid 30.00 for a one hour massage and when it came to pay and give a tip I requested I'd like to leave a 10.00 tip.  The man at the front desk said there is a credit card fee.  However no where in there did I see this disclosure.  He ran my card for 30.00 plus a 10.00 tip however he only handed me 8.00 back.  Where is the other 2.00 going?  When I called back to complain he hung up on me and would not give me the owners name or phone number.  The sign out front stating a one hour massage rate is also not accurate.  My complaint is if my receipt says 10.00 tip then he should have given me 10.00.  I feel this is not good business practice.
