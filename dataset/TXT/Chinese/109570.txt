loXkZgAd70KMjP8ISCnZPQ Ughhh I'm so full!!!! Hearty portions. Unlike most takeout, this food was actually flavorful. I think maybe the fried foods could have used a little more drying time as it was still a bit greasy. Nothing a napkin couldn't fix so it wasn't soggy greasy, just a little too much left over from the fryer. Didn't change my opinion on the food though. I got the shrimp spring roll which you could tell had actual shrimp in it, the wonton soup (the noodles do not have the pork in them which is totally okay with me because I pick it out anyway), crab rangoon  (YUM!), chicken fingers (which are a lot bigger than regular chicken fingers from Chinese resturants... a little heavy on the breading), and the chicken and shrimp lo mein which was absolutely amazing! The lo mein had a ton of different vegetables in it which I tend to see a lot of Chinese restaurants get a bit skimpy on. I also want to mention I definitely did not eat all of this food, when I order Chinese I also order enough for lunch the next day. I usually take a little bit of each per meal. The portions are so big that I will need my fiance to help me finish it all. I couldn't do it, even if I wanted to! Overall, great little Chinese restaurant. Highly recommend. Just be prepared for a lot of food when you do order (never a bad thing, just hope my food doesn't go to waste after ordering so much).
