-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ We love this place. It's good for lunch/dinner. Their menu is simple, but has many choices. You can see how they prepare your dish behind the counter. The service is rather good. If there's a bit wait time, they will apologize and inform you. We always order the salt/pepper chicken wings as appetizer which comes in 8 good size pieces for $8. I ordered wonton soup this time. It comes with large size shrimp wanton, broccoli, water chestnuts, straw hat mushrooms and big shrimps. The taste is so good and surely to fill you up. My husband had the fried spicy shrimp with noodles. Huge portion and the spice is just right. I won't say this is a cheap place, but the food is good quality. It has become one of our regular stops.
