I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg This was my first time having Taiwanese-style shaved ice and it has got me hooked.  I had the taro snoh with red bean, green tea mochi and black sesame glaze.  LOVED the taro snoh and black sesame glaze.  I'll have to pass on the mochi next time because I didnt' like how it got harder and less soft and chewy the longer it was in the snow.

Great atmosphere to hang out, they have board games at every table.
