DiCWSyoaBkIpOVUdIO7Jlg Whenever I think of Little Dumpling, I automatically think of Jimmy Fallon's Thank You Notes. "Thank you dumplings for tasting better than you sound" Lol!

All jokes aside, I don't get the bad reviews here. I really like this place. The food is good and so is the service. I've dined in a few times, cute little restaurant and very clean, no complaints. But mostly I like to use the delivery service. You can pay online, even include the tip so when the food comes to your door all you have to do is grab your food and say thanks! :) I'll be honest, they do take a while to deliver but I'm sure 30 minutes seems like an eternity when you're starving. 

Everything I've tried so far has been good, but the General Tso's chicken is my absolute favorite. Get two orders so you can have left overs the next day. Nothing better than leftover Chinese food. Ummm.
