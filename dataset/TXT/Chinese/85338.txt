hjDCsuzS_yU60FFffqpt-w Thing is with chinese buffets, there are far more dishes than you can or even should eat.  You can't taste em all and when you're through trying, you've overdosed on all the wrong things and look like a snake that swallowed a basketball.
Food here was ordinary (good).  There were 14 food islands with more dishes than anyone could ever sample at one time....still the same can be said about all chinese buffets that I'm acquainted with.  There is also a shushi bar and a mongolion bbq which they call Hibachi bar.  
Because it's new, it's decorated nicely.
Oh, I didn't mention that while I was eating, I pulled a long maybe 10 inch strand of someone's hair out of one of the foods piled on my plate.
I am giving this a three star rateing but at the same time, I wouldn't go too far out of my way to eat there again.  This was the first time.  An exploration, if you will.
