9g4jaW7IzcuwXg86eJbynw Id steer away from the dumplings, especially the seafood ones. they were very doughy and tasted very much like imitation seafood. however, the handmade noodles are out of this world. i was very happy with my noodles with chicken. great flavor, huge portions, and very cheap. not to mention, the food came out pretty quick.
