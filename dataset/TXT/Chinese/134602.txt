Q62lGVKqoKJ09lZNt2qpfw I am totally hooked to this place. Food is great, they give plenty for take out. Price is also reasonable, you get some discount if you pay by cash. They also have lunch special that comes with soup or roll. 

This is a bit too crowded on weekends, I prefer going a little late in the evening for take out.
