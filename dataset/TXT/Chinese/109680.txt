Lpp8IiUVEhJzF4Fb8DkScQ Hakka Legend is one of those places you go to when you and a group of people do not know what to eat.

We came here as a group of 6 extremely hungry people and the waiters were quick to serve us. We ordered 2 fried rices (chicken and veggie) chili and pakora chicken,  and their Hakka noodles. The taste was alright and we did leave pretty full + we were able to take home leftovers. Gets you out of that hunger and well the price ain't that bad.
