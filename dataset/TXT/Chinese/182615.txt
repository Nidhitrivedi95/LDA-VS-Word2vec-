XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA This place stinks of fish, which is something I always like to mention for those who have a strong sense of smell, like I do.  Beyond that, I love it here!  On weekends, it's impossible to find a time that isn't ridiculously packed and busy.  Yesterday (Sunday), they actually ran out of ice for drinks for a brief period!!  I really enjoy the sushi here and could just eat that all night.  There is a nice assortment of Chinese food items, Mongolian-style barbecue and seafood delights, like crab legs and frog legs.  The desserts are great; the best is the variety of ice creams!  The service was fine for a buffet.  The table was kept clean and the drinks kept full.  I've brought many special guests here.  $41 for three people to eat an enormous Sunday dinner with drinks... not bad at all!  If they could do something to counteract that terrible fishy smell, I'd give this place 5 stars.  ;)  They also offer take-out prices by the pound!
