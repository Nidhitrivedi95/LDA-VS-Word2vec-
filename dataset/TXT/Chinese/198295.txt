zXJilaBN28oUdX7Owf0fRA I am so surprised by the harsh reviews of this place! This is by far one of my favorite sushi places in the city. There are a lot of places for improvement but as far as the sushi scene in Pittsburgh is concerned, Sakura is doing great!

They have one of the best variety of rolls I've seen in Pittsburgh. Usually whenever I go somewhere new and order sushi I stick to my usual, the dragon roll. At Sakura I'm always trying something new. Their menu is so extensive and creative that I don't usually even bother with the typical staples like salmon, or tuna rolls (although they are good too). I'm all about their interesting and unique rolls, the list of which is always growing. Some of my favorites include the Godzilla Roll, Red Dragon Roll, and the Spicy-Tuna rice sandwiches (I forget the exact name...) Also, they usually have a weekly special (not that it really ever expires... you can always order these even off the menu). This is how I found my real favorites, the Monkey Roll, Earth Roll, and best of all the Ocean Roll. 

My only complaint is that the prices are a little steep, but I think for the quality it's worth it. I don't know about how their other food is aside from sushi, but the sushi itself is great. Don't let the unattractive outside facade fool you, this place is great and relatively quiet on the weeknights, so go then if you want faster service.
