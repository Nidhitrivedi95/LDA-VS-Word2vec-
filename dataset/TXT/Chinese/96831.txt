I ordered the fried rice with 3 chicken wings (Bruce Leroy). It was very fresh and flavorful. The chicken had a really good flavor and fried to perfection. She gave me a sample of the mac and cheese and I was sold.... One side of that please. I also had a side of collard greens that came with a piece of hot water cornbread that looked like an egg roll. The greens were not cooked with any meat so they weren't as flavorful as I would've thought but with an added pinch of salt and eating them along with the cornbread, they were quite tasty too. I wanted to try the peach cobbler but it wasn't ready.  I was there again the same week and will be back probably before the weekend is up. This is my husband's new lil fave too.
