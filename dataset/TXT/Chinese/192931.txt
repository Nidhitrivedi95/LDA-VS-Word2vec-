ZB4ViCkUyJ4j-cJjOQ-N4A Went there last Friday .. Sing said move downstairs .
It is no longer the same super fantastic restaurant..
The afternoon special no longer, the good beef noodle from the previous owner no longer serve replaced by thin Japanese ramen just awful.
The pan fried buns were just passed. Missed the old 'Three Villages '
It was a fantastic restaurant.. The new place just not worth the trip.
