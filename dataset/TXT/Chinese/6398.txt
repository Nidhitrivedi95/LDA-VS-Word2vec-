0I0yATfnNQJB-A-IPGgqDA We went to Aristo Bistro for the first time yesterday and were thrilled with the food and the overall experience. We have passed by the restaurant many times but never ventured in. But I happened to read the Yelp reviews and my husband and I decided to try it based on the excellent reviews. The dinner did not disappoint! We were pleasantly greeted to our table and the restaurant itself is done up in a cozy and elegant manner (white table cloths)! We also have been craving a good Chinese restaurant in Westlake and Aristo Bistro is that and more. The menu is very interesting with items from China, Japan, Singapore etc (Aristocratic Eurasian we were told!). We ordered the vegetable spring roll, my husband ordered the Won Ton Soup and I ordered the vegetarian Buddha Hot and Sour soup. All sumptuous portions and delicious. For our main entree we shared the Classic Stir Fry with Tofu and Chicken with the Nippon Curry sauce and the fried rice! Every item was unique, made with fresh ingredients and delicious. The Nippon Curry (a first for us) was elegantly spiced and wonderful. Large portions so we brought home enough for lunch today! Prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount! Excellent service as well! We will surely come back. And hope others reading this review will stop by and keep this new local business operating for a long time. Aristo Bistro is an excellent addition to our culinary scene in the Westside.
