IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ I know that I live in Irvine, the MECCA of authentic and tasty Chinese food, so perhaps my superior and spoiled palate has a higher standard for Chinese cuisine, but COME ON REALLY!!!! How do you mess up Mongolian Beef? 

My boyfriend and I got the Mongolian Beef (more like The Sugah Beef) and Mabo Tofu (it was aiight). 

The beef was WAY too sweet! I was expecting a spicy and savory flavor sensation, but clearly the cook was thinking something else!

Definitely won't be going here again! $17.95 for sugary beef makes me a sour puss!
