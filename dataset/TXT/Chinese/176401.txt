WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg On a recent trip to Las Vegas was hungry and was craving some Chinese food and came across this place and I must say that I wish I hadn't, this place is one of the worst I have ever been to. First food tastes like it's been out all day, poorly cooked and very poor quality, service not good and over priced for what you get...heck they even charge you .50 for a cup of ice water. Avoid this place at all costs.....
