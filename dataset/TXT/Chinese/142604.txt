rkVTKhUDO-VtrIu8esB75g Hard to say how the food is since the cashier ignored me as I stood in front of the counter with money in hand. Restocked cups and moved around random register items instead of acknowledging me. I decided to order next door instead. Others were promptly greeted so I don't know what about me indicated that I just wanted to stand there and NOT order food.
