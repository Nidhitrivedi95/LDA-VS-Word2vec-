1MrJJ9tyNyfFrxaNZ67xFg Came here last week for a birthday celebration. It was snowing out so there weren't many people dinning. The hostess was incredible. She showed us to a hibachi table took our drink orders and even answered our questions while we waited on our server who she informed us had just walked in a bit late due to the weather. No biggie because she was great and more then accommodating. 

I started out with sake because what celebration doesn't start out with a good drink. After reviewing the menu I decided on tuna. Included in the meal was soup of your choice and a house salad. I loved the dressing. Our hibachi chef was fun. Not the best I've seen but still put on a good show. My tuna was overcooked but still tasted descent. The fried rice was a bit bland and could have used a bit more seasoning. I also ordered plum wine which is a favorite for me. Over all it was a descent dinner and the 2 other people at the table made for great conversation. I would like to come back and order off the main menu. I feel this place has untapped potential.
