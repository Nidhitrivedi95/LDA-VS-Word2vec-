trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ One of the few places that lived up to the hype here in Toronto. 

We were accommodated despite all the tables reserved. On a Saturday. At 7pm. Not bad! 

Our server was Kevin - a really nice guy who did everything to make our experience enjoyable. Who even brought me 3 samples of various beer - one which he decided to mix. A failed experiment, but I definitely appreciated the enthusiastic attempt. I ordered mussels and frites, my girlfriend ordered caesar salad and fish and chips.

The mussels were very fresh, large, with a great broth. The fries were excellent and plentiful. My girlfriend's caesar salad was quite fantastic. Not your basic caesar - lots of flavour with sardines mixed in. It's tough to elevate a caesar salad and normally not worth commenting on...So huge points here. The fish and chips were as good as the ones she's had in Dublin and the UK. And once again, tons and tons of fries!

Overall just a great experience. I guess my only regret is not ordering some oysters? Well, next time I guess.
