fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA We were here on vacation and we decided to try this place after spending the morning in Chinatown.  We weren't impressed with the food or the service.  This is a very small restaurant with a few seating.  For the restroom, you have to meander downstairs.  Beside our table, there were only two other customers but the server seems to be in a rush.  The food was not really good.  We lived in overseas and also spent sometime in Los Angeles and Washington DC.  The beef noodle soup just didn't taste very good.  It was very salty.  The noodles were a little tough and chewy.  We had some friend dumplings.  It wasn't crispy.  It was very greasy and too doughy.  We weren't too impress with this place. 

It's definitely not the best we've had.
