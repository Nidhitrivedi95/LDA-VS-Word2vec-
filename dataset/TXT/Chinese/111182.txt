The buffet selection was as expected and the food was good. Service was good considering the large amount of people eating. 

I am a big fan of sushi but the prepared selection was dismal. You can have some made to order but no one was around to take our order. Things got worse as my son needed to use the restroom. After seeing how awful the men's room was, I asked my wife to check on the women's room. She stated it was even worse. So sadly, we left our meal early just so we could get our son to a restroom. It certainly made us think twice about visiting this location again. We hope that we will have a better experience at the new location on Baseline once it opens.
