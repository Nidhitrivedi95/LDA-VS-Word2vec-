fjE-jiwnTQysz-rLl6YMQg Amazing Wok seems to be catching up with technology if the receipt from our delivered Chinese meal last night was evident of anything. 

I'm going to knock off a star for the flavorless beef fried rice I probably should have avoided, but the potstickers I wrote of before are still asskickers (I put in a double order for Kay and I), and the General Tso's Chicken (we wanted to play it safe since we were simply starving) has that moist, honeyed, crackling quality that makes the dish such an easy crowd-pleaser. 

Ordering over the phone with a credit card was a cinch, and the delivery was speedy.

Amazing Wok is almost amazing.
