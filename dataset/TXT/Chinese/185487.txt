y_Xi2V_0lGbCkRuiXLHUFA I read a review about Hong Kong Buffet and decided to go there although I wasn't familiar with the neighborhood.  The food was average but there was a large variety from sushi and appetizers to main course meat and desserts.  My only complaint was they put cold shrimp next to the desserts in the buffet line, making the desserts look very unappetizing.
