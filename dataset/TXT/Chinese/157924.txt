If the meat were fresh or the price a bit lower I'd add the fifth star, but ultimately everything else in your experience comes down to your skills. I get 3 tasty meals out of my visit, and here is my strategy:

1. Get some butcher paper and repeatedly crush down your meat to create a secondary "meat bowl" effect. This allows more meat and less mess.

2. Spices: don't be shy.

3. Veggies: feel free to have a small pile, and use butcher paper to scrunch it down.

4. Noodles: gotta do the trifecta, but end with a big pile of wheat noodles. They weigh everything down.

5. Sauce: if following these instructions, double the recipe on the board, pour a few scoops on the noodles themselves, and add some hot chili oil for good measure.

6. Cooking: don't miss the crunchy and sweet things at the end. If you like those things, they are available.

7. Tips: tip the cook. It's hot back there.

8. Post-Game: You will not finish this. You will have extra sauce on the bottom. Get 2 bowls of brown rice to soak up that delicious sauce and get two to-go cartons worth of awesome leftovers. They will be better the next day after soaking up flavors overnight.

9. Label your cartons. People are crazy.

There ya go. Happy eating!
