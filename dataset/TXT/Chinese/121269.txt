O7_rXHN_-cFp0TgiMaNulw My newly found favorite in birkdale! This is my second time here in two weeks, I tried Lan Zhou noodles and pork belly bun. As a Chinese who have lived in New York for years,  I was always a bit disappointed at the Asian food here, Kung Foo noodles defiantly exceeds my expectations in NC. All the noodle dish I had so far are great, I would recommend Tonkatsu, it reminds me of New York style Japanese noodle house, very delicious.
