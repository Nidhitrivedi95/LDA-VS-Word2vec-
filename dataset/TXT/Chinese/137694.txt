QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw Vincent is the gracious owner of an authentic Hot Pot. The broth was exquisite. His family arrives in the  early morning to prepare the delicious broths. I suggested buying whole carrots to juillene, instead of the little finger ones, my only issue. His wife helped me mix a sauce up and gave me pointers on Hot Pot eating, very cool. I got the mushroom broth with veg. Plate for dinner and was very happy.
