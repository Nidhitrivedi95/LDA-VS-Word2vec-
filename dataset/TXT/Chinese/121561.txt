OaHJvi10dJbMIaQXg5e2Ag Do not let the strip mall location the food and service at this hidden gem are nothing short of spectacular ! The prices vs quality and quantity of food are ridiculously low . We tried the chicken and pork bhan mi with egg on servers recommendation , the bread was perfectly toasty and chewy vegetables crisp and pickled to perfection and the meat no words ! In short everything it should be but elevated by the egg . The pho was easily the best we had in area I did the chicken and hubby tried some amazing shrimp pork rice and egg noodle concoction . We also sampled summer rolls which came with this yummy sauce and the cabbage chicken salad . This place is a must try !
