zXjA4Jms2jCAP09EO7Ghfg I compare this restaurant to Chinese restaurant at the mall. We ordered the Sesame Chicken and Chicken Egg Foo Young. Both very bland. Sesame chicken was dry and tough with large chunks of under cooked broccoli and slices of carrots. Egg Foo Young was just as bland. Three large patties with large chunks of onion as filler. No vegetables just patties and near tasteless substance that passed off as gravy. 
Hot & Sour soup was somewhat better than normal but lacking in tofu.
