bI4emjU96ZvGQRTwxItd2w First time at Tom Yum.  Arrived at 1 PM on a Sunday and the place was empty. All of downtown was empty for Labor Day weekend. 

The menus here are put together more like a cheap, fast food place rather than finer dining. It wasn't visually friendly and took us a while to navigate. 

Our daughter got Yellow Curry with Tofu. She's not vegetarian but likes tofu. My wife got Beef Pad Thai while I ordered Royal Shrimp Supreme. 

The shrimp was kinda weird. It came in a rich tamarind sauce but aside from some steamed broccoli and carrots, it was just shrimp. The Pad Thai was also in a strange sauce. Not horrible but not great. 

The whole bill (water for drinks) came to $42 plus tip. Too high for the meal. Probably won't go back since there are so many good Thai restaurants nearby.
