l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA Always been  a huge Chinos fan.  Have been going to the original N. Phx location for years, since the early 1990's.   Have been a regular since the Chandler location opened.  Know the owners personally .. RIP Frank.  have nothing but praise for the concept, the flavors and the service (until recently that is...) 

Unfortunately, the Chandler location seems to have gone through a bit of staff turnover as of late.  They're understaffed at lunchtime, the wait for your food is incredibly long, to the point that it's frustrating.  They're losing their 'mojo' as Warren P. so eloquently put it :(  Makes me sad to see. 

When you can see your order sitting under the heatlamps for 10mins and no one brings it out to you?  frustrating.. 

This has happened previously only at night, or slow times mid-afternoon.... which is somewhat excusable.. but  now at lunch?   

Also had to help another patron with the menu.. no one bothered to give them the free samples and walk them through the menu (first timers used to get this sort of treatment!? hopefully this was also just an oversight??) 

Here's to hoping they read these reviews and correct the problem.  At over $10 for lunch, it needs to be darn fresh, hot and service great to keep me as a regular.
