TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA I really like this place. Good food and good atmosphere for dine-in. I've tried a few different dishes that I have enjoyed. Unlike alot of places lately their food has not been greasy at all each time. Appetizers were a little better than average and the soup was very decent. The main dishes is what I enjoyed most.
