GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g The food here is good, but the feeling i get is that this is a pimped out asian joint with sloppy standards, atmosfere og amature straff (maby not the kitchen) very sloppy servers even though they are overly friendly. I Tried the pot stickers the general taos chicken, and my girl testes the chicken ginger dish with a glass of vine and bottledlife water. We payed 120$ but we feel it was only wourth 60-70$. We have no problem paying big big for good food but we want to feel that its wourth it and leave with a feeling of "i want to come back" but the amature waiters and straff made us not want to.. ( but again the food was good)
