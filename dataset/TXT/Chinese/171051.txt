vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I usually don't go to restaurants in casinos for authentic Chinese food, but I read the reviews on Yelp and wanted to give it a try.  We went to PPP on Friday evening for dinner.  We were seated right away and I like the modern decor of the restaurant. It is clean and neat. We ordered some spring rolls, HK style wonton noodles ,and shanhainese pan fried noodles.  They are all so delicious. I like them being not too salty.  

I will definitely come back again and try out their dim sum as I read that they are pretty awesome too.
