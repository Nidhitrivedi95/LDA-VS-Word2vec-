7OKQ4ENVfPfxtDqFOG7x0g Reviewing this place for what it is (a cheap college town Chinese food place) this is an OK place to get food. Decent food, Low Price, and pretty large amount of food for the money. Dont go in expecting fantastic food that will blow you away and your experience should be ok.

On a side note, Some of the reviewers are complaining about customer service issues. Im a bit surprised by this since every time iv been into this restaurant the staff has been friendly.
