yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A My new happy place when it comes to Asian food. It's trendy, casual but not too informal, the open space is great for groups or if you feel like having a drink at the bar and a solo meal. Kitchen ran smooth, apps were done and entrees quickly followed. Staff is super friendly and our servers had great suggestions to try, and explained the tastes perfectly. Def worth trying something new every visit, been here more than 3 times and haven't been disappointed.
