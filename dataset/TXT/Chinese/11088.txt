2d-bG9IumvPOIwfr9Q4MKQ It's been a long time since I've been to this location and now I know why.  The food is crap!  The service is ok.  They don't clean out of the trash bins.  

This time it wasn't crowded or at least have some people in the restaurant when I first got there.  It was 1:00 p.m. and I was the only one in the restaurant.  They didn't have any trays to carry your food.  I had to ask, which is odd to me.  When I got to where the plastic ware was, there were plenty of forks but no knives!  How could I cut up my Teriyaki chicken without a knife!  

This totally sucked!  Everyone that came in...carried out food.  I hope someone from the Panda Express franchise sees this and changes this location!  I'm sure this is not what they want from their store!  Thank you!
