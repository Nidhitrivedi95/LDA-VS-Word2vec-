Michelin stars. We went around 6 and the place was still fairly empty- i think this was a good move as it filled up rather quickly by 6:45. Service was exceptionally attentive. Our fish and beef tenderloin were both cooked perfectly. Three course meal of this quality in the Wynn for only $50 is a killer deal.
