-H1-IzxW6CXmjhmF5F6iMA Decent food but I practically have to beg for extra soy sauce every time I order. I know it's only a small issue but it's annoying. So annoying that I'm leaving this review. How much does three or four packs of soy sauce cost them? I asked for for three extra packs of soy sauce and they placed one one the bag and stapled it up. I didn't notice the fooled me until I got home. The food is decent but taste like every other Chinese place. I may go back but I won't enjoy being made to feel bad when all I won't is extra soy sauce.
