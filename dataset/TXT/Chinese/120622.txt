O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw Definitely appreciated the no-frills quality of this restaurant.  My server barely spoke English, but it's ok because we both spoke the language of FOOD.

I ordered the Deep Fried Tentacles, half because I actually really enjoy squid and/or octopus (whichever one they would turn out to be), and half because the name of the dish really amused me.  It was exactly what you think it would be.  Hot, greasy, delicious.

Then ordered the Siu Mai, steamed shrimp dumplings, and the shrimp rice dumplings.  I ordered Crab and Pork Soup Dumplings... thinking it was the soup dumplings I'm familiar with in NYC, where there's scalding hot but delicious soup inside the dumpling... but instead, it was a bowl of soup with a very large blob of dumpling in it.  Difficult to eat and a sore disappointment from my expectations...

Also, the bakery next door was pretty awesome.  Wait, let me go write a review on that one separately...
