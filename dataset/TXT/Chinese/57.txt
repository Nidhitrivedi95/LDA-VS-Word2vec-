--SrzpvFLwP_YFwB_Cetow I used to come here occasionally but I will not be back. The service here isn't that great to begin with. Even during non busy hours the workers are slow and do not pay much attention so sometimes you really have to wave them down to get their attention...which is annoying. But I would come back because the food was good. 

Well, things have changed. It seems that the prices are going up for the dishes but the quality of the food is going down. With so much choices out there it's definitely not worth putting yourself through such crappy service for mediocre food.
