It is located in the heart of Montreal Chinatown so a good for some photo ops. Overall the taste is just fair. I like they have so many filling options, vegetarian, beef, lamb or pork. I agree with some of the reviewers that steamed actually taste much better than fried. The fried ones are so dry, takes away from the taste completely. Nothing too special, not worth making a special trip for.

But if you do, Cash Only
