kWkW6vVePpBox_fKfGgPjQ I'm actually in Pan Asia while I write this. We have ordered chicken chow mein, gyoza and some cali and twist rolls. 

I really don't know why I keep coming here. This place has the worst service I've seen. Right now I'm watching the waitress watch the tv. This is the same waitress who flat out forgot our main dish last time. She brought us the check with it on there and didn't even apologize. 

Any way, this time it came out right away. Maybe she remembered last time. I haven't been here in so long and now I know why. The chow mein was fine but the gyoza came out cold!! I almost sent it back but since I've been here almost an hour with still no sushi, I was starving and ate it any way.  If the waitress was actually waiting instead of watching tv maybe it would have come right after it was done cooking.

Eventually the sushi did come out. It is just so so. I'm not sure if that is just how it goes when you try to get sushi in Arizona or not. I have found much better in Colorado (go Hapa!) and that is land locked as well, so I'm not sure if that's the reason sushi here is no good.

Honestly, I wouldn't waste your time with this place. I'm not sure if they even know how bad it has become. Hopefully they get the hint soon because I haven't found any asian food places on this side of town.
