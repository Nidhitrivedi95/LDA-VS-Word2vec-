B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ Relatively new restaurant serving a great menu of Chinese and Asian inspired dishes.  The owners (and chef) are actually Indian and plan to open an Indian restaurant next door.

Tastefully decorated if a little echoey. Warm colors. Excellent service. Dishes are cooked lighter than the Americanized Chinese fare. While appearing like a trendy fusion bistro designed by some California restaurateur, the entire  place is actually the work of the people who work there. And they have put a lot of their own heart into the place. They better have, considering it sits in a strip with 2 other Chinese restaurants of good quality. Give it a try, you won't be disapointed.
