WLCdg4ib7-_7b8epoXRjAw I've lived in the neighborhood for over a decade and always ordered from here. The food seemed as if it was slipping lately and we found another place nearby that also delivers. All I can say is Holy crap! I've been ordering from the wrong place entirely. Cherry house has stale meats, floating in awful, thick, flavorless brown goo. The spring rolls taste like they were frozen twice, and even the fortune cookies were rubbery. This place is just terrible. Thank goodness I'm recovering from the flu and didn't feel like going out. I never would have discovered what I've been missing all these years. This is not good food, even for takeout. You'd be far better off going to the grocery store and buying the store brand 'beef with broccoli' and some frozen egg rolls. At least they wouldn't be slathered in sauce that prisoners wouldn't eat.
