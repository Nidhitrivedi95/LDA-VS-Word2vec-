puPY7gVy7RCz8bK1zkzdoQ Tried this place for the first time today for lunch.  It was OK. Not spectacular. We had the chicken chow mein lunch special. Prices are good.  I found it odd that this particular lunch special comes with a side of egg foo yung.  I'd prefer almost anything but that - considering the egg foo yung wasn't at all like others I've had. But an egg roll, chicken wing or finger or boneless ribs make much better side items. And the amount of rice you get was pitiful!  One small scoop the size of an ice cream scoop.  Rice is the filler - there should have been more of it.  The chow Mein tasted ok - it wasn't bad or anything.  We've just had better.
