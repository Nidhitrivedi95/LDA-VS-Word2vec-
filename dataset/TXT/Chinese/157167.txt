TtaXPsMrTGyPsAlO5LFQ6w This place should really have two reviews, one for eating in and one for take out. My take out experience is much better, the food is fresh and palatable, but still has a ways to get close to the better Chinese restaurants. The lunch prices are reasonable for what you get, though, so I still order out regularly.

If you eat in, however, the buffet food is mostly soggy and you will have to search through the trays, plates, and bowls to find clean ones. This makes me worry about the cleanliness of the kitchen. Overall, the place has potential, but it currently gives the impression that the owners don't care too much, unfortunately.
