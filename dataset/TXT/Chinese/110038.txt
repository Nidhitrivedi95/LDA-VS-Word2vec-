LTF14u6dfIyJQ41P-FooiA Tried China Cafe for the first time tonight, my husband and I just moved to the area. We stopped in and ordered food to go: 2 general tso's chicken, 2 veg lo mein, and 1 order of crab rangoons. Our order was done in about 10 minutes, super fast! The place was very clean and the workers were friendly. I like that you can see the whole kitchen where they are making your food. Everything was very good! I would definitely order from there again!
