- food is very good but swimming in oil (as expected for Sichuan)
- service is rushed - they need more servers
- got here at 5:30.  At 6:20 there was a long line
- iPad ordering seems pretty gimmicky.  They should allow customers to download their own app so each person has a menu

But overall very good and very popular
