The problem lies in customer service.  I initially called and was placed on hold for over 5 minutes before I discovered a website on the menu.  After well over an hour of ordering my food via the website, it still had not arrived so I called the restaurant again.  I spoke to 4 different people, none of which could speak much English and all of them asked for my information all over again.  It took until the 4th person I spoke to to find out that they had not even started my order yet and that it would take another long while before it would arrive.

Definitely try the pangang curry if you dare brave the customer sevice.
