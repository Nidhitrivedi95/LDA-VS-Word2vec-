kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A They ruined a wonderful day of mine. My friends and I walked in and waited like 10+mins, one of servers was just right beside us and was helping taking orders for a desk, no welcomes, no "Hi". She saw us I swear but she kept walking away several times. Then we left there consciously. It was my first time to be there, and should be the last time for me certainly. The worst experience I've never had in town, I swear.
