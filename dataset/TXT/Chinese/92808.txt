itEntB3JJOAnRADa_BPrSg Wow, we won't EVER order from here again! 
Food took 2 & 1/2 hours to be delivered, cold and congealed. Every time we called they told us they were very busy and it was 10mins away, blaming the driver. Perhaps they might consider staffing up for their busy nights?! When the driver finally appeared he said he was "just given it" which clearly wasn't true because the food was stone cold. 

I told the driver our meal should be complimentary at this point and asked him to call his manager. He had to return to his car to retrieve his phone and card machine. They gave us a small discount and offered a discount off our next order, which is clever because we WON'T EVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN. 

Save yourself the grief and starvation and order from ANYWHERE else!
