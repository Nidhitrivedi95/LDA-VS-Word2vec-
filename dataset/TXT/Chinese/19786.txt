5ubokMNw8qfbX2WtxgJG1Q Throwback to the divey Chinese restaurant era of the 90s, and surprisingly not much has changed. Except maybe the portions which seem smaller these days. However that could be, because the last time I was here I was considered to be a small fry. 

This place is famous for their Cantonese style food. My favorite dish was always their salt/pepper deep fried squid and on my last visit I tried their taro stuff duck, which was so good that you know it's bad for you.

The decor of this place hasn't changed, so it does look really run down, and you shouldn't look for an upscale, attentive experience from the servers; mainly because you won't get it. It's typical Chinese style service, as to what you would get back in the mid-90s. Hurried, inattentive, etc. But usually coming to this place, my expectations on service isn't high to begin with. Even if you have a reservations, don't expect them to hold the table for you, since they do get pretty busy...  My visit before my most recent one, was a two hour wait with reservations, just to give you an idea. They do brisk business, but whether or not get seated at a table if you have made a reservation ahead of  time during peak hours is another matter altogether.

The parking lot here could use a resurfacing, becaus it's pitted with potholes and there isn't enough parking for the capacity that they do have to begin with; but once again the food is usually good enough to override any qualms on the details.
