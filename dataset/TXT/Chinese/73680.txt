fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw Waiter screwed up our order twice :(....with the price your paying, the least that the restaurant can do is serve that ramen soup on a real bowl not on a plastic bowl, kind off tacky to think they have to compete with a lot of great food places around...restroom was too far of a walk.... Overall not coming back but will always support Fuku burger...
