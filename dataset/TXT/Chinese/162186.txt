uLUl_dMl6a9m774LGReDVA If I could I've zero stars I would. The restaurant felt sticky and dirty. The waiter was nice but when I asked to place and order for an appetizer I was yelled at and told to wait for my waiter. The waiter never came to get the order so I didn't order. The rice was not hit and in a pan that was cold. The meat was iffy and I was scared to eat it in fear I was going to get food poison. The price was unreasonable, only because everything tasted like it was frozen And from a bag. The general Taos chicken tasted like it was reheated and the sauce was super thick. The egg rolls tasted like they were old and refried. I wouldn't go here!! And I don't plan on coming back. I don't recommend!
