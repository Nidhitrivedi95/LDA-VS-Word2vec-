hsgRNkXFMCqzO7nPRB3yJQ To be honest i think this place is really more of a 3.5, but no half stars on yelp so oh well :) Anyways, I would say this is my go to HK style cafe, just b/c it's not ridiculously over priced, and the food is actually pretty good when you know what to order. Now here's where it gets tricky. This cafe does certain things really well (ex. baked porkchop and fried rice), while other items will make you never want to return (ex. beef in black pepper sauce with rice, which had a really crappy sauce). 

In terms of setting, it is a pretty typical HK style cafe: bustling, busy, loud and run by chinese housewives (si lais) who really don't care for their quality of service.  Though these things may be seen as negative to some, for many who have been to HK, this might actually feel familiar and welcoming. 

Overall this is a good place to go to every now and then. Just avoid lunch times and weekends 'cause the restaurant is REALLY small, and it is quite popular.
