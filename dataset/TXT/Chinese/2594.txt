_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg This place is one of the better cheap Chinese/Korean buffets.  One of the few places I have been where all the food seemed like it was made today and not leftovers from yesterday if you know what I mean.  Some of the dishes were actually interesting like the baby octopus with bell peppers and jalapeno peppers.  They had oysters on the half shell, while not freshly shelled they were tasty and in good condition. They standard whole fried shrimp were excellent compared to other Asian buffets.  The beef ribs were surprisingly tender even if they used bottled BBQ sauce, I like bottled BBQ sauce anyway.  The char shu flavored pork ribs were fresh and tasty too.  While none of the sushi wowed me, they were better than other buffets. For $12 with an ice tea, this place is priced right for me to return, especially after I work out and it is also close to my Fairfield Inn almost within walking distance.
