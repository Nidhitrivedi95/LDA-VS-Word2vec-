cm5pya6toFXn6sJT4FVGyg What can I say? My sister told me about this place and I wasn't sure as it's located in a nondescript strip mall shopping center. Don't let that fool you or the modest decor. It is insane ! I call it crack Chinese because I cannot get enough of it! I have a bunch of co workers hooked too. The moo goo gai pan is great....chicken cope suey with super fresh vegetables .. To die for. This is the most authentic Chinese I've ever had. I'm there three to four times a week!
