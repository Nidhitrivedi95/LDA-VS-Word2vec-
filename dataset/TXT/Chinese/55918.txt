cxVp-a28Cp7lavjaPMvK5w Pittsburgh's finest, hands down. Social House is exactly what the city has been missing. From the breathtaking decor to the detail in each dish, Social House is a true dining experience. I would consider myself a regular having dined 1-2 times a week since they've opened the doors. I have tried almost everything on the menu. The idea of the menu is that most dishes are shareable which makes it great to have the opportunity to try multiple dishes. The Waygu (which is comparable - if not better - to my absolute favorite steak at STK in Las Vegas), the Yaki noodle dish is to die for, the broccoli appetizer will leave you wanting more and POP Rock sushi roll (Yes, I said Pop Rock) has the perfect mixture of a popping sensation with shrimp, asparagus, avocado, topped with a spicy aioli that is an absolute must have. The menu is very affordable. The staff is great. I've got to know a few of the waiters/bartenders really well and they seem just as enthused about the establishment as I was. The icing on the cake is that once your done eating, you don't want to leave. The vibe is great and music creates a great atmosphere to enjoy drinks with friends. It's the perfect place to accommodate your family, friends, co-workers or for a date night out. I consider this place the new hot spot in Pittsburgh. The best part is you don't even feel like you're in the city... more like New York or Miami. A must try for sure!
