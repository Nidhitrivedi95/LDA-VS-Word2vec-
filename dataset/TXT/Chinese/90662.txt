iiEjVLb4JDLE2xl8YGR-Gw I had recently read an article about Chili King so I decided to check it out. I had egg rolls and chicken with Szechuan sauce. Everything was delicious!  The waitress was great even though she spoke little English. Be patient and help her learn by pointing to your choice. She was wonderful!
