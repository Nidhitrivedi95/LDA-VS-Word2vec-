My friends and I laugh that the staff is almost clairvoyant, because your food will arrive just about the second you finish ordering it.  I particularly like the Orange Chicken, because the sauce and the breading seem very home-made, not processed.   The only downside to its popularity and speed of service is there can be a wait for seating during the lunch hour.
