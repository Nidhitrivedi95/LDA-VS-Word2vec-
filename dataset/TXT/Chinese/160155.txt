U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q From the outside, the restaurant looked cool but once I walked through several large fish tanks full of gold fishes and into the white dining area, it felt like I just stepped into an insane asylum. Maybe I was insane for trying such a pretentious restaurant that I know will serve average food I can get elsewhere for 1/2 the price. Oh well, it was too late to turn back and we wanted something light before hitting the road. Maybe I would be pleasantly surprised. 

Nope, as expected the food was average. We ordered braised beef brisket ($16.00) with handmade noodle and steamed pork buns ($9.00). 

Braised beef noodle - The soup was actually good but the noodle was average. With the word "noodle" in the name of the restaurant, the noodle was a big disappointment. Also, the beef had a wet towel smell to it. 

Steam pork bun - a disappointment as well. The texture of the bun was not firm and was a bit mushy and the pork had no flavor. At $9 for 3 little buns, we were expecting more. 

Service was good if this was a hole in the wall joint but when you are charging $16 for noodle soup, the service needs to be stepped up a notch or two. 

Everything about this restaurant is pretentious even for LV standards, from the ridiculous gold fish tanks, to the cold decor to the hostess in miniskirt (not complaining here). Noodle is comfort food so it would be nice if the restaurant could have a warmer feel to it. 

Recommendation: Don't come here for the food but if you like to look at gold fish, this is the place for you. Also, if you like all white decor, you won't be disappointed here.
