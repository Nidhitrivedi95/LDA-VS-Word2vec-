9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw I came here with my family for lunch and they were having a 20% off deal, so we ended up paying $17 a person which I would say is a super good deal. We tried a variety of meat/seafood balls, noodles, meats, shrimps, and vegetables. We also got the mongolion herbal spicy and the mongolian herbal broth. The food selection was pretty fresh and the broth was very tasty. They also had a sauce bar, which I really enjoyed. The satay sauce is my favorite. 

The servers were extremely attentive. We always got our broth refilled at the proper time. 

Also, they had a small selection for desserts, which is a plus.
