omMiNDhPYAX4TPfv4xrBLQ I tried to have a nice takeout lunch in front of the tv for my Saturday afternoon and what I got was me eating cardboard for about 3 minutes before I threw the dish in the trash. Bland, flavorless, driver did not have change for a $20 bill to pay and tip (this was a cash transaction). My expectations were low to begin with now I literally just feel sick to my stomach.
