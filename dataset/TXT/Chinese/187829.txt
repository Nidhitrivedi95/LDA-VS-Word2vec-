yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I heart this place for Bfast.  Pho Kim long is perfect for late night munchies BC they never close.   

There was only few other customers dinning early am. My order rare beef with a order of added meat balls arrived asap. The the fresh mints, sprouts and jalapeno made my pho yummy on a cold morning.

Another plus is they take credit cards with no minimum so I'll  certainly return here for bfast for the convenience.
