qGLEE1yA1bK0YdlGI-S39A This is my usual goto place after a long shift at work. Whether I'm sitting down or taking out the service is always fast. My typical order is either a wonton shrimp noodle soup or beef brisket noodle soup. The portions are generous and the wontons are large and flavourful. The beef brisket is tender and cooked just right. The place is usually packed during peak times so you might have to share a table with other patrons. For a tasty bowl of noodle soup at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong with this place!
