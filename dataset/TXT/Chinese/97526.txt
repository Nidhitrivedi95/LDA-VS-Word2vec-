JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw Hands down one of the best handmade fresh noodles that you can watch sitting at the bar. The noodles are cooked right and seasoning is on point. This place is clean and trendy. Pot stick, cold sesame noodle, pancakes, and pretty much everything we ordered are so good. Would highly recommend this place to everyone if you're coming to Vegas. I also love their green tea.
