O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw Loved the food, was blown away by the actual size of the establishment (looks like an average size from outside but it is HUGE) It was fairly busy, but not uncomfortable. Try the shrimp dumplings, pork buns, ribs you cannot go wrong! I found service to be as expected for 1) a Chinese restaurant 2) in Chinatown absolutely no complaints there 
I did find the bill to be heavier than expected but I quickly realized that they simply added the tip without mention. That was not appreciated and was my only let down to otherwise a great meal. I will be back. I strongly advise all to watch the bill and ensure there are no  indiscriminate charges
