emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw I ate here for lunch today...am I missing something from all the rave reviews...

I had the Chicken Lo Mein, the quality of the chicken and lo mein noodles is cheap, the hot & sour soup was okay but nothing grand, fried rice was plain, and the egg rolls weren't spectacular.

My dining companions had general's chicken, and mongolian beef...and they didn't seem to like their meal ither.

Over all it was a 1 star, but the 2nd star for the price and the soup.
