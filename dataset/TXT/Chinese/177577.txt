wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA The mood and setting at this place fitted well for a perfect date night. However as for the food, it was okay and edible but out of the things I tried nothing really jumped out at me. Yes, you can call it unique or exotic but again I didn't have anything to really rave about here.

Food 2/5 - Here are the items I ordered. Japanese Street corn, Bone marrow, snow crab fried rice, Sea Bass, and Signature Yari Ika Squid. Out of all the items I thought the squid were the best. The squid was cooked perfectly but I wasn't a big fan of the soy butter sauce. The item that disappointed me the most was the sea bass. For the price it wasn't very good at all. The sea bass was on the fishy side and the sauce was very plain. (it was just plain lime sauce on the side)

Service 5/5 - Service was excellent. No complaints here.

**** According to a review from 7/9/16 they change management... Just so you know my review here was based off me being here about a month before this time (June 2016).
