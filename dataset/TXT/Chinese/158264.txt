TxNeo206T0jMvRRQ4nKSIg The food and options here are better than Madarin. I especially like the freshly cooked food. It was loud and it felt more like a cafeteria setting than Mandarin. The servers were not as friendly but still very efficient. Maybe too efficient. I got up to hug someone as it was our staff Christmas partly and my plate of food got taken away. I would also have to say the drinks are not as good as Mandarin. The sashimi was really good...fresh and large in size.
