uLzgiSqVg5Pr93VVXSdOlg [Montreal Food Tour Stop #1] Delicious, freshly made Chinese noodles in the heart of Montreal Chinatown.  This restaurant is hard to miss - just look for the restaurant with a chef making noodles in the window.  You can stand outside in awe and watch as the noodles are prepared.  Or, the better thing to do would be to go inside and actually try them.  Notable entrees include beef noodle soup and zhajiangmian.

Highlights: The noodles are excellent.  They're soft with good texture.  I ordered the zhajiangmian, which is a large bowl of noodles with pork in a ground bean sauce topped with a layer of vegetables.  You get plenty of food in your order - in addition to your noodle bowl, you'll get a large cup of broth on the side.  The vegetables were very fresh and there was a lot of variety.  I noticed a pleasant herbal taste to the broth - definitely was a good thing to have on the side.  My photo shows a lot of vegetables, but they're not cheap with either the meat or the noodles underneath.

Critiques: Cash and debit only, but this is typical practice for a lot of the best Chinese restaurants.  Luckily, I had exchanged a few USD for some CAD at the overpriced exchange kiosk at the airport. With respect to the dish, the pork was saltier than what I'm accustomed to for this dish.  If the dish were less salty, I'd be giving this five stars.

Overall: Excellent quantity and top notch noodles are served at Nouilles de Lan Zhou.  I'd go back to try the same noodles with other toppings (for example, a beef tendon noodle dish that is only served on the weekends).
