KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ Been going to this place for years.  Always had great service and food has been really good.  We usually are waited on by Winny, she is the best waitress there.  We went there today 5/15/16, with some family members during lunch time.  Service was horrible and food was not as good.  Usually when Winny is not there it seems that we get really bad service.  Disappointing :(
