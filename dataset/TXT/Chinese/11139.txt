2d9RbgRtHJyTRzY99GBNOQ This place is clean and the food is standard Chinatown Cantonese fare. Not spectacular but a good option so close to the bus terminal. My one criticism is the service. The waiters have consistently tried to talk me out of my orders offering more standard options. I assume there have been people who've complained if they've expected Canadian chinese and recieved actual Chinese food instead and the servers are being proactive BUT I find having to work hard convince my server that I really DO want what I've asked for quite irritating. 

All in all, this place has good food, looks clean and spacious but lacks the charm of the places on Dundas closer to Spadina.
