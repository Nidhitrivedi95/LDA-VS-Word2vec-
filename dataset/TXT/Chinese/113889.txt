mRubgo8WfjraJkE5Bvbf6w The first few orders for delivery were pretty good.  Then they started quickly going down hill.  Delivery much longer, food was completely cold and quality went down significantly. Won't order takeout or delivery here again.  Do not make a mistake by ordering here. There are so many good place and the quality here is really poor.
