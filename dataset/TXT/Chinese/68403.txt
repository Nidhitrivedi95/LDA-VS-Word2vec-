ErzHs0c5EKwLD_YM2ZjsGQ This Panda Express is located at Town Square next to the AMC theater. I mean, Panda Express is Panda Express. I feel like they've gotten a little more expensive than they used to be. We came when it just opened for the day so not all the food was made yet -- had to wait 5-ish minutes for the entree I wanted. Staff is friendly, good customer service but nothing above average. 

I think everyone knows how Panda Express works -- an Asian Chipotle lol. I normally get a bowl with fried rice and Kung Pao Chicken (spicy chicken with peanuts and way too many vegetables). Their orange chicken is good but majority of the time is super strong, smell and flavor wise. Their mushroom chicken is good, too, but kinda watery. 

I'd really only come to Panda if there's nothing else to eat or if I'm really craving some friend rice and Kung Pao Chicken.
