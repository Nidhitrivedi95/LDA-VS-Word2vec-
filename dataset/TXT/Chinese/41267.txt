So they had a Chin Chin here in Lakewood a couple of years ago and unbeknownst to me it closed down...I still have dreams of my lovely Chin Chin.  The way I used to get my order to go and eat it all before I hit Lakewood Blvd.  Ahh, Chin Chin, I used to feel as though you loved me just as much as I loved you...

So on my recent trip to Las Vegas (The Meadows for all you newcomers) I stayed in a fun filled hotel called New York New York.  There are three separate tower elevators to get up to the rooms.  You are assigned an elevator based on your room.  I think I cried and wet myself all at once to see that right before our elevator was CHIN CHIN!

I stayed in Vegas for four nights and probably ate every other meal here.  It is cheap, good Chinese food.  The best Chicken Fried Rice I have had in a long long time...

Two thumbs way up!
