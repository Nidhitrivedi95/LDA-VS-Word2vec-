-ilH1FPt0lbX22IoiFUngA Given how popular this place is, I'm surprised that it doesn't have more reviews. Tasty Kitchen is a clean and simply decorated restaurant with Hong Kong movies showing on the four or two TVs placed around the walls. Customers here tend to be younger than the rest of Golden Square.

I had the Chef's Special pork ribs, which was one of the most delicious dishes I can remember having. The meat was as tender as butter and I loved the cartilage crunch. My guest did not like the sauce as much as I did, but she agreed that it was tasty overall.

The Tofu Seafood Chef's special was unique and I get the impression that the owner has fun creating interesting combinations. Unfortunately, I didn't think this dish tasted good, but someone else may feel differently.

I came here two times other times before this and the food was good both times, but I can't remember what I ordered. 

Customer service was top notch, and better than what you'd expect at most Chinese restaurants.

This place is on the less expensive side.

Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant to everyone. I'd give it 5 stars all things considered.
