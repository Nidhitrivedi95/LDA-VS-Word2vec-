H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag Awesome place. I come here for the lunch special. Great sweet and sour chicken. The lady is also very friendly and engaging. Makes you feel very welcome! The service is very quick. Less than 5 minutes to get the food out. The food itself is delicious and flavorful. Portion size is more than enough, and I'm a big eater!
