IBNWrN1k9E0E_bMcRD-GwA A good spot if you're looking for some good Taiwanese style cooking!  

Pork chop with sticky rice over yams (or pumpkin or seasonal yams) - I've had this dish three times here and each time it's awesome even though the yams or pumpkin underneath has always changed.  But the pork chop is still very tasty!

Glass noodles with minced pork - Had for the first time tonight and it's very simple but very flavorful.

Garlic stir-fry of seasonal vegetables - This dish is pretty standard in all asian restaurants, nothing special but solid dish nonetheless.

Tofu stir fry with eggplant - I didn't care too much for this dish, a bit light in flavor for me.

Mapo Tofu - Classic tofu dish that's very tasty.

The meal also comes with some white rice or brown rice if you ask.  The service was great, Rebecca is very attentive and wonderful.
