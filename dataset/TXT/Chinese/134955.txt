qAbXHsddBhmfQFegGiV7Dg I love love love this place for all the reasons that you can love a little restaurant.
The shop is small but cozy and they made sure that there is still plenty of space to sit and enjoy if you choose, but you can also order to go and either way the food gets to you quickly. It is also very fairly priced.
The food is good. The teriyaki chicken or beef are at the top of the list to try. The orange chicken, lemon chicken, beef and broccoli, mongolian beef, sweet and sour pork and all styles of fried rice are really good as well.
The other reason that I love to come here is because of the sweet gentleman that is ALWAYS behind that counter. He is just a character. He always seems so happy to see anyone and everyone, and he will most definitely put a smile on your face. It's nearly impossible to order from him and not.
All around I love to come here and I suggest that everyone give it a try.
