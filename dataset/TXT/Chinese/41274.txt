b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag I've been to Chin Chin a couple of times and I've yet to be disappointed. The drinks are always strong, the wine is never old.

This time we ordered the Wonton Soup and Anthony's Special Noodles. The wonton soup broth was amazing, light and complex I could taste a lot of white pepper which was great. The wontons were flavorful and tender. Anthony's Noodles were also very delicious, the flavor was lightly spicy and heavy with the taste of cilantro. 

Far from traditional, but that's not what you're here for (traditional can be found on Spring Mountain, the chinatown plaza). Portions are huge, the grease is great for building up the required barrier in your stomach required for heavy drinking! Will definitely be back for more when we're back in town in November.
