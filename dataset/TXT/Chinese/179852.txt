There's 3 or 4 different lines and a sea of people all over the place. However, there are plenty of staff that will direct you to the right line after which you'll wait 30+ mins in that line to get into the club and get stamped about 2-3x. Once you finally make it in you'll go up about 4 flights of stairs, (they have elevators too) and you'll arrive to an overly crowded place with people elbowing you left and right while you're waiting to get yourself a $20 drink. The music was great, but it was just too crowded to even have a good time and after about 20 mins we bailed. As we were walking out one of the bouncers asked if we'd go back in if he could find us someone's private table to hang out at. Um, thanks but no thanks, the 21 year old me probably wouldn't have hesitated, but hellz to no for 32 year old me. I'm all about the YOLO life motto but round 2 of going out to clubs in Vegas was enough for me. I'm good for the rest of the year!  I've noticed it's better to show up to a Vegas club between 1:30-2am, no line and easy peasy getting in.
