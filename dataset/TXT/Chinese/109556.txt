lOW5kH6nHVOYfmoAfpWvHw The other positive reviews are right on. Very tasty, not generic Americanized dishes, serious portions. I ordered take out and dined on it for a day and a half.
I had the scallion pancakes, delicately flavored; the xu xiang eggplant which had good texture and a mild plum(?) flavoring; green beans crisp and flavorful. The order came with a take-out container of sticky rice in sufficient portion to match the eggplant easily. 
Service was prompt and positive. I will definitely be back.
