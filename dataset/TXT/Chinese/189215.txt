yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Pho Kim Long isn't great. It isn't horrible either.

Pho Kim Long has been my go-to for pho for the last few months for my lunch breaks. I like how their service is quick and the food comes out quick. Lots of people waiting for a table? No worries. The wait is never that long. Their take out is also quick. Therefore, I could get a good meal in before my lunch break ends. 

I ONLY come here for their pho and fried egg rolls. I don't order anything else other than that.

I typically order the pho tai, which is the pho with rare steak. 

The consistency, however, is not always there. Sometimes the broth is good, but sometimes the broth is really watered down. 

Best part of Pho Kim Long is that it's open 24 hours. Late night clubbing and got hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. Late night hotel party and got hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. Late night drinking and got hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. Shitfaced and hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. HAHA You get the idea!

Though, one time, it took them 20 minutes to get my take out order ready. So that was a meh :/
