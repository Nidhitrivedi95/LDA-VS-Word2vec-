CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw to be honest, i was drunk when i ate here (surprise surprise) so i can't say that this review is totally objective. BUT, the food really really hit the spot. service wasn't all that great (they took our order and left us to fend for ourselves). i had the laksa curry noodle and it was worth coming back again for more.
