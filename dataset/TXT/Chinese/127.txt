-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg I am a big fan of Phô Ga (chicken) and will always try to find the best spot wherever my travels take me. Today I discovered Saigon and in my humble opinion based on my overall Phô adventures this restaurant rates as one, maybe even The Best Phô around the US. The broth is clear, not greasy and very flavorful. Thin noodles and lots of chicken. A real must. 
My second visit "the same day" I had summer rolls and lemongrass and chili stir fry with chicken both again very well done and very tasteful. My next visit to Cleveland  I will come back for more.
