WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg Delicious Hakka Chinese! Visited the restaurant in a large group and was happy with the bright comfortable ambience. Crispy Beef, Prawn fried rice, Chicken Manchurian (no gravy but delicious), calamari (appetizer) and Chicken chowmein!!! What's not to like!!! 
It's a great spot if you are seriously craving Hakka! Will definitely visit again :)
