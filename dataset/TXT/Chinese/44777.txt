BkxNYIAJv-ygcflZ5u3r4Q I am going to be very honest. I have been to various boutique spas and franchise beauty spas / massage spas throughout the South Charlotte / Ballantyne areas for the past 3 years, however Rejuvenate is by far the BEST!

Here is why:

1. Service
2. Professionalism / Knowledge 
3. Exclusivity
4. Value

I just had our first child, our baby boy DJ,  about 4 months ago. Kay did a massage and seaweed wrap on me to detox and minimize the appearance of cellulite. This was done 4 weeks ago. I can honestly say I see a difference! She was knowledgable able her services from a biological standpoint. The detox worked immediately then residuals over the course of a couple days. Stomach looked much flatter even though I was not "dieting". The spa is quaint and serene. You pretty much get the waiting room to yourself as she books appointments in such a manner. Her prices are awesome. I only wish I would have booked her handmade all natural holistic  sugar scrub to exfoliate my skin in time for my beach trip. Oh yeah, parking is a breeze! 

This is NOT for you if you like bright lights, ditsy staff and packed waiting rooms. Kay greets you and provides the service. Very private, professional environment. 

I bought my membership package (for me and the hubby) .... I think she cut us a deal because I'm a regular ;-)
