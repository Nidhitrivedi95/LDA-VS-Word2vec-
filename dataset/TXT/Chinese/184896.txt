xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw We met here for lunch.  First of all there were no shrimp. Then we made our choices,  between the coming stone and our table,  our meat/ fish choices had disappeared and then we got bowks that were not ours.   The manager told my elderly mom that her name sounded Like that of a man. Very tactful!  Not a good experIence.
