JkzqS4JDOpoHrj534rzvAA I visited this restaurant based on ratings. The exterior is not like your typical restaurant, and is pretty small. Once inside, the I found it to be very family friendly and the servers and cooks are very kind. I was in the mood for Chinese, and ordered sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. Soo good! I cut the pieces of crispy chicken with one stroke with my fork. They were juicy and so fresh. The sauce is very good- and the rice was delicious. I will be coming here more often, and plan to bring kids- I can order Chinese for me and burgers for them! The only thing, is it closes by six- So plan to go before then.
