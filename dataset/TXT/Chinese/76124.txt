g1UVmCOhQDY7TGSZ2rRT_w Love this restaurant! Very good price with very good quantity! Guangdong style food.. love their fried dough! Been here a few times with my friends and we will definitely come back. Lots of people when we were there and the waiting time is not a problem. Dishes are prepared pretty fast. I am pretty satisfied overall
