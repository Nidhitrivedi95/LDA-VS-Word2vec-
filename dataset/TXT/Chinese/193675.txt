ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Today is my 30th birthday and since it's a milestone, I decided to Yelp locally and find a new place. I read the reviews and saw they were positive so I happened to decide that this is where I'd like to spend my 30th birthday. 
I got all in my finest attire and stepped on out to the world. The ambience is great and more dressy than casual which is exactly what I was looking for. The alcohol that adorned the wall behind that bar was vast as well. We were greeted immediately upon entering and were seating promptly.
My sister and I took advantage of the "2" deal which was two meals and four cocktails for $30. 
Beyond a great deal IMO. We had two cocktails each and appetizers to start. 
I had the curry and my sister had the salmon bibimbap. 
Everything was beyond delicious. My food actually had spice to it too which I appreciate as I fancy spicy foods. 
We were also given complimentary peach fritters for my birthday for dessert which were phenomenal.
Service 5 star
Ambience 5 star 
Food 5 star
Overall you guessed it, 5 star
Highly recommended and I'll visit again
