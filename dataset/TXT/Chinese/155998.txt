Todrg1F247iuDIm784XHfA I don't know what to say except that the people on here with anything below a 4 star are just miserable people, or they don't know what good food is. Okay the fried rice is just okay, but the rest of the food is exceptional! This clown that gave theme a one star and said there were a bunch of bugs in his food is full of crap! My wife and I discovered this place on accident and we keep going back!!
