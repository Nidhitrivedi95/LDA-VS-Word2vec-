AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Being vegan tourists in Las Vegas, we searched out this place. We initially stopped in Veggie Delight and was turned off by its dumpy appearance and total lack of ambiance. We looked for a health department rating  and didn't see one. We decided to head over to Veggie House, and  immediately decided we would dine there instead. ("A" rating, tablecloths, and sign that read, "Please do not bring in seafood or meat.") I have eaten at Vegan Chinese restaurants in Philly and New York, but this one in VEGAS is the best by far.  Chef Kenny prepares the meals in a gourmet fashion. In a swanky setting, these meals could easily go for 3X the price. The portions are very generous, and each entree is bursting with a multitude of flavors. We had the fried wonton appetizers, which had a wonderful crispy texture and flavor.  I had the walnut scallops, which were out of this world. The flavor was so unique and amazing. My husband ordered the General Tzo's chicken which was equally tasty. Did I mention the pumpkin cheesecake? WOW. The food was served to us very quickly and the service was top-notch and incredibly friendly! A+++++ We will definitely dine here again and spread the word!
