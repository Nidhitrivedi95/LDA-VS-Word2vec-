5ubokMNw8qfbX2WtxgJG1Q Magic Wok, indeed! It's crowded and the service was not that great, but the Cantonese food was stupendous. First, your meal at Magic Wok starts off with a bowl of complimentary pork soup, which is nice and unctuously delicious. Our family style entrees included spicy lobster (absolutely amazing), beef tenderloin (so succulent and delicious), the most tender chicken... my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Complimentary dessert, too -- during my visit, it was a red bean soup. So yum. 

It can get very crowded here, so your best bet is to come early.
