tZ-h-gFhIWnrC4TR_N9K_Q Mr. Congee is really Mr. Everything.  They have seafood, BBQ, meats, veggie stuff, and congee - like all the other Congee places.  

I guess Congee is another word for Economical food.  Mr. Congee is surely that.  Fam and I have now settle on this place as our go to Congee place.  I have abandoned Congee Wong on 16th and Bayview - quality of the food was more than subpar the last few times.

Funny thing is that I have never had congee here.  Usual orders are spicy squid, turnip, black bean something, some kinda noodle, veggies, and rice.  We sometimes venture out of the norm to have lobster, pepper steak, and other recommendations.

All in all, the meal is fine.  Not going to win any foodie awards but keeps the kids fed and my wallet not as light as a dinner out at Yang's.

Cheers!
