QpOAv584eb-ecG4TLEm95g P.F. Changs this is not. Nor would I expect it to be. That said...

Not sure why this place is still open or why people like it. It's absolutely disgusting!  I seriously question the standards of those who deem this place great or even good. It's far from either. 

Food quality poor, its like they use the worst cuts of beef around for Mongolian Beef & try to pass it off as something edible & pleasing when its clearly not. Fried rice is that of cardboard. Everything is soupy, greasy, and just not appealing at all. If you want MONGOLIAN BEEF SOUP," this is your place. 

Chop Stix is soo much better & up Bermuda at Silverado Ranch. 

Save your money, your stomach, and palate & avoid this place. I don't know about the other locations but this one could use a Kitchen Nightmares makeover. The owners would do well to pay attention to the bad reviews. They certainly are deserving of them.
