yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Most well known pho place I know of. All of my friends have at least been here once, i've been here multiple times late at night, and even for lunch. I've experienced pho at many other restuarants and can say Pho Kim Long is just about average.  

My most recent visit was yesterday. As it was hot, i didn't feel like ordering something too hot like a soup or rather pho. I wasn't too hungry either, so i ordered Pan friend udon, yes I know, a Pho place wouldn't specialize in it, but another place i've been to had superb udon.

It was around 3pm when i arrived and there was a good amount of people. Glad to see they're still getting service. I walked in and it took me 10 minutes just to get seated. Like i said there was a good amount of people, it wasn't packed or very busy. Once i got a table i browsed the menu, already knowing what i wanted, udon. I eye'd the waiter down or rather signaled him to come over and he looked away, but he did eventually come around after 15 minutes of waiting. I ordered my chicken pan fried udon and he went on his merry way. 

The order came faster than i expected took about 3 to 5 minutes aha. Not bad. I tasted my first mouthfull. Not bad, but not good either. It was very tasteless. I put some sauce on there, it made it better but i could still taste that blandness in the noodles. Nearing the end of the dish, I noticed a lot of bean sprouts leftover. I like beansprouts and i tend to eat those first but there was still a lot and it watered down the sauce so much that it just tasted like water after eating most of the udon.

Again, I suppose having udon at a pho place isn't ideal, but i wasn't feeling up to having a hot soup on a hot noon day. Perhaps at dinner? 

This was an average day, i was full after eating, but wasn't satisfied with how it tasted. Eat anything but the udon!
