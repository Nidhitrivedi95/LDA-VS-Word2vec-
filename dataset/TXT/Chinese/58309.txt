dblGQtHAzNy1ACis1m2shw I'm very surprised that people have had negative experiences in this restaurant.  I have dined here about 5-6 times, and every time, the food is excellent and the service is fast and friendly.  I plan on having lunch here tomorrow or the day after.  I never spend more than $8 (20% tip included) and I leave stuffed to the gills every time.
