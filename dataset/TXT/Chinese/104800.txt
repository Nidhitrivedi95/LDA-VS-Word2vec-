KqC7y46lAjWAksfKsWStWw One of my favorite chinese restaurants by far. Their chicken peanuts is to die for .. It's not as spicy as it looks like with all the dried red peppers .. Have if with white rice and ur golden. It's a nice place to go to with big hungry groups as they have hot big platters for sharing that comes on a hot plate ..
