dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw I was at Tommy Rockers today to do one thing EAT! I stepped into the lot between the food trucks and Jenny from the Great Boa truck came right over to tell me about the items on their menu without me even stopping, now that is service. I walked around for a minute and came back knowing the Great Bao was my choice. Had the Duck, Pork Belly and the Pot Stickers.
Pork Belly was good but the Duck steamed bun stole the show. The Duck was right on with some great flavors, the tiny cuts of cucumber stuck out and complimented it very well. The pot stickers came out late and they gave me an extra one for waiting.
Can't wait to go to their hidden location next!!
