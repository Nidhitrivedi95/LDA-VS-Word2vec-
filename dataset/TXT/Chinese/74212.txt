fnaDx7UD4MiodQlgYHDwsQ One word, "Awful". Nuff said. I ordered the crispy duck and the honey walnut chicken. Never seen duck and honey walnut chicken look not taste like this. I couldn't believe what they handed me as food. Terrible! This place made Panda Express look like authentic Asian cuisine. My duck was so dry and fatty. The walnut chicken was all lard covered. Ugh I'm getting a stomach ache reliving this awful experience. How this place got four stars is beyond me. I would've given negative stars if it were an option. This place is fuckin nasty bro
