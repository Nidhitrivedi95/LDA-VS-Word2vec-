-PJgh1XoQBMnnSgg6MhmMA This place was insanely terrible... My wife and I ordered Mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken and fried rice.

The biggest thing was that the "Mongolian beef" turned out to be an entire plate of onions... With maybe four to six small pieces of beef in the entire dish. 
After calling and asking what could be done I was told "we put one large spoon full of beef in each dish." Now I don't know how big their spoon full is, but there was little to no meat... I will add photos if able. 

Next is onto the fried rice... All it is, is white rice seemingly seasoned lightly VERY LIGHTLY with what I'm guessing maybe soy sauce. This was not a great experience...

So after calling back I requested either the driver come back and pick this up and give us our money back.
I will settle for them giving us another order of Mongolian beef. We figured that would be better then nothing. But we will not be ordering or eating from this place again...

Their menu says "our chef has 25 years experience..." 

I'm just trying to figure out if he or she is only 25 years old... Good luck and im sorry if you've ordered from this place and it's already too late.
