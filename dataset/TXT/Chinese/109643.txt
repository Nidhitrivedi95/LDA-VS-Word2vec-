LpdW1vh1AVm5QznEL5j03g This Panda location has a drive thru. Beware of extremely long lines during lunch time at an establishment that is sooooo understaff. I thought I could make it in and out by going in but that was just as bad.

I can say the manager was very friendly and patient. Considering the fact that he had to manage as well as serve he is a true manager who really works hard. The food was tasty and flowed with the presentation. Hot food that is overall good food. The service at the register was not friendly with a smile. You can tell an employee oh likes there job with an employee who is catching a paycheck.

I will be back but I will come during a slower time of day. Lunch time is a zoo. 

Some Perks on this place:
This establishment is super clean. 
Plenty of condiments neatly organized.
Plenty of parking
