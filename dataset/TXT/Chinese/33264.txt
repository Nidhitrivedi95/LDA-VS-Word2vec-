a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg So I always like to review a place at least twice if the experience is somewhat negative, I'm big on second chances.

My entree was awful. Hot pepper beef and after a few bites I tossed it in the trash. Not spicy after I requested it and the meat was so over cooked you cannot chew it.

Also, this place will never give you any soy sauce packets. Even after I requested some, twice, I received one. One for three ppl. Cheap!

Also I ordered Vegan fried wontons to share with my vegan friend.
They were made with whole SHRIMP inside. I think they need a lesson on what vegan is. 

I likes two things, pineapple buns and scallion pancakes.


This place is a fail.
