uU8up3hGwW9qnzQD1HZsMQ Okay so I love Chinese food. In fact I've never had Chinese food that I didn't like. Until today that is. Delivery time was fine, a little long but I don't tend to get upset over things like that. The food however is a different story. The lo mein smelled like sewage. Literally. And I know sometimes food can smell bad but taste good so I gave it a shot. Yeah no. It was so disgusting. The egg drop soup tasted like the eggs were rotten. The steamed dumplings were bland and fell apart. The chicken teriyaki was okay but really chewy. I paid $30 and feel like I got totally screwed. So much so that I made a Yelp account just so I could write this.  I'm just so grossed out right now.
