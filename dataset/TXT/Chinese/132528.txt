pofDmHoIsdvPcSKzb2iMag Drove from Niagra Falls about 100 miles away to get a taste of Toronto Chinese food. Toronto Chinatown like this restaurant was a little less than I expected. The Chinatowns in other places like Montreal and Boston are better. The feel was more what I would expect in a 3rd world country and not a large metropolitan city like Toronto. a couple of the dishes were less than average and a couple of others were ones that I haven't had before, a pleasant surprise. A big turn off for me was the plastic sheets they use for table cloths. People were more than friendly and courteous. Clean and not crowded (table placement). Very inexpensive
