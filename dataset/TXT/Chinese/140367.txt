r6WO_jkx4rkMMauvPvMDeQ My first time here although we have lived in the area for a while. I must admit the negative reviews got to me. 

Anyway, came in today to order lunch to go. This place is really tiny! They had 4 booths and 2 tables for 2. The ladies at the register were nice and the kitchen crew was rocking(a good sign). Ordered mixed chow mien, Mongolian beef lunch special and a taro boba to-go. We were in and out in less than 15mins. The boba was so good and refreshing. The Mongolian beef was "WOW!", the mixed chow mien had so much meat and shrimps and so yummy, the servings are huge. Price is very affordable too. We're good for lunch and dinner:).

Kicking myself for waiting this long to check this place out. This is now my go-to place whenever I'm craving Chinese food.

Food and service, 5 stars. Wish the place was bigger but heck I don't really care about that.
