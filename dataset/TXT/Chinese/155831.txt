tnnbMVeEfr9iLCyT1ZgLwQ I've been coming here since they opened, after moving away from Lancaster, SC where I frequented the Japan restaurant.

This is the same (if not better) quality food that you would get at any high-end Hibachi place, but for nearly half the price.

I call in my orders while I am out on lunch break, and they always have it ready for me when I get there 10-15 minutes later, and ALWAYS get my orders right. And the shrimp sauce is TO DIE for.

While I've never sat down to eat inside since my orders are always take-out. there's plenty of seating. 

Definitely check this place out if you are in the area! It never disappoints :)
