W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g Oh my GOODNESS...found this place on Yelp and tried it and it was amazing!  Not only was the food absolutely delicious, the service was superb!  Abby was our waitress and was very helpful and friendly.  Not to mention, a few of the other ladies working came to our table to see how we were doing and thank us for coming in.  If I could, I'd give them 10 stars!  THANK YOU!!!
