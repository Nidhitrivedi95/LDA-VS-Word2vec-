1czIVv2iyOHc3WMgtUWXCQ We had high hopes for this place after finding it here on Yelp. Unfortunately, we weren't too impressed. Craving some Chinese, we ordered pickup and eagerly drove over. Once we arrived, the wait was only a few minutes. The place wasn't packed for a Friday night, but it's small and intimate with a very nice atmosphere. Super excited for our meal, we drove 5 minutes home and began to chow down. The soups were good, but the chicken (sesame chicken, spicy General Tso's) was mushy and what disappointed me the most was the fried rice. It had absolutely no flavor :( 

I wanted to badly to like this place! Super bummed but I don't think we'll be coming back. Baoding is still #1 for us!
