h5pqhSb74UeLNkv534m5Hg Want to stay warm this winter? Eat here! Their spicy food will warm you up from 0 to 100 in no time.

My absolute favourite thing(s) here are the skewers. They. Are. BOMB. They have a pretty good variety (ex. lamb, pork, chicken cartilage), and they can go for as little as $0.99 when you order 5+! I'd be happy to just come here with friends and throw back some beers to go with a meal comprised of only skewers... Try the whole fish skewer too. Super crispy and smoky!

Their noodles are handmade here so definitely get a bowl of these to try. They offer the thick noodles here too - the width is similar to the size of the bandages you use to wrap around your hand! Super chewy, or "QQ" as some would describe.

They also offer great value with a giant spicy bowl of vegetables and meat for only $12.99. They say the portion is for 1 person, but trust me... This can probably feed a family of 4.

Pro Tip: Make sure to ask for a glass of soy milk to keep you cool... And some extra napkins to wipe your sweat too!
