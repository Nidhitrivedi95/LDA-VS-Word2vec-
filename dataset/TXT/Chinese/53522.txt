cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg Was looking for authentic place to go with my husband that was not the typical chain restaurant that I eat at in Scottsdale, where I live, and just wanted really good food without all the sugary brown sauce and MSG. Well we found it at Chou's Kitchen.  We ordered the juicy steamed pork dumplings that I observed being made by hand right behind the window. I felt like I was in Chinatown or in their very home. No atmosphere really; but smiling, friendly, young server and kitchen staff. Most of the customers were actually Chinese.  We also had the eggplant in Garlic Sauce as well as Chicken with string beans and their pork fried rice. Everything was so delicious, made to order and from scratch. I highly recommend this place. Oh and table served with chopsticks. It's so nice to eat a whole meal with chopsticks, the way you do in Chinatown. You take your time and the food is better digested. I'll be back!!!!!!
