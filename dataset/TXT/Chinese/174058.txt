WBlYp-nmLiBLp7VjP1FJFg Food absolutely sucks, fries are the only decent things. Food is stale and cold and the fruit is hot and mushy, the apples look two weeks old. Ice cream machine is broken. No milk for coffee. If our tour guide didn't trick us into coming here we wouldn't have. Stay away from this place. Me and my partner got sick after eating food from this crapbuffet.
