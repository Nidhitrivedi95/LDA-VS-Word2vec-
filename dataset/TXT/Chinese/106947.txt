L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA Food was good, not THE best. I was more disappointed with the fact that my Red Bean Icee drink was super nasty. I think I'll leave it to the viet restaurants cause they know how to make their drinks for sure. 

It's never crowded in there (at least the few times I've been there) so getting a seat is never a problem. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
