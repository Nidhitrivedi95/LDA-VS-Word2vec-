UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ Fresh food, fast and friendly service and clean...what more could you ask?  I ordered the lunch Kung Pao Beef (how do they make the beef so tender?) and Wonton Soup and ate in.  I walked out about 25 minutes later and $8 lighter (including tip).   I'll be back.  Cheers, Nit Picky
