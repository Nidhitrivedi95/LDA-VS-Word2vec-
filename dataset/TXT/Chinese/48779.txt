C8Ehjy_oDzYcy3-wf32Y4A We went here on a recommendation from friends (always a good sign) and now it's our favorite local spot. The pho is DELICIOUS, the mango salad excellent, the fresh rolls tasty, the sizzling beef was very good and battered squid gets me thinking about it and making me want to go back time and again!! Don't get me wrong, it's slightly westernized and nothing you haven't had before, but I am a huge fan of that rare beast, consistency, plus it's sooo cheap. The two of us go and gorge ourselves and struggle to spend more than thirty dollars, so there's plenty left over for a nice tip, which they definitely deserve. Like I said, not haute cuisine but a nice cheap eat, for groups or couples. There's a TV so it's not romantic, but it's fun to half watch what's on and just talk about the stupid headlines on CP24....
