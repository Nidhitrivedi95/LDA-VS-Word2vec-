TdjydrOFUSMUsTKdlXW6aQ Still very good and Love the BBQ Pork fried rice! We had orange chicken, spring rolls, huge egg rolls, crab puffs, shrimp egg fun yung and everything was delicious! My dad's favorite Chinese food spot. He brought us here growing up and still very good food. This place has had to be here more than 20 years for a reason.
