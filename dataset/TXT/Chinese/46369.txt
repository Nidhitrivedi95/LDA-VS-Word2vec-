BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA Been here several times before and enjoyed the food and experience.  Just left the restaurant after waiting a hour for food.  They brought the wrong dish which made me wonder if they had my initial order.  While questioning them it was obvious the kitchen and staff had no idea what they were doing.  Another customer spoke up saying he too waited an hour in a empty restaurant. When i sat back down the people next to me also chimed in to say they too were served only one dish and have been waiting an hour for the other dishes. The manager told me the printer was broken which is why there is a delay in orders.  He told me it would be another 15 mins before i get my food.  He wasn't apologetic and didn't seem to care. The waitress was the same.  Not impressed
