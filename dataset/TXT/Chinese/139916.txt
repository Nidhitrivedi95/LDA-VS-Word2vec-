Qzq-m_TKJ-Iv1BmYLcjlVA a hot and spicy greasy spoon 

highlight is the vegetable manchurian fried rice, it's the size of Mt. Everest!  look at the pic

and the fresh chopped chilli peppers on the tables. 

ordering 2 dishes can feed 4 people, easy. 

taste hmm bit saltly, blast of chilli/chilli sauces, soy, take out quality
good value if you're feeling like hakka/chinese/indian
