wWry6ceFOu0pSmzPpDJQcA One of my fave places to get noodles as its really filling and they offer a lot of toppings on the side! The restaurant itself is really small; they have about 10 tables but its never full so you won't have to wait. They have a limited menu and all ranging about $10. The noodle portions are really big and filling.
