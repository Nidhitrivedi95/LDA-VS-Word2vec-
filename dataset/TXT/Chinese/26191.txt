Vegetables are usually crisp and flavorful, but the preparation of the meat and seafood leaves a good deal to be desired. Their salt-and-pepper shrimp is far greasier than it should be. Their chicken, too, suffers. Every time I go it's a little too overcooked and bland.

So if you go, I would recommend sticking with vegetarian fare. They do a decent job with that.
