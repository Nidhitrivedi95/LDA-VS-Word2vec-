7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA My family and I decided to try this place for dinner on Sunday night. The restaurant is quite large, and though it was already busy, we were quickly seated. 

We ordered from the Chinese-style menu: scallion lamb, spicy beef tendon, sweet and sour fish, and Chinese spinach. The meal was very satisfying, especially paired with tea. My dad had a lot of rice, which is usually a sign that the food is good (or that he's hungry, but I think it was the former in this case). The lamb was tender and flavorful. The spice of the beef tendon was tolerable, even enjoyable, for me, and it was paired with a numbing sensation. The fish was breaded in strips, and I enjoyed that the coating held its integrity and a little of its crisp instead of becoming mush in the sauce. The Chinese spinach hit the spot as well.

It's a little pricey for me to eat here often, but it's definitely on my list of places to get Chinese food when I'm missing home.
