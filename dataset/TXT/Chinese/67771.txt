eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g Top-notch dim sum and seafood dishes. They put an interesting spin on the usual traditional Chinese dishes with some seafood here and some seafood there. Seafood heaven, basically. They have eel rice noodle rolls, shark fin soup dumplings, shrimp and fish har gow etc... Great variety of dishes and still quite affordable. Their buns and pastries are flaky and delicate (bbq pork buns and egg tarts are a must try!!), rice and noodles made to impress. Would definitely recommend this place for those looking for a more upscale Chinese dim sum experience!
