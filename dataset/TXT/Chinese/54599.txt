ctEDsN8pX1dqCFbYaqruyw This restaurant has been open for around two decades.  Fifteen years ago, it was among the top three Chinese  restaurants north of toronto.  The main advantage here is the decor is high end tasteful.  

Also the dim sum wait for a table is among the lowest around here.  The servers are courteous and responsive.

The biggest drawback is that other than a few ok dishes like Peking duck, the food including dim sum are stuck between average and pedestrian.  

And the food is not priced average.  Not the most expensive, just a little high for the area.
