DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA Food's ok I guess if you like it oily and full of msg. Your regular Chinese food. We'd ordered black bean fish, fried noddle, and some other other dish. Food's not worth its price, but seems like food is pricer in vegas in general. Waiter was somewhat rude. We told him to remove the fried tofu dish from our order, and he still brought it out. Fried tofu would taste better if there were stuffing, but it was just tofu fried with some salt sprinkle on it.
