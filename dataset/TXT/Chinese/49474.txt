CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I didnt know "sh*tty wok" from south park existed but this is it. Come here and enjoy theyre incredibly low quality food with their incredibly high quality decor. 

We got the calamari and pad thai. Calamari tasted like it was defrosted, left out, then slightly heated up. Rubbery and greasy texture. I thought it was funny how badly i got ripped off. I kept telling my girlfriend in a sarcastic chinese manager voice "haha you stupid idiot pay $40 dollar for sh*@&$ food". Good thing im rich and don't care about costly mistakes like this. This place should be ashamed!
