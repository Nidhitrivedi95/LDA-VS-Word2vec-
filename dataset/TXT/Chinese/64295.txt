e7M2GgkCfDYTxdPN1LL1sQ If there were half stars, I would give this a 3.5.  This is a very competent chinese restaurant.  I have only eaten take out from here but my sense of the interior is very favorable.  It is very relaxed and more of a japanese vibe than a chinese red banner and tassel vibe.  The Singapore noodles are particularly delicious.  The other entrees are on a par or better than average.  It is probably fair to say that their menu is too extensive and geared to the western palate (they try a number of asian dishes that may be beyond their ken).  My kids love their chicken on a stick and crab rangoons--and I like them as well (much as I hate to admit that I like pseudo chinese food with deep-fried wontons filled with crab flavored cream cheese--cream cheese?  Cream cheese in asian food?).  The Crab Rangoons are quite honestly an abomination, but a yummy one at that.
