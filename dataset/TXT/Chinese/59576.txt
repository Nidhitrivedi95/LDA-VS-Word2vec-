dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw Just have to echo the general sentiment on this restaurant, which is exceptional.  All that I will add is the husband-wife team are the owners/operators who put their passion for creating delicious food into their small restaurant.  The baos are all made ready to order, so exercise some patience.  Good news is that the restaurant will be moving to a larger location as some point once Jenny finds her ideal location.  Maybe get your hair and nails done prior or after an exceptional meal at this unique location....btw - ask about their restaurant logo for some mindless triva.
