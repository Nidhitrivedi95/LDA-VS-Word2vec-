UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ I first tried George & Sons at their original Scottsdale location, which is just down the street from my parents' house. I was happy to see they opened a location across the street from where I work. They have lunch specials daily for $8, and it includes your choice of entrée, a cup of soup, a crab puff, an egg roll, lo mein and rice. It's a lot of food for the price. My favorite entrée is their Thai Spicy Basil Chicken. Service is quick and friendly, and the interior is nice and clean. We happily make the walk over when we're in the mood for Asian food.
