EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw I live a few blocks from this restaurant. I have been there two times. The first time, the service was terrible. It took about thirty minutes for my simple order of dumplings and shrimp to arrive. When it did arrive I had no utensils...e.g. Chop sticks, fork or even a napkin. Finally I got up and went and found a set of chop sticks. By that time the food was cold. The second time I went there no one ever waited on me. After about 20 minutes I got up and left.

The man standing at the register didn't even look up as I left. 

This restaurant sucks. Don't waste your time or money.
