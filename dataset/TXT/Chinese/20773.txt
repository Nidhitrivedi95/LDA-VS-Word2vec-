64ZPMllrqdrVNXMEQIvXhw Apparently we are the exception to the rule as my family really likes Cherry Blossom. It might be because we always get the same things: Sesame Chicken, General Tso's Chicken and Egg Rolls. These are not exactly the hardest things to make but we love the sauce and the taste. We especially love the egg rolls - including the spicy-ness of the pepper. It is very quick, reasonably priced, and consistent. My kids literally complain anywhere else we go to get Sesame Chicken. But they love this sauce. Maybe low expectations but we enjoy the food and that it never changes.
