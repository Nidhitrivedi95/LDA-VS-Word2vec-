AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA My boyfriend and I kind of stumbled upon this restaurant through groupon and decided to come here. Our good friend is vegetarian, so we all decided to pick out a dish. We ordered the crispy eggplant that was recommended by many yelpers, the crispy veggie scallops, and the steamed ginger chicken with brown rice.

The crispy eggplant was really delicious. As stated by some yelpers, they are like french fries, but with a twist!! It was topped off with garlic, which I love!!! The steamed ginger chicken was to die for!!! It amazes me that its not chicken, but it tastes like chicken!!! It was mind boggling. hahaha. As for the crispy veggie scallops, it was good, but not great. I think it is because I am a huge scallop lover and I love the real thing. As for the price, they give you A LOT of food for what you pay for. =) Since I am a piggy, more the food... the more the merrier!! ::CHOMP CHOMP::

The staff was incredibly nice. At one point, the waitress introduced us to Chef Kenny. He was so nice and humble. Although we aren't vegetarian (except for my friend) we loved the food and definitely will be back.  I can't wait to try more things and maybe one day I will convert into becoming vegetarian!!
