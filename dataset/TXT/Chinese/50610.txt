CGgUHkAKU0QBsdGvXxfMuw we found this spot three years ago, after a jaunt on the bike to bookmans.... and now... i continue to stop in and continue to be amazed that this tiny little non-descript, 4 table 'hole-in- the wall' best has some of the best freshly made  no-MSG chinese food, i have eaten... hot and sour soup, lo meins, orange chicken, (non-breaded), sizzling rice soup, dumplings, and on and on.... pick-up, delivery, and dine-in, it's all good!
