_dXydCs8tNkJeoO0Mk30tA Love their cantonese chow Mein, salt and pepper squid and shrimp wonton soup. So yummy! My fave chinese resto in Brampton.
They get very busy and have their days but I find the owners genuinely sweet. 
The delivery driver forgot my drinks once, apologized and was quick to come back with it.
My only issue is that sometimes their delivery isn't available (mostly during the days) and that inconsistency can be inconvenient.
