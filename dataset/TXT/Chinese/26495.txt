7T3WU-Up01pgCeygbc_K-A After seeing that this place is always packed since it opened, I decided to come to see what the fuss is all about.

I ordered the Beef Rib rice noodles with lamb meat. When the order came, it was missing the lamb. The customer beside me thinks that they switched our order.  I told them it was missing the lamb, but they seemed confused at first as they're not very good with English. I had to point at the menu to show them what I meant and then dig through my bowl to show them. When my correct order came, the server had to confirm again. Why is it so difficult? Also I was not served any water.

All the servers came to me speaking Mandarin and assuming that I would understand because I'm Chinese (I speak Cantonese). 

The noodle, the broth, and the meat were very good, but it seemed a little expensive. It was 13.99 for the Beef Rib noodle and 2.99 for the lamb. After tax and tip came to close to $21. I'm not sure it was worth it. It was basically 2.99 for 4 thin slices of hot pot lamb.

I might come back and try the pork bone noodle (9.99).

Quality: 8.5/10. Service: 6/10. Value: 5/10. Overall: 6.5/10 (not an average).
