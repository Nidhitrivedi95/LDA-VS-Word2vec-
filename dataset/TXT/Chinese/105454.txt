kWkW6vVePpBox_fKfGgPjQ Wow, nearly a year ago I had dinner with 
my husband at Pan Asia.  The brothers worked the Sushi bar then.  We were introduced to their flare of Sushi and loved it. They greeted who ever walked in and sold their special that day. 

Today, the brothers are gone and so is their Sushi flare.   The customer service isn't much to appreciate either.  Well the 50% discount on the Chinese food is something to look forward to.
