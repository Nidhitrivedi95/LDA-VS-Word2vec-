BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I was here on a Thursday night at 7pm and this place was Packed with a line up almost out the door. Luckily they take reservations and we had a table waiting for us when we arrived.

The dumplings are the star here coming in Pan fried, steamed and boiled variety. And man are they good! Homemade, right in front of you they are as delicious as I've ever had (Ok, Not as good as my moms but still very good). 

My Favorites on the menu are Pork and Dill Dumplings, Pork and Vegetable Steamed Buns and also the Green Onion Pancakes all made in house!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a dumpling fix at any time of the day!
