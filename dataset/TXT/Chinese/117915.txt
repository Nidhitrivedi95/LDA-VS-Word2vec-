njiPpJhy94Ojq91Bev6ckA Every time I go to this restaurant, there's a long line at the drive thru. It takes me about twenty minutes or so, to get just a simple Panda bowl order. Yesterday, today and on previous occasions, it is always the same story; sit a the drive thru for a long, long time waiting for service. These workers are really inneficient and when someone's order is not ready (Often, that seems to be the case), they don't know (like other restaurants) to tell the customer to go wait on the side of the business in order not to hold off the line. Today, I saw at least one person leave the drive thru and I was about to do the same as well.  I'm about not to do business with this place anymore. They're going to start losing customers.
