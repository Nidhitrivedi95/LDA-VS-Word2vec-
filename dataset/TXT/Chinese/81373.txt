GxzEsd-81hVP6C2h6wMvBw Tucked away on Byng Ave. this place serves mainly beef noodles. I decided to try the classic beef noodle. When you order you have a choice of the circular noodles of various thickness or the flat noodles with various widths. The preparation time wasn't too long so the noodle was served in about 5 minutes. It was served in a large bowl with lots of noodles and a few small slices of beef. The broth itself was a tad salty but it was decent. The service was good as they kept refilling our cups with water and checking up on us every so often. The location is relatively small with enough seats for maybe 15 people and 2 bar stool type of seats facing the window. There is street parking right outside or you can park along Kenneth Ave as well. In terms of the Classic Beef noodle itself I would give it a 2.5/5 as it was a little plain. However the service was pretty good so I would give it a 3/5
