x8O-Mll5ksDpeIgtA0XY-w this has always been our go to for Chinese food at a buffet

living in Vegas my whole life we have had a lot of Chinese food places come and but this place never fails to be fresh.

if you are into sushi they have an entire sushi bar and its very fresh and kept up to date they even have little stickers of when they were put out on the buffet so you can ensure that  it is not too old

they have an amazing selection of Mongolian barbeque and it's like a pic your own Chinese food and they cook it fresh for you it is to die for

this place is pretty big and seats a lot of people has a lot of traffic so very rarely do I see a wait but it is always packed and because it is always packed the food turnover is incredibly quick  very rarely have I seen dishes cold,  empty or close to empty usually its full fresh heaping piles of goodness that you can scoop on to your plate

they have fresh crawfish hot and cold they have a good soup selection and a great Chinese selection all the way from fried rice to want on soup too fried wontons to pot stickers to muscles to hot wings to pizza for the kids

it is definitely worth the price you will not regret going 

Enjoy!!
