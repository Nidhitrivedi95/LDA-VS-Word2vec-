5ubokMNw8qfbX2WtxgJG1Q Okay, first things first- I'm Asian. So I've had years upon years of Asian food. At home and at restaurants. 

Never have I had to sit through such horrid customer service. 

Positive notes are that they were courteous, polite, and offered great explanations of dishes.

Until. 

We ordered a Seafood Noodle dish (lack of better terms- Ho Fun)

It was bland, poorly cooked, and it seems like it was left on the flames for too long that it stuck together in lumps as shrivelled up bits of noodle. I've always ordered this dish with my family and this is the first time I've seen it be this poorly done. 

When my mom called them to question the dish- both employees that came over had poor attitudes and seemed to not want to deal with us. They kept telling us it was fine and that was how the dish was supposed to be. Nope. I doubt that. 

Furthermore, I could SEE them talking about us as we ate. (Yes, I'm writing this and I'm HERE at present time) now, my family still tries to be uber polite so we dropped it for the most part. They were nicer afterwards, but I'm still rather unimpressed. 

The two stars barely made the mark. 

Step up your game, come on!
