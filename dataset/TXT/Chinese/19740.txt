5td-5D7aMQ6zSuSSNLAQjQ There are 3 Chinese BBQ joints at this sketchy plaza. The bald guy in the picture doing the chopping I think used to run the Vans BBQ place at FMP.  Since they are new, I am going to say that opening a BBQ joint when there are already 2 existing ones in the same mall and is either extremely stupid or very ballsy. 

I am still scratching my head as to why the lineups and why the glowing reviews, sometimes I think people just do not have any taste.  I had the roast pork and duck for $5 deal and was very disappointed.  The duck was limp and flavourless, and pork was dry and bland.  It tasted like the meat you get at a Foody Mart or Bestco.  The only reason there is a lineup at this place is the ridiculously low prices. But low prices means low quality meat as you get what you pay for.  They must be sourcing their meat from sketchy suppliers because there is no way you can make a profit on a $5 meal deal.

I tried them out of curiosity, but from now on I am sticking with Ho Ho BBQ next door as they are way tastier and worth the extra $2.  Ho Ho BBQ and Lung Tung BBQ are still my go-to places for Chinese roast pork and duck.
