Dzm3_K2lnLLcGPVLZBZtog The sad part is I haven't even tried the food yet! But I ordered OVER 2 hours ago and still no food. 3 phones calls later including me calling to make sure the order was ok after placing the online order only to be called back 45 minutes later and told my card wasnt working they had the expiration date wrong and they hadnt started my food yet. I gave them the right info they said we will do it ASAP. Well over an hour later and still nothing. This is ridiculous. I am a very understanding and realistic person. I knew ordering on a Friday night would be long but I have never ever had to wait longer than an hour for anything delivery ever! We will not be ordering from here again. And it is unfortunate because I have no idea how their food tastes but after the bad taste in my mouth of waiting 2+ order I dont think we will like it! Pitiful!
