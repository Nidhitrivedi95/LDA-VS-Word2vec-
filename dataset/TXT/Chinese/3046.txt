_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA We just arrived at Las Vegas and only ate Del Taco before we came. So we were definitely hungry! On top of that, we had to get ready for Tao Nightclub, so even more hungry! We found this place in The Venetian and next to Tao Nightclub, so we decided to try it out. The restaurant looked very nice and chic, but then again it had to be, located in The Venetian remember?!

What we ordered:
1. Black pepper beef udon-The beef was very fresh and the udon was made just right. However, it was a bit oily for my liking, but I was way too hungry, so I finished this whole plate! Lol!
2. Seafood mix udon-This was not a good dish at all...The seafood didn't taste that fresh. The flavor was bland and not very satisfying. 
3. Tea-Watered down...Need to put more leaves in it to make sure the tea has flavor.

The service here was good, four stars.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming here for Chinese food, should have went to Chinatown. =(
