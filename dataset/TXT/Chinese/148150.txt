sePTDv1dGHPID7kwuNzXaA If you're looking for a quick eat, homey meal and very very affordable menu then definitely stop by Sam's Congee Delight if you're in the area! located right inside of Market Village near the corner of one of the grocery stores in the mall. This restuarant has been here since time! I remember coming to Market village as a kid to learn music theory (bleh) and always walking by and seeing how bustling this place was. Came here on a weekday for lunch and boy was the line crazy for a table! We waited a good 20 minutes to get a table for 2. There are about 20-25 tables in the resturant and all are small. Turn around time to get food is quick though so you will not be starving and waiting long for items. We shared a fresh shrimp rice noodle and a preservative egg and pork congee (my fav). the congee was about $4.75 and you get a good bowl size that can feed two people. The Fresh rice noodles were i believe 3.25 per plate.. but its made fresh!! They also make the chinese salty doughnuts and sweet doughnut here too and they are definitely made fresh to order. As you enter into the restuarant there is a window where you can view your meal being made. Very cool idea. Lots of sauces to choose from as all the sauces are located at the centre of the table. Hosion, hot sauce, soya sauce, peanut sauce, you name it, its there!

Very homey taste, not overly salty and the rice noodles are super silky and smooth. They also do take out, and probably recommends take out when it's this busy! Cash only though so be sure to bring cash.. though there is a TD bank across the street.
