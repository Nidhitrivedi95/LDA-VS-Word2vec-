YsqOYGnY3p-20sspdOUYSQ I've been coming to China China with my family for many years now.     The restaurant is in an old building, located in an old part of town, but don't let the facade deceive you.  If you pass up this restaurant while driving by, you'll regret it!  There's no doubt in my mind that their Chinese food is among the very best in the Valley.  I've never had a meal there that didn't satisfy me.

They have a wide menu with many offerings to choose from; a great variety of items in chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, noodles, and vegetables.  They also have lunch and dinner combos which come with an entree, soup, fried rice, and a side item.  I have many favorite meals here, but the one that I get most often is the house lo mein which is soft noodles with a little bit of everything thrown in.  It's very good and well worth a try!  

Perhaps the only thing that can rival the food is the service.  The manager here works every day and takes the time to get to know you.  Very personable and always friendly.  If you come in often enough, they'll even remember what you like to drink and have it prompt!  Prices are mostly inexpensive.  Dinner entrees start around $6 and run up to about $13 per plate.  If you don't feel like dining in, they also have take out available. 

If nothing else, try China China once.  I'm sure you'll leave happy!
