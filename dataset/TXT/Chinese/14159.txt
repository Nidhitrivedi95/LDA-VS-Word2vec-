39AOOQM4Ff6rWXW8b9ZPvw I was so disapointed with Chen's Bistro. I have to admit that I am not a fan of buffet food by nature but I wanted to give this place a try. It is extremely overpriced which was a huge turn off and apparently they can charge you for the food you leave on your plate?! I was scared to try anything I wasn't sure of for fear that I would not like it and be charged EXTRA for it. Other then that annoying fact, its just really not good. The food tastes like food court Chinese. I would never again give Chen's Bistro my money again.
