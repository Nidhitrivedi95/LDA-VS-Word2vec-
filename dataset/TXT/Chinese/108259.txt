liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA Been here a few times while staying at the Palazzo and loved their great food and service! It located just off the casino floor and between the Palazzo and Venetian hallway. 

The decor is upscale and the service is much better than a casual dining restaurant. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are huge. 

Most times it's not too busy as there are tons of dining options to choose from. 

The casino comps meals to this place as well, so be sure to ask the pit boss or casino host after you play. 

They will be closed for a remodel so make sure to get there as soon as possible if you're near by.
