get 511! and CRISPY TOFU! you will not regret it
it's better if you go with a lot of people and reserve a table with the spinny thing in the middle cuz it gets kinda packed during dinner time.
If u go with a pretty big group and do family style, you'll guarantee try some good dishes. 
Their sizes are very generous as well.
make sure you tip them if u dont' want to clean up the tables!
