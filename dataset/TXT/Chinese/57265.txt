D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw We found this place across the parking lot from Firefly which was our original destination. We were fortunate that Firefly was so busy because Satay is a gem.
We arrived when Happy Hour was still going on so we ordered some appetizers from the menu at a discount. We got the Thai nachos and the Lumpai--both were excellent. The wife got lamb curry for the entree and loved it. The sauce was flavorful and spicy, the lamb super tender. I got the Malaysian satay with dark chicken meat. It was very juicy and not at all dry. I liked it a lot, one of the best satays I have had. I also had a small house salad and the carrot dressing was excellent. Don't be put off by the  location off the strip, this place is a better value and the food is way better than the corporate chains on the strip. I would return here in a heartbeat.
