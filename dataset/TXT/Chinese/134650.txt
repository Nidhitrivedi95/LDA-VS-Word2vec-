q7aNYIUEkmisLTE3qBPRog If you are feeling hungry and craving all that PE has to offer, I recommend coming during  the off hours.  The lunch and dinner rushes can be brutal.  Not only will you have to deal with the masses inside, but the parking lot can be ridiculous as it is poorly designed and small due to sharing with other busy businesses.

This particular PE serves up what every other PE does.  There is nothing special about it.  It is just like another PE in a strip mall, only this strip mall parking lot sucks.
