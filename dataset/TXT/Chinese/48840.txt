The side room seems to be where they exiled many families with children (although there were a few in the main dining room as well).
The buffet had a variety of islands of food.  One was salads/cold food, one dessert, several with hot food items and one with soups.  There is a separate area that has a hibachi station and sushi.
We went at an off peak hour (around 2:30) so I was worried about food freshness, but everything was pretty fresh and seemed to be replenished pretty regularly.
The main buffet has the standard options.  Chicken with broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, general tsao chicken and more.  There were also items like coconut shrimp, spicy chicken and others.  Sides included the typical Lomein noodles and white and fried rice.  There was also "seafood" stuffed mushrooms and clams, cream cheese puffs and crab Rangoon among others.
Four varieties of soup were available (although they were not getting attention and being replenished).
It was mostly clean and the food decently fresh.  The service wasn't the greatest, but we were in the side room so we may have been an after thought.
They do have changing tables in the men's bathroom which isn't a common occurrence so that is a plus.
Overall not a bad place, especially for the weekday prices.
