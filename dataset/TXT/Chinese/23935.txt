6z-T_jIFrRQ4c6-BIvVBvA I recently went to Congee Star for the first time and had a positive experience.

1) The food is very reasonably priced. The portions are large and the quality was not compromised by the quantity. 

2) The menu has SO much variety. This is a great place for meat eaters, seafood lovers and vegetarians alike. They also had a TON of items that are lighter, grilled, steamed and not fried. It is easy to create a balanced, filling meal that is not too unhealthy. 

3) Getting a table took a bit of time and the front end of the restaurant was a bit chaotic. To get to the hostess to write down our names was a bit of challenge and confusing.

4) The service was great. A dish we did not order was accidentally brought to us. We didn't realize it was not what we ordered (it was similar to something we did order just a different kind of dumpling). We ate it unknowingly. Someone came by a little too late to swap the incorrect order but it was too late. They were SO nice about it. They didn't charge us for the extra order - in fact they didn't even bring it up! Very good service. 

5) For being so busy, they were very quick in turning over tables and bringing food promptly. 

6) We ordered 5 dishes. Everything we ordered was delicious. I highly recommend the whole steamed Tilapia and the green onion, mushroom wontons. The crab meat soup was also very delicious!

I would definitely come again!
