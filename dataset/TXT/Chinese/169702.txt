vTlIUtYXdPxCk6UB746w8w This is a hidden gem for board games - it's like a Chinese Snakes & Lattes. 

The place is actually quite large inside with a selection of board games, poker, jitz and automated mah jong tables! (at $10/hour/table) The minimum charge is $3.99 which is pretty good as you can stay as long as you want. 

To be safe, I ordered the Apple Green Tea which is not bad. Other orders were too sweet. 

Service is pretty accomodating despite a slight language barrier.
