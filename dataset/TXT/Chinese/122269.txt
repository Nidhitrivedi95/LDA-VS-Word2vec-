OfqTPtPSQfCVxaSlY4qAxg The best roast pork in the Phoenix area.  Succulent meat, shatter crisp skin and just the perfect amount of fat to make a bowl of rice a must.  The duck is moist and flavorful. My only complaint is that the skin was soft. 
The hot and sour soup was good although for my taste neither hot or sour enough.  But a little hot oil and black vinegar fixed that right up. 
Mongolian Beef is excellent.  My wife and mother swear by the cashew chicken.
