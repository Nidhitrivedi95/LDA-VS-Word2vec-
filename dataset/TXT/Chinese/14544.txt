3fw2X5bZYeW9xCz_zGhOHg I have never been a huge fan of Chinese desserts, don't get me wrong I like egg tarts as much as the next guy but Chinese desserts in general are not sweet enough for my taste. However Tracy Dessert may have changed my mind about authentic Chinese desserts. 

I went here with some yelpers after an elite event. This is a small place with a few tables, the menu is mostly in Chinese and the waitress' don't speak much English, lucky for us our fellow yelpers spoke the language and knew exactly what to order. A few of us decided to share a couple dishes. The real stars of the show on this evening were the green tea shaved ice and mango pudding. The shaved ice was very good, had a mild green tea flavour (without being overwhelming) and was served with some fruit and some sort of jelly. This dish was so refreshing and would definitely be great on a hot summer's day. The mango pudding was also quite good, had a natural mango flavour, a nice consistency and had some tapioca in it which gave it a good texture. This dish was also quite light and refreshing.  

My least favourite dish was the black sesame soup, the flavour was ok but it had a weird consistency that put me off, furthermore this dish was not very sweet. I also managed to snag some glutinous rice balls which did not have much flavour but had an interesting texture; the peanuts these were garnished with saved the dish. This place also has some savoury dishes but we were here strictly for dessert. 

 Overall if you are a fan of Chinese dessert this place is quite good. The best part about Chinese desserts is that they are usually quite light and not too sweet so you won't necessarily feel guilty from indulging in some dessert. I will likely be back for some delicious shaved ice!
