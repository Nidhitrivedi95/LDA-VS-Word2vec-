PwcZPVAxhnG-MPPpH3BsYQ It's a Hong Kong style food place. Went to this place twice. First time I ordered their Malaysian Chicken Curry and their Nepolian black sesame ice cream dessert.  The were both good. The curry had a good texture and taste and Nepolian Ice Cream melts in your mouth. The second time I went, I ordered their vermicelli noodle soup with chicken steak. It was simple but delicious.
