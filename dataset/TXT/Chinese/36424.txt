Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Worst dining experience this trip! Started with waiter recommending NOT to order a dish...seriously?  Then waiter said order delayed due to sushi order wrong. They said redoing the sushi and right out. 15 min later the excuse was a big order in front of us. Finally 1.5 HOURS later we finally called a manager over for the check. They comped the appetizers and my daughter's sushi while making excuses all the way. Poor service. Definitely on the never again while in Vegas list.
