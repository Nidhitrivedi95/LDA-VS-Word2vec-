GxzEsd-81hVP6C2h6wMvBw Broth lacked taste. The noodles were good but nothing super special. The toppings of beef, mushrooms and pickled something (can't remember what it was exactly...) Were good but not enough for the entire soup. The portion of small was good however the toppings were not enough. I might try one more time to see if they'd change my mind but this place wouldn't be a priority.

Space itself was small and tight. Very poor ventilation when it's hot. Seating outside but no servers come outside to check on you unless they're bringing out your orders. The servers don't speak English very well.
