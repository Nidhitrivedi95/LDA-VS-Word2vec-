HJ928N6c5Hh2KD3lYCuabA I've always thought Spring Rolls was decent food, but over priced from what you're getting. The quality isn't amazing, but ok. With their new all you can eat menu, it's pretty great - there are tons of things to try like chinese dimsum, sushi, pad thais and other noodes, even kalbi - all for $18.99 on weekends, more for dinner, cheaper on weekdays. 

We got a whole bunch of stuff, which came out at a pretty good pace. Some memorable ones was the Thai Spicy Noodle, Japanese Crab Fried Rice, Fried Squid (a little over cooked), Sizzling Plat Kalbi. The Kimichi Sweet Potatoe fries looks good on paper, but was lack lustre when it arrived. All portions are super small, some are bigger for sharing, but most of the Mains are only good enough for one or two people. Doesn't matter, you can order more!

Although service was decent, the narrow long table we were all sitting at really could not handle all the dishes that we had. They use white thick porcelain dishes, not really conducive to stacking, and they were heavy. They would also serve steamed buns with a plate (that's super hot) , which is so unnecessary. It really took away from the experience as our dishes kept piling up.

There also needs to be a way for everyone, especially a large party to manage their orders. Maybe the check sheet would be a better way for all this. We ordered the Stuffed Crab Head Curry twice, and it never came. When orders came, we never knew who it belonged to. 

When the meal was done, we stopped ordering, there was no one there to clear our plates and basically sat there for a good 30 mins getting cold and gross. 

Definitely catered to westerners, but good for if you feel like more than just dim sum.
