uUvnimNxg15Ds9r0SC3oMg Food was good but the service was terrible. We went on Friday at around 6 pm. The place was only half seated. It took them 3 minutes to give us menu and 10 minutes for someone to come to take our orders. I had to literally raise my voice to get noticed. Ridiculous . 
We ordered lobster combo for 4 for $65. Food was quite tasty and portion was large. Hope they have better service cuz I would like to visit more often.
