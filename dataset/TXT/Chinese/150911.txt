SxjNgkzAlUG-wt2rSbc2HQ If we could give this place 0 stars, we would.  We ordered General Tso's Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice, and Spring Rolls. 

The chicken was not edible, the fried rice was old and we asked for two sauces for each dinner and was charged extra.

To make matters worst, the food was bland and expensive; the delivery took over an hour an a half (our hotel is less than .5 miles away from the restaurant), and  my wife was up all night with indigestion which made the selection of this eatery  an epic failure.  


We strongly advise you to save your money and go elsewhere.
