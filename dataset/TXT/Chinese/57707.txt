D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA Don't come here. You will get 10% of what you pay for. Servings are extremely small. They food are not that great either. I honestly prefer Panda Express over this fake Hong Kong style restaurant. Their fried rice was very basic. No reason to say, "wow." Soup had a nice presentation but don't let this deceive you. The soup was very salty. The cup of noodles from the grocery stores have better flavor and probably less sodium as well. They did bring out our food pretty quickly. Its nice that someone is always walking around with a cart full of "fresh" dim sum. These items were also expensive. Even though we weren't impressed with our food, our server was extremely nice and attentive. She constantly checked on us to see how we were doing. She also made sure that my glass of water was always full. I expected more from this place considering their prices. You're probably better off trying another restaurant. I do not recommend and I will not be coming back to this place.
