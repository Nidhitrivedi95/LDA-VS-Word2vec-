79e4GUc_y2A5Cn3z1lNERw Looking at the reviews I'm not sure we're talking about the same place here! I come here all the time and it's the best. Hand made dumplings always served steaming fresh and quickly. It's CHEAP! I get full on $6 worth of dumplings but I always order extras to take home. It's always quite empty when I come here to eat, and the staff is average. They serve super authentic northern chinese food, so it's understandable that they lack some of the sweet-ass dipping sauces  you southerners like. Honestly I'm sick of the Chinese food =sweet and sour chicken bs. 

Tldr: hefty ass juicy dumplings for cheap, average service, average atmosphere. Very authentic chinese experience.
