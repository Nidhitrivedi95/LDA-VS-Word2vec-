IQnUxhO7oieEP7-5ZVJ4uA I used to love this place. The sign says new ownership but same cooks or something. The food is totally not the same anymore. Everything I ordered was below average, the price seemed higher than what I remember, portions are smaller too. My son ordered chicken satay and they served it raw. Sent it back, they gave it back over cooked. Curry was  watered down and very salty with only about five pieces of meat.  For the price I could have gone to the one on Jones. Sad but will never go back.
