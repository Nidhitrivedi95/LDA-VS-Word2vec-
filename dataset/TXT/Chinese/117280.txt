NdpvGGF4cLrdnA6ydSZz3g Good variety of foods and soup ($2.5-$3 each). You can really taste the soup flavor in the meat - don't need to dip sauce. I like the corn best; also tried sa cha, tomato, and variety of their famous spicy broths. 

Modern interior, nice wood mix. Service could be better but don't expect much. Made a reservation but still had to wait 20+ minutes. The place is super packed.

Also for drinks, it's $6 for a pitcher (got sour plum and wintermelon) which serves about 4...  I can drink the whole thing myself.
