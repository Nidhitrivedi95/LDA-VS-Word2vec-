bzMO8LJmJtgo3KuyWGKUxA D+ for the marketing team and their efforts in naming this place! I've walked by this place a thousand times and if it wasn't for Yelp, I would've walked by again!

To their benefit though, I didn't judge this book by its cover. Turns out, it was pretty good! 

Took recommendations and got Sliced Beef/Oxtail in Chili Sauce, and ordered the Braised Beef with Pulled Noodle/Knife Cut Noodle. Also got BBQ tendon for good measure since I'm excessive that way.

Sliced beef was awesome! Great flavour, and plenty of meat! The soup was great too, with subtle flavours of anise, with a light broth. I definitely liked the pulled noodles better though as they were chewer and less heavy to eat. 

I couldn't go past the first bit of tendon though - probably needs to be braised ahead of time as it was equivalent to chewing on an eraser that was over salted and burnt.

Let's be clear here - This is not Japanese ramen, so don't compare apples to apples. This place does stand up though, so if you're looking for this specific style, I'd give it a shot.
