X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I bought the $100 vip bar card which gets you entry into the club in a much shorter line plus $100 to spend on drinks.  It pays for itself immediately.  I then read the reviews and i was horrified.  I thought i just wasted my money.  I get in line and they don't have my card on file.  I thought, "here we go ugh".  The staff was great!  The girl at the front desk made sure i was taken care of when they eventually found my card.  I get inside and the upstairs bar was very accessible... the bottom bar was way busier.  Every club in vegas is packed and drinks are expensive, so if you cant handle that, then clubbing aint for you.  Just head to a bar on Fremont street.  FYI, the hip hop room was on level 3 and it was banging.  I missed tiesto all together.
