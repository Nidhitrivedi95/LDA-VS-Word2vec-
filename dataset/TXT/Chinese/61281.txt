DQMaUSbKsRtB5lJD3egqxQ As a Chinese, I think this Chinese good is really amazing. Unlike other chinese restaurant , this restaurant use more good quality ingredients and  more fresh stuff to make their food.  Not really oily and taste strong. But it was just delicious!  Price is really reasonable and great service.
Will go back again!
