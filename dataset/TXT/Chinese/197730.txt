zTGxLMOd9crAz0XNzqrcrA I didn't eat here- I was just on a serous mission to find bubble tea on the U of I campus on a Sunday- since all the other bubble tea places were closed. 
I am glad that I went into Empire to order bubble teas though. 
They were perfect- not too sweet- and fresh. 
I got the milk tea bubble tea with boba (tapioca). 

I can't wait to try the food here next time I am on campus.
