We decided to go low key this New Year's Eve with dinner and a movie.  I made a reservation in advance, but due to the volume of people in the restaurant, we had to wait about 10 minutes.  Way better than the 60-75 minute wait being quoted to walk-ins.  

After we were seated we were greeted promptly.  I have never seen so many staff in Chang's before.  I think they were trying to turn tables as fast as possible.  

We started with a couple of delicious Bud Lights ($4 each, not bad).  Since we perused the menu while waiting, we had already decided on the 4 course prix - fixe menu for $39.95.  I started with egg drop, he started with hot and sour.  Both standard and good.  Next on to the Lettuce Wraps.  Always a favorite.  They were crunchy and fresh.   I added a bit of the spicy sauce they whipped up at the table.  Delicious, but why do I always run out of lettuce?!

For entrées we went with Beef Lo Mein and Chang's Spicy Chicken.  I also ordered a pot of tea.

Lo Mein- The noodles were tender and the beef crispy and the Lo Mein sauce was flavorful.  I do think it was a little light on meat this time.

Chang's Chicken- while spicy is in the name, the dish is not very spicy, however it is very good.  The all white meat chicken was tender and seasoned well.

We did feel a little rushed during this visit...our lettuce wraps came out before we even started our soup.  But given the holiday, I understood.  Plus, we were able to get to the earlier showing of Unbroken, so it worked out okay.
