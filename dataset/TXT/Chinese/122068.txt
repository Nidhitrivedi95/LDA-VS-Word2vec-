OCnxN6lO64Gr3wYAHA12tQ We came to Congee Dynasty as a Plan B after our dim sum plans got changed last minute.  

We ordered the pork/egg congee ($4.25) with donut ($1.50), Chinese greens ($4.25), 'Deep Fried Three Kinds of Stuffed' ($5.75) which despite the terrible name turned out to be tofu, eggplant and green peppers stuffed with shrimp/crab meat, fried chili turnip ($5.95), a Cantonese chow mein ($8.99) and rice noodle with beef and black bean sauce ($7.75).

Food came out hot and fresh, although cooled down quickly due to a draft from the kitchen where we think there was a door was propped open to the outside.  

The dishes were all average with the donut being the highlight.  It was like biting into deep fried dough heaven - soft, fresh and crispy, yet not too greasy.  The donut alone is reason enough for me to return here.  I did find the food to be a bit on the salty side but MSG is an integral part of the Chinese food groups.  

Portions are generous, definitely enough for 5 people to be full and we had enough leftover for one person's workday lunch.
