x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg Asian Legend is one of my go to places for northern Chinese food.  Although it's a chain, the food and service are pretty consistent across the board.  It's kind of like The Keg except for Asian food - you look forward to your meal before heading to the restaurant and you leave a satisfied customer.  I always get the siu long bao, dang dang noodles, and green onion cakes, but the menu has a great selection and you won't be disappointed with your order.
