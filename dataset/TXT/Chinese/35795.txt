ag8gM2YKZkjndCvl2ti7kQ Went there as part of a group of six for my birthday dinner. Fantastic food, affordable, good for both vegetarians and carnivores alike...what's not to love? And this location, unlike the original one on Spadina, serves beer! (They will get in wine for you special if you ask ahead nicely. That's what they did for me. Thanks!)

Particular standouts for me were the pork and fennel dumplings (panfried), and of COURSE the semi cooked potato threads. If you don't know what they are, just get them already. You're welcome.

Another plus is that this location delivers. Also, you can buy frozen dumplings to take home. Three bags for ten bucks, with a dozen in each bag. Yes please! I have some sitting in my freezer already

I think I have died and gone to heaven :)
