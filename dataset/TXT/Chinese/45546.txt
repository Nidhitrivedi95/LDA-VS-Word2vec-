The reviews on Yelp/Google were dicey, but we decided to take a chance on Kim Fung anyway. The restaurant's entrance is in a small mall and there's signage both in/outside to help you locate it. We visited on Friday around 11AM - it wasn't crowded so we were seated immediately. The food carts came around very frequently and the food was fresh and delicious. They served pretty basic dim sum - har gow, shrimp noodles, spring rolls, shu mai, etc. The check was a little pricey, but we ate a ton of food. They didn't hound us for a tip, but they did ask how much change we wanted back. Overall, it was a pretty similar experience to many of the NYC dim sum places we go to.
