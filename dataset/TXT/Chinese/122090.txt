odfX0wO7fOyqa8oobxh96w I live downtown & I LOVE Chinese food. Living down here it's been wonderful having the ability to have things delivered other than pizza. 
SO... my fiancé & I order from here often enough that I believe they know us by name practically.
Everything we've ordered has been really good. Not epic good... but good.. EXCEPT their peppered chicken IS amazing good. BIG AWESOME GOOD... a must if you order from here.... it's basically the best thing they have on their entire menu.. I'm pretty sure that's totally accurate. 
I order online mostly but when I do call in an order - the person who answers is always nice - easy to understand. The delivery person is always smiley & super nice too.
One time they forgot our steamed dumplings - I called & told them the problem... the person came back & delivered them within a few minutes of the mishap & was super apologic & really sweet.
I know this place has gotten some rotten reviews over some time but it's very easy to do that as people don't always give the happy reviews when they're pleased typically.
SO, I say - give it a try people - order the peppered chicken - it's excellent - you're welcome in advance & if you're happy - write a happy review. :)
