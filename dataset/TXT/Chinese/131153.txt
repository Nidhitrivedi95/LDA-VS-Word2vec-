phTLTkqSvylLkmz5wAwhTw Was hoping for a new place to get Chinese food. I placed an order to go , service was very friendly and fast. The food on the other hand was horrible. Springs very greasy, and so was the tasteless fried rice and chow mien Tried their special chicken wings, I took one bite and spit it out. It was like putting a tablespoon of salt in my mouth. Unfortunately I ended up throwing it away and having a P and J for dinner. I'll never go back to this place.
