UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw You can't beat the deal on Local Dines (http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ )!  A $40 certificate for $20.  This was my first visit to this location because I always used to go to the one on Mill.  I LOVED going there and it is a shame they aren't there anymore because the place had a great vibe to it and had excellent food.  This Bamboo club has the same great food, but you could tell the place is getting pretty old and needs some updating.  None of this mattered to me because I was there for one reason:  the orange beef with that crispy spinach.  Soooo frikking good.  Its like candy.  I also love the fried rice because it is full off good stuff.  The service is also pretty good as are the martini pours.  I will return hopefully soon.
