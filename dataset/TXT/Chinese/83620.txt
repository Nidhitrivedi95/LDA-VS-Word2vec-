HdQrBS3jrtOrRqzRymgiig We have been working our way through the menu's at www.justeat.ca and this place caught our eyes because they had a 20% off offer.
Mind you, we found out after looking at the menu, that you needed to spend $50.00 to save that 20%
It wasn't tough to order that much anyways.

We were most impressed by the quality of the meat we ordered, we are big chicken lovers, and ordered a few chicken dishes, every item had white meat, this was a nice change.

We will order again
