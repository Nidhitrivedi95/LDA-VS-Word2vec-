CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ It's a great place and very customer-friendly. I loved the broth separation in the same pot (caters to different tastes: check). You are immersed in vapors and you come out feeling very full. 

I enjoyed almost everything I put on my plate, but when the place is crowded the food can get mixed up on the shelves. 

I really like it.
