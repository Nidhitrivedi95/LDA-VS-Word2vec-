JOrz9T33rVHDbusIKPj96g Food is rather typical, nothing too good or too bad. There are many better options in the area. The major complains are: 1. bad service, 2. slow service, 3. no service. We went 3 times and they never improve their service.

Oh and sticky floor. They could really use a Mr. Clean there.

Would NOT recommend.
