0VjHFdczi6Nln_nn8bucJQ I want to like this place, I really do... but there were just too many problems. 

I ordered pho with rare sliced beef and beef balls... and requested it in a larger size. The menu only displays one price, but the server said he can make it into an "extra large" bowl for me. I was hoping I'd get proportionately more meat, but I ended up with a large bowl of what seemed like endless rice noodles. TASTE wise, it was fine, but I felt a bit ripped off. 

Interesting to note: there are no containers with fish sauce on the tables... but they have single-use packets for SOY SAUCE. This should've been my first red flag. 

The next problem is that I was craving some traditional Vietnamese coffee, hot. Even the menu has a cute picture of what it's *supposed to look like*... a hot, slow drip. When I put my order in, maybe 45 seconds passed and he brought out a mug with a spoon. He warned me "It's super super hot and also VERY strong!" To emphasize how strong he believed it was, he grabbed me a container for sugar and set it next to my cup (something that I did not ask for, but it gets better)...

I tasted it and immediately felt disappointed. One, this wasn't how it's supposed to be served. Two... it tasted almost identical to the Vietnamese instant coffee packets I have at home! Two packets, to be precise. No extra sugar was necessary because I never add sugar when I use my two packets at home.

Maybe I just got my hopes up too much from other Yelp reviews. Is this place terrible? No. (The restroom was well maintained, at least.) But don't go out of your way to come here! I spent a little over $14 and walked out disappointed.
