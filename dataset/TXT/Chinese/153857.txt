TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ We ordered vegetarian manchurian pakoras, manchurian noodles, chop suey, chicken in black bean sauce, a soup and schechuan fried rice for take out. Had read great reviews about lotus garden and the food did not disappoint. Manchurian was crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside. They had packed the gravy separately (sensibly). The noodles and rice were hot to taste and red in color -- reminiscent of the Hakka cuisine back home. The chicken in black bean sauce was the highlight though. All in all, well worth the 1/2 hr drive. Highly recommended!
