Mkpg9S2j0ZrZc3q-VjfLsA Being a fan of congee, Congee queen is my 'go-to' place in Markham for chinese food. 

My family and I rarely go out to eat but when we do, this is the place we go. Once you order, the food comes quickly from the kitchen. Service is normal for the amount of people that are in the restaurant. Wait times are usually decent too, around 10-15 minutes for a table of 5. The environment is always loud and you will hear dishes clattering, but that is typical of an Chinese restaurant. 

As for the food, I usually order one bowl of small congee (enough for 5 people). Their 6 grain congee is health in a bowl. It can be a bit more on the bland side, but it is a good break from some of their other oily options. 

Their fried oysters are usually a staple in our congee queen order. The Pan fried turnip cakes are usually a hit or miss; they can come out golden brown or just sallow. 

Overall, a good place if you want to go to a sit down restaurant and be in and out quickly.
