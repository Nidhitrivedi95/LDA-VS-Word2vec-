UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ This place is horrible I ordered two meals and I ordered soup on the side. I hated the soup and let them know that I wanted it returned. Normally a restaurant will automatically take the returned item off the bill, however this place refused and told me I was just to full to eat it. She said I would have to pay full price for the soup even though she had already thrown it away without telling me she was going to charge me for the soup. Had I of known she was still gonna charge me for the soup I would of kept it and fed it to my kids or something. However she took it and said nothing until the bill came. Then she argued with me about the bill for 5 mins before agreeing to take some off. By this point I am not letting up on the subject because I can't believe how this business is treating me! Do not eat here. Ps, the food was a 5 out of 10 as far as taste goes.
