6Qpo9mVLl60gu-ajJvcBLQ Have been going here for years and they never disappoint. They are easily the cheapest Chinese place in town and continue to produce quality food. The dining area atmosphere is more of a fast food style but the price and speed make up for that. The family that run the place are very nice and will make a dish however you ask.
