_OgiLzwewW-0Y9_7SIirMQ So after wanting to try a new place for Chinese, I saw this place with pretty good reviews and decided to give it a shot. After giving it a shot, and coming back to leave my review, I notice that the most recent review is from two years ago. 

Things must have REALLY changed in two years. This place was terrible.

I walk in, and and my food wasn't ready yet, so I pay and wait. While waiting, I wish I wouldn't had paid yet. I saw the lady from the counter MICROWAVE my boneless spare ribs. At that moment, I just wanted to walk out. 

Sure enough, the food was soggy, and tasteless. Even the house fried rice was bland and flavorless.

DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND! Go to China Restaurant or Peking Garden in Gastonia.
