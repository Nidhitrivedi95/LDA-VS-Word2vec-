G-OMrmKRaSumc73LaSbhPA Brentwood needed a GOOD Chinese food restaurant. China Wok moved in and was having a Grand Opening so we gave it a try. There are 3 or 4 small tables to sit at and eat. I ordered food for take out. My food was made hot and fresh and packed nicely for travel. 
I ordered the Sesame Chicken. They make theirs with a lot of heat. I asked for little to no heat. It had a smidge of heat and it was good. The chicken was cut into smaller pieces but it actually made it easier to eat. There was a very small amount of breading but not enough that it was heavy or clunky. Their portion size was I keeping with other restaurants. It was served with fried rice which had some bean sprouts and bits of pork in it. The sprouts were a nice little crunch and the pork added a little flavor to the rice. An egg roll came with my meal. It was on the smaller side but like the chicken it made it easier to eat. The egg roll was cooked perfectly and had a crispy outside and the insides were cooked perfectly. 
We will definitely be back to try other dishes.
