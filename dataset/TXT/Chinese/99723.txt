jvUeGNTr7M-FRyozqKRZzQ You have to have some set of balls to have the word "spice" in your name and put out food as bland as this place does! It's like it all came out of the same buffet leftover tupperware. Worst chinese food I have ever had. Service was just average at best. When I can say Panda Express is way better than this place (and that's not saying anything), I suggest you eat ANYWHERE else.
