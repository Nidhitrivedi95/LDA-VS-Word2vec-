QHZw2L6LV1qmExNJbfhIsQ Back for Skyview's dim sum special $2.80 if order before 10:50 am on weekdays.

If you do want to take advantage of the special, be sure to be here at least 30 minutes or more to wait for a table. If not, you won't be happy to pay full price for their dim sum.

Most of the dim sum we ordered were A-OK. But the kitchen seemed to overcooked some of the items: the shrimp rice roll and siu mai. The Crab Soup Dumpling which is suppose to be an XL was disappointing: bland and hardly have any filling, even at discount pricing, I would not order that again.

I doubt I would be paying full price for dim sum at Skyview at least with what they offering now. Hoping they would improve on their choice and quality!
