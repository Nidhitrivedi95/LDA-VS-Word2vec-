fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA **They only accept cash** I had to walk an extra half mile looking for my bank to withdraw cash. But it was worth it. I ordered the mixed dumpling plate where I ordered vegetable dumpling, lamb and beef. The lamb was my personal favorite. It was rich in flavor. This place is legit and you can tell by the employees in the window rolling out fresh dough for the dumplings. Great pitstop after a long walk.
