6vVkSaymw-4MOTPh68HN3Q I love this place for take out Chinese. I tend to get the sesame chicken combo and fried wontons which are both very good. When I get other things I am happy with the food. I use to go to First Wok all the time because I lived near it but now I am far away from it and find that this place is just as good if not better. They are always very pleasant, quick, and I find the prices very reasonable.
