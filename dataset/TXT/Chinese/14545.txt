3fw2X5bZYeW9xCz_zGhOHg I think this HK style dessert shop does desserts right! they have been around for a pretty long time, especially since other shops beside them on the same strip, has been switching owners a lot.

I think they do a good job with the clay pot rices, the rice is nice and soft and there is a good amount of toppings. (It's a 30 min wait, but it's worth it) I've tried all the different flavors already, and there isn't one I did not like.

The desserts are delicious, I have been here many many times and tried almost everything, I especially like the shaved ice, the fried milk, and any tofu fa, grass jelly or sago dessert which has LOTS of fruits. and the herbal jelly is authentic.

I like the hot foods also, the portions are good and it's flavorful. Like the street style rice rolls, and tea eggs,
