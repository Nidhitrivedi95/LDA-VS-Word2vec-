dJnF_GUWdoX3tUucpKbYMg I've been her before for dinner, and I remembered it was good.

However, recently, I went there for dim sum with my parents, aunt, and cousin.  We ordered the following: har gow, siu mai, eggplant, congee, chicken feet, turnip cake, bbq pork rice noodle, shrimp rice noodle, beef balls, chiu chow dumplings just to name a few.

I was quite impressed by the har gow, siu mai, and shrimp rice noodle.  The shrimp was large and tasty.  The chicken feet was delicious as well, however, it might have been that I was craving for chicken feet.  The "chiu chow dumplings" were good as wel.

I never had a chance to try the bbq pork rice noodle, beef balls or eggplant.

I was very disappointed with the congee.  It was suppose to be a vegetable and fish slice congee.  It just tasted like plain congee with a few chopped vegetables in it.  No fish taste at all!  The steamed turnip cake was bland as well.  Had no taste at all.

Some things were really good, but I've had better dim sum at other places.
