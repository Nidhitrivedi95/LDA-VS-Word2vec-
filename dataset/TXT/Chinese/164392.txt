UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ We stopped here for a late lunch this afternoon. The place was fairly empty so the service was quick. We ordered lunch specials; citrus chicken, chicken chow mien, and curry chicken. Everyone was happy with their meals but it was nothing amazing. The crab wonton was fantastic but no one cared for the spring roll. Lunch for 3 was about $31.00 before tip.

The place was clean but the endless Billy Joel music was a turn off. I'm a fan, but unless I am at a concert I need some variety in my music.

We went back here for dinner last night (3/5/16) and I am glad we did. The food was very good, as was the service. They even brought us out a sample while waiting to order of their Thai chicken. There were 5 of us so we ordered quite a bit of food and everything was good. My orange beef was a bit too sweet and after a couple bites I couldn't eat any more but it was still tasty. The orange chicken was my favorite dish on the table. 

The Billy Joel music is still on but it was pretty loud there last night so it wasn't as noticeable.
