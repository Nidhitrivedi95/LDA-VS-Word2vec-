5zk3LxFzijmY2JipVZ7Xdg Quick service is what they serve in the place. They have great food...but in my opinion just a little overpriced, but then again...I feel like most Asian restaurants are in AZ. The waiter is super friendly and always has a smile on her face. 
One thing to keep in mind...if you take any food to-go...and they put the food in this black plastic container...well...even though it says it's micro safe...it's not! Mine melted in the microwave...not cool at all!
