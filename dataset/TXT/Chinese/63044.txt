DwmAsemahJywywhuqv5J1Q Teeny weeny portions!  One small container of rice for 4 entrees. Seriously ??? 
We ordered crab Rangoon and got pork dumplings . 
So if you don't want the food actually ordered, or rice to go with food you ordered and small portions with large price order away, otherwise scroll down, there's GOTTA be something better.
