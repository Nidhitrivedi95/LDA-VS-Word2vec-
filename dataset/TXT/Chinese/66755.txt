eI1ZHGOr2Pus842KrZD5ZQ My fiance's family and I came here for our last dim sum brunch before catching our flight back to NYC. My fiance's dad had his company's  holiday banquet here. Very elegant, grand interior. A huge crowd was waiting to be called when we arrived. Fortunately, we had a reservation and were seated immediately. The dim sums here were exactly the same as Crown Prince maybe a few extra item here and there. Something new that we tried were lamb dumplings (not a big fan), durian rolls (no one in my party dared to touch them.. all for me yay lol), egg yolk layered cake (I love sweets but the salty part threw me off.. wasn't a big fan), taro rolls with sweet potato (too starchy), sweet potato tart (delish not too sweet! - even my fiance's brother's gf liked it and she hates sweets!) 

Definitely looking forward to return to this place for another fine dim sum dining in the future!
