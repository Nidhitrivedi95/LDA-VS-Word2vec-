1uPQTz5XZSWr0ti7kUpaDw Being Chinese, I have a high standard for dumplings. 

On a one weekend trip from New York to Montreal, I visited this place twice on a friend's recommendation. These were by far the best dumplings I've ever had in my life. I had the pork, shrimp and mushroom boiled dumplings and the pork, shrimp and coriander. Both amazing, super fragrant and just the right amount of skin to meat ratio. 

The shop is cozy and clean for Chinatown standards with friendly staff. They also had an amazing chili sauce that was the perfect balance of spice and flavor without being too spicy and overpowering the flavor of the dumpling. 

I would order these frozen online if I could and eat them everyday.
