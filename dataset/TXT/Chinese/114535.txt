mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w My family and I love Chinese, but we had never had dim sum. We were surprised when East Ocean opened in Henderson in the same space where the Italian restaurant used to be. With little knowledge and just the recommendation of one of my friends I brought the family on a late Sunday morning. 

Wow - there are a lot of people here and there were very few tables available in this massive space.... we kept going. This place is beyond clean. We were seated within 2 minutes by a friendly hostess, we learned soon enough that unlike other Chinese places on or near the strip everyone speaks English and customer service is really important to them.

We didn't know what to order but the different cart waiters took the time to explain what many of the items were.We chose about 12 small dishes for the 5 of us and ordered a couple of desserts, which was enough.

Overall everything was hot, tasted amazing... my soup was a bit too spicy, but overall authentic yumminess.

The place is loaded with a big contingency of Asian speaking Henderson locals - definitely a sign  something is right here.

Will be going back soon.
