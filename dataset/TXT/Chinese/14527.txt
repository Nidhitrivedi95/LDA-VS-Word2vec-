3FekhBpUmAWXBCvXBhuqVQ I would recommend Da Ke Yi as a great take-out place for rice rolls and congee (note that congee is on the more watery side).  This place is famous popular among the older generation from Guangzhou China since they make delicious 'heritage rice rolls'.  There is often a line during prime dining time.  Expect a 30 mins wait if you're ordering the 'heritage rice rolls' when it's busy.  In that case, I recommend to call in advance.  I don't recommend to eat at the food court since you can feel the layer of grease on all the tables.  All in all, I am a huge fan of this place.
