_P-N2rDIJ2kHTPstjUWByQ This restaurant is a total hidden gem in Elyria. You wouldn't think much of the place when you first walk in but, the food is very good!

The Kung Pao chicken was tasty & spicy. They used all white meat which is a huge plus. The fried rice was really good as well as was the veggie egg rolls. I also ordered the fried donuts which you can never go wrong with that.

The service was good & fast. The young lady working there was really friendly. I like the fact you get a freebie (2 liter of pop) if your order is over $25 & if your order is over $30, you get a free order of general chicken.
