CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA I came here because a coworker suggested the place. The wait to order the food wasn't bad and the food arrived quickly. After finishing half of my bowl, I noticed a hair as did an en employee who overheard me complaining to my coworker. I was told to take it upfront and I did. I received an apology from the cashier. In a situation like this I would have expected the manager to come out and own the issue.
