CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw For the most part this place is good, does the job if your craving some Asian food, I've found its hit and miss with the quality.  The portions are good, service can be a little weird at times with the language issues but good for the most part.  I find the prices to be on the high side for the type/quality of food being served.
