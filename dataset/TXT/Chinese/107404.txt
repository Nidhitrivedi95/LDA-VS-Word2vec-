l9vx-OTdDPU-oHZ17aVxdg I don't know hakka very well, but I thought this must be a good place for people to crowd the door before the restaurant even opens.

It was very simple inside, and I ordered singapore noodles.

Very tasty indeed, and not too greasy or salty.

 I hope to come back, and try more items off the menu.
