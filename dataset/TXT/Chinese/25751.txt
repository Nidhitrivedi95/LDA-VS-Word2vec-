Aside from a little bit of attitude when we asked for water everything was perfect. Then our bill came and the server added a service charge to the bill... There was only 2 of us eating. We paid and I picked up another menu to see if there is any note of gratuity being added to a bill and to my surprise the menu clearly states that they do not add gratuity to their bills! The only explanation I can think of is that we were discriminated against. Not cool! Very offensive!
