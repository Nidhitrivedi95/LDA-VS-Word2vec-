VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q Came here on a pretty cold night so hot noodles paired perfectly with the weather. It's another one of those customizable concepts where you can choose what to have in your bowl of noodles. You have a choice of the: soup base, 2 toppings, noodles, and drink ($1.00 extra for  cold drinks). They raised their prices again apparently to $10.50.

I ordered the gingko + pepper fish soup, Korean style glass noodle, beef briskets and choi sum, and a cold milk tea + coffee for my drink. All their fish soups apparently contain no MSG so that's an added bonus. I really liked my soup base since the pepper added a decent amount of kick for my baby intolerance level to anything spicy. I feel like for some people with larger appetites, the portion may be a bit small. However, for me it was just perfect. I feel like I did the right combo this time in terms of customizing my noodles. Overall a pretty good experience.
