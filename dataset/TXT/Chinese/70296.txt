It was mostly raw onion and green pepper, and I counted exactly five tiny pieces of chicken. It was also extremely greasy and much too spicy (I normally love spicy food). I've read a lot of good reviews for this place so it was pretty disappointing, but I would honestly not recommend this place to anyone. Our order of 3 entrees also came with no eating utensils or napkins which was unacceptable. On the other hand, the pork lo mein was tasty enough, and the egg rolls here are decently sized. All together, I wish we had ordered from somewhere else.
