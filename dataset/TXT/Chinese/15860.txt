3snG6gdJH_IQzU1ryHL0Sw only been here once but would definitely come again!! really nice, clean place which is very spacious. staff are very nice and the food is lovely. there is a huge vary of chinnese food, all you can eat. your plate gets cleared regularly so you can just take another plate and get more food. at the end, when its time for desert they have a chocolate fountain with marshmallows for dipping. they also have a ice cream machine al well as other cakes etc. really recomned this place!
