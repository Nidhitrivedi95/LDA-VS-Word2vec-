KXLjOJbl9VYXFxKT4YK99Q This place is great. It moved in were the old Pick-up-Sticks used to be and offers much better food. The joint is fast paced and open to substitutions on its combos. The prices are average compared to other normal take-out Chinese food. I really like the the house chicken and orange chicken.
