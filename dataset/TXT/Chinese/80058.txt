gnqHyA6gY2-m9S-FKt6Xqw I go at least 1 every 2 weeks. I LOVE THIS PLACE.   I am addicted to there Jakarta Fried Rice. I always look for it when I go to other places but they don't have it. If they do have it they don't come close to Cravings' version. Their menu is really big. Everything that I have tried I liked. I like that people speak Chinese it gives it an authentic feel.
