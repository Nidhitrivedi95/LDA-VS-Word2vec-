cJzv3fbd7jL2ZHyFosFkOw I haven't even tried the food yet... However, I placed my order over an hour and a half ago and still NO food. I was told over the phone it would be an hour. I provided my phone number, apparently it didn't occur to anyone to call and give me an update if they got busy. I had to call them! I had to call about 20 or so times before anyone answered the phone and I called BOTH numbers listed. Then they put me on hold and told me it would be another 10 or so minutes. Ugh!! At this point they don't deserve any stars. I'm on a business trip and it's been a long day, I was really looking forward to my wonton soup. :(
