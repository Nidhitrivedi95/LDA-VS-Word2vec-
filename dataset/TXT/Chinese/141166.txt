Rd2dzpMw_iHh8zeMuL2TWQ I dig this place, mind you it was a damn near impossible to find if you've never been before (like me), so thank goodness I had GPS! For those on the lookout for this place it's on Village Centre Place which is most easily accessed by going north on Hurontario St and making a  right on SherwoodTowne Blvd followed by a quick left onto Village Centre Place which is a court surrounded by low rise offices (think a business park).

If you go towards the back of the court you'll see the ample parking that services the entire area. Once parked Zem-One is easy to find, identifiable by their tall Zem-One flags and sandwich boards out by the curb.

Those sandwich boards come in handy since they are the ONLY sushi spot in the 905 doing Drive-thru sushi. Huh? Basically you call in advance, place your order and they will meet you at the curb with debit/credit machine so you can essentially drive up, pay for your lunch and go - super convenient.

If you're dining in/taking out they've got some incredible lunch specials that include sushi and even some thai and noodle options. I was dining in the other day and ordered a maki lunch special. It was excellent, a very creative creation with amazingly fresh ingredients. They've definitely done a great job here.

Consider this a hidden gem in Mississauga and worth checking out! I'll reserve the 5th star for future visits

Eatcrest Out!
