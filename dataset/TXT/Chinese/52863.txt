Cl-xl1vTUwHeaGgBxzdTRA Absolutely gross. So disappointed  the orange chicken was chewy and the beef with broccoli was questionable. The wonton chips and cream cheese wonton have a weird yellow tint to them don't know if that has to do with the flavor. Shrimp fried rice was completely undercooked and inedible. The only good thing was the wonton soup.... just wondering if/how/when can I get a refund on my $40.
