gvur69cXFtawJnJbNzFuZQ Delicious dinner on a Friday night at Pearl of The Orient, in business at Beachcliff market Shops since 1984. We  were seated and immediately the owner George came to our table and welcomed us to the restaurant. 
We ordered Szechuan Chicken with Brown Rice and Orange Chicken with Brown Rice, both meals were delivered to our table in a reasonable amount of time 
Steaming hot full of flavor, large portions, we loved the food and can't wait to return.
