Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w No more "all you can eat" crab legs at this restaurant!  They really need to take it off their website since it isn't offered anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!   Plus they need to get that low 90 restaurant score up, too!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Gross!  We left & ended up taking our family to The Melting Pot.   
45 minute drive each way.  We will NEVER go back, or refer this place!!!  Hmmm...  No wonder their parking lot was SO empty...
