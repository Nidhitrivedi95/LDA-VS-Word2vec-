xDnTbCZ3z2EnwHIcXYu0wA Got Singapore noodles, chilli chicken, chicken Manchurian, egg fried rice, shrimp fried rice and 2 orders of fried shrimp for apps (which they forgot to include) food was satisfying and tasty with good portions. 

       The low rating is based on the fact that I was staying in Brampton and realized when I got home that they had forgotten to include the 2 orders of fried shrimp. This was a true inconvenience as my family and I were looking forward to the shrimp as appetizers with drinks. 

       The next day I called them to inform them of the mistake which they confirmed by having too much shrimp in the fridge. they agreed to have me pick up the 2 orders that evening. I asked if they could include something extra seeing that I would now have to drive from Brampton to Scarborough due to their mistake. The person I was speaking with would not approve any complimentary items despite having admitted their mistake.

       My poor rating of this restaurant is based solely on service. Ultimately in my opinion it's a restaurant's duty to serve their customers the best they can; keep the customer happy and of course... in the right mood to keep coming back. Due to the lack of respect for my time, planning and inconvenience I will not be returning to this establishment.
