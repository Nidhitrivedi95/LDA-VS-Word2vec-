UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw I am increasing this establishment's rating from four stars to five stars.
Second visit and this time the experience was almost perfect.
We all arrived for dinner at about 7pm and, because it was Wednesday, we ordered a bottle of excellent Argentinian Malbec for half price. What a great way to start a meal.
We checked out the menu and everything looked wonderful. We eventually decided on Mongolian beef, sesame chicken and the Cantonese noodle dish.
Each dish was wonderfully flavorful and the three of us shared the dishes so that we enjoyed the distinct taste of all the individual spices and we were all completely full by the end of the meal.
The waiter, a Matthew McConaughey doppelgänger (well, just his accent) was very capable and his service was excellent.
We didn't order dessert because we didn't take any food home with us.
The only drawback to this restaurant is that it is a rather a long drive from the Biltmore area.
This place renewed my faith in good Thai food. The Bamboo Club has oodles of it.
