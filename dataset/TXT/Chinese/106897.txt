l5NUIeAo6Fk-Vx4nm3Xqfg China Ginger is our go-to place for Lemon Chicken. The lightly breaded chicken is tender and the lemon sauce is sweet and tangy, but not overpowering. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing with calming music and the servers are really sweet and polite. They are always checking on you and are really quick to respond to your requests. Though I'm WAY past the age for dating, I always think this restaurant would be ideal for someone's first date where good conversation is possible!
