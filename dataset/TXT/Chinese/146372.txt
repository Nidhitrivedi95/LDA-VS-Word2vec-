s3AG8m6Pzq-vON729pf0gw This is my third or fourth time coming to this place.  Why three or four times with the one star?  Because I keep hoping that this place is good!  It's in  such a great (convenient) location and there aren't too many great neighborhood sushi joints in Mesa.  The quality of the food is very disappointing.  We ordered a salmon roll and the "salmon" was a jelly consistency.  If this establishment wants to stay in business, they need to reevaluate the quality of its ingredients.  True sushi lovers know that it's all in the freshness of your ingredients.
