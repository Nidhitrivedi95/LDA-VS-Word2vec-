_xt4ZyvtgY8Xu_O6SpSB5A Open till 11 so it says but don't walk in at 10:13.  Had 5 minutes to order because we were told kitchen closes at 10:30.  Food was rushed and rather bland.  I was served wrong item and never came back to check on us. Mopped with bleach water right under our feet. Not sure why such rave reviews especially when there is 50 other Asian restaurants in Mississauga
