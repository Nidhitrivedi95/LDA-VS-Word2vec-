Fk3EJL73i9Uql92ndZscMA I had dinner here with my husband recently.  The street address is Dufferin Street but the entrance is actually on Orfus Road.  So it's a great place to grab a bite after shopping all the outlet stores on Orfus Rd.  

I had the Combo D, which was Spicy Crispy Chicken, stir-fried noodles and vegetables all for $6.95.  My husband had the General Tao Chicken on fried rice ($7.25).

The Spicy Crispy Chicken is battered boneless chicken pieces, deep fried and tossed with some spices (mostly salt, garlic and chili peppers).  It's dry, not covered in sauce/gravy.  It was hot and crispy, and a little bit spicy, but I found it way too salty.  If they went easier on the salt, it would have been excellent.  I liked that the vegetables (broccoli, peppers, carrots, bok choy and cabbage) were not covered in oil/grease.  I think they steam them and then toss them in a tiny bit of oil on the wok.  The noodles too were not oily/greasy like at most Chinese restaurants.  I liked that I didn't feel disgusting after eating here (like I do after I eat at places like Manchu Wok, Tiki Ming, etc.).  

I had a bite of my husband's General Tao Chicken.  It was delicious.  The sauce was more sweet than tangy, and it didn't have an overpowering hoisin taste to it like it does at some restaurants.  I was a fan.  The fried rice is just plain fried rice, no vegetables in it.  

Overall for the price this place was great.  You order at the counter and when it's done they let you know and you carry it to your own table.  The staff are very nice and pleasant.  The place is small and a bit dingy, but whatever, the food is good, fast and cheap!

It's in a strip mall so lots of free parking.
