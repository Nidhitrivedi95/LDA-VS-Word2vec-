zXR-C_clfbCksI0cIDrl4g Just moved into Southern Highlands and had hoped my local Chinese place would have good or at least decent food. I left two stars instead of one because I did not vomit. I'm sorry but they really need a new cook.
I decided to leave this review in hopes that the owner would see it and strive to improve the taste of the food. 
We do not have many food options out here in Southern Highlands so please please please improve the quality of your food.
