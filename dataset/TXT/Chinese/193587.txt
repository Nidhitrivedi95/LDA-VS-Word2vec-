ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. The only qualm I have with this place is their steamed buns aren't really bau, but more like a steamed bau taco. It's delicious, but not exactly what I was expecting. The food is always fresh and perfectly prepared. Great Asian fusion with a southwestern twist.
