1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Been meaning to write a review for this place, it's just plan awful! Always try not to be bias on one visit but been to this place 3 times and it was all awful. Poor service and mediocre food, I can make better food at home. Wouldn't have given this place a try but thought hey they got pretty good reviews. Sorry yelpers, not sure why it was great? 1st visit there with a party of 6 during dinner hour and was greeted by a grumpy middle age woman, she was busy calculating tickets and told us "you have to wait" when I told her we have a party of 6, her awful tone of voice made me feel like I was scolded by mom! Not the way you would greet your guest! Took her forever to service us after we got a table and they were not super busy. Just gave me the feeling she didn't like working there. The food was very simple, basic and bland! That's why I think I can make better tasting food at home. Maybe because the price was cheap thats why people are okay with it? Another time was just our family of 4 during a late lunch hour around 3:00 service was slow because there's only one guy running the show for maybe 3 tables there. Felt bad for him having to do tables and cook the food but he wasn't too friendly either. Well came here 3 times and my husband said "shame on us for not learning the 1st 2 time"! Don't waste your $5! That's how bad.

A side note, if I was the owner I would at least provide a bit of friendly service to my customers. A smile and Thank You wouldn't hurt, we are paying customers and not beggars for us to be treated this way. IMO
