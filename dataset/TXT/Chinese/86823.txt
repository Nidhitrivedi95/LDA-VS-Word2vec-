hQMx2ZbGAa_oxJNpnTZf8Q Food is always good, service excellent as well. Glad they opened the ice cream on the side porch however it's not very inviting, more like a storage area.  We stopped a week or so ago and the ice cream was excellent, very creamy and perfect consistency. My daughter was glad they changed their 'recipe' as she only agreed to go because other ice cream shops in the area were closed.  Well apparently they went back to the old ice milk she remembered tonight ... Chocolate was too dark and the vanilla was off white and fast to melt.  Hopefully they go back to the better flavor or we will be going a few miles further for ice cream in the future.
