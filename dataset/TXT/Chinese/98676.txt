Aside from that...food is pretty good. Good prices and good amount of food based on the low costs. I think they make the best Egg Fried rice over all dozens of Chinese places I've tried in Arizona.

Lunch specials are the best because they are cheap and depending on the size you get you get full with small or have left overs with a large lunch special. Lunch starts at $3.75.

They offer delivery even though I've seen they wait until they get enough orders before they drive off. So be warned your food might be sitting getting soggy and cold before it gets to your house.
