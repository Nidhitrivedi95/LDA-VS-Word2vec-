GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Talk about a great fusion restaurant... I've never heard of a Chinese/Mexican restaurant before and it was in our hotel, so we had to try it. I'm so glad we did. The food was amazing. We wanted a lighter lunch, so appetizers to share worked perfectly and that's how the restaurant is designed. There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try. I will definitely try to go back to eat some of the food we had to skip this time around. The service was also wonderful!
