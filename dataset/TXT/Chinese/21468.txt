6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q Went for some dimsum on a Saturday morning. Not busy, so there were plenty of tables available.

Very cool decorations. Service is prompt. 

The dimsum takes a bit to come out, but that's because it's made to order. Sip on some nice hot tea while you wait. When it arrived the dimsum was very tasty. We had shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, stuffed mushrooms, sticky rice, fried rice and some other good dishes.

Although a bit pricey it's worth it for a nice tasting meal in a nice place.
