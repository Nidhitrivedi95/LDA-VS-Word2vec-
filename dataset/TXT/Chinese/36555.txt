AktuBx1W7c3ZdzwuaOp8xg Awful. New owners. Again. Each time a little worse. We had to update the review as a result. 
Prices have increased. Quality has diminished. This was our go to place. Not any more. We tried twice since the new family took over. We won't be back. 
Disgusting. 
The food is at best average. Not tasty. 
I'm so sad the first owners moved away. This WAS. My fav.
