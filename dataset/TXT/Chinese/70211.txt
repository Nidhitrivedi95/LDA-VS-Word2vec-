f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ I've never been to other dim sum places in Las Vegas Chinatown...so I can only compare to what I've eaten before. 

I came here with a party of 7 on a Wednesday afternoon at 12:15 pm. I had called earlier to make sure they still served dim sum and they also took my reservation! 

We came at 12:15 pm and they were in a scurry to clean our table and seat is. Okay, that's fine. But the whole point of "<U+98F2><U+8336>" is to drink tea along with your food! We didn't get any service for tea 20 minutes into dining even though the cart ladies were already bombarding us with options. 

We ordered quite a bit! 
-Fung Zhao (chicken feet) // classic dish. Pretty sweet, not spicy enough. But not bad for what they had! 

-Har gau (steamed shrimp dumpling) // Okay, this was butchered. Not so crystal skin and it was cold and falling apart. 

-Siu Mai (open topped steamed pork or shrimp dumplings) // a bit too oily for the pork! But still yummy. *Be warned, we found a piece of hair in this. Luckily we could exchange it...*

-Jiu Cai Bau (fried wheat starch skin dumpling with chives) // yum! I would get again. It was a bit on the oily side but stuffed with good amount of meat and thin skin. 

-Cha Siu Bao (steamed BBQ pork stuffed buns) // Mehhh. I'm not a huge fan of this item regardless of where I get it. 

-Cheong Fan (rolled rice noodles) // errrr. Probably one of the worst I've had. Not big and soft like other places! This was tiny and stale....too much soy sauce added and really cold! The beef one was gross, shrimp was doable. Luckily we didn't order too many! 

-Pei Guen (steamed tofu skin roll) // Classic dish that I love! They did okay with this- you seriously can screw up steaming this. But the only complaint I have is that the stuffing inside was way too little and did not have the classic bamboo shoots. 

-Lo Mai Gai (steamed glutinous rice) // Not flavorful at all, and barely half a teaspoon of stuffing in the center. Regret! 

-Daan taat (egg custard tart) // This was a disappointment (like everything else). But I guess it's good for the kiddos! 

-bowl of intestine soup // too sweet, but I love intestines regardless. 

-bowl of pig blood soup // not a super clean taste- can still taste some of the "freshness". Good portion though! 

-plate of stir fried beef and rice noodles // Good! Pretty decent potion, not too oily and enough beef for everyone. 

Pros: 
-Helpful service. They were patient and helpful with out questions and needs. 
-cheap? I would say for 8 people, we only paid $85 before tax. 

Cons: 
-Not a lot of options rolling around. And I mean, literally, rolling around. The classic Cheong fan wasn't being served unless you requested it! 
-No menus. It's nearing lunch time and I would think that you'd give us a lung menu too since the cart ladies were taking off! You'd have to be a frequent here to be able to understand what they are doing...

Tips/Observations: 
-parking lot is small! Be prepared to circle around. 

Overall, never again....I would check out other places besides here.
