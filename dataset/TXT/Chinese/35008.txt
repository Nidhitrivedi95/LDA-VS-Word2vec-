Finding this hidden gem is another reason why I love Yelp. A friend recommended this place but I had to confer with my trusted Yelp friends. And once again, Yelp did not let me down!

I still can't get over the amazing deal they offer. For $6.99 I got  a huge plate of Roasted Duck, Pork Belly and Rice. Everything was succulent. The Pork Belly skin had just the right amount of crispiness and not too much fat.

This place is nothing fancy but you definitely get more than you pay for. If you're looking for a cheap meal that satisfies and is easy on the wallet, this is the place to go!
