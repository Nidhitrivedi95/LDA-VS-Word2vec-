beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Incredibly unique dining experience with the conveyer belt & hot pot combination concept, delicious & Deni was super knowledgeable walking us through the menu! Great ambiance, music selection & staff. 

I had the fresh watermelon juice- perfect for ailing my hangover :) 

We both tried the house broth- light herbaceous and flavorful. 

We added the tiger shrimp, ribeye, veggie sampler, cuttlefish balls (I had to) & shiitake mushrooms. 

Everything we tried was fantastic. The veggie sampler was mostly lettuces, an incredible amount for two people and most were varieties I was unfamiliar with, but enjoyed greatly. 

We later grabbed crab stick & lotus from the conveyer belt as well. 

Loved it. Will definitely be making a stop back on our next trip!
