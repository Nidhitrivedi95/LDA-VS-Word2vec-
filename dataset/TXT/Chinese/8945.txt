1nM-ES-xVqL0yQGTCwtd-Q I really don't care if the food from this establishment is good.  After walking in and ordering fried rice,  pad kee mao, and red curry we sat for 45 minutes for our togo order.  Thai taste could have the best food on the planet, but I will never again order from this restaurant.

To be fair the curry and pad kee mao were pretty tasty, however the fried rice barely qualified as fried...
Service was friendly.

I still will not patronize this establishment in the future.
