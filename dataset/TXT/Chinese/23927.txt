6z-T_jIFrRQ4c6-BIvVBvA My cousin and I were hungry as hell when we hit this place. We had the Cantonese chow mein and spicy eggplant. The food was fine, nothing revolutionary. The chow mein was crispy upon first viewing but got soggy pretty much right away.

The only thing I could think was how I usually only get Chinese food of this calibre at the end of a looong night.
