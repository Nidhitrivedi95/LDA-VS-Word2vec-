2BFHItMhYjJzuWA4jIdlQw The Loon Fung will always have a special place in my heart. Every year my family and I spend a long weekend in Edinburgh taking in lots of shows at the festival and without fail we stop in here to have an enormous Chinese feast. We always over order but I never learn to recognise my own limits. When you a stitch from eating too much food that's when you know you're enjoying yourself!

Salt and Chilli Chicken wings are my favorite starter although the King Prawn version is also pretty good. Make sure you get some Chinese tea to help you pace your drinking and cleanse your body (am I kidding myself by thinking this minus' calories?). Crispy duck is a must for mains but it's also worth getting a noodle dish too. 

If I had one warning I would say that the Loon Fung is the kind of place where you need to get to know the menu. A few of the dishes can be a bit too sweet or greasy and some the descriptions are a little misleading. Nonetheless this is still one of my favourite restaurants. I'm really sad that I can't remember the name of the lovely woman who owns the Loon Fung but you'll be sure to know who I mean when you see her warm smile. If there is even the smallest mouthful still left in your bowl she'll offer to wrap it up in a doggie bag for you to take home as she really hates to see food go to waste. Great service, great food, great fun. Well recommended!
