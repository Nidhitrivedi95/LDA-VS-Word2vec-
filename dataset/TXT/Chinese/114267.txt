Service: 1.5

This restaurant deserves at least 4.5 stars for food quality and taste! They have the right chefs in the kitchen, that much I can say. The dinner was good, and the dim sum was even better. Their tea was real and fresh. 

However, the service and attitude brings the overall rating down significantly. The wait staff are just following orders, so I place all the negative blame on the managers and organization of the business.

All the dim sum dishes came rushing out to the table within the span of 10-15 minutes, to the point where we couldn't fit everything and had to stack steamers and even consolidate plates! The staff can clearly see the amount of food we ordered on the menu and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to quickly estimate that not everything will fit all at once. So why not pace the food delivery accordingly? Rather, we were forced to chow down like pigs just to make table space fast enough for the oncoming dishes. This was very OFF in terms of what a real dim sum experience should be. Forget about talking!

While waiting for a special dish to arrive, the manager came to inform us that the price shown on the menu has been updated, to which he pulled out a pen, scratched off the price on the sheet and scribbled a higher price!!! How can you do that in front of a customer after they've already placed the order?! TERRIBLE!!

When we called for the bill at the end of the meal, the manager again informed us that a few of the special items we ordered have a special discount if we pay cash (ie: we are cheating the government on taxes if you pay cash). Again, TERRIBLE!! 

Aside from the great tasting food, this place needs some quick correctional action.
