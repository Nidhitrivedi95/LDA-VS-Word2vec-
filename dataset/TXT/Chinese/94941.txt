jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg This place have a very bad management. We went for my birhtday dinner and they seat us close to the entrance. My sister was seating with her back on the hostess stand. A person approached the hostess stand but nobody was there, apparently this person is a snatcher and took my sister's bag and run. We run after this guy and the guy drop my sister's bag when he notice we are getting close to him. I speak to the manager if they have a camera in the restaurant so we can call a cop and report the incident. There is a camera buy it is not working. The manager said there are a lot of the same incident happening in there area. They could prevent this if there is always a person in the hostess stand and if they were a camera . It is not safe to eat in this restaurant
