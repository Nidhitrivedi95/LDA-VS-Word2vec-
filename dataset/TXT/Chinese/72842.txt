fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA It's early evening on a Wednesday. My hubby was willing to return to King's Noodle with me, but something strange compelled him  to "strongly encourage" trying the Dumpling House. Maybe it was the fact that at 5pm the only patrons were young white guys -- the only Asian women in the restaurant were staff members, or significant others of said white guys. There didn't appear to be much variation in the types of foods everyone ordered: a selection of steamed dumplings (12 pieces for about $6) and fried dumplings (again, 12 pieces for about $6). You can mix and match fillings such as pork with veggies, pork with sour cabbage, pork with shrimp, spinach and mushroom, group beef, chicken, and even minced lamb (the latter was not very good), I usually like my dumplings served in a steamer on top of a bed of Chinese cabbage. Dumplings should house a little bit of a savory, vinegar based soup, of which the diner has to find a way to get the soup to your mouth without breaking the dumpling and spilling the soup (that's a party foul). Two people, one canned soda, and 24 dumplings cost about $16 CAD.
