6_KCUxu2kOgP-pRnSNXG8Q FOOD POISONING ALERT

I'm pretty sure this establishment does not correctly handle their food. 

I went here with my mom and brother during our trip to Vegas and thanks to this place, it made it the worst Vegas trip I've ever been on. After eating two of their dishes, my mom, brother and I found ourselves with paramedics at 4 A.M. in our hotel room, rushing to the E.R. at Valley Hospital due to severe food poisoning. 

Although the food tasted good, the extreme stomach cramps, internal bleeding, unpleasant trips to the restroom and $1,000+ medical bills ARE NOT worth it.
