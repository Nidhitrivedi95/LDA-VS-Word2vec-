4KHo1LnkM69RtWTDBdG16g Came here for a late lunch and found the food and drinks to be decent.  It's not a bad choice if you're just looking for casual asian food or if you just want dessert and bbt.  They have a good variety of items, both sweet and savoury, so you'll probably find something you like. 

We ordered a durian slush and green apple bbt with tapioca for drinks.  Both were fine but I found that the tapioca lacked sweetness.  Not a huge deal, as they weren't mushy or too hard...that I can't stand. 

We also ordered a ramen and the teppan rice with beef (plus cheese and corn).  Ramen was average but I really liked the teppan rice.  The beef wasn't the best quality but once you mixed everything together with the sauce, it actually tasted really good.  Highly recommend adding corn and cheese :) 

For dessert, we ordered the marshmallow custard toast which was good but if you're not a huge fan of super sweet things then you might not like it so much.
