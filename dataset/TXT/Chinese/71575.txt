fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A Overall very good quality Chinese food. The service was very good (tell me another Chinese place that actually has people pouring your tea for you!!!). It took a while for our food to come out but it was worth the wait. We ate the corn soup (very delicious!) and we also got the seafood chow mein (so-so), the Kung pow chicken (the best dish of the night!), Mongolian beef (very good as well!), and the Chinese broccoli (lacking in oyster sauce but still good). The prices were what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant (overall we paid about $90 for five family style dishes). And the decor was nice! :) I would definitely come back~
