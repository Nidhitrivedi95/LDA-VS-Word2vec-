XPtDU14nu36LWt7_UagI9Q Questionable area of the city in a dumpy strip plaza?  Check.  Outdated, '80s donut joint feel?  Check.  Dim sum from the freezer?  NO!

It's true that there's no "dim sum" experience, re:  no carts, no cart pushers who call out their offerings in Cantonese, no hustle or bustle.  However, the price reflects this - there is no tax/tips.  The max. price that I saw for a dish was $2.50, so it's really reasonable.

I don't like dim sum carts 'cause I KNOW that things on there aren't necessarily fresh and re-steamed, re-fried, and re-heated in some other way.  So I actually prefer the ordering sheet method, especially for places with less turnover. 

They also sell freshly baked Chinese buns that are ~$0.65.  I knew they were fresh 'cause there was condensation inside of the clear baggie.

Based on the atmosphere, I expected re-heated pre-frozen dishes, but instead they were all made in-house.  The Chinese meatballs had a softer texture, the ha gow wrapping was more supple, and the shrimp stuffing wasn't as tough/tight.  So I was pretty impressed with the quality of food at this place.

Would I piss here?  Not unless I was desperate!

Update:  My mom said she had diarrhea after eating here.  I was ok though.
