x8O-Mll5ksDpeIgtA0XY-w Pretty good food selection - most food was very fresh, because they are very busy and have fast turnaround.  The sushi is meh, nothing special, no sashimi.

They make you pay at the door when you walk in - price is with drink included, tip at that time or at table after dining.

VERY BUSY when I went around Sunday brunch
