One guy got the small chicken fried rice and said it was a good deal. Another person got the large lo mien and had enough leftover for her packed lunches for the next few days. I have to give it to them, the quantity of some of their dishes is large. 

However, the quality is seriously lacking. I got the dumplings and pork bun. They said the dumplings were homemade on the menu, so I was pretty excited about them, but I've definitely had better; the dumpling skin on some of them was a bit dry and tough. 

Have you ever wished you could go into the kitchen of a restaurant and help them make the dish better? That's how I felt about the pork bun. It looked like they had all the ingredients needed to make a good pork bun, but what they served was an oily mess. I could only eat about a third of it before I had to stop because it was too bland to justify slurping down that much oil. I think this meal goes down in my books as the worst Chinese food I've ever had at a restaurant.
