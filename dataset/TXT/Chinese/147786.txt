sDQDMrb5xez4aASZ8U5qTg I can't compare to the one in Hong Kong because I've never been there but it's not like I've never had tofu before in my life. Tofu fa is probably my favorite Chinese dessert and it's hard to find them freshly-made. 

They have a lot of dessert options if you don't like tofu fa but the whole point of coming here is to have some! I ordered the cold almond tofu fa; only problem was it wasn't cold but rather room temperature. I had high expectations since I was looking forward to something like the packaged ones I usually ate but I was disappointed after the first bite. The texture of it was fluffy and soft, like if you cut the layers in half, little pieces will fall out. I wouldn't say it was smooth or anything because it immediately disintegrates once it goes in your mouth. There was also not a strong almond taste, so you probably would've never guessed it was almond tofu if I asked for a random tofu dessert. 

It was hard to try to finish the whole thing because the syrup was so sweet and overwhelming, plus I'm not very used to eating room-temperature desserts. Very fast service and cheap but I'll just buy a box of Dofu Delight instead.
