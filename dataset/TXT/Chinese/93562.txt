J2LJ1IuLOj_BYyP8lUa7iA Las Vegas Chinatown is unique.  Driving is a better option than walking because the plazas are not too close to each other compared to other Chinatowns in the US.

There are several plazas there:
- Chinatown Plaza: the most popular and probably the OG.  It has 99 Ranch supermarket, ginseng store, reflexology, travel center and restaurants.  
- Pacific Asian Plaza: Shun Fat supermarket is the anchor of this plaza.
- Great China Plaza.
- The Center at Spring Mountain.
- Tokyo Plaza:  Raku and Monta are here since they are Japanese =P

I go to Las Vegas Chinatown when I get tired of eating buffets.  You can get Chinese, Malaysian, Filipino, Vietnamese and even Japanese foods @ Chinatown.  Craving boba?  Chinatown has Volcano Tea and #1 Boba Tea.

Too bad they don't have slot machines here.  It would be cool to eat dim sum while playing slot =P
