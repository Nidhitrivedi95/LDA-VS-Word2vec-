pJKb6w6pcC0Ds4r_Pznjeg I would give zero stars, but that wasn't an option. We have ordered delivery countless times, mainly because this is the only place that will deliver to our house. Tonight I attempted to order a dinner combo, but asked that the chicken and rice be placed in separate containers. I offered to pay for the extra container. I was refused by 2 different girls, then was told the manager is conveniently not in this evening. I made it clear I wasn't asking for anything free or for more food, just 2 separate containers. I am literally dumbfounded that my request was denied. Will never order from this place again.
