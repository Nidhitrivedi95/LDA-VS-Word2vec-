OaHJvi10dJbMIaQXg5e2Ag Authentic, genuine pho to wash away my tears after being at the Browns gut wrenching loss on the blocked FG turned into touchdown - with no time. So after a night of drunken debauchery we came here.  I live in NJ - and came out for the MNF game ( don't ask me why) and this pho made up for years of pain and suffering as a Browns fan ( well atleast for a few minutes). Great, attentive service - fresh hot food, and you can tell it's the real deal. In Nj there's a ton of Vietnamese places and pho, and they're good - but they're a chain and this place has some kicking real good pho.  Come here, especially if you're a Browns fan.  It will stop some tears from rolling down your cheeks.
