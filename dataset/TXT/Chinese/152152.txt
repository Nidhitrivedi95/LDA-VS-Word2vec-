t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA 4 1/2 stars for food.   Not sure how to rate the atmosphere.  Unusual setting.  Lots of tables with lazy-Susan's to seat up to ten people. Very basic set up.  If ambiance isn 't a must for you, then definitely try the place for the food.  You write down your order at your table and take it to the counter to order and pay.  They bring plates, napkins and chopsticks to your table along with your food.
They have two menus.  One is simplified--more like you see in a regular Asian restaurant, and another that is authentic and huge, with many unusual items.
The portions are very generous, and ours was delicious.  I had the chicken vegetables with chili sauce.  It was pleasantly spicy and very tasty.  My son had the fried tofu in chili sauce and my husband had cashew chicken.  They cleaned their plates.   The only dish I wasn't crazy about were the steamed dumplings.  Just so-so.
Regarding other comments about it being pricey, you have to consider this is a "no tip" place.  The price of each dish is approx equivalent to what you would pay elsewhere with a tip.
We don't live in Champaign, but we 'll stop in again as we pass through town.
