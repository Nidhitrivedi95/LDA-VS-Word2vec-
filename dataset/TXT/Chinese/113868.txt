mRubgo8WfjraJkE5Bvbf6w We like the strong Vietnamese coffee. It's a bit creamy, but pretty good. 

I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the portions are much smaller and pricier for fast food, but I guess we all need to eat a little less to trim down our waistline :-) Pho was okay, not that good, but most dishes are decent. Vietnamese bún noodle was not bad.
