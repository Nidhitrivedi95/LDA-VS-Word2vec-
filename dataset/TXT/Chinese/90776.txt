IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ The 2nd star is for being open so late. The food is overpriced and not good at all. Meats were fatty and too well done. The shu Mai was not edible.   To further annoy me, not only were all the BBQ meats fatty and too tough to eat, when I was starving, but I was asked when I ordered if I would like rice with it?  I assumed in typical Chinese restaurant style this meant it came with it so I said yes and was then charged $4.25 for it. 
Are you kidding me?
The shrimp dumplings were the only thing that was good. 
I would never ever again come here for this overpriced terrible food.
