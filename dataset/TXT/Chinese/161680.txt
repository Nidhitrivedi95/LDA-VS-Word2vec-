uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw If you are looking for a bowl of noodles, Magic Noodle can hook you up with some great options. They do hand pulled or knife shaved noodles in a variety of broths or sauces. The last time I was there, we snagged a table in full view of the chef pulling/shaving the noodles, so they are obviously made fresh for your order!

First step is the broth base. My personal preference is the lamb broth, it was light and flavorful without being oily or heavy. If you want something with a bit of kick, the braised beef brisket soup gives an extra bite. You can still taste the beef broth under the spice, so the balance is good.

Noodle choice is next. I like my noodles al dente so the classic noodles was perfect. They stayed chewy and consistent from the first bite to the last. If you like your noodles softer, the knife shaved noodles would be good. Due to the unique shape from the knife shaving through the dough, the noodles start on the chewier side and slowly softens further as it sits in the broth. I did try the curtain noodles, however due to their size, it was unwieldy to eat and I found myself either chewing on noodles alone or drinking soup separately. Probably not the best choice, but an interesting experience. 

Prepare to wait at peak weekend hours. It seems easier to snag tables for two people than for larger groups. The space is small and the tables are packed close together. Be prepared to overhear plenty of neighboring conversations, or have your conversations overheard by others.
