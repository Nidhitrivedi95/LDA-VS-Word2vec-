WcHMfQZzs3G5UVY_zBB2FA Small shrimp Lo Mein: tasty and flavorful. Shrimp was over cooked. Beef with Beef W. Broccoli combo, I didn't want fried rice so this is not how the combo comes: carrots were my only issue (it was dry no flavor). It was still yummy, a little on the sweeter side. Would definitely come back.
