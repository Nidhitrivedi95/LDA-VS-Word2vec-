R__NLOqjUlw8qf12KD-I5A When I saw the reviews on Ding Dong Pastries I had to go check it out. It far exceeded my expectations! Lots of variety of pastries and for confusingly cheap prices. 

All buns are indeed 6 for $3 (no tax), I ended up buying 12 of them. Large swiss roll cakes are approx. $2 each. Steamed pork buns are 3 for $2. The steamed pork buns were well seasoned and contained a generous portion of pork. Egg tarts are 3 for $1. The egg tart filling was not firm enough for my taste but the shell was deliciously crispy. 

I visited at 11 a.m. and the place was very well stocked :) If I lived in the area I would never want to cook again.
