Mom-in-law wanted to go here because her friend highly recommended it to her.  What a mistake that was.

For a Wednesday night, this place was strangely deserted when we arrived around 8:30pm.  If one was looking for a good telltale of a bad restaurant, It was hard to beat an emptied parking lot with only two cars.
  
The dinner menu was way over priced for just about every dish listed--it was probably the most expensive menu I had seen for a chinese restaurant.  We, a group of 3, settled for a dinner combo consisted of 4 course meal; and the bill came out to be $146.90 Can.  Every dish portion was small and was probably not enough for 1 person.  I left there with my stomach half filled and ended up eating instant noodle later on that night.  What a waste of money!  I could get better satisfaction by thowing my money at a fish pond.

The place was nice and fancy, but the decor is somewhat weird--English scene painting from the imperialist period.  I would not be surprised that they were all made in China.  The food was nothing to brag about, but the presentation is fancy.  So, if you want to feel important and only care about anything else but foods; this place is for you.  

Toronto has many many great chinese restaurants serving Cantonese cuisine, but this one ISN'T it.  Don't be fooled by the fake rating it has, and I don't care for the association it tried to show with Lee Kum Kee
