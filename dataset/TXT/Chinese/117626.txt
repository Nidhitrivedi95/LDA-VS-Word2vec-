NFOj3uboFzeNF5X-dWUd_w I ate here with a co- worker.  The place has nice decor, but it was empty.  For an appetizer we ordered honey glazed spare ribs.  They were awful.  Very tough meat, cold temp.  Just bad.  For entrees, we chose the green pepper steak and generals chicken.  Surprisingly, both were really good.  The service was also very good and attentive.
