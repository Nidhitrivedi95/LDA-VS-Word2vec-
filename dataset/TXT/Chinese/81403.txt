Everyone just has to wait in line and stare at the cashier as she continuously takes the call. Phone has priority over customers in store.  

Then when your to-go order is up, make sure you go through whatever bag is placed on the counter. See, they don't call it out. It just sits on the counter and you have to guess if it's yours. 

Then when you go to eat you chicken noodle soup, be sure to bring a bag of cooked vegetables and chicken to add to it. Because you'll realize they should call it noodle in chicken broth soup. One small piece of chicken in a bunch of noodles, no vegetables. I get it! It's called Noodle&Company. I see a lot of noodles and a company that has some growing up to do.
