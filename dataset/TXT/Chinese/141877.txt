Rh2smrKvcamnP8VBUgMI0Q My family and I have been coming here for over 10 years! The staff greet my grandparents by name and are always very welcoming towards older generations and older, Chinese 'regulars'. However, I believe stronger efforts can be made in being more inviting and amiable to many of the young adults, university students, and working professionals that make up a decent portion of their guests.

Each time I go, I see a diverse crowd of patrons. For the most part, the servers are fairly open to showing and explaining the dishes to you if you aren't familiar, or if you're 'non-asian'. 

Food-wise, this is probably one of the best places in downtown Toronto to eat dim sum. Every time I go, I can NEVER go without ordering their pork sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves, fried turnip cakes, and soft tofu in sugar water. These are to die for! Highly recommended!

Overall, this is a wonderful place to go with big families, a large group of friends, or just by yourself. The noise level is fairly high, but there is lots of space. I never feel overcrowded or packed. Their prices are very fair and reasonable.
