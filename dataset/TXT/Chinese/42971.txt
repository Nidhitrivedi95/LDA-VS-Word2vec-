beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw We do hot pot at home, but not so much in restaurants.  So, we weren't really sure what to expect.  This place is new and had lots of positive reviews, but I can't say that I'm a fan of this place...  Fellow Yelpers have disappointed on this one, which makes me wonder if all the reviews are real.

Everything here adds an extra costs to your meal.  Soup base = minimum $4.  Want noodles in your soup?  Another $3-4.  Meat?  Anywhere from $5 and up.  Each little plate that rotates around = additional cost (from $1-4).  Some plates are reasonable, but others are just ridiculous.  I think we paid like $3 for a couple pieces of lettuce, because it's considered a "daily special".  Perhaps there's some better way of ordering, but it was not explained to us very well.  For two people (that just drank water), the bill ended up over $50 for some noodle soup that wasn't impressive at all.

Service for us wasn't too great either.  Seats were available, but the hostess told us to sit in the corner only to come over less than a minute later and tell us our seats were ready.  We weren't given a menu, but there was one nearby.  Turns out, it was originally given to the people next to us.  But, the hostess pointed out for us to use it when we were sat down.  We ordered noodles, but those didn't come until long after we started.  And, I paid the tab with a $100 bill and the women who took the money asked if I needed change...  Really?  I'm not poor, but I'm not wealthy enough to be tipping the same amount as my bill.  Especially when I'm cooking my own food.
