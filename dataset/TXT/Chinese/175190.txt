WghhtS-tqDWMh_W2O13CYA My mom and I stopped in here because of her past experience of P.E. at a Texas location.  The prices are ok but the chicken was entirely overcooked.  You couldn't tell the difference between the beef and chicken, they looked so alike.  The staff was stepping all over each other.  We got there for lunch around 12:30am and they were already out of plates.  There was so much repetitive yelling for missing food to the chef.  We saw food displays for food that wasn't even cooked yet.  The poor lady in front of us had to literally wait 15 minutes to get her refund for her over cooked food because her kids didn't like it.  It was all over the place.  I've worked food retail and know how crazy the lunch rush can be but c'mon.  At least the shrimp was cooked fine.
