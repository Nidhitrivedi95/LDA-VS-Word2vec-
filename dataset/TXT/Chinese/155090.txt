THsmhy9NXI6WOEhVnrv01A My friend and I wanted Chinese food but was looking for something fast n good, so our friend recommend King Wah Express to us.  This place is kind of hidden behind Sonics on 43rd ave new Northern, we ordered the orange chicken, Kung pao beef, crab puffs, and house fried rice, oh man the food was amazing and their is so affordable our total bill was under $20.  We are definitely going back with some friends.  If you're look for reasonable and great Chinese food, I would suggest that you try this place.  They have sit down, take out, and delivery too.  Very friendly people!
