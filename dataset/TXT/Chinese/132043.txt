PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ This absolutely is one of my favorite places!! All you can eat place..and I love unlimited crab legs on the spicy boiling soup!! They have all different kind of options, non-spicy soups as well.   You have to try the lamb skewers that come with them as well, it's amazing if you like lamb.  Desserts are included.  The service is amazing.  My wife Michelle and I go there all the time, and any friends we have taken there, they all loved the place.  Especially when it's nice and chilly  outside, that's what I crave.
