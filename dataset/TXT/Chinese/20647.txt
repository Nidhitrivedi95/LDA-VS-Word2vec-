6_KCUxu2kOgP-pRnSNXG8Q I'd recommend this place to anyone. Food is as good as places you would find in any chinatown and I've visited many. Maybe its because stuff taste better after you've lost all your money but I always look forward to eating here when I'm at the Palace Station.My girlfriend likes it and she doesn't even like chinese food. But be forewarned, this is an authentic chinese restaurant so don't expect nice uniforms or even english speaking employees. I once seen a guy, must have been the cook, walk out the back and sit at one of the tables workin a toothpick in his mouth. WTF!?!? Like I say, its a chinese restaurant. You go here for the food and that's all.
