AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw Came here one day on the weekend and it was packed! Luckily we were able to get a spot pretty quick. Typical HK style restaurant and good for its cheap eats! I had the Portuguese chicken with pasta and my bf had the curry chicken with rice. They provide free soup and free drink including tea and coffee depending what dish you order. Food quality is alrite, not the greatest but you don't really expect much in a HK food type restaurant. I would go back here on occasion when I'm feeling for a nice cheap eat lunch! Service is alright I can see how hard the servers work. I think it would help if they have more staff.
