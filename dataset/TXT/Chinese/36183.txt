Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Big, new and shiny, always a bonus, and we had great service. Based on my husband's expression, I would say his Frik En Good roll was the best dish we had, but I actually didn't taste that. I had XO string beans, miso soup and an avocado/mango roll, which is a nice option for the vegetarians out there! The miso soup was a generous bowl, but I did not love the XO string beans. They are made with long beans, not regular green beans, and as a result were thin and a bit tough. The sauce had a nice flavor, but wasn't particularly spicy. It wasn't expensive for a casino property, but I feel that the prices adequately reflected the value. For a quick fix of Chinese at an MGM property, I think there are other options that might be worth an extra buck or two. However, they can definitely accommodate a large group!
