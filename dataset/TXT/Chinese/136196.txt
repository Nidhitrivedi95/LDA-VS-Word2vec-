Qe8vFq-3HMld-ymBQLDnpg Terrible. Reached out to them because I had an issue on Facebook. They said they would and never got back to me. The food took 15 min to my door step. I live 10 min away ???! Ummmmm sounds fishy to me. The noodles were doughy and no flavor at all. Chicken balls were dry and re fried.
