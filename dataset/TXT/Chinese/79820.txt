gMJRFH_zFh_UrQeU5KHvng If I could give this place no stars I would....okay so the guy in the front of the restaurant is nice but I'm convinced he has to be to make up for the horror that is the food.  My daughter and I was looking for a chinese food place and this was the first I saw and it looked okay, but yes it was deserted and that should have been a clue.  Anyhoo I ordered a few things because i like variety and everything was bland.  No I take that back the potstickers were okay because they were covered in some kind of sauce.  But the eggs rolls were mostly roll...i mean wtf!!! it was a vegi eggroll and hardly no vegi's.  The food was BAD I didnt like anything.  I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN....I feel like I got robbed.  You know it's bad when after you spend your hard earned money you want to throw away the leftovers just so you dont have to be reminded that you were stupid enough to buy nasty food.  I wouldnt eat here again if:

1. They were giving food away
2. I was starving I only had 6 bucks and this was the closet place...
3. Wait there are so many I could keep going forever.....just save your money and dont eat here.  yuk
