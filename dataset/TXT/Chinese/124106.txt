oplwp3MumIb_dJI9fmKbSw This place is clean, roomy, nice atmosphere and a GREAT price! They have the typical food you find in buffets but they taste great and they are fresh. I love they have egg foo young which is hard to find.  Their wait staff is very nice and they keep it clean.  You can get your own drinks which I love because it get annoying when you are waiting for a refill.  They got great coconut shrimp, ribs, soups, noodles. I actually drive out there for this place. I never have gone on a Sunday and do not know if the menu changes since the price is not 6.99. But every other day it is 6.99 great price for good chinese food, especially when you are craving it! You can feed the whole family without going broke! I recommend it!
