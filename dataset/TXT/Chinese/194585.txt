Late on a weekday afternoon I sampled from the dinner menu. I tried the hot and sour soup. Most of the hot seasoning was on one side of the bowl. I had to finish mixing it up.

The pot stickers were not inspired either: tough and overdone.

The atmosphere was comfortable: dark and good for conversation. The service was excellent.

House of Hunan left me longing for the Chinese restaurants of Northern California.
