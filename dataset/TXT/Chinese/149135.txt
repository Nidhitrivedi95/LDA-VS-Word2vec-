sOaeX1zQWuqbPcclvjtdeA Mediocre food served with dangerously high sodium and carb counts.  There is a nutrition count menu posted online.  The only question to be asked is why anyone would risk life by eating the food?  In some cases the sodium count is 2-3 times the DAILY recommended limit.  My lunch group lunched there today and I found the only items which had reasonable counts.  The portion was minuscule and not good.  That's how the count came in low.
Why risk your life eating here?  It's like suicide by sodium!
