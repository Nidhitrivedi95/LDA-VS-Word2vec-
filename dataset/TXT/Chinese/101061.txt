K4-J1A_ZIzG2yNkee0KOaA I came here because the pho restaurant in the same plaza shut down.  I was craving for a hot noodle soup on a frigid cold day like today.  I saw this place I thought I would give it a try.
The service was really good as the wait staff was really polite and quick. A+ for that!
Like I said I wanted a hot bowl of noodle soup so I ordered the beef tendon with rice noodle soup and a plate of cold appys that consists of beef, squid and pork.  The beef tendon was actually really tasty and cooked long enough as it was really soft.  However I didn't like some of the briskets because they were too fatty.  The broth was also not hot enough...not to my liking anyway.  The cold appys was on par and very good.  I was full after eating that for lunch.  
With the combination of very good service and mediocre food.  I can only give it a 3 star.  I'll have to go back again and try out their other stuff.
