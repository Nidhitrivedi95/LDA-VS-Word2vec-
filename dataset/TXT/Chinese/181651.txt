xEIqG7Rq8ydAT9LxCVBOOg I really enjoy this location and everyone is always very friendly, especially the bartender. However, I was not as impressed tonight (Labor Day 2016) because the male host did not seem very friendly. I work in restaurants and he just didn't have good customer service for what I am used to here. I would still recommend though because I think (I hope) maybe it was just an off night for him.
