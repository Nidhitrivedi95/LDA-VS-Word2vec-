X3ixtoD0xjiVtxROlU_2wg I walked into this place all sore and aches and walked out like a jello - no aches and very relaxed!
The place itself was quiet and very suitable for a nice relaxing massage. They offer body massages, foot massages, and couple's massage. The place is fairly new so if it's your first time, they give you a 5$-10$ coupon for your next visit which is a pretty good deal. 
I went and got the combination massage which was foot massage and body massage. Felt so great after. I was in a room with a great atmosphere. Not too loud or lit. Just enough to make you fall asleep as soon as they start the massage. Haha. 
The lady (forgot her name) that did my massage was very efficient. She has hands like magic. My whole body was like a bubble wrap that just kept on popping as soon as her hands stroke it. I felt so relieved. And she didn't stop til she got rid of my knots. With all that's going on, she kept on asking me if the pressure was enough. Everything was perfect. I will definitely come back here more often. Can't wait to use my coupon.
