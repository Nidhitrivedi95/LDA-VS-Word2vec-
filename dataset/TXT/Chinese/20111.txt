5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ My hun and I have been craving normal unfusioned Asian foods and so we were happy when we found Dragon Noodle Co., in our hotel. We perused the menu and experienced sticker shock at how pricey everything was, especially the Chinese veggie plates! Of course, we know it's Vegas and so  paying a high price for mediocre to bad food is more the norm than the exception.

We were seated as soon as we walked in and ordered the following:

Seafood Tofu soup (bland)
Chinese Broccoli with Oyseter sauce- good but a bit too greasy
Spicy Scallop Sushi- way too spicy with no Scallop in sight!
Himachi Sashimi- huge slices that was ice cold cuz it was served ON ICE

The service was efficient and polite but it definitely is pricey for ok food.
