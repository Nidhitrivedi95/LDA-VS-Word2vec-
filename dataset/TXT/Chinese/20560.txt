I was surprised by the overall high ratings from other reviewers on Yelp (even though there are just a handful of reviews) so I thought I would give it a try in hopes of finding good Chinese food that is close by.

I ordered  dinner for pick up last Friday. When I walked into the restaurant it was completely empty other than the employee behind the pick up counter. He seemed caught off guard by the arrival of a customer as he was drinking out of a bowl when I walked in.  The food was ready and the employee was friendly overall. As I was about the leave I noticed another employee in the kitchen washing her eye glasses in the sink, she made eye contact but did not greet me. No big deal.

The food, however, is not good. At all. Completely bland, with little to no flavor. Not even the taste of salty-ness one might expect from Asian food.  The hot and sour soup had no flavor whatsoever. Nor did the cashew chicken or garlic shrimp - both had a bad after taste of stale grease. The spring roll tasted awful, like it had been deep fried in oil that has never been changed. 

Needless to say, we took a few bites and couldn't finish our meal the food was that bad.

I don't often rate restaurants with one star but the food was that disappointing.
