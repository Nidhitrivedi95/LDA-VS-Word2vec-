DM8j5g9k28vEOTM0kz4KVA Typically I just get take out here and have always been satitisfied. The food has always been very good. Tonight,  I decided to dine in and it was a not a good dine in experience at all. I preface this all by saying the food was still good.  Had sesame shrimp and was very tasty.  BUT the service was awful. I came in and sat down and there was a table beside me that patrons had left with the table still dirty and for about 10 mins, no one came over to clean it. Left sitting there at that table was the bus tray right beside where I was sitting with a pile of dirty dishes. Finally someone came up to me asking if I had a to go order. I said no and would like a menu for dine in and she handed it to me and asked my drink order. Told her I wanted a beer but not sure which type yet. She said to take my time as I decided and I quickly learned the menu didn't even show the beers they offered. Knew it was not going to be a good experience when people in the corner were hollering multiple times for someone to come back to their table. I also noticed multilple employees who were clearly capable of tending to dine in patrons horsing around near the counter. There wasn't any sort of urgency or foucus on the customers. Finally the table beside me was cleaned and my order was taken but only after a lengthy wait. The resturant wasn't close to full and the whole experience took well over an hour. Again,  I will eat food from here again but only take out. This place clearly isn't equipped to handle dine in. Eat here but would recommend just take out.
