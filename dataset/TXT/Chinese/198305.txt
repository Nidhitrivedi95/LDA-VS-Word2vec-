zXJilaBN28oUdX7Owf0fRA Dropped in for lunch and was certainly not disappointed. The food was affordable and delicious. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. I got one of the combination plates and you certainly cannot beat the amount of food that you get for the price. I decided to get the General Tso's as I always like to try the basics at a new place before trying something different and it was great! It came with a choice of soup and the egg drop soup was perfect. Definitely will become a new regular spot for me!
