1DkpdmcxLCRXAdEi6TdOFw Was told by a good friend to come here for legit Asian food, and to ignore the 3.5 star rating on yelp. I was craving northern Chinese cuisine, and ordered 3 classics: eggplant/potato/pepper stir fry (too oily/saucy, as per usual in Chinese restaurants), spicy cumin lamb (great), and cold mung bean noodles (amazing sauce). Well priced too!
