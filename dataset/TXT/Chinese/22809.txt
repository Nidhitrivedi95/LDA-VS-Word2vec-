6Ps8McF6NVAw_1Y1D6S2TA Newland BBQ Square, a Northern Chinese Restaurant  having a Grand Opening Specials.  

Lunch is 50% off Noodles, Rice, Dim Sum and Appetizers... So this review written by me is naturally based on their lunch specials!!

Newland BBQ Square's Chinese name is really Newland Sea Cucumber Restaurant.  So I guess they must be specialized in sea cucumber. The menu is really interesting though with Seafood, Northern BBQ, Hot Pot, etc!

Walking in to the restaurant, I saw some water tanks that has fresh oysters, sea eels and other live seafood... but today I am going for the lunch specials!! 

Great Selections, all written in Chinese but their main menu does have English "Subtitles" you can refer to that by the corresponding numbers:

Mixed Sea Cucumber & Cucumber ($4.49)
- Really sea cucumber mixed with celery and parsley
- Sea cucumber does not look so appealing as a whole or when it is alive... 

Steamed Meat Bun ($2.99)
- The skin was a little thick...... not too much soup inside

Lan Zhou Stretched Noodle ($3.99)
- Noodles was nicely cooked with nice bite
- Soup based is clear.. not as flavoured as Vietnamese soup based, has a more tangy and spiciness to it
- Just a few piece of beef floating in this big bowl of soup with green onion, parsley and white radish as garnish.

Black Bean Sauce with Pork Noodle ($2.99)
- I don't really enjoy it as much because I found the sauce a little heavy and saucy... but some chili oil fixed that problem
- The noodle though has great bite!

I think the 50% off is great value when come during lunch. I will definitely be back for that again.

For dinner, everything is 10% off.

The decor is a little strange as this location used to be a Western Seafood restaurant. They do have 2 private room with Karaoke set up if you want to eat your sea cucumber and sing at the same time!!
