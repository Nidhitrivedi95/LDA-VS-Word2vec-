RU3PsG2y_eGBFi_8jDqyQA My first impression was good but it has been in decline over the last few visits.  Some of their dishes are good but their chow mien noodles are very bland and the fortune cookies taste like card board.  These are two very basic Chinese restaurant items that should be very good.

I will say that the service is decent when you eat in and twice they've given us free egg rolls and a Chinese donut.  I appreciate it but it doesn't sway my opinion from a 2 star.

Maybe China A Go Go is Americanized Chinese food. I lived in Asia (Singapore) for a year and traveled around SE Asia so my taste buds might have become snobbish.  LOL
