OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw This place is the spot for us every time we visit Las Vegas for Dim Sum. They have a good assortment of Dim Sum. The ladies there pushing the cart of hot food comes by often. The place is clean and customer service is good by the waiters. We always come here for our Dim Sum fix. The price is reasonable.
