OqiGriMzxocWaIJR9tic_Q Look guys, this is Cleveland. Chinese buffets are not our city's speciality. 

But if you want some fast, greasy Chinese food (let's be real, we've all been there), Mandarin will be just fine. You'll be seated within minutes and can be stuffing your face with noodles even faster. Sometimes you just crave some Chinese, and Mandarin will be waiting for you.

The space is newly renovated and looks fantastic. Inside, its absolutely huge, so you'll never wait for a seat. This buffet is broken up into a few parts: traditional buffet, sushi and stir-fry. Admittedly, I usually gravitate just to the buffet, where i'm a fan of the green beans, various noodle choices, and buttery crab dishes. On high volume nights, they'll have crab legs, oysters, and various shrimps. The buffet is super clean, and there's definitely this vibe of "no one is going to judge you for how big your plate is." So if you're out with a burly man, let him go nuts and have a Game of Thrones feast. This is also an awesome place to go with a big group-- just call ahead to let them know. 

Overall, Mandarin is a totally fine option for a Chinese buffet in the suburbs. You'll be stumped to find a better one!
