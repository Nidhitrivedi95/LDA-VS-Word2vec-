GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Literally sitting here right now waiting for take out order. They stated 15 minute wait, turned out to be a 45 minute wait. The take out order line is completely disorganized and the pick up window is completely disorganized. No separate lines so everyone just crowds around a single window. It is ridiculous.
