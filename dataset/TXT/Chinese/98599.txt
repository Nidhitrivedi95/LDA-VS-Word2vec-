JS8MpdVJ8-grSVNObYXnbA Honestly these days there's not great value out of this place.  On the weekends they break out crab legs but after tax and tip it's almost 40 bucks a person even if you don't buy drinks.  

I understand it's all you can eat but I don't know many people that can get their money's worth for this place unless you're only or mostly eating seafood.

I'd rather just order Chinese from my local place and save over 60 dollars (based on 2 people) but this place is more of a special occasion place for us.  It was a relative's birthday as it usually is when we come to this place.  We've been here a bunch of times and there are some changes that they've done lately.

They've added some raw fish to the sushi area but I noticed they don't make any actually sushi (nigiri or maki) with raw fish.  They have like 3 varieties or so of raw fish (red tuna, salmon, white tuna) to the side.  I tried the red tuna and the salmon and they didn't taste that great and/or they didn't seem very chilled.  Health hazard?  Maybe some of the hot food on my plate warmed it up a bit but it just wasn't as good.  I've had sashimi at all you can eat buffets in Miami and it's night and day.

These days a weekend cost if you don't eat seafood is NOT worth it IMO.  40 dollars after tax and tip is a lot for Chinese food considering you can get a lot of Chinese food for well under 30 dollars to feed more than 3 people and this place is much more for just one person.

I didn't see too many dishes empty so they do fill them up fast, even the crab which I had none of and they do have a decent variety of food but it's not worth 40 dollars per person during the weekends (busy time).
