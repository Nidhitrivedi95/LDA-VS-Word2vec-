I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Wow were my tastebuds impressed! Fantastic little hole in the wall dessert place. I can't believe I drove by on Camelback all these years and never tried Snoh! Had the honeydew ice with caramel and mochi...wow. So refreshing! Save your money from Creamistry and just come here instead. Really pleased with my dessert and can't wait to get back. I joked about how large the serving cups are - now I know to at least get the regular size next time, the small goes too fast. Highly recommend!
