GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Great place for the indecisive. Mexican and Chinese food...NOT FUSION! 

Our server, Kate, was FANTASTIC. Prompt, full of good recommendations, and with a hard-to-find sense of timing as to when we needed her. Can't say enough good things. I have no clue why so many reviews say bad service

Also, if you have an allergy, like at all the José Andrés restaurants, they have a special menu for you! I recommend trying something Mexican and something Chinese. The Dan Dan Mian is not spicy (tastes like Korean Barbecue) but amazingly delicious. The Beijing Glass is fresh and a lighter, healthy fare. The swordfish ceviche is to die for, as well as the Oaxacan BBQ Taco (the cactus tastes like a more earthy and mild version of a pickle).
