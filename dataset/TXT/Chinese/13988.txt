31mm5EtlmT4557BTYAFOrA Entering an empty restaurant fills me with trepidation, but as it turns out, this is a relatively new restaurant that I hope will stay in business. The waitress is super sweet, the flavors are on point, and the prices are inexpensive. 

- the veggie dumplings were great. Getting them pan fried means they come out with an awesome golden, perfectly crispy, unbroken crust. 

- the pork loin clay pot is actually more like a bim bim bop than the usually saucy stew common at Chinese restaurants. The pot comes out hot, with the rice crisping underneath the fried pork strips, carrot, cucumber, and black fungus. Loved the flavor of this one! I think the rice is cooked with meat stock and garlic flakes. 

- the seaweed cold dish is massive - an entire dinner plate! 

- the food comes with a millet porridge, which my parents loved. When my mother expressed how much she likes it and asked how it was made, the waitress launched into a long explanation  that they only use a certain kind of millet imported from China (after trying every other millet they could find), where to buy it, how much it cost, what the bag looks like, and how to cook it. Then she gave us a container to take home. 

Easily my new favorite Chinese place in Vegas!
