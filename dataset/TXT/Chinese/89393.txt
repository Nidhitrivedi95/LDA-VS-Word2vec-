I6oxEn1HT41S2GPrDKPPvA Been coming to this place for years. It's cheap dim sum, and for the price, it's pretty good. They have quite a variety but only serve everything when it's busy (ie. Saturday mornings)- otherwise they serve limited types of dishes. Service varies depending on your server or cart lady. They aren't always friendly but if you don't mind that, it's a good place to come for cheap food.
