kpxUsRQ7i65ipQ4wLeZKeQ It's not so obvious to find a place for a proper meal in less than an hour downtown montreal before a concert at night! We did some walking on the weekend to identify which places could fit the bill and double-checked on Yelp to confirm and eliminate some options. This place did came as our selected choice being less than two blocks from the Bell Centre (where The Who were playing) and being a buffet, we can time our service ourselves. There were 4 of us and we arrived gradually over a 20 minutes period but the buffet concept did enable us all to eat at our pace.

With a good selection of soup, appetizers (including some sushi), entrees and desert, it was exactly what we wanted. All in all a good choice for those kind of situations!
