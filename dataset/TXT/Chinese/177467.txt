wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA This place had a major makeover and now is one of the first to offer skewers and tapas in an all-you-can-eat menu. Really great concept! 

I really enjoyed getting to try all types of skewers, soups, rice, and other small plates. On this occasion we tried tongue, calamari steaks, scallops, bacon wrapped asparagus, along with their Thai, Korean, and Japanese chicken wings.   All were good, but tongue was a little tough and chewy. 

Some of my top favorites was their squid ink rice, crab rice, calamari, uni ramen, and in first place, their uni soft scramble egg toast, super delicious!

Another unique item is their 3 foot meat tower for an additional $4 per person.  We didn't try this on this occasion as it seemed to be too much for 2 people but will next time with friends. 

The concept definitely needs some fine tuning though.  So they give you a check mark list where you make your selections and hand it over to your server.  This is great however we didn't get a good amount of our items we ordered.  I heard the same thing happening with other tables also so it is definitely a problem.  Since there is no suggestion box anywhere, I will use this platform in hopes they read yelp reviews.  Perhaps having a list that has a carbon copy so one goes to the kitchen and one stays with the table and then as the server delivers the items they can cross them off both lists, this in my opinion would make for a much more smoother dining experience and then my 4 stars could turn into more of a 5 star review. 

Again great concept, nice atmosphere and will definitely come back.
