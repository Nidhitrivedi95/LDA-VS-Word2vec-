WBlYp-nmLiBLp7VjP1FJFg I'm here with a bus tour and thought 'oh a las vegas buffet sounds good.' Then we got here and were the first ones here and was seriously disappointed!! 
1. No labels for food
2. Not much variety
3. Watered down soup
4. Watered down lemonade 
5. Had to get our own drinks (why pay $10+$5 tip if were not being waited on?) 
6. Tofu was flavorless
7. Grab your own napkins and forks

Very disappointing! Save your money and eat at the other satisfying nearby restaurants
