AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw 100th review!! 
I have some special memories with this place :')

LOVE this place for two reasons, the fried chicken + 1 jug of drink special, and the big tvs and small crowd during the NBA season. 

The special is well worth the money, feeds 2 super hungry adults, or 3 hungry adults. It comes with a jug of cold beverage and it seems like we can never finish it (unless its beer)!

If you come during the first quarter of a raptors game, theres a good chance that the restaurant isn't filled up. Love their big screens as well.

Don't expect superb service. And I've never tried other things on the menu yet. But it's a nice and clean asian cafe with parking right outside.
