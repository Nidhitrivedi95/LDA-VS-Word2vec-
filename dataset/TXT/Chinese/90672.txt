iiEjVLb4JDLE2xl8YGR-Gw If you don't speak/understand Chinese, this is NOT a restaurant for you. Period. We should have taken the advice of earlier reviewers who reiterated this issue. Seems like new management has huge problem with clients speaking English language.

The menu has English as well as Chinese descriptions. We ordered by pointing exactly at menu  with English & corresponding Chinese dish, and reconfirmed. Still, the server made multiple mistakes during ordering. Even equipped with her Google translator, the server kept on fumbling...For example: The vegetarian dish contained pork/beef pieces even thought the party ordered from "Vegetarian section" with just Tofu. While serving, the waiter mixed the dishes (the server had no idea what the dish is, so just put random dishes at random places for us to figure out). The food itself was very oily. Some dishes showed good quantity, but later realized that those were padded up by bunch of chewy/dried red-peppers. Looks like they want to be true with their name : "Chili King". The Lunch menu runs from $10.99 all the way to around $29.99. At that price, any other Chinese takeaway can beat this on quality/quantity and especially on service.

And surprisingly after all this multiple goof-ups, the server expected (huge) tip! We include the tip in CC payment, still the lady asked cash. (Yes, waiter can speak "cash/money" in English!).
