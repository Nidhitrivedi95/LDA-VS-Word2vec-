1CeWMRJwyFkQ-fc3MR1Dmg I've been to a few different congee queen and this is probably the worst one. First we went on a regular sunday evening and it was overly crowded. In the entrance, there were lots people standing there waiting for tables. In my opinion, this kind of food is NOT worth to line up for. 

Second, we ordered around 8 dishes, include Cantonese chow mien, stir fried veggies, onion with beef etc, they all overly sauced and the sauce was so thick with no  flavor except the cornstarch they use to thicken the sauce. 

I remember ordering the same dishes in other congee queen location and they tasted better. I would NOT want to go back this place for sure.
