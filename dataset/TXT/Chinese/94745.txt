jfK-_0x_r7Qgdg2wj60iAQ Picked up take out - big mistake! I could see in the kitchen and there was a large bin of pre-cooked chicken sitting unattended on a chair. I ordered Chicken Lo Mein. I was given my order and she said "chicken fried rice". I said no, I ordered Lo Mein. "Yes" she said, "it's Lo Mein". I take it to my destination. Not Lo Mein - it was fried rice covered w vegetables and sauce. Hungry, figured I would try it. The rice was beyond dry and the veggies literally had NO taste. The egg roll I did not order was even worse! I will never go here again, especially with places like Dragon Garden and Frankie's Wok close by. Huge disappointment. Glad I didn't get sick!
