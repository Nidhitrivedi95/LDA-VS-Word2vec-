VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA Great food in a neat location. I got the mix of the buns and each of them was amazing. The noodles are made fresh and the noodle bowl was huge! It's a bit pricy but you get a lot of food. The guy taking my order reminded me of an Asian version of my grandpa and he was sure to check on my satisfaction. It was adorable. I would come back here for dinner but there was too much food for me for lunch.
