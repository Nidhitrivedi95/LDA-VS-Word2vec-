They fixed any issues with their rice, but the Crispy Orange Beef was tough and flavorless, the Mongolian Beef was so salty I practically had to give myself dialysis.  

The service is pleasant and attentive, but there is a LOT of room for improvement  in quality and consistency with the food.  Their one saving grace was the Szechuan Green Bean entree with shrimp and tofu.  This dish will likely be the only thing I order there again, until I see proof that things have improved.
