DiCWSyoaBkIpOVUdIO7Jlg I have never set food in the restaurant but this is my location for delivery. First off, get their General's chicken. The picky preschooler loves it and she hated everything. 

Egg rolls are good as well as their super strong Thai iced tea. It's not as sweet as others, but I still like it. Fried rice, you will receive pounds of it. They don't skimp on rice.

Delivery is slow and can take up to an hour to hour and a half but the food is good. Just don't order hungry or you'll be on a hunger rampage by the time it gets there.
