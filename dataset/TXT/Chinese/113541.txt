MpT8KheTjs7TSDWIoMUFxg As a Las Vegas regular, my family and I have made it somewhat of a tradition to eat at China AAA.  It's not necessarily what you would call a classy restaurant; however, its the PERFECT place to eat if you want an authentic Chinese meal for an unbeatable price. They have a large variety of plates with excellent lunch specials for everyone. This restaurant has it all; fresh food, great service and generous portions at an awesome price. If you like Chinese food you HAVE to try it.  :D
