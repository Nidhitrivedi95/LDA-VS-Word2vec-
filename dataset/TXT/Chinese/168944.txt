Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA The best Thai and pho I've tried. We ordered the shrimp Panang curry, pineapple fried rice, pad Thai, pho, wonton soup and each order was  amazingly delicious. An explosion of flavours! Careful with the spicy levels. I eat Habaneros like candy and considered a number 5 to be  mild. The service was great! The owner was super friendly. Wish this place was in Los Angeles.
