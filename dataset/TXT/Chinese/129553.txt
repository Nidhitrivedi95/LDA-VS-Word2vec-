 The service was pretty awkward; we apparently came in during a shift change and it wasn't handled very well. 

 My biggest gripe is the sashimi served in incredibly tiny cuts at one piece per oder. It was the least impressive thing that we ate. I actually wondered if it was a mistake and the waiter was of little help, so I'm still not certain. I wouldn't mind the prices they charge for it if the portions were better or the quality was better.

 I'll eat here again, but I won't order the sushi or sashimi next time and I'll make sure that there isn't a shift change happening.
