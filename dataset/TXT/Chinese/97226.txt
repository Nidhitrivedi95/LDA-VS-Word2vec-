JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw A must try one of a kind noodles.  We got the hand-pulled Pork Belly noodle, the knife-shaved Shàng Beef Noodle and chicken mushroom rice.  I prefer the Shàng Beef, my boyfriend agrees as well. In terms of variety/ingredients, other places has more. Still tho, the noodle was very unique and the sauce for the chicken mushroom was delicious!
