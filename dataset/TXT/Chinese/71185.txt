fBmyj1okdO1p-GUzfQQohg Mediocre, but not bad and didn't make us sick.  I had crab puffs and sizzling rice soup, which were both okay.  Crab puffs were nice and crispy, they gave us a ton of them, but they were a little on the sweet side.  Sizzling rice soup had good broth and good rice, but almost nothing else - few veggies and only 3 piece of meat.  BF had dumplings and moo shu pork.  The dumplings were standard - pan fried with an odd dipping sauce.  Moo shu was 90% cabbage.  Anywhere you get moo shu, there are a lot of veggies, but this was seriously just cabbage.  A few babboo shoots here and there, very skimpy on the pork.  The flavor was okay, though.

To sum up:  Go there if you're in the mood for a quick and decent meal, but don't expect to be amazed.
