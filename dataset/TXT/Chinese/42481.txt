bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg In a word...perfect! We had originally booked a week ago, but Open Table screwed up and failed to notice that the restaurant was closed. Grit & Grace was super apologetic (even though it wasn't their fault) and treated us very well. The decor is a big improvement from Taste of Dahntahn, which used to be in this space, and so is the food and service. The Dim Sum Girl (that's how she introduced herself) brought us some amazing appetizers. I particularly like the Crispy Brussels Sprouts. The Corned Duck Breast with rye noodles and pickled daikon had a rich soy-flavored broth. The desserts (not on the website) were unique. I had Coffee Mochi with chocolate, lemongrass cream, chocolate and crumbled Froot Loops.  We will be going back. One caution: this place is noisy!
