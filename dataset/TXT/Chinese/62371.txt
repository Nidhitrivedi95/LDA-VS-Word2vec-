DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA Ugh, should have checked Yelp before I came here, what was I thinking?! I'm going to keep it short and say that this restaurant is definitely not worth coming to. For starters, its not the most sanitary place. Sanitation is something I take very seriously in the food industry. The plates and cups still had food articles on it after sitting down and looking at my plates & utensils. 

Secondly, the food here was NOT GOOD. There is no other way to put it. Everything had way too much salt on it causing it to have no flavor.
