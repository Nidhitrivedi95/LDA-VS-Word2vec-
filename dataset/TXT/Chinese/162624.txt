uNjoyF_qlLqOSEEYVpTkLg Went on a Saturday in November, 2013 for Dim Sum.

Place was full, which is always a good sign, and the food was pretty good.

Because it's a seafood restaurant we found the various seafood Dim Sum dishes were the freshest and the best.  Har Gow, Curried Cuttlefish, and Deep Fried Octopus Tentacles were all delicious and fresh.  In fact anything with shrimp in it had the sweetness of shrimp meat that only comes when its fresh and has not been frozen and defrosted.

Non-seafood things weren't as good.  The Chau Siu So (BBQ Pork Pastry as opposed to the BBQ Pork Bun) had waaaaaaay too much pastry and very little pork.  The fried dumplings had simply too much greasiness and were clearly deep fried instead of fried lightly in a wok.  In fact I don't recall ever having anything in any Chinatown Dim Sum place that was that greasy.

We will definitely return, but will stick to seafood dishes since it is obviously their strength.  The bill for 2 people was about $30 which is a pretty good price for Dim Sum.
