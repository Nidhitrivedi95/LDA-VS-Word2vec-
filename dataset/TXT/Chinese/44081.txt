BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg Great place for simple American Asian food for dine in or take out. The service is quick and pleasant and you receive a healthy portion.

My gen tso chicken combination plate came with an eggroll appetizer which was piping hot, however a tad too peppery for my taste. Was served with duck sauce. The combination platter came quickly after that, served with chicken fried rice. I asked for their "spicy" version which was a small kick for my wimpy taste buds, but if you don't eat the chili peppers you will not be wheezing in any way of form.

Perfect. The waitress was very polite and courteous anticipating needs and making sure we were happy. 

How Lee also has quick turnaround for their take out service which I believe can be delivery.
