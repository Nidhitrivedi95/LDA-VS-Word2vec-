RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ My lady friend and I were excited to try this place as some feel it is one of the best spots in the Squirrel. Unfortunately, there were very few bright spots in our meal. The prices bordered on outrageous and although the portions were adequate, the flavor of everything we ate just seemed slightly off.  The Taiwanese Chunk Chicken was texturally pleasing but after the first few bites, it tasted like the chef had used far too much fennel or anise (maybe both).  My date ordered the seafood kimchi and although the dish came with its own flaming mini-sterno, the seafood did not taste fresh and was mixed awkwardly with  bland tofu.  The server was charming to a degree but overall, we both left dissapointed with the meal, the bubble tea, and the number at the bottom of our bill.
