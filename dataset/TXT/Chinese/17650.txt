4v_RbefzvGkixXXJkn-bzw My husband and I went for dinner here Saturday night.  We got there about 730. There were plenty of tables open which is not a usually a good sign. They reopened in October after remodeling for a year.  The exact same menu from 25 years ago.  The price increases was about 25 cents to a dollar. I have always loved their food and nothing has changed about that. We had 2 orders of potstickers which I believe are the best in Cleveland.  Also ordered kungpao chicken , scallops in garlic sauce,  and pan fried noodles.  We wouldn't order the noodles again but everything else was fresh and delish. We go there anytime we have the chance. Love it.
