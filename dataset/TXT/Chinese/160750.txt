uBCRRQJ4ukFaE_UyY6T1uQ Nice atmosphere and tasty, well sized dishes all served for sharing.  The calamari salad is a great starter. Refreshing salad with some fried calamari. The duck three ways was also excellent. Great service. They kept the food flowing and we ordered the perfect amount for the three of us. Reasonably priced for the quality and casino-hotel location.
