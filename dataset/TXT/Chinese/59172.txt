DiCWSyoaBkIpOVUdIO7Jlg We have been ordering to go for a couple of years. The last 2 times they have  had problems. Yesterday we ordered 4 dishes, egg foo young and Moo Shu Chicken.
When we got the order home and opened the Moo Shu, we thought something was wrong and finally figured out that it did not include any cabbage. As we eat we discovered the Egg Foo Young was burned. Because we generally like this place, I called to let the owner know of the problem in the kitchen. She was very impolite and in effect called me a liar about the cabbage. She did offer to refund the cost of the egg foo young, but I was so upset over her attitude I declined. We will now look for another Chinese restaurant with a better attitude and customer service.
