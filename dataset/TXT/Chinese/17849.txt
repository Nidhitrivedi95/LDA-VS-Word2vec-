4XGjbI2Ggi-kdgt9eZR83w This place does some things very well but the food needs some help.  
The staff is very friendly at the greeting counter but not so much back at the cooking station.   The place is immaculately clean and the serving islands are impeccable.  High marks for this.  They have a good variety of food.   
My problems were that none of my food was hot.   Almost everything was barely warm.  The sweet/sour chicken did not taste that good and used that chicken mash for the interior instead of solid chicken.   They may have also used that elsewhere.   It is chicken with filler or something and I hate it.   I also didn't care for the Crab Rangoon.   It was ok in flavor but the consistency was different from what I am used to.  
The best dishes were the broccoli chicken-excellent flavor and tender chicken, peanut crusted chicken-really good and crunchy with great flavor,  
So all in all I was able to put together a good group of foods that were quite tasty.  I just wish it was hot.  Probably won't go back again.  I would rather spend my money on something more to my liking with even better flavor and of a higher quality.

Went back a few weeks later.   Focused upon the dishes I liked best.  They had good flavor but still not warm enough.   Not flavorful enough for my taste.   I tried an apple desert they had.  It was way undercooked.  Bottom was completely uncooked and totally dough.  Yuck.  They still get 3 stars because of the cleanliness and pleasant atmosphere with lots of room to move around.
