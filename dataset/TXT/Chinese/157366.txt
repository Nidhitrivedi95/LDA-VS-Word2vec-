TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA Cute little Chinese restaurant.  Get packed at lunch time.  Great lunch specials.  Good price for a big lunch.  When you get in its all dim and you have to get get used to the lighting.  When you open the front door to leave restaurant you get blinded by the sunlight.  Love coming back for lunch for the price.
