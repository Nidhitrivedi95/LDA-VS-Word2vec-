tUxOHYVW6e1l2frBQ7pAtA I used to eat at Congee Wong frequently but one incident completely put me off and I have not returned. 

I found 2 inch long slivers of metal in my wonton ( like ones that might come off a metal scouring pad for cleaning dishes). I was shocked and almost cracked my teeth on it before spitting it out. I took it up with the waitress and manager. I even tried to be discreet so as not to embarass them in front of their other customers. 

The waitress looked dumbfounded and thee manager said very loudly, "You found THAT in your wonton? How did that get in there!" Then began to laugh hysterically. The waitress also started to laugh. I said, "You're the manager, this is your restaurant. You tell me." She put up her arms and shrugged and walked away from me, still laughing. 

No apology, no explanation, no offer to at least replace the food or remove it from my bill. I paid, every cent and did not tip. I have never been back since and would not eat there again if it were the last restaurant left on earth. 

In a related note, if you search the health inspection website which oversees cleanliness in restaurants you will see that this Congee Wong has failed. many times, including once for failure to control rodents and having cross contamination of meat and vegetables. 

Rats in the kitchen and metal in my food. Never again.
