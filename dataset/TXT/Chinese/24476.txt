6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag Came here once before when it first opened and was craving some soup dumplings so we came back today. 

Don't be fooled by the exterior of the restaurant, the outside looks a little rough but the inside is very nice, clean, looks new and nicely decorated. The space is pretty big, good for small and large parties. Staff were very nice, food came out pretty quick, only waited quite a while for the check when they got a little busy and only a few people working. 

The changed the menu too, a lot of the same items but prettier, more pictures and nicer looking. We were seated quickly, water and tea are brought out immediately, I got the cold soy milk which tasted very good, not too sweet!

We got the juicy dumpling which we thought were soup dumplings, but there was not much soup in the dumplings, which is fair since the dumplings are described as "juicy dumplings" not "soup" dumplings. Got the Mama's special fried pork buns, these were delicious! Dough is soft and fluffy, good pork and onion stuffing, crispy fried on the bottom, a little oily but delicious anyway! 

We also tried the giant bone marrow soup, this was so good! Huge portion, big enough for up to 5 people, large bone in the middle to pic the meat off of. Soup tasted very sweet and savory, healthy but not bland. Definitely recommend trying the soup.

The pork stuffed pockets were good but a little bland, I prefer the beef rolls. Spicy wontons were good but not spicy, came in a very small bowl but contain a bunch of little wontons (very cute), topped with fried garlic and chili oil, not spicy but very good. 

I plan on coming back and trying their entrees, saw eggplant with garlic and pork belly with leeks on the menu, looked really good, will try next time!
