1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Based out of New York, this place is a nice change in pace from the Chinese restaurants you're used to. For one, the food is not drenched in oil or extremely salty... everything has a unique flavor I can't say I find in any other Chinese place. Everything is extremely reasonably priced as well! 

TO START: Get the SHRIMP WONTONS. Fried to a perfect crisp, these babies are so flavorful. I can't put my finger on it, but they are just so addicting. One order comes with 10 pieces, are a good size and comes with a light sweet n' sour sauce. Do it!

FOR HER: I swear by their HOUSE SPECIAL SHRIMP WONTON WITH NOODLE SOUP. The soup is a broth that is not too salty but so savory. Comes with thin noodles, Chinese broccoli and steamed shrimp wontons. So extremely satisfying every time! 

FOR HIM: He ordered the BEEF RAMEN WITH TENDON. The beef was so tender and was seasoned perfectly, and the soup again was not too salty but absolutely perfect. Not a fan of tendon texture, but he ate everything and said it was all so good!

TO FINISH: We tried the ALMOND PUDDING just to get a little sweet fix. A small cup portion, but it wasn't too sugary! It almost had a tinge of fruit flavor I couldn't figure it out until the end... when I found a lychee hidden inside! My favorite fruit ever, so it was the cherry on top to a great meal! :)
