1CeWMRJwyFkQ-fc3MR1Dmg The Congee Queen franchise is by far my favourite chow mien and fried rice stop in Toronto. I'm a regular here and each visit has always been consistent. Great food, great service. 

To start, this restaurant really ups its game when it comes to congee shops decor. It's fancy, it's modern, and it's clean. This is a great place to bring the whole family, they can easily accommodate tables of 2-12, no problem. 

We ordered two items. The first was the fried chilli turnip patties, this dish comes with diced chicken, shrimp, egg, and turnip patties tossed in a chilli paste. This is by far, one of their most popular dishes, it is a must try. Everyone I've introduced this to loves it. The second item was the empress fried rice, though not on its main menu, this rice comes with eel, roe and crab meat. It was very tasty, a nice blend of delicious flavours. 

Other notable items I've had in the past (not pictured) but definitely worth mentioning are: beef and vegetable chow mien, and the shredded duck with preserved cabbage super bowl vermicelli in soup. 

If you're ever in the mood for great Chinese food, stop in here, you won't be disappointed.
