Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ - I've only tried dim sum in 2 Vegas eateries.  This was better by default simply because Harbor Palace dim sum was unpalatable.
- Orchids' waiters were quick to fill our requests and the push-cart waitresses paid lots of attention to us (in some LA dim sum joints if you're not Chinese/don't speak Cantonese the push-cart folks sometimes just ignore you).
- Hopefully there's a better Vegas dim sum place I'll come across but until then this'll do.
