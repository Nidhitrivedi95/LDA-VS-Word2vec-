VbY4yD6UmA9jKKxHscrxvg I've been here a few times with my family and friends and the service has always been pretty terrible, but I return because the sushi is good and it's decently priced, but tonight was actually so bad that my family and friends and I will not be returning. Our server was extremely rude, which my friends and I tried to look over even though they dropped sushi on my friend and did not replace the roll. It was one of my friends birthday and we asked to get their usual birthday thing which is free so we could sing to her. Our server didn't even acknowledge that until we said something way after we had paid the bill. the server proceeded to say "Is it really your birthday?" To  our friend and we said yes astonished that he even said that. He said he would ask whoever in the back and comes back to tell us that they needed to see an ID from her!!! SO RUDE!! She is young she doesn't have an ID!! (We know they don't usually ask for an id bc a table near us got it without one). It was extremely rude and the fact that they treated us like that just because we were younger (18-25). I even left a tip because I felt bad for the server!! Never again will we be returning.
