gnqHyA6gY2-m9S-FKt6Xqw Cravings is the best Chinese restaurant on campus (Golden Harbor is off campus).

Hot and spicy chicken, Jakarta fried rice, Yangzhou fried rice... whatever you get off the Chinese menu... it'll all be really good.

The owners remember their regulars and are always so enthusiastic when they see you come in.

I've been here way too many times than I can count because the food is really good, the portions are huge, and the price is very reasonable!
