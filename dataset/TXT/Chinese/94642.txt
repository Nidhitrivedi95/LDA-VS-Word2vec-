JEqM8xXhKumU5AfhmsiD8w I have been coming to Bean Curd for many, many years. I think it has improved a little each year.  Tonight I had the Thai Red Curry with tofu.  It was very delicious.  The curry is mixed with coconut milk with just enough pepper to give it a pleasant hotness.  This was good enough to drink all on its own!  The tofu was also very good.  It is fried just right - the inside was very creamy and soft.  My companion got the steamed vegetables with tofu.  It comes in a neat metal pan.  The portion was so large that she's got lunch for tomorrow.

The dining room for is bordering formal with nice booths, table linens, and a nice ceiling.  But nevertheless it is casual with a HD TV broadcasting football and another TV at the sushi bar.

This is a nice place!
