Qme4ZWzZEdZUwnpo-sPPIw My boyfriend and I visited Noodle Bowl on Sunday after I said "I feel like stir fry" and being in a rush and around the corner from the place, reluctantly stepped in. Living in the Annex, I've walked by Noodle Bowl hundreds of times and have always noticed the huge plates of food being consumed by the diners in the window. I would have never, ever gone here if we weren't in a rush and looking for some cheap eats.

Well! As soon as we walked in we noticed the smoke filling the dining area and the general haze- why we didn't leave then I don't know. We ordered our food and waited, the smelly smoke bothering me more and more, even starting to irritate my eyes. My boyfriend's General Tao arrived, which was flavourless and severely lacking in any "spice" whatsoever, and mostly consisting of fried bits with very little chicken. The rice was plain and standard. My unnecessarily large "platter" of beef stir fry with rice noodles and black bean sauce was heavy and again flavourless, the noodles extremely overcooked and sticking together in large, soft clumps. I ate a few of the vegetables and pieces of beef, but we were quickly done with our meals, leaving about 3/4 left on our  plates.

I understand the whole "cheap & cheerful" thing, but this place is far from delightful, even if it's supposed to be mostly catering to students. The fact that the place was unnervingly smoky and dirty (the fans on the ceilings were yellow and grimy), so that should be a turn off itself and to be honest, I really don't understand how this place passes health and safety standards.

We left quickly, the smell of the smoke trailing behind us in our hair and jackets. Never again.
