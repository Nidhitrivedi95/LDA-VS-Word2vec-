pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og I went there 3 or 4 times using a Groupon during lunch and each time I got the same experience, disappointed by the food. 

The restaurant is nice with a long sushi bar, nice drink bar with a lot of options and a nice patio when the weather allows it.

I usually get rolls as they fills me up most of the time. Got 3 different rolls each time and, nope, couldn't find any flavors in any of them, really plain.

I really wanted to feel what was the hip about this place but couldn't find anything close.
If it wasn't for the discount, I would have passed.

You probably have much better options around which are tastier than this one, Google is your friend!
