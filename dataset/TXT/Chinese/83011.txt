hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Took a friend out for her birthday dinner tonight and WOW, this place is awesome. Great food - everything we ordered came out really fast and was super delicious. 

My critique:
Soup dumplings were delicious, but each one was on the small side (made me glad that one order gives you 8 of them). Pork slider was literally one big slider and a little difficult to cut up and split. Dan Dan noodles were wonderfully savory with a hint of spicy. Crispy mini milk buns were perfection. 

I wish I could eat here everyday - pun intended. I will definitely be heading back because this place is a gem!!
