jDZJsIyc3jXjcTtJk_p8ZA I love the shrimp in lobster sauce here. The flavor is just right. I love the salty, eggy white sauce that smothers the shrimp, mushrooms, snow peas and crunchy water chestnuts. There were at least a dozen medium-sized, succulent shrimp in an order, so it is a good value too. 

My dinner companion enjoyed the shrimp in egg. It is a little greasy to have as a meal, but it is nice to share.

It's hard to rate this place because I really enjoy what I get there but think other dishes are just average. The four stars are for the shrimp in lobster sauce, not exactly the restaurant overall. My expectations for service and ambiance aren't high for a restaurant in Oakland. It's a solid, quick lunch and dinner spot.
