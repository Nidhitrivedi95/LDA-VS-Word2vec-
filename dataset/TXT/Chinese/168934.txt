Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA I came here due to the reviews on Yelp. It was good... not amazing. Ingredients tasted fresh. I would not go out of my way to dine here but it's a good option if you are in the area. I wish the potstickers were pan fried instead of deep fried but I did not inquire if that was an option, I just took them they way they come.
