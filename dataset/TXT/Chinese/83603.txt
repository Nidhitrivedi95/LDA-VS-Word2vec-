hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA You know what, this place is OK. We are staying on the strip and an older lady wants to go here to eat. What!?! There's a gazillion buffets on or near the strip and they wanna go 25 min out of town? Must be special I thought.

I get there and its an Asian/Chinese buffet. Not impressed. Even the decor was non descript. I was dreading eating there but I did it for my aunt. Pleasantly surprised, the food was actually OK. Nothing special but there's the standard fare. I was surprised there was honey shrimp, crabs, and prawns as the higher cost items. Service was fine. 

Mostly locals eating here. The best thing about this place that bumped it to 3 stars is the just under $13 price tag for dinner. I am not sure how they make money.

Not worth the drive but if you're in the area (maybe to visit the ridiculous number of car dealerships) then hit this place up.
