AVLj5MSJD1si-Rl6X6qTXQ We came here for a UYE.
The place has an open and clean feel (a rarity in this neighborhood IMO). We had a set menu and had the following:
Lychee Pork. Hmm I tried this by mistake and to tell you the truth it could have been mystery meat for all I care. It was mostly batter anyway and devoid of any texture and taste. Could have come out of a frozen meal with the sauce just warmed up and slathered on.  
Grouper. This was served two ways. Once with soup and the other stir fried with veggies. Both attempts were bland. A delicate fish wasted. 
House Fried Vermicelli again a very poor dish. Just out right bland. 
Fried Mixed Vegetable Noodles . I am not a vegetarian by any means but this one was a better dish on what we tried.  Clean taste.
Tofu Bean Curd Stick and Eggplan. Standard fare here a very average dish.
Crispy Chicken This was supposed to be their signature stuff. Skin was crispy which is nice, though I did find the meat to be dry. OK I guess. 
Purple Rice Sweet Soup: Garbage.
I might come back to try this place for dim sum as the price is right and reviews seem decent otherwise from what I had for dinner I would stay away. 
The only saving grace for this place IMO is that its inexpensive but so is the Mcdonald a few steps away! 
1.5 stars.
