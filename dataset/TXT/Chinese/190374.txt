We didn't get a fortune cookie at the end tho :( where is my cheesy advice 

Apparently there is "discounted" parking at the bottom of the Soho hotel, but parking across the street is actually half the price ($10). There is wifi available and they make raspberry mojitos that are off menu if you choose to request it. 

Decor is on fleek, it's freaken beautiful
