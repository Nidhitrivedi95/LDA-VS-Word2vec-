Fe699lNnpiZIGjgmuQahXA Food is great but they honestly have the worst service and are so unorganized! It's 11:20am and I order a Chicken Teriyaki Bowl with brown rice and a Thai Tea Boba and five minutes later one of the cooks is telling the cashier to ask if we want to wait because the brown rice isn't ready. Then another 5 minutes later I get my order and ask about the boba and was asked if I can wait another 5 minutes because the gel is cooking. Seriously?! Get your shit together! Never coming here again! I'll just stick to the one near my house on Eastern and 215!
