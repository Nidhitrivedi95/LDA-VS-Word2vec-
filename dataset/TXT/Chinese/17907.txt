4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A Was introduced to this place a while back and later found that just about all my Asian friends know about it. It is an all you can eat hot pot place just across the street from World-bowl. 

This is a great place to go on a cold day or night. You make your own dipping sauce from a nice variety of ingredients. Then you add whatever foods you wish into the large boiling pot in front of you. There are plenty of tasty items to choose from. 

if you are cold and/or hungry, this is a great place to go. Just don't be afraid to grab a waiter when they walk by or they might not notice you.
