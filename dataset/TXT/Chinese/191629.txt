yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A We ordered a to go order and when we got to the restaurant they forgot to place the order and tried to make us believe we ordered the food from a different location! We asked for the manager he apologized and told us he would cover the bill and when the food came out he over charged charged us and the amount ended up being $37.00! Since we paid for the food we reluctantly ate is and it was horrible! Bad management, horrible take out department, nasty food! If I could give zero start I would! Don't waist your time McDonalds down the street has better service! Oh wait! This property was a McDonalds! Don't waist your time this place is bad!
