TxNeo206T0jMvRRQ4nKSIg I like this place...  but watch out for the live cooking station, some of the "chefs" are very bad in customer service.  I understand they have a long line, but at least be a bit more polite.  And the sashimi station is always low on fish, they refill very slowly and the pieces are very small.  It is a buffet don't limit your food.  Birthday "day" is free for that person with at least one guest, and I love to go there if my or my husband's birthday lands on a weekend.  Besides that, it is quite pricey for my taste now since they raise the price.
