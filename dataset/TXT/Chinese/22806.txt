I'm picky when it comes to my Chinese food, I'm particular on my rice and my lo mein. This tiny little Chinese counter is authentic for sure, no other way to explain it. They're always fast-paced and busy as hell. People in and out all during the weekends. They also deliver, and since I live not that far away, they'll deliver to my house for a delivery fee of I think around $3.00, not bad. They're lo mein is my favorite, and the wonton soup is delicious as well. Hard to understand though, especially when calling in to place your takeout order, and like I said, FAST-PACED, they will definitely hurry you up. But most of it is to be expected, they're are usually always busy when I'm there, Fridays and Saturdays especially.

If your looking for a good, cheap authentic Chinese take-out diner, this is it. Not a "must-try" if you're passing through town, but definitely worth trying out if your a local and looking for a new favorite Chinese place in the area.
