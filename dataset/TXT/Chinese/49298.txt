CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Noodles is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants on the Vegas Strip. It's definitely more affordable than the other super expensive Chinese restaurants on the Vegas Strip. It's located in Bellagio and might be hard to find at first. Just follow the signs as soon as you enter the hotel lobby. I ordered Roast Duck with Rice. The dish comes with a serving of duck marinated in plum sauce, a bowl of white rice, and a side of Chinese brocolli. You can request the duck to be boned or boneless. I ordered it to be boneless, and it tasted great. I ordered the Bok Choy sauteed with garlic, and it was one of the best bok choy dishes I ever had. I also ordered their pot stickers, and I loved them. I personally prefer to dip them in soy sauce. I also order a century egg on the side. This restaurant is a great choice if you're in the mood for Chinese food.
