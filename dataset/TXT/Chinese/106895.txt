l5NUIeAo6Fk-Vx4nm3Xqfg Wow, what a disappointment. I really wanted to like this place because it is less than 5 mins from where I live. But I am sorry to say that the food was some of the worst I've had. The fried chicken wontons had too much soy sauce in it and was soggy and very salty, the fried rice was very greasy tasting and again too much soy sauce, it was the darkest brown fried rice I've ever seen, the mongolian beef was extremely salty and the pad thai was salty and greasy. Overall the meal was pretty much inedible. China Ginger decrease the soy sauce and maybe the entrees won't be so salty, also decrease the amount of cooking oil used. Sorry but I won't be back.
