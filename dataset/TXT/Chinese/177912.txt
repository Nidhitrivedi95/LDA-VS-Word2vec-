wZvSsHFU0NdyQ03625kh6g There are hundreds of Chinese restaurants in Vegas, so the only reason we decided to try this one is because of their House Special Lobster. Wanted to check out how it compares to the same dish made famous in the Little Saigon region of Westminister, CA.

First of all, the place is LOUD, with big groups of boisterous business types and crying babies. Service is a tad slow too. 

The lobster was good but not equal to the California version. This one has a less buttery flavor, is a bit spicier and with a lot of pepper. We ordered a Thai style seafood soup that could have used more flavor as they seem to skimp on the ginger, galangal and lemongrass.

The mung bean dessert was great. It's not a universal favorite but I'm always happy to eat 2 or 3 bowls of it when others decide to skip it.

Overall, decent place but we will still need to make the 4 hour treck to Little Saigon for the quintessential House Special Lobster.
