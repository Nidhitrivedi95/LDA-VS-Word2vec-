X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg This was actually my first time at Hakkasan and from my first experience, it was okay. Because there are two dance floors it made it comfortable for people to listen to whatever kind of music they want to listen to because there was a hip hop dance floor on the bottom floor and the main dj on the top. I spent most of my time at the bottom dance floor because the music was soooo loud on the top floor. Both of the dance floors are pretty small too. I feel that the space is mainly catered to the people who get bottle service, which is not many because if you get bottle service downstairs you would have to stay there. They also do not give you glow sticks that usual night clubs do in Vegas. 
I guess I can't complain because I got in for free because I was with a bunch of girls and we had a promoter. But one thing about that was we had to wait in line for a hour just to get in, because they said we had to be there by a certain time, but they just made us wait. 

One thing that annoyed me was that there was NOOOOOOO place to sit, unless you got bottle service. Which was ridiculous because not everybody gets bottle service when you go clubbing and for you to not let customers sit down because they didn't have bottle service is annoying and it really did not make me want to go there again. Every time someone was sitting on a ledge of something, security would come over and tell the person to get down. Even in the lounge area there were no seats. There were just tables where you would stand with your drinks. 

There is also no water fountain where you can get free water. You have to buy small SMALLLLL Fiji water bottles for $9 and hope that will last you the whole night.

A lot of my friends have hyped up this place up for me but currently this place has only disappointed me.
