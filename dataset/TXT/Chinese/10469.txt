1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Those who complain about anything for this place are people who buy a Toyota Corolla and complain its performance does not match up to the BMW's ...... We went there 4 times in 2 days and literally tried everything on the menu. Yes, some dishes are a bit salty and some are less than perfect, but a lot of other dishes are very good (shrimp paste ong choy, shrimp/wonton noodles, thin ribeye steak with rice, etc.) and the portion is generous. FOR THE PRICE you pay it's amazing!
