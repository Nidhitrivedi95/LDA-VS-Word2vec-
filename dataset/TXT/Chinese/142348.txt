RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg Hhmm Im really leaning on giving this place a two given the sticky menus, the unswept carpet and my soup bowl that had some sort of crumb residue on it. But the tempura shrimp and veggies I had were not too bad and I didn't get sick on both times I was dragged along here. 

Their customer base is made up of young families and on both visits no one didnt seem to mind the mess. Im assuming alot were regular customers by the way everyone interacted with the staff.  

The service was on point, had no problems issuing separate checks.  The price of the meal was a good value. What I had was pretty decent.

So three stars since my guts survived. Not in any hurry to go back though but will keep this place in mind for cheap eats.
