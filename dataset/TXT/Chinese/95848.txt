JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA I used to go here all the time in the old location even after they first opened in new location and love it for the past 4 years, until one day, one of my coworkers was complaining to me she got rotten food from them right before they close, and several time we went there, the egg wasn't fresh at all, it's like the egg sat there overnight for whole week. One time I went there pretty late so I asked them politely is the food still fresh, the lady immediately talked to me in rude voice "oh, it's you again? why do you always asking us such strange question" (PS. this is the first time I asked them that question by the way), what's even more shocking, the nice owner who use to be nice added on top of it "if you want to eat then eat, if not then don't", WOW, I walked right out and that's it for me, will never go back again even if they have the best beef noodle here in town.

Wow has it been 4 years already? I'm very proud I still haven't set my foot in their door since past 4 years, I want them to know it only takes one shitty service to scare away a loyal customer for life :)
