BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg I tried How lee after deciding not to wait an hour to eat at Chengdu Gourmet (which I love!). First impression left me feeling a little nervous about the food. The place looks to have been recently renovated, but nothing fancy. After being sat and ordered off of the extensive menu, the server gave us some small plates and wine glasses. A few of the wine glasses had a "film" on them that I cannot pinpoint the source of. And then a few of the plates still had a little "crust" stuck to them. The server was happy to exchange these items out for cleaner ones. Not a good start, but the order had already been placed so I was going to give this place a shot whether I wanted to or not.

DRINKS
- BYOB

APPETIZERS
- Steamed pork dumplings. These were so-so.

MAINS
- Tiger Skin Peppers. Wow - these are delicious, but incredibly spicy! Being someone who loves spice, I was even a little nervous to dive into this dish after tasting the first bite. Others at the table literally had tears dripping down their faces. Folks, any pepper can range in spice level -- order with caution.
- Spicy eggplant. I'm not even an eggplant fan, and this dish was really good.
- Mapo tofu (ordered with no pork) -- aka the Szechuan tofu. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.
- Others at my table ordered the spicy prawns, chili beef, and some spicy chicken dish. They all enjoyed these dishes, but probably the chicken and beef ones more than the prawns.

OVERALL
I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I wish they would double-check their plates and glassware before setting it out, but as far as the food is concerned, it was a good experience.

I will definitely give How Lee a shot again in the future.
