VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ I have been going to Flo's for more than 10 years and have always loved the food and value. The last few visits have been disappointing. Last night we did our traditional New Year's Eve take out and were disappointed again when the sweet and sour sauce for our sweet and sour chicken was missing and the sauce for our dumplings was also missing.  I had checked the order when I picked up but forgot to check for the sauces. Needless to say, dinner was not very good. We have had problems before with take out and at this point, I can't see us doing this again. There is no quality control in Flo's take out and when I spend more than $60 for dinner, I expect to get what I pay for. Flo, if you read this, add a quality control step to your take out process.
