They had a wide variety of options and they all were fresh despite it being later for lunch and very few people in the restaurant. They had a few sushi varieties which were good. I'm not a big sushi person so i can't say how they compare to most but as far as buffet goes I thought they were good. Lots of dessert options like cookies and pastries but they were all a little on the dry side. Chocolate covered strawberries were awesome and they had other fresh fruit. Service was great.
