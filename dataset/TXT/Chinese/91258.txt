iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A Tastes like an average Americanized chinese fast food place, chow mein nd fried rice are nothing special but don't have the Chinese flavor I was looking for, the kung pao shrimp nd chicken are heavy on the sauce nd tastes overly of fish sauce. It does seen like all the flavor is only in the sauce nd everything else is bland. I liked the crab rangoon, it actually tasted good. Next time I might just order those. Sorry to say but I don't want to try anything else again.
