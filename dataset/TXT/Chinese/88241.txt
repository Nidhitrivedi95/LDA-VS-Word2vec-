I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg This is the best shaved ice experience in the valley. If you are looking for authentic favors like matcha and Thai tea, they have it. The kiddos will enjoy choices like cotton candy and strawberry. The ice here is so fine and light, it takes snoh to another level!
I opted for the #4 Gotcha Matcha - green tea ice, red bean topping and instead of condensed milk I chose the black sesame glaze. Yum!!!! The customer service is awesome and helpful, too. Great peeps, cool atmosphere, relaxed vibe. We'll be back!
