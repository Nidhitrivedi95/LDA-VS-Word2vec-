aqszoKRB4Ol9bpemt0_-GQ I ordered the Chicken Noodle soup.  Again, feeling under the weather an want soup.  It far exceeded my expectations.  I used to get chicken rice soup from TinTin and was never impressed.  The chicken there was always a little "iffy".  Soho's CNS is delightful.  I was greeted with large broccoli florets, slices of zucchini, bok choy and LOTS of good quality chicken. The chicken had a good texture and was cut-able with a spoon.  I ordered with rice noodles which came nestled in the bottom of the container and were not over done.  The broth was light and full of flavor.  It wasn't too salty and was a delicious end of soup drink.  As a happy bonus I got fried wontons with the soup.  They were large and fresh; A tasty crunch. Once again, Soho Bistro knocks it out of the park!
