spDZkD6cp0JUUm6ghIWHzA If I could give it a negative, I would. This place was an absolute mistake; got there around 7:15 and didn't leave till 8:45. This is not because the food was soooo amazing that I had to stay, but rather that my kids had to wait 45 minutes for the wonton with instant noodles. Yes folks, that's right, I said "Instant." Not so instant in my opinion. We've all made instant noodles at some point in our lives; never has it taken me even more than 20 minutes and that's usually because I'm adding beef balls, eggs, or spam. Maybe they had to run out to the supermarket to buy it. In any case, I ordered a Portuguese Beef Brisket Rice, which came in 20 minutes. The plate was enormous but the amount of food didn't quite exactly fit the size of the plate as my kids managed to scarf down most of it before their noodles arrived. My dish was below average as the brisket was very tough and the sauce tasted like it came out of a Lee Kum Kee bottle, but my kids were super hungry, so they ate it anyways. Had to ask for water three times as my kids can't drink tea, but after three failed attempts, I didn't bother. I also noticed several individuals leave before they finished my meal which was an indication that the food was not very good. I also noticed that the table in front of us was informed that they ran out of whatever she ordered, but this was 25 minutes after she ordered. Needless to say, she got up and left. When I was about to leave, I asked to pay with Interac but they said it wasn't set up. They should really take off that Interac sign on the front door if they don't offer that form of payment. So, I had to run out to the bank and get cash; pretty much adding salt to the wound. I guess you pretty much see that this will be my first and last visit. One of my worst dining experiences EVER. If you're smart, stay FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!
