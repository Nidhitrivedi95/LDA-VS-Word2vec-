3v1c2BsFFcWlpV3S3LS8dA Whaaaat the heck!? All of there meat is shredded into a shape that's no longer recognizable...no wait, that's only half the time. That's pretty much the story with this place, half the time it's decent, half the time it's the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I've had it--I will not eat here again.
