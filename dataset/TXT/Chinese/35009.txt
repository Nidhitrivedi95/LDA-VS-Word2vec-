aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg I am still amazed how little we paid for the nice food we got. I am a chinese, and I will tell you the food is delicious! and their special menu price is so low, I couldn't believe it. I ended up to go 4 dishes on second day, so I can have some at home. Those ice drinks are tasteful also.
