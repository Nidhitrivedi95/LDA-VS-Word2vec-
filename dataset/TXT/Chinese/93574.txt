j3lG-ZqQXUQl-ImNcWHbVQ I have eaten here at least 8 times so far and I must say it is a pretty good buffet.  The Sushi is quite varied and probably in the upper tier I have experienced as far as sushi at a buffet.  The Habachi - or as we call it in Michigan - Mongolian - portion is a nice start, with a good selection of raw meats and veggies - it could be great if they would actually add a "sauce bar" for you to add your own sauce and spices....frequently the dish after it is cooked looks like no sauce was even used.  I mentioned this to management and hopefully they will take it to the next level.  Overall the rest of the buffet is good and affordable - my measure is usually how much soft drinks are....in this case I believe they are $1.55 w/refills.
