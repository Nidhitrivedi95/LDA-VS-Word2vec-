JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A The food is delicious, but the service is slow and way understaffed. We had to wait for almost an hour to get our food because it looked like it was the only one lady in the whole restaurant managing the kitchen and tables. There was some minor communication issues, but for the most part she was friendly. The food is inexpensive here. We spent about $24 for two people and I had leftovers to take home. It was very filling, just wish the service was better. I'll definitely do takeout though.
