9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw Very good authentic Chinese food at very reasonable price especially during lunch time or secret reverse happy hour after 8 pm you can order from lunch menu again just ask them. I love the yang chow fried rice for $5.95 , crispy noodle with  chicken $5.95 , salt and pepper pork chop $5.95 as well. For $20 cab feed a family of 4 easily
