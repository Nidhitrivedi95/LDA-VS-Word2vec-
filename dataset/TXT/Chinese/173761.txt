Wa2X66syShuMSVUYAj1C-Q Oh Yan's, how I love this place!! We did an order for pick-up of quite a few different things...all were great.

 The lettuce wraps are ridiculous, like as in ridiculously good. I like them more than PF Chang's. I wish more sauce was given since the huge amazing portion of chicken and fresh lettuce is so generous and did I say good?, lol. We also ordered crab won-tons that were huge and very well full of cream cheese and a bunch of crab and I believe scallions...super tasty. The vegetable spring rolls were also excellent.

Along with the apps we also got chicken with vegetables and sweet and sour pork....both were not only generous portions with perfectly cooked rice in the boxes on the side but they were great! Good amount of white meat and greatly cooked pork also. The veggies were crisp but not under cooked, perfectly cooked in fact. Super good. 

Only problem I had was no chopsticks in our to-go bag, no forks or spoons for sauces and no napkins. Otherwise, check this place out, it is pretty dang good and 10 steps above Panda for sure, Peace out :)
