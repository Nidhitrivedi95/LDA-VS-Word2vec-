4v_RbefzvGkixXXJkn-bzw A pleasant surprise!!!

 It said vegetarian on the door, but I wasn't expecting vegan beef, vegan chicken, vegan shrimp, vegan fish, vegan scallops -- make a vegan HAPPY why don't you!? :D 

(Yes, meat eaters - they take care of you, too.) 

I'm just so excited, Lakewood is definitely holding it's own for the vegan crowd. 

I had a crispy, spicy tofu and veggie dish as well as an asparagus tofu soup. Super nice portions, I'll be having the rest for dinner. As my server said, "No cooking tonight! You can just watch tv and eat!"

I already can't wait to go back!
