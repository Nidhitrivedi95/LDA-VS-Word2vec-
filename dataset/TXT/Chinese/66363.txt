EhGPj8iJDIdaHnWg9d5BgA Have been going here for dim sum for special occasions. 

Dim sum is comparable to Markham but at a price. But if you care for quality then would skip the dive msg laced downtown Chinatown dim sum restaurants and pay some more $$$ and come here.

My mom loves the atmosphere as its brightly lit, nice view of the lake and quiet (compared to other places).

Side tip: book in advance, request a window view during the air show in August.
