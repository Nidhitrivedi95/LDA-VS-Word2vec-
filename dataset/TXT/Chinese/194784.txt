zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ This place has an awesome name and is very trendy inside. That about sums up the positives for Momofuku Noodle Bar. On the other hand, the service is slow, and the food. Oh the food. Boy was the ramen disappointing. I got the Momofuku Ramen, which I thought was going to be great since it's got the restaurant's name in it. Nope. The broth wasn't tasty.. more bitter than anything and well the broth kind of makes the ramen. The meat in it was nice but pretty much everything else was disappointing. There are so many good ramen spots in the city, so there's really no reason to come here unless everywhere else is booked up. Then again, the place was packed for some reason.. maybe only because of its celebrity chef's/owner's fame.
