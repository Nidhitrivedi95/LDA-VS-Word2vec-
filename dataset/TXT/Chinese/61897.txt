Is it the quintessential smell of milk tea? Is it the chairs with their plastic covers and metal backs? The typical glasses for our tea? The Chinese menus on the wall? Whatever it is, we knew we had arrived at a place that will satisfy our cravings for east meets west cafe food.

I had the lunch combo of chicken leg and egg on rice that came with a good helping of broccoli. It was pretty good - nothing fancy, and a good size. He had diced chicken and salted fish fried rice which was decent as well if you're into savoury and pungent flavours.

Super glad we found this place downtown as there are so many more options in this style uptown than in the heart of Toronto.
