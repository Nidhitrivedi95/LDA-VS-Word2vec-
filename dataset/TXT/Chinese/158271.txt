tXsbez4J_fE6Iqq1TrxdEw Came here for takeout food. Was way better than I thought. The entire restaurant had only one staff who served as both the chef and the cashier, which caused us to wait for a bit longer than expected, but food quality was well above average takeout. Husband ordered green curry and I had shrimp pad thai, both are huge portion and very well seasoned. Highly recommended A12 satay beef screwed, the dipping sauce is home made and lovely. The only staff in the restaurant was super friendly and very carefully packed our food for us. Will definitely come over again for takeout.
