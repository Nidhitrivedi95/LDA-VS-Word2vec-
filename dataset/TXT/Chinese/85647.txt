hMgIF04rrJ7oB1lGIpFt5w A lot of the Chinese students here said this was a good place and more authentic than the other Chinese places in town. I was recommended to try the stir-fried fish with chili and and the steamed fish with chili sauce. Both were excellent and both dishes were big enough for two people to share. We also had a good dish that was thinly sliced potatoes and peppers. We also had a plate with various kinds of mushrooms. Very tasty! They have some American Chinese dishes too, but I didn't see the point in getting them, since I like trying new things and their menu is huge!

They do not have a full bar like it says under the description, though.  But we inquired if we could do BYOB and they said it would be fine.
