Ax1DHVBCpaBpViUvSwDdSg Whenever I find myself in the High Park area, I always drop-by for the BBQ pork wonton soup, especially on a cold day. It's simply the best of its kind in the city! For the price, you get a good-sized portion with plenty of wontons with slivers of bbq pork and hot broth. If you'll be eating anything else, get the small size; that's plenty enough. But if that's all you're having, go for the medium (the large is for two or more people). Though I haven't tried it, friends tell me that the chicken version is delicious as well.

For more traditional Cantonese food, go to Chinatown. However, if you're in the mood for old-school, Canadianized Chinese food, this is the place to be. Don't mind the 1950ish exterior and dated interior. It's clean and the food is what you're after anyway. 

I also recommend their sweet & sour chicken balls, lemon chicken, honey garlic ribs and spring rolls.

Though I'm an east-ender, I've been visiting this place every few months for more than 15 years. The owner, Jeannie, has always been kind to me. She works 6 days a week, so pay her a visit sometime.
