5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A Tuesday 7:30p Live Music!  Excellent delivery service also.  

I am picky so exactly what I order to me is the best way lol, the Thai House Fried Rice, no crab, onion, tomatoes, raisins.  Then, you get extra pineapple, chicken & shrimp which is freshly cooked.

It takes me about 2 minutes to eat the crab wontons & egg rolls they are so perfectly made. I'd like to try another app soon, but have been in love w/ these for awhile.  Also the lunch time special is a great deal.  Soup, egg rolls & your entree.

The menus are quite old so that'd be my only complaint, but the deliciousness overrides that, along w/ the service & smiling happy people.
