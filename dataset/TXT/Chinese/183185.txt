XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw Went here last night on a whim. We ordered from the "must try section". Got to say that when its hot it's pretty good, nothing to rave about. Little pricey. But when the food becomes cold it really gets soggy and oily. The best was the pan fried potstickers for $9.99. Good and best value I think.
