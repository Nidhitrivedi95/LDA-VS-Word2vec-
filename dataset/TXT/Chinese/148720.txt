SlQNMsVEOSxN-ciIn93LOw We have been to the restaurant about 4 times in the last four weeks.

The food is good but not always consistent. We ordered the orange chicken a couple of weeks ago. It was so hard we could barely chew it. Needless to say, we did not eat it all.

My issues are:

1. The owner is always trying to nickel and dime us- if we ask for sauce it's an additional cost. The waitress tonight said it was a dollar extra. Ok, no problem. The bill came it was two. We asked about it, and she said I'll take it off. We heard her ask the owner if the sauce was $1 or $2. She came back, placed the bill on the table, and walked away. We checked the bill, and the $2 was still there. We asked her about it, her response was... "oh, I just said I was going to ask about it." Okbecause we didn't hear you clearly say that you would take it off! 

2. If you order the fried rice and eat in the restaurant the serving is much bigger than if you order it to go! We absolutely tested this out.

There are few other minor issues but, I digress.

We were already teetering on whether or not to patronize this business again. Tonight confirmed that we will not return.
