Q9veWOu7mFj881o3nqB4bQ Where do I start? Every time I come here, I am so satisfied time and time again. I keep telling myself to write a Yelp review after each visit, but I kept forgetting. I just went here again on Sunday, so now it is time for my review! On Sunday, we experienced the "All you can eat hot pot" special. It's about $24/person and there is a two hour dining period. Everyone in your party chooses their soup base-- either white, spicy, or vegetable. I like the spicy soup base because it has the most flavor, IMO. If you're not a fan of spice, just remove the hot peppers from the soup when it is brought out to you. The soup get spicier over time if you leave the peppers in. Anyways! This place is like the Melting Pot for Asian cuisine. You can choose the veggies and proteins your table would like to eat. Note- 1 order of something feeds about 2-3 people. Most recently, we tried new veggies and proteins we normally wouldn't get a la carte since everything was included. We tried fish balls, the sausage and tripe? Along with our normal lamb, calamari, baby corn, greens, broccoli and udon noodles. If your mouth isn't already watering, they also have a sauce bar in which you can mix and match to create your own unique sauce to eat with your food. I could eat at this place every week if I had the chance to! I highly recommend this hidden gem if you're ever out and about in Oakland!
