WF0I9AwErfaqkPPXM98ywQ Came here at 7PM on a Thursday evening before watching a movie, to try out their meal combos and some of their sweets. The first time we came here, they ran out of meal combos by 5PM, but luckily this time, they have several choices left for dinner.

My BF got the pork ribs with black beans on steamed rice combo with lemon tea for $6. The meal was surprisingly very small, and didn't taste good. Won't get that again but it was worth a try since fellow Yelpers have ordered meal combos here.

I got a ham and cheese croissant ($2.5) and a slice of mango mousse cake. I've asked the server to microwave the ham and cheese croissant as I prefer it warm. The ham and cheese croissant was good and there is a big amount of meat and cheese on it. The croissant was nice and flaky, and over-all it was delicious! Will definitely get that again!

The mango mousse cake is a good big slice for only $4.25, but as far as the taste goes, it was a bit bland in my opinion. The size is big and filling, but the cake lacks flavor. The mousse wasn't as soft and light as I expected from a mango mousse cake.. I guess I have been spoiled by the quality of cakes at Bakery Nakamura. Haha. I won't get the mango mousse again, but perhaps try other cakes when I come back. They have quite a few choices.

Service is nice and friendly and the place is well-kept and clean.
