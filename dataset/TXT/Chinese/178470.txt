x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg Went there again yesterday - gave them a 'final chance' and it turned out really well.  Not sure what happened the last time I was there but yesterday was the same Asian Legend that I have come to love.  Had the wuxi-style, slow simmered gorgeous ribs, shaolong bau (that broth inside is exquisite) and my favourite hot and sour soup ... 

Attentive table service and the Manager (who always seems to be there regardless of the day of week or time of day) always remembers us - is a very gracious host.  It seems as though they're back on track.
