O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw We had family visiting and they really wanted some good dim sum in downtown Toronto.  Seeing how most of the family had no cars, we couldn't really bring them up to Markham or Richmond Hill.  Someone mentioned Rol San and off we went for Chinese New Year dim sum.

This is one of the old stalwarts of Chinatown.  It's probably one of the best options here and probably the most cleanest as well.  Thank goodness someone booked the tables cause we saw the line up of waiting tables spill out into every part of the hallway and dining areas.  The staff was unpleasant at best.  It was near impossible to get their attention and when they did, they clearly were irritated.  Seeing how we're used to the curt but efficient service of most Chinese restaurants, this was FAR FAR worse.  

Then menu has many of the dim sum standards... deep fried squid, cha siu bun, rice rolls filled with shrimp or beef, siu mai dumplings, and har gao.  We pretty much ordered over 24 dishes for our group of 12.  The first comment was that this was more expensive than the average good Markham places.  The food quality was ok... some of them clearly has been sitting in the steamers for a long period of time because the dumpling skins were gooey and fell apart easily while the pork inside was tough.  All the food did come very quickly so we were never left waiting for more food.  

Overall, this isn't a bad place but it certainly doesnt match up to the good places in GTA East.  If I had a choice (and more cars to bring people places), i'd spend the extra 30 minutes driving to get better food and service.
