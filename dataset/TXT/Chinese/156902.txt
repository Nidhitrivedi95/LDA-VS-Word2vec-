trsKoo2b9-nMcXCKn8dlfQ I previously gave this place with 5 stars. The food is terrific and their flavors are spot on. The reason why they have 2 stars taken off is those dirty plates + glasses. We found some black thing on our water.For me cleanliness is so freaking big deal. I would still come here and give them one more chance. Mind you, this is my 3rd visit when this happened. The previous visits were all good. I hope the manager let the guy know to clean the plates better. :)
