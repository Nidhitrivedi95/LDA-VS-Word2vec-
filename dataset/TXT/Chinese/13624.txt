2ZEnhnWEascgZDMdf6kfAg I like the bullfrog dish, it's my favourite, the rest of dishes are just fine similar to other Chinese restaurant.  The service is bad tho, been there couples time they waiters will never ask our opinions and not even notice us, have to put up the hand for so long even when it's not busy. Like they never pay attention. Beside the service it's not bad place.
