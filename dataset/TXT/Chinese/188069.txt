yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA If I'm feening for Vietnamese food, this is my spot. It's quick and service is good. And there's a really cute girl that works the register! The Pho is always on point. The chicken wings are amazing. They have extra crispy skin and the fried garlic they throw on top of it isn't overpowering. (Puts Hooters wings to shame) The rice dishes are bombay! (chicken, pork chops, steak)! They are all very juicy and never disappointing. The spring rolls are fresh tasting. If your a veggie lover, get the chinese broccoli sauteed with garlic. I have never left this place unsatisfied.
