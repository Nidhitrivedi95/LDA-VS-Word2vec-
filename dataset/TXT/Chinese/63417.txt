dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ A pleasant surprise! Some of the best and cheapest sushi we've found thus far in the surrounding area.  We got some of the "under 30 minute meals", which were served on cute plates, with soup and salad. 

Sushi was cheap and tasty (California rolls and some sort of shrimp roll) and salad dressing was tangy and citrusy. Portions were plentiful and we took leftovers home. 

We'll definitely be going back to check out the super hot noodle bowls and penny beer.
