He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw This is a pretty neat little dessert place. Lots of different options to choose from.

I ordered a mixed fruit iced tea, beef striploin omurice, and had a bite of this Oreo toast mountain thing I didn't even see what it was called but pictures provided lol

The mixed fruit iced tea was ok, but not the best I've had. I think the fruit choices could have been better for the infusion. 

The omurice was not bad, I usually have it with curry, so with black bean sauce it was interesting but good. The rice was very soft, wet, and sweet. The striploin was ok, but the portion is a bit on the small side.

The Oreo toast was ok. Some layers of toast were really hard and crispy like croutons, done were on the softer side. Not sure if it was intentional but there's different textures from what I experienced. It's very sweet, so if you have a sweet tooth, you'll probably like it.

Overall, I think it's a pretty nice place to take a date and I will probably go back just because I saw so many things I wanted to try.
