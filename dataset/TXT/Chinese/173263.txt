W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g Today was my first time trying the chicken pho at Simi's. I found it really good. The noodles were firm, the broth had a good flavor and the flavors all seemed fresh. I really liked the chili paste as it came in a bowl and tasted better than the stuff some places have in squirt bottles. The chicken was kind of odd. Not bad odd - but it had a slippery boiled texture. The pork spring rolls were also very tasty. Service was great and friendly and the dining room was clean. I would still rate Unphogettable a little higher, but they have two different tastes and both are very good.
