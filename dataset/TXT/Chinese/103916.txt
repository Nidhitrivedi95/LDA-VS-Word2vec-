But make sure you make a reservation (call in early afternoon for an evening reservation) and still expect to wait 15 - 30 mins when you arrive (they always tell people 10 mins but it takes about 30 mins - just go outside and people watch). I ordered off the Gluten free menu and the food was fantastic.  Service was friendly. It's not expensive which in Vegas is a rare find and why I give it 4 stars (for value).
