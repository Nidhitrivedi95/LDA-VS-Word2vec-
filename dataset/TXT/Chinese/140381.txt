r6WO_jkx4rkMMauvPvMDeQ This place is amazing from the food to the service its hand down my fav Chinese food place!!!!
I order from this place AT LEAST once a month, I don't have any issues with the food or the service ever...BUT last time i  ordered  their China go go wings, and they weren't crunchy than other times they were tasteless and kinda mushy i was kinda pissed cus out of everything that's what I was craving!!!!, now that is the only time I can think about them messing up or them slippn. Great place to get your Chinese fix.Friendly, Quick, Delicious, and Inexpensive!!!

JUST SO YOU KNOW!!!! i ordered the New York style Chow Mein, I don't know what i was expecting but definitely not what I got...It wasn't your typical noodles and it had a lot of veggies...NOT saying it was bad but it wasn't anything i was expecting. It was Good but i wouldn't order it again!

*******Honey walnut shrimp BEST HANDS DOWN SUCKAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!
