mwO4cm8qs32djjve5ni_Vg I always used to nip in for a take away at the Haymarket Chop Chop when I had a chance.. and was utterly delighted that they decided to open up shop in Leith. It has now a staple visit. The place is nice and airy and not noisy. The food is to die for. The excellent staff will give you all the time you need and as long as you are aware that the food comes out when ready (not lined in the way you ordered) you are in for a massive treat. Be aware though that when busy they tend to get things wrong, but that is always easily rectified. And on occasion popular dishes might run out as they are freshly made (beef & chilli dumplings, anyone?) They got their own 'club' or 'loyalty program' which will ensure you of special deals every so often. I say you go to try and you will agree with me.
