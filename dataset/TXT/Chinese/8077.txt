1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w Our food was okay, I would recommend the black pepper chicken. But we were a little bit thrown off by the "family size" being so small. Not that we are gluttons, but it really was more like what you expect as a slightly generous dinner entree. Service was okay, we weren't overly thrilled with how often we were simply waiting for acknowledgement that we needed something. All in all I suppose it is about what you would expect from a franchise/chain restaurant.
