rx1AEnleVRWMNz6vB-YhfQ Ewe ewe and more ewe!  I have to warn you this place is horrible!!  My party of 3 ordered potstickers wonton soup pepper steak sesame chicken and beef and broccoli!  We were all mortified!!  The friend rice wasn't gross but it was bland with no flavor at all!  The chow mien noodles were disgusting as well!!  And the fortune cookie, Not one of us would try it!  My daughter shockingly said this stinks as soon as she opened the package!  Sure enough it smelt like the dried worms I feed my turtles!!  I cannot believe they are serving the food like this!!  I wouldn't even feed it to my dog!!  We spent $48 plus tip and feel like I just threw my money in the garbage!  We barely touched any of our food past the first taste!!  Panda Express is 5 star in comparison!
