JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw Just came back from this place. There is not much distinguish food here compare with others. Only two waitress are for sure not enough. the taste of noodle soap are way too Sweet. the dumplings are plain with any taste. three youngsters next our table are pretty loud through out our stay there. A disappointed meal.
