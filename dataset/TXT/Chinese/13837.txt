3-HFGxmbzSax-NySJ_LzDg We were pleasantly impressed by this place- the location has been many other restaurants in the past- it's got an ugly exterior and just looks weird.  BUT when I walked in, I totally felt like a VIP!  The interior decor is beautiful- very classy with huge sushi bar in the center and alcohol bar towards back wall.  The bathroom was pretty.  Ok- onto the food.  There are two extensive menus- one with Chinese cuisine and one with Japanese stuff like sushi and bento box.  I thought sushi sounded delish but was a bit pricey.   Chinese stuff looked really good too.  We both ended up getting bowl of hand pulled noodles- I got roasted duck and my boyfriend got beef tendon.  Whoa!  It was amazing!  My bowl came with a good amount of duck plus three pieces of fresh bok choy.  The beef tendon was so delicious and flavorful.   Both our broth tasted similar but it was so good.  It didn't taste like they just threw in a bunch of MSG.  I am going back at lunch to try sushi (was priced much better). By the way, our noodles were only $8.95 each bowl which I thought was very reasonable.  This place was so nicely decorated, I can easily see it hosting weddings, etc.  But everyone there was dressed very casual-  I had arrived in my workout clothes and I felt alright.  It's a four star for now since I haven't tried sushi- I hope to eventually give this place five stars after trying other dishes.  Service was professional and friendly- very efficient with order, requests for chili sauce and bill.
