N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ Now that I've gone a brunch binge of late (when did it become my favourite meal?), I can say with certainty that Patois is pretty solid. 
They open at 11 on Sunday and we got there about 1120 and there were only 2 tables left, that was fast! The three of us got a table at the back. The place itself is pretty dark and I would describe the atmosphere as a dark party bar. The staff was friendly and helpful bringing my little one a special glass to drink water without asking. I ordered the butter french toast and I gotta say SO AWESOME!!!! It's a french toast sandwich with butter in the middle and deep fried. I asked for the syrup on the side as I've seen picture of this drenched in syrup. When we got to the final bits of the french toast I thought I should try some with syrup and MIND BLOWING. They must mix the syrup with something as it tasted awesome. Definitely better than the standard pure maple syrup. Also had a americano which was pretty standard. Definitely go back, but don't eat any carbs for the rest of the day after!
