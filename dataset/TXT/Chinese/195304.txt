-  don't look for authenticity, just look as to whether its yummy.  His cookbook is pretty awesome and I've made many of these dishes , they're not overly hard, just insightful

- the ramen basically is a love letter to pork and bacon, it's not the worlds greatest but it is pretty yummy if you can deal with the salt -
- the pork buns here still rock.  Also they had a chicken liver pâté and head cheese bun that killed
- the very spicy noodles are very good and very spicy, almos a Dan Dan mien without the peanuts
- the chicken and egg is ultimate comfort food - smoky confit chicken seared on rice with pickles and soft poached egg.  It's different from the traditional Oyako Donburi but hits the mark
- they serve Mexican Coke

Been to ny and to locations I think they have a winner in TO - just need to tweak things
