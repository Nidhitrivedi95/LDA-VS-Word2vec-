HgL6gGEGoAUBKGrT6BXU4Q Service was great and my food arrived within like 5-10 minutes.

The chicken rice was good, and the broccoli tempura was also decent. 

The portion size was pretty small, though it would leave you some room for the dessert, which was also rather small - two strips of french toast. Yes, strips.

With that price, I do hope they could offer a larger portion so you don't have to feed urself with the extras or the desserts.

My final complaint would be that the onion/ginger sauce was a bit dry. The flavour was authentic, it would be perfect if it was more oily.
