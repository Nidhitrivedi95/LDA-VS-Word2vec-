a0Jm-rlHOKk_1fm4hzxskg WF puzzles me! Nice decor, accommodating host (owner) but "old style" food. I got the feeling that we went back in time, say the 80's where everything tasted the same. Soup & sauces all had that cornstarch flavor that covers the tongue at first sip & stays with you throughout the meal. Their won tons in brown sauce must be an acquired taste that we haven't acquired yet. We also had the whole fish w/brown sauce on the side. It was over cooked & the sauce was more soy like than smooth. Both lacked flavor. The shrimp dish was bland & they used button mushrooms that they didn't bother to cook. I really wanted to try the fried bananas but chickened out!
All in all, not a stellar outing...
