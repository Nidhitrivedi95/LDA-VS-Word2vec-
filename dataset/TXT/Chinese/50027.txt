cDpUshHyJHDEc19TSTulJw I had three worries when I first heard of Urbana Acupuncture.  My first worry was that due to the group setting, it would be hard to talk about my concerns.  My second worry was that the care wouldn't be the same quality as when I had acupuncture at a typical clinic.   My third worry was that I would be annoyed or distracted by other clients. 

My first worry was completely alleviated.  Jim, the acupuncturist, will talk with you either at a desk to the side of the waiting room, or over the phone by appointment if you wish to have a lengthy discussion.  For minor updates that you want to share when you come in, you can write these down and share with him that way.  He is very attentive to any concerns you wish to discuss. 

My second worry also turned out to be unnecessary.  The treatment I received was on par with what I've received elsewhere.  Truly excellent results.  I think a big part of it is that because it is less expensive, you can afford to go more often and don't have to delay a visit because of money.  Also, they're open five days a week and make it very easy to schedule.  

Lastly, I wasn't annoyed or distracted by anyone.  The treatment room is huge, and the chairs are spaced out in a way that you don't have anyone "in your space" so to speak.  There are plants, dividers, etc. that make it easy to concentrate on yourself and relax.  People who come in are very respectful of each other and the treatment center is very quiet. 

In summary:  Caring people who are excellent at what they do.  If you're a student or have a small budget, they make it possible for you to get excellent and helpful treatment.   We need something like this in every community.   Highly, highly recommended.
