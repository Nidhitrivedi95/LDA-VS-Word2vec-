I could rate this place higher if I was happy with the delivery but, Im really not! They deliver sometimes, there is no rhyme or reason and no set schedule of when they will take delivery orders.  One must call to find out if they will delivery every time! I could call every week same time, same day and most times it a no!  I hate that if I want Jin house I cant call up and get it delivered unless it happens to be a fluke. I tip very well and I make a point to always order 20-25$ of delivery to make sure and still Im disappointed. I would rather drive to another city  than drive down to the location when its busy.
