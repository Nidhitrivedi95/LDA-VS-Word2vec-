4KHo1LnkM69RtWTDBdG16g This restaurant truly takes the cake for being the worst restaurant in Toronto.

i)Tables and cutlery is dirty
ii)Servers pay no attention to you and slam the food on the table.
iii)Dessert is brought before the main dish.


Absolutely disgusting, and the most horrible experience ever.
And for a bubble tea place, the bubble tea is absolutely awful.

Congratulations!
Instead of screaming at me in Mandarin, why not try English?
