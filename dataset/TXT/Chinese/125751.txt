OyBStpjF5e_iRCMXflFasQ Wow.  Should have read the reviews and stuck to the tea.  I had the lo mein looking noodles, spicy "young' chicken and general tso.  The only thing I could get down was the noodles.  I went in because the place was packed with Asian students so I'd figure it was worth a shot.  Now I'm not feeling to good.  Note to self:  read yelp reviews first!
