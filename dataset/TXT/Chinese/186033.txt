y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw My cousin and I were here in Vegas for vacation. After eating burgers for days, we craved for Chinese food very much. So we came to Pearl Ocean for the delicious Dim Sum and authentic Chinese dishes. It didn't disappoint us! The food is so good. The restaurant environment is upscale and nice decorated! The waitress Tina is very polite and professional. Strongly recommended!!!
