QTYA1yCbsCjRU6BYDdQJuw Just happened to be in Markham, so we started yelping to see what was new in the area.  We saw some reviews about Sweet Peas (and I do agree that the two Silverstar locations made it confusing when it's exactly the same address with different interiors).

We ordered the 12 assorted mochi for $13.  I was hoping to get mango and lychee but we got none.  But instead we got 4 flavours and 3 of each: black sesame, taro, mocha and honeydew.  They were smaller than we thought and only the Taro tasted like Taro.  The honeydew tasted artificial and black sesame didn't taste like black sesame.  Some said the mocha tasted like coffee, but I thought it tasted like chinese milk tea. 

We didn't enjoy it at all, but we'll probably come back to try other desserts.  I wouldn't recommend ordering the mochi because the ones at T&T is almost double the size with real ingredients.
