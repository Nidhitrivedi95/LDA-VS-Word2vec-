Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w This place is ehh... I suppose I'd eat here again one day.  Only because I was told I didn't order the 'right dishes'. We ordered Siam wings (so-so), coconut milk tom yum soup (blak), spicy pork chop (eww), and watercrest with garlic (bland).  
We went on a Friday night, and this place is pretty happening.  People around seemed to enjoy the food. 
The portions are big, prices are small.  The service was very good--very attentive and happy to serve.  Updated review..to be continued..
