RI-E3WWC_KMm27EShF3O8Q Can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review for this place considering I usually go here once a week when I am feeling to lazy to cook.

I first came here during a lunch hour as they do lunch specials, that was so long ago that I can not even remember what i ordered or how it was.

Since then I usually come back this way after gym and order the same thing everytime. Szechuan Fish with noodles. The lady who usually serves me is like an aunty now, always happy to see me and knows what i want. 

The portion is great and the fish is so tasty with the spiciness being just spot on. I love garlic as an ingredient so this suits me fine. I never finish the whole thing at once so it usually makes a decent lunch for me the next day. 

Long live King Chef!
