TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ My wife had eaten here for lunch one day and said it was a good meal, we needed dinner, were right next door at the UPS store, so we would save gas and (hopefully) enjoy a good dinner.

A craving for sesame chicken had been creeping in for a while, so that was what both of us ended up ordering. She got the special with soup and a different side, I got the plate with rice only.

When the meal was served up, I received a rather large plate COVERED in a large serving of sesame chicken, wafting up to my olfactory receptors was an inviting aroma of teriyaki and chicken. There was also a surprisingly large container of steamed rice before me as well. Normally, Asian restaurants give a small cup of rice. Not Golden Flower! They actually give enough rice to compliment the generous portion of chicken.

We were both full after making dents into our meals, and had lunch for the next day too! All of this was under $20.00 before tip. Seriously?! Two dinners and two lunches for under $20! It was delicious, good service and big enough portions to eat the next day, this place is a great value to match the quality of food.
