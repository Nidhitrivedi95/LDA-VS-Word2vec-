PRUhSfe7ihf3nLcihudsuQ Thought I give this place a try since its been here for ages but this is going to be my first and last at his place. Their decor and furniture needs some serious TLC. Carpeted floors and chairs that are used back in the 70s and if this place were given a rating on cleanliness it would be a C....their prices are cheap and selection is limited, seems like a lot of ppl get their sandwiches which ranges from $3-$4....quality of food is not that good, my sister found a piece of hair in her noodle (grosssssssssss)....a lot of ppl come here but it seems to be the frequent comers as the waitress are chatting away with them 

Go down 5 mins on south warden to me congee for much better and cleaner food
