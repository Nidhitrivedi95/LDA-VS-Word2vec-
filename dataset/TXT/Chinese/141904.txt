Rh2smrKvcamnP8VBUgMI0Q Terrible service and frozen-dim-sum-like quality food!  

Service:
Even for Chinatown standards this place's service is bad! Carts couldn't get to us (which is fine b/c we were seated in a bad location and it was a busy afternoon).  In such a case ladies would make a decent effort to ask if you wanted anything or the waitresses would take your order and get us food.  Here, no one asked us and the waitress refused to take our order saying that's not her job.  

Then when we finally got food at our table the same waitress moved a dish off the table towards my friend while she had her chopstick in the steamer saying to get out of her way while she cleared out table.  At this point I lost it and told her off and asked for the manager.  The manager finally came and I gave her a ear full and then some but to no avail. 

Food:
If service bad and food is ok then that's ok, but if service and food are bad then hell-to-the-no-way!!!!  The dim sum tasted like the frozen ones you get from the supermarket.  We ordered the usual fair and one of the dishes that came was RANCID (I kid you not).  Finally I saw the worst possible thing, they recycle the sauces.  We ordered fried shrimp dumplings that had mayo for dipping sauce.  We had a lot left over and when they cleared the plate I saw the lady recycle our mayo back onto another plate - disgusting or what?  

Bottom Line:
Don't go unless you want to pay for people to treat you bad and overpay for frozen dim sum.
