WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg This restaurant is buzzing during the day filled with City workers because it is located just behind City Hall. Anyways, I go to this place because of the Manchurian Chicken on rice. IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!! Again, I travel the long distance just to satisfy my craving for this dish. I've had other versions of this spicy dish in other restuarants but at Yueh Tung it is the best in the city, if you like spicy food try this dish.
