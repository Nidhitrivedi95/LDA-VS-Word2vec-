EQDJVVIgenbyNZpRcqUWcw This is our second time here in 1 week! The food is great and the price is right. If you like your food spicy just ask, they will make it as hot as you want. The lady who works the cash register is also very friendly and remembered us after just one visit. I highly recommend eating here.
