K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw Desserts are offered on weekends only, a few varieties of Nyonya Kuih (steamed "cakes" made with some combination of rice flour, glutinous rice or flour, coconut milk, grated coconut, and other yummy ingredients) are available each day but they fly out the door fast.  The stores opens at 11am, once I was there shortly after 12 only to find out that the desserts were almost sold out.  A must-try, but make sure you go early and on weekends only.
