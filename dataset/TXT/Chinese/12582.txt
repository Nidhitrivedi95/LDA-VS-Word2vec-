2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg This is your typical Cantonese comfort food restaurant. Apparently, they're beef brisket stew is quite popular here. I noticed a lot of patrons ordering the beef brisket noodle soup. I ordered the same except with wontons and ho fun noodles! The brisket was nice and tender and the soup was tasty. It wasn't overly salty and I didn't experience a bad MSG headache afterwards. So that's a good sign, ya? I also had a seafood and pork congee. I'm not crazy about them using pork skin in my congee though and wish that they instead use salted pork meat like they do in NY. I noticed this in a few other Cantonese restaurants in Toronto. The congee was a tad less salty than what I'm used to, but that could good sign because some congee places overload the soup with MSG. It might taste great at first, but then you feel like a water balloon. Also, the service could be a tad more attentive. I only had one cup of water during my whole time there.
