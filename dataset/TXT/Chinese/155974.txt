Todrg1F247iuDIm784XHfA I need to bump this up a star.  Having been here a few times now it really is above average for what it is.  The food is always good, never get crunchy rice.  The service is always quick and friendly.  They go their beer and wine thing sorted out a long time ago.  The only thing I would change now is: I happen to prefer sitting in a chair than a booth and the last few times I have been in they have all 8 of the tables set up in pairs to seat 8.  If one of those pairs was split in to 2 4tops then I would seat at a table rather than a booth.
