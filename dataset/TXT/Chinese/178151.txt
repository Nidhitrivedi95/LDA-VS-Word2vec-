X2I47eENvYeVL6QlzAZ0wA Seen this place a while ago while walking up and down yonge street and thought to myself... that's a very long Chinese name for a restaurant. =p. 

The restaurant is narrow, has a couple of tables for 4 along one side, and a bench table on the other. When it's full, you may find yourself waiting 15-20 before getting a seat. 

Menu is pretty easy to navigate. One side has all their side dishes. Other side has all their noodles.  There are pictures to go along. Since it's a Chinese noodle restaurant, the menu is in Chinese, with corresponding English so non Chinese readers should be able to figure out pretty easily. 

I ordered #13 - noodles with house special marinated pork. It comes with your choice of toppings and spicy/numbness level. I decided to go with less spicy and most of the toppings. Extra noodles are free of charge!

Noodle is good. Not too soft and just enough chew. The special marinated pork turns out to be pork belly. The fatty part was cooked through and very soft. The meat part was just a hair overdone, but certainly still very good. 
Unfortunately, I can't comment on the soup. I got less spicy, so I was expecting to taste the flavor of the soup with a bit of a kick. What I ended getting was a lot of kick and a numb tongue and lips. Maybe you need to specify what level of numbness you want... or maybe less numb comes with less spicy.. I don't know, but I certainly could have done without the numbness. If what I had was considered "less spicy" and probably "less numb/regular numb", I can't imagine what regular or extra spicy/numbness would taste like!  

Service is nothing special. All in all, it's a good place and would consider returning.
