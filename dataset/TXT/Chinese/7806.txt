It is located in an unremarkable strip mall with other ethnic restaurants so all I was expecting was a quick Chinese meal to satisfy my hunger.  After that first bite, I was hooked! I went at least two more times during my short 3-day business trip to the area.

The main business (as the name implies) is take out and delivery. There is a small dining area should you decide to eat there.

The food is made fresh each time you order so it is not just sitting in a heated container or buffet for hours.  The meat and vegetables used are high quality so the final product is excellent.  The prices are excellent as well.  I would gladly pay more even if they increase their prices.

I highly recommend the Orange Chicken and Singapore Rice Noodles.  I recommend this place without any reservations.  You can't beat freshly made food!
