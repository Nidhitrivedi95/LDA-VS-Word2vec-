ve7-f5urgRoFvhoez9eUjA In Korea they say "mott oop soy yo" which means "taste there is none" .

I read the reviews and said hey, road trip! An undiscovered gem! 

Nope. The food comes out hot and looks very pretty, but DO NOT come here thinking it will be Thai or even generic chinese food.

Seriously, like my one friend used to say about Taco Bell "mexican food for white people". 

This place is not serving to customers food that they eat themselves. I am truly disappointed. 

This is to Thai food what a hamburger is to Thai food. 

It was hot and served nicely but I would rather have authentic taste and bad service.

Really really really disappointed. Which is hard to do to me, I give out four star ratings like water. Disappointed will never be back.

Tasted like it was made with bottles of sugar water and tuned to the tastes of Amish. I am changing review to one star. This place *****.

Cannot believe I got suckered by a bogus 
4 1/2 star overall rating. Well, consider the locale I guess.
