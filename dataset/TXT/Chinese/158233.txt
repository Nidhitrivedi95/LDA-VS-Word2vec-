TxNeo206T0jMvRRQ4nKSIg Wok of Fame has always been the go to place for a family celebration. Really enjoy the onsite cooking with the wok as well as the unlimited drinks. For an AYCE place, wok delivers a variety of food from freshly cooked food in the wok, to live cooking of prawns, musscles, salmon n steak, to a delicious array of desserts. On your birthday you eat for free by showing your passport. Staff is friendly, place is big n clean. Will continue to go to Wok of Fame!
