By3eFOzWO9Mo0HivLhN8Sg The search for decent Chinese food in the valley continues, as Jong Wah won't be our go-to place.

We started with the Popo Platter. Though we were one of just three tables there on a Saturday night around 7:30, it took nearly 30 minutes for our platter to come out. It was plated beautifully. Unfortunately, the fried shrimp had an odd texture I had to pass on, and the crab ragoon and ribs were barely lukewarm. The highlight was the egg rolls. These were clearly made in-house because the insides were crunchy. As in, not previously frozen and then defrosted mushiness. They were very good.

We ordered Kung Pao chicken and a beef and brocolli dish, plus house fried rice. The two dishes were well spiced. Often spicy dishes are just ungodly spicy where you can't taste anything else, but these actually had some flavor. It's just too bad the quality of beef was so poor you wouldn't want to eat it by itself.

The house fried rice was outstanding, with huge shrimp. We'd highly recommend the rice and eggrolls.

We also had a coupon, and our bill, with one soda, was $40. Ouch. We couldn't make heads or tails of our itemized, handwritten bill.

They do have an outdoor patio.
