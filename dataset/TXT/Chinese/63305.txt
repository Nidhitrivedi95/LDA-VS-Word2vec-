dYQaLCEog1QpQShowSVZig This place is right between work, school and my house so I was really looking forward to discovering a cheap Chinese restaurant that would be so convenient. The outdated, hole-in-wall style was very nostalgic for me and reminded me of cheap-yet-delist places I used to frequent with my folks. 
 Opted for the $5.25 lunch special since it is an awesome deal! Service was super friendly and accommodating, and even let me know that the spring roll did contain pork, seeing as I ordered the sour soup and mixed veggies and rightly suspected I didn't eat meat. Did take-out and the food took about ten minutes to arrive which I feel is perfectly reasonable for good Chinese.
Was pleasantly surprised to find that they add an enormous pile of rice to the veggies making the deal even sweeter. Dish was piping hot but unfortunately seemed to lack flavour halfway through the dish. 
Honestly had three spoonfuls for the soup and had to throw it out; it's contents were extremely rubbery and flavourless, and the broth's texture was thick to a point of almost being gelatinous!
Basically as far as food quality goes, it leaves much to be desired, but perhaps I may have ordered the wrong dish. This place gets three stars because the service was wonderful, the price fantastic, and I'm willing to give them a second chance.
