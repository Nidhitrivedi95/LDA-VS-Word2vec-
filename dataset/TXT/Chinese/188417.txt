yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA This place used to have one of thee best calamari...but all they served us today was batter and hints of the actual squid itself. For twelve something dollars, it wasn't worth it. To top it off, the sauce was not to my liking. I am usually a person to order calamari and putting an end to that at this establishment. The pho was alright, a little on the room temperature/warm side but I was hangry! This place is supposedly recommended to most out of town guests but not one of mine.
