Wa2X66syShuMSVUYAj1C-Q I've lived in Goodyear for 10 years and have tried this place a few times. When they first opened they were decent. But sadly, my recent experience proves they've let all quality and care go by the wayside.
I just had surgery the day before we ordered so I really wanted some decent food.
Ordered:
honey shrimp- SO strange. Battered pieces were huge as if it were battered fish, yet cut it open and there was one smaaaaall shrimp inside. If I had felt better I would have taken a photo it was so sad and comical. And tastes gross.
Wonton soup: no words for how bland and disgusting this was. Seriously.
Teriyaki chicken: I asked for sauce on the side. I got a container full of BOILED chicken with zero seasoning, with disgusting sugary syrup style teriyaki sauce on the side. It was impossible to eat. Even Panda Express teriyaki chicken is so so much better than this!!
Crab Rangoons: purses of overstuffed lumps of cream cheese. No crab. Fried cheese balls. Gross.
House fried rice: this was the only decent thing that we were able to eat. 
We spent $40 and threw most of the food away. Shameful and awful. I will NOT be getting food from Yans again.
