X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ This restaurant is my first experience with Malaysian food.  I really enjoyed it and have been back many times since. The beef satay is one of the best things I've tasted in Chinatown. This is family owned and they are the employees.  I LOVE supporting family owned businesses, especially when the family is actually there working!

PROS: The menu has a picture for EVERY item listed.
             Homemade Green Curry 
             Lo Mee ~ noodles in homemade soy sauce, topped with chicken & mushrooms
             Hokkien Char Mee
             Roti canai
             ***The COCONUT PUDDING**** Served INSIDE a coconut ~ ice cold!! 

CONS: Could use music or something atmospheric.

They also have really cool lighting fixtures if you happen to look up.  Located in the Asian Pacific shopping plaza ~ on the 2nd level
