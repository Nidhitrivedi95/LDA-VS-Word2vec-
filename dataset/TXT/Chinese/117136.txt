nChi_8Gygb6NUMa_kg_tlQ Asian Fusion is relatively new spot that replaced Hazelrock Café. It's quite a transformation from the quiet, empty coffee shop. The proximity of the location to the ASU campus makes it an easy pick. The staff is really friendly and helpful when deciding what to choose from the menu if you are not familiar with some of the dishes. The spot seems to draw a lot of the Asian students from ASU which is a good sign. The food was delicious and large in portions. I absolutely loved the décor around the restaurant and the wall that depicts a Chinese district/street. It's a great place if you want some Asian food that's not fast food and close to campus. 

Appetizer: Pot stickers- They were good but not fantastic at $4.99. Tasted about the same as the frozen pot stickers you can buy at the store.

Entrees: 
1. Singapore Rice Vermicelli $9.99 - Delicious but I think a little dry. The flavoring and spice on the noodles were just right. 
2. Chow Mein $8.99 - the noodles were amazing! I'd say it almost tasted better than Singapore noodles but I can't. 

Dessert: Taro snow with condensed milk, red bean, and strawberries. Had good flavor and was enough to fill us up just right at the end of our meal. We had really wanted to try the Condensed Milk Toast because a friend recommended it, but we were too late since they stop serving toast at 4 or 5pm. I guess it's a tea-time thing.
