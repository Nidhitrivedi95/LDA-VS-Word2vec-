yAkaDc6MWX3dy8bnEcCrRQ Imperial Garden is a Madison treasure. It is one of my favorite places to go celebrate or maybe have a date night with my honey. My favorite dish is the crispy duck, We also often order their appetizers which are both yummy and more than we can ever finish. I have never had bad service and we have been there many many times. It is beautiful inside and a very relaxing place to share a meal. I always have enough for another meal the next day!
