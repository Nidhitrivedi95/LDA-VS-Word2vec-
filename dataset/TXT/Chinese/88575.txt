I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Alright, so I visited this place for the first time I went to Phoenix before returning back home to Florida. 

First off, I'd like to thank them for their awesome service and accommodation. We arrived a little earlier than opening time as they were setting up & allowed us to sit inside with our puppy as we waited. (YES, they allow pets). It was awesome and made us feel very welcome from the start.

I stumbled across this place thanks to the reviews and photos other yelpers had posted. So when the gentleman at the cashier I explained to him about it being our first time and there was one particular picture that caught my eye & though I did not know what it was, all I had to show him was the picture and he explained what it was and started making it right away. 

They give you the choice of size, flavored ice(s), toppings, and sauces. Since I wasn't sure what sauce would taste best (though both were described to me) he surprised me with adding both on my dish. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!

It was fulfilling, delicious, flavorful, and just enough to cure a sweet tooth craving without an overwhelming taste. I just HAD to share thee picture the moment I saw it & good thing I did, because it was not pretty for long once you dive in.

As I am no longer in the Arizona region, I am already planning my trip to Phoenix again and Snoh is (and forever will be) on my list.
