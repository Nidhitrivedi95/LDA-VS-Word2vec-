EQZPTDAy-lWijb0i8JpHNw Typically nondescript decor, but a warm and friendly welcome is an excellent sign of what follows: quite simply the freshest and most flavourful dumplings north of Joe's Shanghai  in New York. And you get to watch them being made from scratch by the hands of the staff; then proudly put before you to slurp and enjoy.
And the price is also great : $7.95 for 15!!

Equally enticing is the option of ordering and then hanging about for 10 minutes to take home and boil up a simple and delicious meal!!
