GuvbQ3bCMw6xfUfCQ8N1LA Another example of a well run mom and pop shop for a Chinese restaurant.  Good place for take out, prices are very reasonable and taste is great!  I especially like the deep fried chicken wings and the Fried Shanghai Noodles dish.  No long waits for orders, and nice to see the open concept kitchen and seeing the chef use the wok and the "wok hai" to cook my food!! Too bad there weren't more of these restaurants around North York, as I always have to make the journey down to Gerrard and Jones for this.
