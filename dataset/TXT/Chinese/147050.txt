s9zNmeJIu83WVL56QNLD2A Panda Express is so good at this location. The store is clean and the staff has great customer service. There are times when certain sides are not available because they ran out and that's fine for me because I know that our dishes are freshly being made. I like the fact that they preach no MSG into their food too, it provides a sense of knowledge that you know what you're putting into your body. Their portioning are pretty big, each time they scoop something up they pack in the plate's compartment as much as possible. I only go to this location because at the other locations their rice and chow mein were dry and some of their sides tasted gross.
