9ibMbke1qYbmhJ2Qf3tWfA Love Dragon Express! Superb service, clean restaurant and delicious food that never disappoints! Bonus that it's very close to our house. My kids get the teriyaki chicken and orange chicken and love it. I usually get the ginger chicken w/ broccoli and have tried the general tsao's chicken which are great every time! Hubby gets the edamame and either shrimp w/ lobster sauce or dragon wonton soup. He's never left hungry or disappointed!
