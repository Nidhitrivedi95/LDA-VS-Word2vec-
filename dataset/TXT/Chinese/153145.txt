t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg My wife called me and ask if I know any Chinese's restaurant on her way home from work. I looked in Yelp and found Chop Chop Wok. When she came home she had lots of good food to eat. She told me she order the family meal which was about $25.00. It came with soup, three main courses, rice and egg rolls. The food was really good the next time we are in the mood for Chinese's food we will head to Chop Chop Wok
