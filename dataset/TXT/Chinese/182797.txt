XjmHPe0H91BlJ3gwJb7OiA Well, this place is busy to the max around dinner hours from 5:30-7, it slows down a bit right after 7:30. Reserve for quicker access to seat. 

I went with a friend and ordered the Peking duck (35$), salt and pepper shrimp (7.99$) and clams in black bean sauce (7.99$). Everything was pretty decent and average tasting. The prices were also decent. 
However, there must have been something off as I had a major stomach ache and pains for the whole night after that meal. 
Overall, for what it costs, it was alright. Would I go back? Maybe, to try the lunch special... Or if I'm around the area. :)
