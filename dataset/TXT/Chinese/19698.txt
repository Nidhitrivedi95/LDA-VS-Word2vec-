5PcW2QipC23t_g71rdCCcw Fok Yuan Seafood Restaurant is located inside the strip plaza near the food court area. I did not even know it exist because I never see it when I drive along Midland Ave. But on a cold winter night, my friend ask why we go eat some hot pot but not the AYCE type.

The interior looks and feels dated. This place totally has this old school feel. 

As planned we ordered: Chicken <U+6E05><U+5E73><U+96DE>($15.99) + Herbal Soup Base <U+85E5><U+6750><U+6E6F><U+5E95>($4) + Fatty Beef <U+80A5><U+725B>($12.99)

Great for a cold day as the broth and the chicken both suppose to be immune-stimulating and restorative. All I know was I feel warm and fuzzy after I finished my meal.

Service here is fast and efficient. 

A decent place if you want some cheap eat.
