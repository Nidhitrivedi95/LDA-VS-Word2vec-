U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q This is the WORST RESTAURANT IN VEGAS.  Stay away from this place.  Do not get lured in by the overcrowded fish tanks and hand tossed noodles.  Open the menu first and you will be in for sticker shock.  Chinese noodles for $20 bucks?  "Kobe" (notice the quotation marks)  Beef Noodles for $99?!   This place is one sick joke after another.

WARNING:  DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!  It's not as upscale as you might think.  It's a tourist trap... I mean it!

We are seated by a deceptively hot waitress only to be served by an extremely mean spirited chinese lady who ... CANNOT SPEAK ENGLISH?!  I politely ask her to get someone that can take our order.  She keeps talking in Mandarin hammering it over and over and over and over my poor little brain.  The constant yapping in a foreign language... maybe she thought i would get it?!

If your selling an upscale product to affluent customers, at LEAST speak in a polite manner and don't toss the menu's at your patrons.  SERIOUSLY
I get that service in Chinatown all the time but not at a $20 a pop wannabe-upscale-noodle place

So after the nightmare, we try the noodles.  To my surprise ... it TOTALLY SUCKS.  I've been to Hong Kong and Shanghai and trust me they are ripping you off BIG TIME!

Did I mention this is THE WORST RESTAURANT IN LAS VEGAS???
