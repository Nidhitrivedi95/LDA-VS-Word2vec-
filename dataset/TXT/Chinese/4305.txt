_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w - RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST
- CASH OR CANADIAN DEBIT CARD ONLY
- BE PREPARED FOR ADDITIONAL CHARGES (you will never be able to just pay for the menu price)

The food here is amazing and definitely worth the hype.  We made reservations early to ensure we get a table since we were driving in from Chicago.  We ate here two nights in a row because we really wanted to try the various dishes.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any king crab when we got there, so we had to eat lobster two nights in a row.  The first night we had the lobster mountain for four people and the second night we had the lobster entrees for four people.  The food was fresh and delicious.  They also give you gloves to use to not dirty your hands. The service was very nice and friendly, but the biggest beef I had with this restaurant were the random charges they would add to our bill.  I was already aware this place was cash or debit card only.  It wasn't a problem.  The first night they added extra money for the lobster being 1lb over weight, which was fine, but made no sense.  They charged us close to $30, but their menu stated $19/lb.  We didn't make a fuss and paid the amount.  The second night it was a cheaper menu and again they tacked on $20 or so for the lobster being over weight.  Again, they told us ahead of time, but the price is just random.  They ended up adding 10%+ for tax or whatever this charge was for that we didn't have the first night. We asked the manager and they said it was for taxes, but it wasn't on the receipt or the check they gave us. Again, just some random amount to boost up the total bill.  Just be prepared coming here that you will NEVER pay the price that is on the menu and there will always be additional charges they try to add on to your bill.  Be careful.
