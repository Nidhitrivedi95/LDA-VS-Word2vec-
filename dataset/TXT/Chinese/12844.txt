I'm a fan of Chinese culture. I traveled to Beijing and ate the most I could there. I'm not joking when I say that the selection of food in China, was almost as wide as in this restaurant...

I looked into both menus, and took me more than one cup of tea to decide what to ask for. I ordered a bowl of shark soup, and the boneless duck with spicy sauce. My husband, the Chow Mein, and a pork/duck- noodle soup.

I thought, they would tell me that they ran out of shark soup, maybe because they needed a bigger order, or simply, cuz nobody asks for it. But I was wrong. They brought it, and it was delicious.

The duck was really good as well.

I realized you can't get disappointed in a place like this. In where the majority of customers were happy Chinese people, of all kind of ages; enjoying their perfect meals.
