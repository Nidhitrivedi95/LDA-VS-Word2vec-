ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w I visited Kwan last weekend with my girlfriend. While the service seemed slightly disorganized (your usual new-restaurant issues - will certainly improve with time), the food was above average and very delicious. Tea was great, cutlery and dishes were a little more upscale, as is the decor. Clearly a lot of efforts has been put into the entire package in a bid to separate it from the average Chinatown dim sum restaurant. I will certainly be back!
