uNjoyF_qlLqOSEEYVpTkLg Rol San's had a 30 min wait and so, we decided to come here instead. Sunday noon dim sum is the goal. Service is mediocre, typical unhappy employees but it's kind of what is expected from Chinese places no surprise here. Food was surprisingly good and really cheap - $2.08 for small and $3.80 for large. Our bill for two came under $20 so I'm a happy camper lol Place is getting old but decent and all-in-all, I suggests swinging by on the weekend/holiday for frugal dim sim!
