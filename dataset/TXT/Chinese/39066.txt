AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw Sister place of City Hollywood at Market Village, it seems that this owner decided to open up a second location due to the success of its original location.  Would I call it a success, well for starters it was merely impossible to get the attention of the waiter.  Our party came here on a weeknight just after 7pm the place was a little busy with staff on all corners of the restaurant.
The interior decor of the place is nice, and its definitely an upgrade from the original location which looks like it needs some cleaning up to occur. 
In terms of food options, Cafe HOllywood has a great selection of morning, lunch, and dinner specials that include soup and tea/ cold drink/ dessert, etc. 
For the food option I decided to order their Stone-bowl (porcelain) korean dish with beef and veggies.  I must say the presentation of the dish was lovely......thankfully there was not too much rice, but more content...it was nonetheless an enjoyable eat! if you're into spice id ask for their thick chili sauce(almost smokey) and add it to this dish.. :) 
The prices are reasonable, however what I didn't agree was they actually..... actually charge you $0.25 for a take out container... hmmm...... really? 

For this place to even more clients, id suggest they get rid of that drive thru, because it makes the place look tacky from the outside and make it a patio area....more cha-ching!!!!!  I mean...we all knew it was BURGER KING back-in-the-days lol...Drive-thru anyone?
