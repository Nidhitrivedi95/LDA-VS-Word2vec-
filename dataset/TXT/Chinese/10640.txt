YOU HAVE TO GET THE Fried Shrimp Wonton, this is a must. Their curry beef is also pretty yummy! Their Hainan Chicken is 2nd best in town especially for the price. (my first pick would be from Flock & Fowl)  They did raise their prices by about 50 cents... but every entree/meal here is just about 5-6 dollars, with a good amount of food. Very authentic, very good.
