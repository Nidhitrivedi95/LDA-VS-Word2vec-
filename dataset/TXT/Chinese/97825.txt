JQrh2cmndqRKwTpVveHPDg The most disorganized operation in restaurant business. Both Markham & Richmond Hill location. First experience was 14 months ago and we had waited 2 hrs and we've asked the hostess and she just totally ignore me then we decided to leave. Our second experience was yesterday we figure to try out their Richmond Hill location, supposedly space is a bit bigger but not better. numerous of customers were screaming how come their tables were given to another people behind their line and the hostess also ignored them. We waited for an hour and I finally decided to leave and say final goodbye to this establishment.
