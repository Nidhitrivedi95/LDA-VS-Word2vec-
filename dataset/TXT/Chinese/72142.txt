FexomhlA5G7ipOEH3pqFkA The decor is very chic. Place clean. Food was so-so and very expensive. Took the Maitai drink and it was gross. Took one of the beef plates and it was overly spicy...almost chocked on it. Probably dropped the pepper shaker in. The fried Wonton dessert was blah... The worst part was the service. Our waitress was snooty and wouldn't even make eye contact with me and was pretentious.  Dissapointed. Don't recommend.  2 stars....for decor.
