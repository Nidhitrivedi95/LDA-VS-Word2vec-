0Eqjt54KPklmWTsly9ltyQ Holy hell!!! Is there ANY decent Chinese food in Toronto? Take me back to basic, cheap US Chinese food. This place is straight putrid! Only edible item in our $40 order was the fried rice. The wontons were especially suspect. $6 for a box of greasy old triangles...some of which had a microscopic bit of "meat???" In them. The dipping sauce was a congealed red blob. The hot and sour soup was opaque bright orange....again lumps of congealed....something..???...in it. Could not eat. Everything else was crazy bland...including the human beef supposedly their specialty.
For real, I give up on your Chinese food Canada.
