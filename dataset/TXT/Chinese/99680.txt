Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Not gonna lie, it's not the best I've ever had but it's affordable and hits the spot when you're in a hurry and craving dim sum. 
What keeps me coming back is the service. It's pretty good compared to other establishments. There's literally no wait time. From the second you sit down, hot & steamy carts roll up with friendly servers, I like that. And they are very accommodating when you request an item that isn't already being served that day.
