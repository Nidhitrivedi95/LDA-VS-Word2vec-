Food is awesome. They have a lot of different variety. My favorite is the shrimp wonton with egg noodles! They also have an awesome dessert and drinks menu which is very authentic. To top it all off, everything is very fairly priced and I never pay more than $7 for a meal.

Service is also very awesome. It's a (fairly) new restaurant so there aren't usually that many customers, which helps with good service. The decor is nice and very spacious, so I always feel comfortable. My mom is friends with the owner, so they always welcome me and make sure they say 'hi' when I stop by :) 

Overall, I would definitely suggest this place to everybody! I have brought at least 3 of my friends here + family because I love it so much! :D
