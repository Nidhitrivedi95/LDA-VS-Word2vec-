I have been eating from canton for 2 years now. Mostly I am satisfied. 
For the portion size you get, the price is good. The food is good but not great.
The service is pretty darn horrible though. This is to be expected though.

Overall, I would half-heartedly recommend Canton Chilli, especially to those who are financially restricted. For me as a student it has been great to have cheap food for late night study sessions.
