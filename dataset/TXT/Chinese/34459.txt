aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ Spring Rolls is just not doing it. They're not doing Asian food, they're not doing Thai food, they're not doing anything substantial or worth eating.

Their Pad Thai is dry and pasty, their curries are filled with fatty meat and mostly cabbage (Really? Are vegetables that expensive?), and their Chinese dishes are so bland it doesn't make sense.

This location of Spring Rolls is always busy, no matter what the time, because of the central location. When I was in school, I'd sometimes stop by their takeout window and order food to go, food that I always thought would be better the next time round. 

Nope. not yet. Spring Rolls cuts too many corners to have good food, and they're laughing because Canada hasn't had Yelp to tell them otherwise. Well, now they do. Beware to anyone visiting Toronto -- we do have good Thai restaurants! Spring Rolls is not one of them.
