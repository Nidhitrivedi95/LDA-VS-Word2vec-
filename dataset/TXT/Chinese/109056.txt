lkvHG6proAFP8_evKhdxKA I've said it before and I'll say it again- you cannot beat china town prices for the amount of food you get. The main woman who runs this store is amazing and very sweet and friendly. Great hours and super conveniently located along dundas accessible both by dundas streetcar or Spadina streetcar and short walk. I'm a regular here and will continue to be. The deals are crazy good and I love the pork buns here. 3 for two dollars- what? Amazing!!!
