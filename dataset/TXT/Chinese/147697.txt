SbwUKzeMlSZs-mQt0lOGQw I was here for a typical Chinese Wedding banquet.  Having DJ'd in umpzillion various facilities, I'd say this was alright.  There happened to be another wedding in the same place (divided by a thin wall), and there was a battle of who could be the loudest.  I think the other party won.

This place reminds me of some Chinese interpretation of European decadence that'd easily be found in Shanghai somewhere.  The room was decked out in Gold, and by the time I left I was seeing yellow spots everywhere.

The food was on par with a traditional Chinese banquet menu.  The umpteen courses included the traditional displays of riches: suckling pig, abalone, lobster, shark fin soup.  Abalone was served as an entire chunk as opposed to the thinly sliced version.  Ethics aside, abalone and shark fin is the most overrated food items in the world, and I seriously wouldn't miss it if they were ever taken off the menu permanently.  At a cost of over $100 a kg for abalone, I'd rather take a hunk of prime kobe beef or premium cocaine any day. 

The couple seemed happy with the place and us guests were in fine form which I guess at the end of the day is what really matters.
