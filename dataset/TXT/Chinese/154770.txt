tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw Given that I was hesitant to try this place, I'm not surprised with how things turned out. My husband won a bet so it was his choice - enough said. 

The service was fast and friendly. Not sure if this was per usual or just because the restaurant was dead. We arrived just in time to take advantage of the lunch special which was nice. 

We ordered the wontons and they came only with cream cheese and plum sauce (similar to sweet and sour). I was hoping they would have had a little flavor, but they did not. Green onions would have made a huge difference! 

The tangerine chicken was good. However, there were inedible pieces of orange peel and whole chilies on the plate. The sauce was very sweet with very little flavor. On a positive note, the chicken was all white meat and was large in portion. 

My husband really liked his Singapore noodles. He even enjoyed the egg roll that came with my lunch special (I thought it was burnt and too greasy). 

Overall, our experience was OK.
