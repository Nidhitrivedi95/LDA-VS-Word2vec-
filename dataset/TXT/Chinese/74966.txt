fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg 3.5 stars really , but nonetheless I had a pleasant dining experience. The staff are very friendly and attentive until it comes time to pay your check. The food wasn't bad but really overpriced. The decor is gorgeous and the outdoor patio is a perfect evening setting. We ordered a few items off the dim sum cart and added egg rolls and shrimp tempura along with a bbq pork Singapore noodles. The shrimp dumplings were standard fare, nothing special. The 2 pieces of shrimp tempura ($6.95) were coated in panko not tempura batter. The chicken egg rolls were crisp yet filled with vermicelli noodles so the kids didn't like them. The Singapore noodles were quite tasty although the bbq pork was thin and tough like sliced jerky. The soda was $2.98 which is expected in this high priced restaurant. If you're in downtown summerlin there are many other better options for dining. Otherwise just drive to Chinatown for half the price and double the flavor.
