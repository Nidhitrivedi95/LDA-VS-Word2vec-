zLC9OtK3SKAW_g6SXijr4w Family owned Chinese Buffet, 

I really enjoy Chang's Chinese Buffet,  off 43Ave in Glendale, stop by for lunch or dinner, this family restaurant offers a buffet that adds dishes daily.  The hours are nice because the place is open a little bit later than most restaurants.  Everything is worth a try and when i eat hear I'm always getting a 2nd or 3rd plate.  

jessica C. one star review, hmm, she has one review and non of her 6 friends have more than one review, that s why I love yelp, bogus reviews are easily seen.
