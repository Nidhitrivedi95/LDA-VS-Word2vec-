KqC7y46lAjWAksfKsWStWw This is it folks Spicy Szechuan at its best. Its been a while since I've been here last, but from what I can remember thei food portions were huge. So order wisely. I usualy get their szeuchuan noodles, rice, this other item that I cant really remember atm, and also on occasions some nice yummy cow stomach. Not gross, you dont really smell anything much and the meat is nice and tender. The flavors are incredible plus the prices decent so you can come really anytime. 

On the flavours itself the food is not at all oily from what Im used to and the staff is always accomodating to your tastes buds. As great on the eyes you even can smell the soulness and the quality never fails. They are mostly honest with their menus, so you can tell them about any of your allergies including MSG. They will patiently try to make the experience as less trouble free as possible. 
The staff is moderately friendly, and service really on time. This is great for a group of 4, for good interaction or even couples who want little time together enjoying over good food. I always leave with a big stomach so come with a good apetite. Enjoy!!!
