vEwazCciremwBgkRJgfXtw I totally recommend the Crispy Chicken Lunch special.  I usually get the general tso's which is my good old stand by..  I tried the Crispy Chicken today and it should have been called AMAZING chicken because it was outstanding!~!!

The chicken is white not dark and breaded and the sauce is a little spicy and its mixed with vegetables - and mix with some steamed rice..  its PERFECTION!!!  

I totally recommend. The orders are always accurate and the food is always delicous.

Thanks Kiyoshi.
