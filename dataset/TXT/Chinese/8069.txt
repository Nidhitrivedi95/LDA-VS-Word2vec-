1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w Been to PF Changs many many times and their food is always good. I was at this location with a pretty large group, eight people, this week and we had a good experience. The waiter was very nice and although it was confusing for everyone, he helped us with splitting the checks. Some of the appetizers were a little on the slow side to come out and they were on top of it, Manager came out and comped the appetizers for us without us really needing to say anything. Surprisingly, they have one of the best moskow mules I've ever had.
