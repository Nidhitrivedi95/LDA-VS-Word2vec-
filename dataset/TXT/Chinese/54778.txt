cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw This is the place you don't to give it try.  Wait for 40 minutes for just 2 beef noodle soup. And food is so bad and salty. And price is too high. Also ask soup and noodle separate apart.  After go home noodle and soup still in one container. The noodle is so soft. Can't even eat. I will give this place -5 star.  Hope this place will close down soon.
