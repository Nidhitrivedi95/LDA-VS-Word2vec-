L_tieGcFMQVSmk7XiA093A This place is great! The price is comparable to other hot pot places nearby like Morals Village or Little Sheep Mongolian hot pot, but the ingredients are fresher. Everything, from the meat to the veggies and seafood, tastes better and is fresher than at other places. My wife says this is the best hot pot place in Toronto, and I agree--Of course, I always agree with her about anything... That's a free marriage tip guys!
