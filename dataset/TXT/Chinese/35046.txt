aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg This place is so yummy! I love their shrimp dumplings, bbq pork w/ egg noodle soup and the crispy bread sticks. But pretty much everything looks delicious. They're always busy here(that's always a good sign). The service has always been pleasant, and the prices are very reasonable.
