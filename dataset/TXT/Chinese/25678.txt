7F6JYzEDGs2d2mYW_To57A One night the whole family was there for dinner, the following dishes were ordered:

Beef with Stir-fried Onion
Stir-fried Fish with Vegetables
Hot Pot Stir-fry
Sweet and Sour Chicken
Sesame and Sugar Coated Taro
Eight Treasure Rice
Yeung Chow Fried Rice
Seafood Soup
Sweet Sticky Rice Ball Soup (dessert)

We loved the dishes however, we waited a long time since the place was packed.  Instead of the main courses, they started off with the desserts.  We had to ask several times for the waiters to bring us our meal.  

I suggest you go there early as 5:30 PM for dinner so that there are less people and you can enjoy a savory Sichuan dinner without interruption.
