SWDEdiv_v1QppobT1YnEPA If you are looking for a nice, high class restaurant to take someone, Chin's is not the place. If you are looking for a nice family owned Chinese place with good food and friendly workers, it is the place.

The food is good, and strikes me as at least slightly more authentic than some other places. They have a good selection of food for omnivores, and their vegetarian selection isn't bad--I think they'd be happy to make substitutes as well. The takeout menu is small--I have no idea why--but if you know the menu you can order whatever. As others have noted, they have great egg rolls. The also have pretty awesome fortune cookies.

The interior is a bit dated, a bit dark, a bit run down, but it has always been clean when I've gone. The front desk is cluttered, but the place is not actually dirty. 

I have always had great and friendly service there. Also, when my wife and I ordered vegetable dishes the waitress noticed and offered to bring us a vegetarian soup instead of the regular. 

I wish they delivered, but overall I think it's a great place, even with its flaws.
