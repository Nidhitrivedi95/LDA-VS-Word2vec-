uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw We always come here late night as they are open 24/7. The restaurant has around 20 small tables. They are usually full, even late at night. The mainly serve noodle bowls and side dishes. They make the noodles in front of you. And you are given the selection of extra thin noodles to curtain flat noodles. The prices for these noodle bowls are very reasonably priced. I tried the lamb, beef, and beef brisket. The lamb was okay, nothing special. The beef noodle bowl is what keeps us coming back. Their soup is flavorful, noodles are decent.
