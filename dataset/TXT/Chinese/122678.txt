OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw This is definetely one of the nicest dim sum restaurants I've been to, as in CLEAN and in good condition, which makes for a much nicer atmosphere. The food was great as well, it was Friday during lent, so we weren't really supposed to be having meat, but we did slip a few times, with the steamed buns with pork which were very good, and the tripe which was excellent. The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was excellent, very fresh, and cooked perfectly, with a nice crispness to it. The desserts were great as well, this is the only dim sum place I've been to which offered sweet rice cake, which I love, and the egg custard was awesome as well, with a nice flaky crust and rich egg filling. The prices weren't bad either. I can definetely recommend this place.
