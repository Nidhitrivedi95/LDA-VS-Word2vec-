pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA The last time we were in Vegas, we had a chance to celebrate our anniversary here. I had called last minute to see if they would take a reservation for later in the day. Host was very accomodating. The food was amazing, our server was really attentive and took the time to answer all our questions. We got a few apps, and sushi and then splurged on the wagyu that you can cook on the hot rock. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the Peruvian corn that came with the skewers, some kernels were undercooked and temp was only slightly warm. Regardless meal was great. Might be our most expensive meal yet lol. They even gave us a complimentary dessert being a special occasion. Will definitely try to eat here again next time we are in town.
