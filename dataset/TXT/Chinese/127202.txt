We ordered a bowl of congee, Tiger shrimp E-fu noodles, duck, roasted pig and a plate of veggies.

We were 1 of 2 tables seated. So a quiet night.

Food:
The E-fu noodles were so sad. One of the most expensive e-fu noodles ($14) on their menu and it came with 6 pieces of shrimp, shredded ginger and strips of green onions with some sauce that was tasteless. The whole dish was bland and the noodles were soggy. Good e-fu noodles, to me, have to have some bite to it, some texture. The tiger shrimp was over cooked and tough.

The roasted pig's skin wasn't crispy.

The veggie stocks were literally 1 inch in diameter. They tested your degree of Canadian by practicing being a beaver, chomping on these trees. They were cooked well though. They had a crunch to them and were cooked through which is the way I like.

The congee was congee. And their dough fritters were dough fritters, you can't mess those up having CONGEE written on the front of your restaurant.
