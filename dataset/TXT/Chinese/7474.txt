0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Love the crispy beef so much that I hardly try anything else. Other reviewers have mentioned receiving dried out steamed rice and, yes, I've had that happen to me once too. The General Tao chicken is good, the sauce is quite thick and coloured red. A friend had the butter chicken, I wasn't a fan of it but to each their own.
