yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I was in Vegas for new years weekend and we decided to eat here. Good food but the wait was crazy....extremely busy. Service was okay but i wasnt expecting much because of how busy they were. I had one of their Vermecilli dishes (always do at Vietnamese places) and it was one of the best I've had. Definitely check this place out if you get a chance.
