RJKbewB0SzRZpIvQmiF-dQ I'm new to the area and didn't know what my delivery options were. Based on the reviews, this place sounded like a home run. I was so disappointed! The food is reasonably priced, they deliver for $12 min, and delivery was quick, so it warrants 2 stars. I also love the fried noodles they included with my soup. Unfortunately, everything about my General Tso's combo was subpar. The meat was all dark meat, and some of it quite fatty. The fried shrimp that came with it tastes old, as did the rice (and who messes up fried rice?).  In the unlikely event that I order from them again, I will steer clear of the chicken!
