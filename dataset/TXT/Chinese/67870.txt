EnOCjP3wBpoICvEZXil4Cg The food is great, that's the only good thing I can say about this place. The service was horrible. The waitress was slow, barely spoke English, and was rude when asked questions. They also don't serve beer like most of the restaurants in this area. Get your food to go, or skip this place.
