CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Noodles at The Bellagio is a noodle house extraordinaire!  Prices are on the high end.  But that's what you usually pay when you're on the Strip.  We waited in line for about 15 minutes and we were promptly seated.  At first, the lady at the restaurant said it would be for 1/2 hour!  So that was quick!  

We ordered the following dishes since we are originally Singaporean:
- RotI Prata - Good and flaky roti prata where you dip it in the a small dish of curry.  The curry has authentic taste and the chef uses curry leaves to enhance the flavor of the curry.  There could be a little more curry so that I could sop up my roti prata.
- Laksa - Delicious and very close to the authentic Singapore Laksa Lemak!  That coconut broth reminds me of home right away!
- Hainanese Chicken Rice - So-so.  I've had better.  The chicken has the correct Hainanese taste and so does the rice but I think the chicken could be more moist.  Also, the chili sauce that comes with the platter is not the correct Hainanese chili.  The ginger sauce is ok.
- Penang Char Kway Teow with Shrimp - it's just ok for me.  Not enough sweet black sauce.

So overall, I'd come back to have the Laksa for sure.
