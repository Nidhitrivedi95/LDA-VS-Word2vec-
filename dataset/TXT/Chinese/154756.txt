Tf299O_MA5NFrgqagutOjw I will add myself to the like side of these reviews. I have been to this place many times and have always had good food.

The menu is large ...true. However if you frequent Asian restaurants often you will have no problem. Every thing is categorized very well, so once you know what you want (IE Bun, Soup, Rice etc) you should have no problem.

I find the value very good for what you get.

If you are getting take out. It can be tricky with the larger bowls. The take out containers are not large enough for what you get. Best to have a larger bowl on hand at home to transfer soup to.

My Fav is the H01 Hu Tieu Ga Super Bowl ($7.25) ...a very large bowl of soup that has the tastiest broth. ...lots of liquid, so I don't recommend getting a drink with it.

I also always start with the KR05 Shredded Pork Krystal Rolls (2) $4.25 ...a very good roll that comes with Hoisin Sauce for dipping ...yum

The only bad thing that I could say about this place is that at times the service can be a little slow. Typically they only have one wait staff on. Not a problem most times, but the place can get busy fast. Even so well worth the wait.
