S9CrHJJnns3cqdGca7mQWQ Very disappointed. Orange chicken had good flavor but the actual chicken was uncooked! Honey Walnut shrimp had an awkward taste. Could only eat a couple bites before having to throw it out. Biggest let down of all was the Thai tea..... It came in a can! It was awful!!!! Nasty!!! Veggie Fried Rice was the only  edible thing we ordered. Altogether a huge waste of 40$
