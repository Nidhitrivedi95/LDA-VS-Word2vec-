D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw This place is a small very neat and classy joint next to a Wells Fargo in Vegas that killed it. 
The chicken satay were the best ever. 
Crab rangoons were amazing and the Tom Yum medium hot was very hot but also very tasty. 
I love this place and it's really good. 
Highly recomended !
