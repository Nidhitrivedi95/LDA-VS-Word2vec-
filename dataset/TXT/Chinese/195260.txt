zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Having been to Japan 3 times (and spoiled by my Japanese friends) I'm a teeny, teeny bit of a ramen snob.

Momofuku is adjacent to the Shangri-La hotel, which is where we were staying. This was a good place for a light meal at the end of our day.

Pork buns were delicious. The pork slices were definitely fatty, but that's what made them so good! The sauce, scallions, and cucumber were a great touch!

The Momofuku ramen was very meh. The noodles were cooked nicely; the perfect al-dente consistency. In my book, there are few things more evil than soggy noodles. I was just craving a traditional miso broth or thick pork broth, so I felt disappointed at the flavor profile of their Momofuku broth. Note - the egg is a softly poached egg, not a soft-boiled egg (which I would've preferred.) Keep in mind that once you break the yolk, it will change the flavor of the broth.

We also tried the Ginger Scallion ramen (veg) which had shittake mushrooms and cabbage. I liked this one a lot, but it felt a bit more like a salad appetizer. It didn't come with broth.

The okonomiyaki was very disappointing. It was far too salty, and just tasted like they piled mayo and oyster sauce on top of a regular pancake. Bleh.

For the food you're getting, Momofuku is fairly expensive, and there are a ton of Japanese-themed restaurants in the region better deserving of your money. I might return to try the ice cream, but probably nothing else.

Service was good - no complaints there.
