ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ Came here today for a lunch meeting and had an interesting mix of dimsum and dishes from the menu.  Service was much better than I had expected and the food was pretty good as well.  For dimsum we had the chicken feet and durian pastry.  Not a big fan of durian but everyone else on the table enjoyed it.  Chicken feet was meaty and tasty.  We had several dishes from the menu.  The lobster noodles was really good but the best dish was the roast duck.  Skin is crispy and meat was tender.  
Will come back again.
