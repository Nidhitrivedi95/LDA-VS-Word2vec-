C7oHVsJyxNGH2D9yXUB2kw Not so secret place in the Financial District.  
Mole your way over to King & University through the path and you will happen upon the best take out Chinese food in the path.  2 choices with steamed rice for $6.50 or 1 choice for $5.  
Free tea, even!
The food is pretty good and not your typical Chinese fast food fare of sweet n sour pork or chicken balls with that god awful red sauce. 
Modern Wok's food is fairly authentic as the long queue of Chinese people (and non-Chinese in the know) can testify.  
Had the spicy eggplant with ground pork and stir fried choy-sum with shitake.  yum!!
