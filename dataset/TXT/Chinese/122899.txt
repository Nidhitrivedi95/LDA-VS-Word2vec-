OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Three of us was here Friday noon to get some dim sum. I ordered:
5 Shrimp Noodle Rolls (best I've ever tried)
2 Chicken Feet 
1 Chinese Broccoli
1 Shu Mai
3 Tofu Dessert (with Sugar Water)
The foods were so good and the service was quick and perfect.They paid attention to customers so much that they took away all the empty dishes after I just finished it and they even filled the tea immediately when it ran out. I would definitely recommend my family and friends to come here! BTW TRYING THE SHRIMP NOODLE ROLLS IS A MUST!
