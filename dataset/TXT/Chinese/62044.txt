DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA As a long time resident of Las Vegas and a downtown resident I have witnessed the demise of traditional Chinese restaurants such as Fong's Garden on east Charleston and more recently Las Vegas Chinese downtown, replaced by Nacho Daddy. Thought I would try Sam Woo in China Town. Food was good but service was very bad. The biggest disappointment of all is their "Cash Only" policy!!! Really??? This is 2013 almost 2014. Leads one to believe that sales are not properly reported to the IRS let a lone the inconvenience of customers not able to use debit or credit cards. You have permanently lost my business.
