hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q I am sad that I no longer live in walking distance but I still get take out from here and my favorite is the 7pc sushi with tuna roll and extra wasabi - I like my nose to run :)  I have never been disappointed with the food and actually really want some now that I am writing this. The staff is always friendly, the decor is clean and crisp and, if you eat there - the saki is yummy as is the edamame.
