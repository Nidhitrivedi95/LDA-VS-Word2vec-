2UdoeXzcFg87O1VMCc3WGQ The best AYCE Asian around! They have great selection and the service is super quick. Dirty dishes are cleared from the table immediately. The price is somewhat reasonable considering the amount and quality of food.

If you want great food... Go here.

Oh... Almost forgot... Get the cream puffs for dessert... They are served warm and almost melt in your mouth!
