-I7Vz5eDjc63xKmmt4Qx4g The place is new and has a nice atmosphere. Tonight was my second visit with my teenaged son as he liked it the first time we went. When we arrived, there was a note stating that the debit /credit machine was not working which the hostess reminded us before seating us. A minor inconvenience but we were ok with it. We sat down and waited for about 25 minutes for someone to come take our order or even give us a drink. Staff were speedily walking around and ignoring our table's attempts to get their attention. At one point, three wait staff stood by us, ignoring us again. They were quite apologetic to the table beside us because they had ordered a drink but the waitress didn't write down the size although they seemed not to care that we were waiting to order. My son really wanted to stay as he enjoyed the food the first visit (although service was not that great that time either which I originally blamed on it being the opening week). We finally gave up and walked out. As we stood up and walked away, one of the wait staff looked over at us and he seemed relieved that we were finally leaving. We were not rude in any way and we tried to be patient by politely waiting but the service here is just terrible. Would not recommend.
