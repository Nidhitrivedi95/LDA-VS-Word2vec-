Despite that, this place was worth a shot. I came here for a light lunch and ordered the do-it-yourself noodle (I don't like calling it "car" noodles, if you get that reference). They have a lot of items to choose from, so just pick two (or more), pick your noodle, and you're all set.

I had the default noodle option with red sausage and curry squid. The default noodle tasted okay, but it didn't really mix in with the broth that well. The red sausage actually tasted very good! The curry squid was nothing special, and nothing of curry remained after putting it in the broth.

Iced lemon tea was decent. No general complaints there.
