1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I come here quite often because of the good tasting food and cheap prices. My favorite dish is the Thai style ong choy. I would also recommend the soy sauce chicken. They don't always have it, but when they do, be sure to order it right away! The waitress is friendly and always happy to serve us.
