HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA This was our second visit to Fat Choys. We walked from the Encore and it was awesome bc it worked up our appetites. I had the short run grilled cheese which was a creamy yummy sandwich with onion Jam and the most tender short ribs ever. The server was super nice and attentive. The fries that went with the sandwich was hot and just salty enough. The ventilation in the casino, Eureka, isn't as strong as other hotels on the strip so although there was no smoking in the restaurant, it was still smoky from being open right by the casino. The food itself was fabulous and I can't wait to go again!
