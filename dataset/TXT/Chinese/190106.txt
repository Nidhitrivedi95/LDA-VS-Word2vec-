yJ5rA9U6nmSEUV8_j_jYHw Tonight's dinner was absolutely disastrous. We had been here for dim sum a couple times before and it wasn't bad. We decided to try the dinner here. We get there for dinner and was given the table closest to the door. There were some plates and cups out, but not complete sets and the tablecloth was dirty - not sure if it was being used as a spare for the time being or what happened, but that didn't matter much. 

We place our order with a waiter, and waited half an hour before we figured it was taking way too long for even the starter soup. Asked another waitress if our order was even punched in, and she said she would check. It took her a long time to check, so we asked the guy who placed our order if he had punched it in and his reply was "ok". The other waitress finally gets back to us asking to order again. We placed a new order with her, and she punched it in, but this was 45 minutes from when we first sat. A couple minutes later we get the soup - fair. We didn't get our first food dish until ANOTHER hour. Everything else came out really slow. Food was very salty and is nothing really special compared to other Chinese restaurants. 

The service today was absolutely horrible. Usually dinners at these restaurants take around an hour for us, this dinner took 2.5 hours. We were here celebrating my dad's birthday and it was probably the worst birthday dinner he's had. Definitely will not return.
