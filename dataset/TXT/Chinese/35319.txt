ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ Shaved spinach noodle soup with chicken broth and green onions and cilantro is the best. Why can't someone open an restaurant that sells noodle soup like they do? 
Weekends are pricey at $32 but they have Peking duck which is awesome. Someone serves it to you four at a time. On weekends, they also have premium sashimi like ebi, toro or hamachi. 

Waffles with whipped cream and blueberries are awesome too. 
Make a reservation. Esp on the weekends.
Also on Tuesday's, the meal is cheaper per person. Enjoy!
