sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg Great food! I'm half way through the orange chicken and noodles as I type this. At the suggestion of the dude at the counter, I tried the noodles and im a big fan (though the veggies could stand to be cooked a taaaaad more). The orange chicken is phenomenal. The people who reviewed this saying it tastes like panda must be having the best panda in the country, cause this is miles above any panda I've tasted. All in all great place - awesome food, friendly service, and very generous portions. I'll totally be going back! You know that's saying something when Wang's delight and Yogi's Grill are less than a mile from this place!
