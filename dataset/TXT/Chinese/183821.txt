xSplhd6mlpQzbjUAq3rP6w I don't write reviews much but I will for this place. For years now I have been trying to find a place that can make me some tasty Singapore curry noodles just like my favorite Thai place that closed down. And many years are gone a lot of places tried, I think I've found my noodles. I just wished that it hadn't taken so so long because now I am just a couple months short of my move to San Diego, CA. But at least now I know that when I come back to visit I can come here for them. The flavors in their fried rice is also good. I will definitely be back to try more.
