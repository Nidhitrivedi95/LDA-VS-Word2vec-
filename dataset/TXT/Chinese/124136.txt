opwxvFwYTppE0JgfM4FBlw Pretty standard American-Chinese food. Nothing special. Went here to pick up dinner for the fam. The young girl behind the counter was nice, but there were 3 older women in the kitchen (which is completely visible from the register) who were yelling at one another in the back and fighting which was completely awkward/uncomfortable to sit thru when I was waiting for my order.
