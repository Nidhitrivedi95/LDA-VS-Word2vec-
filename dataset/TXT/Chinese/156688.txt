TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ This is our new Chinese spot! Wow, all the dishes are AMAZING. I'm always hesitant on trying new restaurants, especially Chinese ones cause they can be either too greasy or just bad all together. But this place definitely is on point EVERY time. We liked it so much that we wanna make it a weekly treat. The orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken and lemon chicken are my favorites. Yummy!! :) ---- it's a MUST visit!
