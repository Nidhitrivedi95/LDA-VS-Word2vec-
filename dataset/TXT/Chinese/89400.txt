I7eqTdTmRTWYwF9HNZAHxw Went in for lunch and had the beef pho which was very good. The service however, was poor. They appeared busy with only two waitresses who didn't really greet me nor act to interested that I was there. Despite this l, I will give the benefit of the doubt that they were just very busy and go back because the food was yummy :)
