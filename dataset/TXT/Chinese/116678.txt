NaO8109RYqscYu8fLzURsQ You don't go there for the decor,  let me tell you that.  Now that we've covered that,  let's move on to more serious matters. 

This restaurant is A. M. A. Z. I. N. G.!  The staff is always friendly.  The food is delicious.  Tastes authentic.  Comes in bulk. And is out-of-worldy cheap. This place is,  without a doubt,  the best restaurant I've discovered in the neighborhood thus far. Will go back,  again and again and again!
