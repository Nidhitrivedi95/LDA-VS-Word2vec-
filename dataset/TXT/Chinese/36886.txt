AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw Update review. Ordered delivery and wow I wish I didn't! I ordered a small Mongolian beef and it had 4 pieces of beef! Mostly water chestnuts and onions. Yuck! Asked them to make it EXTRA spicy and it was the most bland Chinese food I've ever had! Honestly that wasn't even Mongolian beef. It tasted like bland beef and broccoli except no broccoli and I must've ordered 90% vegetarian with water chestnuts and onion. I mean, if the vegetables were cooked it probably wouldn't have been AS bad but they were practically raw. Wow has this place gone down hill or what? I wrote a five star review last year and I cannot believe how much it has changed. I figured I would try my wonton soup. (Because how hard is it to F that up?) it was so salty and the wontons were mushy. I literally threw out all my food. I'm so disappointed I wasted 25 dollars for food so bad that went into the garbage. But now I'll safe my money by not going back. Cereal sounds better for a midnight craving lol. So disappointed.
