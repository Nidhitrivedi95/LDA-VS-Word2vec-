The portions are also very generous.  They delivered to my house, which is 4 miles away for only $2 delivery charge.  
The con was that the delivery took close to an hour n a half. It could have been busy at 7pm on Sunday. Kind of a long wait time for delivery.  Willing to try this place out again maybe when I'm not so hungry, so I can plan on the long wait.
