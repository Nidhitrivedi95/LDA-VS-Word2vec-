D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA Friendly staff, food is fresh and tasteful. They do serve a lot of food, so order appropriately. We tried different dumplings, $7 and $8 per plate, served from a woman pushing a little steam cart. We also had the pork fried rice and a chicken dish. It was all very good, but will order less next time. It would be helpful if they told you.
