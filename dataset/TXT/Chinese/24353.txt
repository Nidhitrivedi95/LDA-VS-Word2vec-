6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag Based on the reviews here on Yelp, I went to China Mana on a Sunday, around11:30 am. Only one other patron in the restaurant. She was speaking chinese with the waiter.

Since I am on a mission to find excellent xiao long bao in Vegas, i was hoping that this place would do the trick. Alas, I was somewhat disappointed. The xiao long bao did not even come close to the ones I've had at Din Tiau Fung in Taipei, or Nanxiang in Singapore :-(

I also did have the port and picked turnip soup which was also average.

All in all, an average chinese restaurant.
