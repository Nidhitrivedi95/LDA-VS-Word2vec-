ZOAid_xX3q85wAkBWtFDPg I'm glad that they have their own restaurant, as I always can't find table in their Pmall Food court location.

I still love their cold noodles, and not much different from their Pmall location.  My fav is still Chicken Noodle with Sesame.  I also like their Beef Brisket Noodle in Soup.

Portion is just right, hmmm, maybe a bit small for guys.  Sometimes, we may need to order some side dishes here.  Or have dessert afterwards in other places nearby :-D
