BevY0RqrIxHOgfd8l_UWSQ This place is pretty crowded during lunch, it's a HK/western place. There are a variety of dishes, but my favourite is the chicken steak with noodles and extra sauce. What I like about this place is that they start you off with some bread and soup, I love their cream of chicken, then comes your entree, and finally you get some coffee or tea to wash down your meal. All of that for under $10, a pretty good deal of you ask me.
