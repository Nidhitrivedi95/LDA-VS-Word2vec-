U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q The interior is 5 stars - very gorgeous floral design in what looks like enameled cast iron. I also love the goldfish tanks at the front of the restaurant. 

The service, 4 stars - we had a very gracious and attentive server who allowed our party of 7 to split our bill without any hassle. 

The food is 3 star, on its own - definitely not bad tasting food, but realize that you'll be paying $16-$20+ for an entree that, for the exact same order, would run you $6-$8 in an off-strip restaurant. I'm okay occasionally paying more if I see an increase in quality; for Beijing Noodle, this is not the case. 

I had the Yangzhou Style Fried Rice (Shrimp, diced Ham, diced carrots, peas, $17) and the Singapore Style Rice Noodles (Shrimp, diced BBQ pork, scant bean sprouts, a few shreds of julienned bell pepper, $17). They were average, but edible, and on-table soy sauce and sambal oelek were welcome spices. 

The wait, 1 star - we stood in line for 40+ minutes on NYE, which I guess is standard (? - I don't think so...), but they also will move any VIP's to the front of the line, of which there were many the night we came, lengthening our total wait. 

The cross-contamination of food items, 1 star - beware that because they make wheat noodles fresh in house, it's almost impossible to avoid allergen contamination with non-wheat items. If you are gluten-free or gluten intolerant, you're gonna have a bad time, which I did less than an hour after eating at this location (a reaction so severe it mimicked food poisoning). My bad.  

Won't be returning here in the future. Better (and safer) eats elsewhere.
