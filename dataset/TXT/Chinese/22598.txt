6nRbHreAZzP_RDqUyD1FPg I'm sorry to say, but I think this place was mediocre at best.  I always like to try little hole in the wall Chinese restaurants (which always tend to be the best compared to Chinese corporate america) but sadly I wasn't impressed.  
The price is cheap which is the only thing going for them (in my opinion) but the taste is very bland for the type of Chinese I was hoping they would be.
I will contradict myself for a moment and say that I will probably go back here for 2 reasons only...1 Location, 2 Cheap Price, but I would never recommend anyone to go here if they asked me for a good Chinese restaurant...hence my 2 stars.
