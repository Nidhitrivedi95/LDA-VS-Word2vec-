8zyurJRIAEHh_I0Skhcp3w The food here is decent (prefer Congee Queen though) and the service is fast. But geez, the servers here are so rude! They literally throw the dishes on the table, pushing whatever is there out of their way. The plates are teetering on the edge and they just walk away. I asked a waitress to bring me another set of chopsticks and when she came back, she made this "psh psh" noise to get my attention... Seriously? What a Neanderthal. That was a first for me, and will also be the last as I won't be coming back to this place.
