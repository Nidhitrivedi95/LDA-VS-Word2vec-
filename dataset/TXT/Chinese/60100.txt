DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ My local go-to spot, just down the street. Food is good but the Chicken Katsu Musubi is a must! They have a variety of food to choose from and I am never disappointed with the selection here. This place is much better than the more well known Hawaiian joint that shall remain nameless. Lol.
