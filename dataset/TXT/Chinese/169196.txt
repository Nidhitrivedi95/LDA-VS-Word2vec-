Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Just ordered from Grubhub, it was fast and the guy was super nice, but I ordered the pork pad thai and it was horrible. Not even a little bit if spice, barely any flavor and the pork was just as uninteresting. Neither the noodles nor the pork had flavor or seasoning or anything. It was a little cold and very bland. I also ordered the Thai iced coffee, now I've never had thai iced coffee, so I have nothing to compare it to but it was gross. That could just be my own taste buds. I still wouldn't recommend it. It was a complete waste of money and I'm extremely extremely disappointed. I wish I ate at the restaurant so I could give it back and get a refund. I'm sure the other food might be good, but NOT the pork pad thai.
