5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g I LOVE beef stew noodle. When my friend told me this place made really good beef noodle stew, I just had to try it.  However; this place was aver.  I feel like a lot of places I review are just average.  Haha.  I got the Beef Stew Noodles for 7.99.  There's a spicy version and a not spicy version.

Their customer service is just meh.  It's typical Asian service.  When we first ordered drinks, we asked for ice water.  Another lady came out and brought us hot tea.  :(  When the lady brought out our noodles, I would have liked if she told us what each one was.  Luckily two of of us ordered the same thing, so we could tell.  

My friend did rave about this place, so maybe I expected too much.  I might go back and try the beef noodle dumplings she recommended.  I think it's dumplings in beef noodle stew.
