TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ Ordered the chicken chow mein, crispy beef and chicken fried rice for delivery. The food was enough for dinner for my gf and I and some leftover for brunch! They only deliver after 7pm and depending on how busy they are, expect your food to arrive at least 30-45minutes after ordering. 

The food was decent for the price. Everything added up to $25.50. For four meals, that's better than eating fast food.
