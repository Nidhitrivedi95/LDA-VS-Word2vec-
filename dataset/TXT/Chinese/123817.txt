omMiNDhPYAX4TPfv4xrBLQ Found this place through Yelp and proximity to my house.  This place was yummy and service was fast and food cook to order.  We had Egg Drop Soup (shared between two), Orange Chicken and the Salt and Pepper Wings.  Stuffed our faces and still have leftovers.  Reasonably priced too.  We will be back.
