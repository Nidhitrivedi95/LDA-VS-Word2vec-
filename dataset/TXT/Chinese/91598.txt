ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg I went on the day of the Asian Festival and I was still able to get my meal quickly, my server was friendly. My only gripe is that when I first entered, the greeted was cold and standoffish, which annoys me greatly. However, the rest of my experience was great and I will be going back. Also, unlike many Asian restaurants, I didn't come out smelling like fried food.
