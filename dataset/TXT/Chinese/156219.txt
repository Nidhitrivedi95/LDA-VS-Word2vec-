tQH_DyUIWYOHMD7CYg6-jQ We decided to go to Hakka Wok for lunch yesterday. I was not sure what to expect since the restaurant is small. The staff person was very friendly. I ordered the orange beef and my wife ordered shrimp with lobster sauce. The wait for the food was not too long. The orange beef was delicious with big pieces of oranges and a tasty sauce. The shrimp with lobster sauce had big shrimps and the sauce was also delicious. Both dishes came with a side of rice and she even gave us more rice when it was done at no extra cost. The portions did not seem big but we were full when done. I will definitely return to try more dishes and hope they are consistent with the quality of the food.
