prr5pOED31nKWUfCHUvhrA I dined here Friday, Oct 21st with 3 friends. We trenched all the way to try their «Xiao long bao» Steamed pork dumplings. We were giddy with excitement. 

At 7ish PM on a Friday night, we were asked if we had reservations which we hadn't. The girl consulted a humongous reservation book and arranged us in a corner spot. Not a huge place but pretty comfortable and clean. Our waiter explained that they were out of the Xiao long bao, the main reason we came there. Damn. Was it really 7pm, how could they be out of steamed pork dumplings?!

Well that is not going to deter us from getting a great dinner. The waiter confided that in order to get the dumplings, it's better to make a reservation ahead of time to guarantee us having some next time. Good to know fellow yelpers!! See if that works for you. 
 
Onto the food...
We all decided to do their $35 tasting menu. It was something like an 11 course meal. First 6 are appetizers. Not going to list the full menu but we all agreed as a group that the soup (fish broth soup) was excellent, and almost all of the appetizers were superb. The main dishes were not as glamorous or anything special to mention. It was pretty average, although their General Tao chicken was different from all the other's I tried (which I usually dislike) but this one was actually great. 

I think if we had stopped at the appetizers this would've been a 4 star review. 
The service and staff were excellent, and attentive. The restaurant filled up pretty nicely during our meal and there was only one waiter, one runner and the reservation girl also helped bringing in dishes. It seemed a harmonious working order and they covered all the tables quite well. 

End of story, I would def recommend this restaurant. Bon appetite!!
