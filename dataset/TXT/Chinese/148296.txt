SEURrw7032BR15PKZ_aleA Finally, Finally, I got to order the special set meal I been wanting to try!

Our table has some disagreement on either lobster or crab... but crab wins!!

And we have more disagreement on what to order as the 3 other dishes from the set menu.... But all I care was I going to have my crab!!

The XO sauce was spiced by real fresh Thai chili! While my dinner mates were in tears, I saved them by eating all the chili and most of the crab!

- Sweet and Sour Fish Fillet
- Chinese Broccoli with Beef
- Fish Fillet with King Mushroom

I guess they all tasted not bad as my dinner mate finished most of them while I busy eating my crab.

3 choices for dessert... and I got to try them all too!!

The only complaint is they ran out of the complimentary soup of the day!

With 10% discount our bill came out to be $53 with taxes!
