7EAhyXA-D4km6WX2yQGwCQ Saru is clean and the food was good.  It is new and has a few kinks to work out. We ordered spring rolls, two sushi rolls, and hibachi chicken. Sushi was good, spring rolls were not their normal spring rolls according to our waitress, but we were given and extra one to make up for it, they were decent, and the chicken hibachi was yummy! Hope they can keep it up. Nice to have a good place to go closer to home.
