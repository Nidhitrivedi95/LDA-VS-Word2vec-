eV-5b1Bjtnn-QePN3t3taQ It's okay , nothing too special here . I think it's a bit of a strange layout and service wasn't amazing . For a quick I don't care it will do . But Gangis grill is much better flavor and easier to work with you don't have to mix multiple sauses and then get a small portion. I would not recommend
