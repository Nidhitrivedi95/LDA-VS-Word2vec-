WuQZ5iesON7NWTDWgwWlbQ Usually come here for dim sum. This is the fanciest and largest dim sum restaurant in the GTA, huge venue with many tables, good for weddings and other celebrations they probably hold after dim sum hours.

I'm never early enough for the early bird special on weekends but at least I don't have to line up as I hear it can be ridiculously long even with the insane amount of tables they have. Dim sum prices are on the higher end. Without early bird specials, to fill two people up, you would probably order 6 plates and end up paying $48ish after tax/tip.

They have such cute Victorian style tea pots and cups it feels like a treat to eat here... Also it is not like other very loud dim sum places. Servers are dressed in these uniforms that make it seem even fancier. Service here is usually alright even with the amount of people eating here at any given time. Never had any of the dishes we ordered forgotten or late although they may come out in a random order (dessert dim sums before entree dim sums).

Recommended dishes: curry octopus (mmm), har gows, shrimp rice rolls, egg tarts with bird nest (you get 4 per order), deep fried squid tentacles. They also have some good dessert dim sums unseen at other places such as the sweet almond pancakes and glutinous rice balls filled with sesame.

Probably my fav dim sum joint in GTA and would get five stars if not for the prices.
