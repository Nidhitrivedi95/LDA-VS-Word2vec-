URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg Celebrating my mother in law birthday, thought this would be a special place to take her. We ordered 2 Mongolian beef. Food was served there was no visible beef on plate just onions and veggies, fried rice was ok. I told my husband at the end to tell the staff they lack beef. In response the waitress told my husband they didn't have enough beef for the second order so they split it...no offer to comp, no apology.
