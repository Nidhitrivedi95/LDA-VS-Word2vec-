kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA Ehh, well the food was just ok. I've eaten exceptionally great tasting Chinese food from fine dining to grungy hole in the wall places. I was hoping this place would meet my expectations food-wise, but unfortunately it did not. Service and ambiance was great. But the blaring music was way too loud to talk over that it felt like I was inside the club. 

Hakka steamed dim sum- (3/5) 2pcs each of har gau, scallop shumai, Chinese dive dumpling, & black pepper duck dumpling. Well made dumplings, but not worth $29. 

Sesame prawn toast with foie gras- (5/5) the crunchiness from the buttery toast that sealed the melted juicy foie gras made the perfect sesame prawn ball. Well worth the $25. 

Crispy duck salad- (3/5) what made this salad was the pomelo and pomegranate making the duck salad lighter and fresher. But for $31, I wish the duck was the star of the dish & not the fruits. 

Chilean sea bass- (2/5) for $38 you would hope the fish would be cooked perfectly, which It Was. But unfortunately it was way too salty totally ruining the whole dish. Sadly, it was my least favorite dish and I love Chilean sea bass. They tried to be too creative with the sea bass instead of letting the flavors of the fish shine on its own.

Tip: free Hakkasan valet parking for diners.
