V6mrVw6BpZhiE_Bn3G_Rog Went here for a catered event on a Sunday evening.  Place started off empty (when we got there at 5:00pm) and was packed by the time we were leaving at 8:00pm.  

I'm not sure of the exact names of the dishes we got but it was A LOT of food, i had to be rolled to the car.  From what i remember: Sweet & sour pork (was probably my favourite dish), lobster, chicken, mushrooms/bok choy mix, mushrooms/tofu mix (tofu was really good), marinated beef and broccoli, fried spicy fish sticks, red bean soup (looked weird but tasted amazing, kind of like melted red bean icecream), and much more than I can remember.

Service was also great, refilled water and brought everything we asked for quickly.
