YBIhTjmEH3IEZW4Dr5ReRA The service was okay. My food I am sure would have been good had it been served hot. We went on a weekday for dinner and it was not busy. We were seated quickly and served our food immediately which had me wondering they probably had a buffet back there and where not preparing dishes as they were ordered. The orange chicken was not breaded and no one liked it. The BBQ pork fried rice was good but cold. I would rather go to Panda Express and know what I am getting and get more for my money.
