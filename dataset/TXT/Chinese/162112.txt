The Fritter King (whose signage recalls a bit of Patty King) wins my heart with their huge bowls of thick, smooth rice porridge here with all the dressings. Seafood, preserved duck egg, pork, whatever you like it is here and delicious. However, there are slim pickings for the vegetarian, but good news! They ain't called the King of fritters for nothing. Their sweet and savoury fritters are made from a wonderful light but dense (and made right by the window) batter and delish for dunking in your big bowl of congee, or chomping on solo.

A very casual setting - sweatpants friendly, expect it to be busy in the afternoons, especially on weekends.
