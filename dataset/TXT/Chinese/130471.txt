pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Inventive sushi, great service, and decent cocktails.

Been here twice now and both times were solid. The food here is excellent and there are many dishes that I have never seen at a sushi restaurant before.

The atmosphere is great inside, but is in a more sleepy party of the complex (Palazzo is one of the quieter "big" resorts on the strip).

The cocktails could use some improvement. Given the price and the clientele, I think they need to bring in a mixologist to redo this section of the menu.

Last but certainly not least is the service. Vanessa G was extremely accommodating as our server. We came in towards the end of the night and she had a great attitude. Also, the manager Jason P. was awesome. He checked in on us a few times and went out of his way to make my GF's b-day special. Big fan of these two.
