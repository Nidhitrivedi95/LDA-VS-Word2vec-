OnGPegQGuQ5_uuFLvezvKw I have been coming to this restaurant for over 15 years. This is the best authentic chinese restaurant in Charlotte NC that I have eaten at so far and I have tried most of them. I love their fried rice and fried chicken wings. I had a party of 17 people there yesterday to celebrate my birthday. The waiter had an awesome personality and even let me know when my 8 year old  asked for a 3rd refill on her caffeinated beverage. The manager was nice enough to work with us through an issue with confusion about their coupon policy. Most of my party was family from out of town and they said that they loved it and want to come back when they are in town. Everyone should try them out because the food is ao good.
