ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg We decided to come here for a late night take out dinner and with the "word of mouth" about this place for their food, we had to give them a try! I had the Tiger Shrimp with Efu noodles and my wife had the Pad Thai. We both split an order of their Salt & Pepper Calamari and some Shrimp Wonton Soup! My shrimp (in a seperate soup container w.veggies and delicious broth) were cooked to perfection and plentiful in number, wholy! Noodles were in a seperate container so that you can add as much or as little as you want, also cooked perfectly! My wife's order was also bursting at the seams in regards to its proportion! There was no disappointment in her eyes when we got home and she opened up the container. Everything was packed tightly and securely! All the the food was still smok'in hot by the time we got home. They put some effort in assuring that their food would be as fresh and hot as it would have been if we had eaten there. The food was AWESOME and we definitely have found our new "go too" place for when we're crav'in Asian! For $40.00, it was more than worth the trip! Thanks to all you Yelpers that rave about this place, you definitely know what you're talking about. And we will be back for sure, hopefully sooner than later.
