Q62lGVKqoKJ09lZNt2qpfw Chinese decor with Bollywood films playing on the TVs, I have been to this small but nice restaurant a few times to sample some dishes. 

Chilli Chicken, & Chilli Fish were really good, the spicy sauces permeated deeply into the flesh & resulted in delicious bite sized pieces of chicken & fish with full flavor throughout.

Chicken & Fish Pakoras were dark golden brown, crisp shell & the leavened interior was moist & infused with the flavors of each respective meat.

Vegetable fried rice is a great accompaniment with any meat dish as assorted vegetables such as, baby corn, onions & cubed peppers are plentiful throughout the mix.

I recommend this place for great spicy food at an easy going price.
