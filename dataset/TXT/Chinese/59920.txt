DL7V1_chkWkZtyG4_xNYfw Just grabbed a Togo order from this pei Wei, defiantly the best one I've been too. The building is an old brick spot, located below Side Bar and sharing a wall with Starbucks (heaven on earth perhaps?). Legit city style complete with exposed wood ceiling beams and brick walls. The sode machine is intense though, user be warned. 1 spout, 100+ choice, all touch screen! this aint for your grand pappy!!! Great, fast and friendly service. Line moves quick. Togo has their own door/cashier. Only problem is parking. I come here for Starbucks sometimes and every-time vow never to come back due to parking. Maybe I just need a longer fuse? On second thought, Nope. Improve parking please.  Thanks. 4 stars only due to parking being such a pain.
