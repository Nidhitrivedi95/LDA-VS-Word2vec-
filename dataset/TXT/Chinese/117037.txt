nBwOIq5KI-zmxp061dTmgw So I lived for a year in surprise, Az. Chen & Wok is a small chain, they have a location out there. I liked their House fried rice better, then this locations. It's ALMOST the same, but this location's lack's pork. 

But nonetheless the house friend rice is really good, better then I've had at a lot of chinese places here in the valley.
