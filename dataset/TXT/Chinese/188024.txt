yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I thoroughly enjoyed my bowl of Pho with everything in it. Plenty of meat, tasty soup, and fresh vegetables. I wouldn't rank it up there in the top ten, but I really enjoyed the Pho and would definitely go back. Haven't had a better bowl of Pho in Vegas, so this would be my first choice for a hearty bowl of Pho, its delicious, big bowl, as well as a lot of meat, and not much MSG.  One bad thing is that this place can get really crowded, hard to get a table sometimes.
