f-ookZOX4pBNldaOHMkJ4A I've grown a bit more fond of this place after awhile. They still aren't outstanding by any means, but the food quality is generally dependable. I've taken a liking to their rice dishes but I do find that their stir-fried rice noodles or egg noodles (chow mein) are rather lacking. I guess it's kind of hit or miss on the menu. The place is a mom and pop shop. Service won't wow you at all as it operates based on efficiency as the first priority, but the place has been a mainstay of its community for many years and I hope they continue to hang around.
