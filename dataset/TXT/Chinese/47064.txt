bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A I think we found our new Chinese food to go place here. They have the best Mongolian Beef. Not soggy. Just the right consistency. And the taste is addicting.
One of my favorites is Chicken Chop Suey. Again, very delicious and veggies were cooked just right. 
We will definitely go back there to try their  cashew chicken, walnut shrimp, mu shu pork, curry chicken, etc.
