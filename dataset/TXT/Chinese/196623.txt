ZN8EHmoe4Xjy4q4Y8ROEfw The quality of the food and the portions are good. I normally order the Pho Special or Bun cha gio there. I've come here a several times now. The lady that serves us here is nice, but sometimes their service can be pretty slow since they don't have enough servers here.  It's the closest  Vietnamese place near work so I'll probably keep going.
