DM8j5g9k28vEOTM0kz4KVA I hate that I order from here sometimes because it's one of the very few restaurants that deliver to us in our area. The food is BLAH! I've tried so many different things and haven't found anything I liked. Their chow mein is bland, their sweet and sour chicken sucks, hot and sour soup is OK at best. I would make the drive down Eastern if I had time
