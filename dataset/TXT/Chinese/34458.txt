aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ I went there today with couple of friends. Nice atmosphere. Busy place obviously. We sat in a booth. Ordered Sushi ( green dragon, Boston something and Veggie explosion) the sushi pieces were big but delicious in addition to spicy eggplant with vegetables and Cashew nut chicken which was really good.
Clean tables, nice waitress and in general it was a good experience.
Worth mentioning that I managed to ruin my dinner by biting into a red chili pepper and burning my tongue beyond repair :( please don't do that!!
.. Still alive though :)
Enjoy.
