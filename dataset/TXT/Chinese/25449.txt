7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA To clear up any confusion, the new name is Sichuan Gourmet.  The restaurant was losing too much business to another China Star on Murray Ave in Greenfield. Sichuan Gourmet is authentic Sichuan.  This is the food that the Chinese G20 Delegation ate when they were in Pittsburgh.  The food is wonderful, and the service is very attentive.  I like this new location, and it looks like they will thrive in Squirrel Hill.  The Tan Tan Noodles are a great appetizer to start with.  I like the Flaming Pan dishes.
