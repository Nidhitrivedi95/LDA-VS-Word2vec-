PM5vkmr8FqOIWE0pe3C2Fw Probably the best HotPot you can get in the downtown area. Great soupbases (original, green, tomato and corn are the goto).

They also have fried mantou buns! Essentially fried bread that you can eat with a side of condensed milk.
Worth the additional price compared to other hotpot places in the area.
