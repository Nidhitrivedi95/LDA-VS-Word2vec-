Lfo8OEUIcswnMLIAXpFWYg It only gets a star because I HAVE to leave one to be able to review this place. I saw the bad reviews and thought it might just be because it is below average but still edible for she that is rushed, nearby, and just needs to eat. 
WORSE Chinese food I have had my whole life... I mean as hungry as I was I could not force myself to eat it. I ordered the house chicken and the sauce had NO flavor and was just overly salted sludge. My boyfriends Mongolian beef was also absolutely disgusting. To make matter worse, but not surprisingly, I felt sick for the rest of the day. DO NOT EAT HERE.
