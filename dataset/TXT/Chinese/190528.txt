YKImxc9VimLbDl2sQN1BBQ Just had lunch here if I could give it zero stars I would first of all we ordered an egg roll appetizer it came out in two minutes and it taste like it'd been refried now I've had refried beans that I never had refried eggrolls. Everything just went downhill from there my daughter had the house fried rice it has all of three shrimp in it and it was tasteless. I had the shrimp in garlic sauce it was also tasteless and I tasted no garlic I guess they forgot to put it in needless to say we will be back to this damn place.
