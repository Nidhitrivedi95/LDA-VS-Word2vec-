jYF7PNnYcn3fWejv0ZE1-w The food was spot on, I had Mongolian Beef and my hubby had the Szechuan Beef they were both very very good. The service was attentive and courteous, very good. The restaurant was kept clean and inviting it was a wonderful experience over all I would recommend this place to anyone, I will Definitely be back.
