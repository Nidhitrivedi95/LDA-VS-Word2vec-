beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw I really wanted to love this place so bad, but afterwards just felt kinda meh about it. Don't get me wrong the concept is great and there's nothing else like it in Vegas so I definitely recommend giving at least one try, but I don't think I'd come back.  

About 5 of my friends came on a Thursday for dinner. We had made a reservation so had no problems with getting a table. The server was very good with welcoming us and giving a brief explanation of everything, but during our meal she wasn't super attentive with clearing plates or refilling our drinks. Maybe they're just overwhelmed by still being a new restaurant, but it definitely effected my overall experience.

Food wise it wasn't bad, but I honestly prefer doing hot pot at home better. I do love that they have tons of sides and meat choices and that you can get your own individual pot. As a group we definitely ordered too much food so I recommend starting with a few items and ordering as you go. For the broth I went with the spicy entry level. I personally did not really care for it. My boyfriend had the mushroom which I tried and thought was much better. I did enjoy the concept of being able to mix your own sauces, but wish they had some type of guidelines of what to mix or just some basics. 

Overall I'm glad I tried this place out and think it's still a great one time thing, but I'd rather do my own hot pot at home.
