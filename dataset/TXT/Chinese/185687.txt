Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw The worst part of this place is that it is 45 minutes from our house :)

We took a chance on Great Wall because it was close to a theater we were going to in Queen Creek.  We figured "How bad could it be?"  Well, it was FABULOUS.  The best Chinese food I've eaten since moving to AZ 10 years ago.  The place was pretty full for early on a Thursday.  But the lines of people waiting to pick up or order TO GO had to be seen to be believed.  If you live in the area you're lucky so try it you'll like it.  And if you live far away like us, it may even be worth a Sunday drive to get a delicious dinner.
