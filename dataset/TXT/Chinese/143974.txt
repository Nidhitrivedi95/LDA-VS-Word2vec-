rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg Nice Chinese restaurant in the south Phoenix area. I have driven past this place multiple times without knowing, it was almost hiding on me! 

Came here for lunch and enjoyed some hot tea and Moo Goo Gai Pan. A little too many mushrooms for me. Food was tasteful and a healthy portion for the price for lunch. Had a couple bites of pork fried rice and this was also tasty. 

Staff was extremely friendly and food came out quick! Would definitely return and would recommend if you want Chinese in this area. Authentic and tasty!
