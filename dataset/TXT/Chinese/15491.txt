3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug I was hoping I could rely on the positive reviews I read but I was wrong, again. The food, which is the most important issue, was WAY BELOW the standard of an excellent restaurant. I ordered the honey garlic ribs, they
were chewy, the sauce that went with it SUCKED. The shrimp dish that i
ordered was lacking ANY FLAVOUR,  The price for a snow pea leaf vegetarian dish was OVERPRICED and after trying 4 dishes I pushed the uneaten food away and left. NOT GOING BACK .
