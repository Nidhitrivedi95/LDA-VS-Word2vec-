AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA This is the best vegetarian restaurant. We have several vegetarian restaurant options in San Diego but none come close to the Veggie House. Chef Kenny's menu has  everything you'd find on a typical Chinese restaurant menu but everything is vegetarian/vegan. The food is delicious and the staff is very nice.  It was great to see Chef Kenny walk through the dining room to chat with guests and make sure everyone is enjoying their food.  This is a 'must go' for your next trip to Vegas, you will not be disappointed.
