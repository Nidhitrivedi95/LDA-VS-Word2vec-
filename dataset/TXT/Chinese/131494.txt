pJKb6w6pcC0Ds4r_Pznjeg Ordered 2 combination dinners for delivery. Price was great. Phone order was painless unlike a previous reviewer. Delivery to mint hill was very timely. Portion was adequate. Regular fried rice has veggies unlike some other places. Food overall was good. No complaints about sesame chicken, pork fried rice was great. Lo Mein was described as "just ok". Egg rolls were good. I am mainly writing this review because I was hesitant to order from here after seeing a 2.5 star rating but after my experience I have no complaints and wanted to give this place a boost.
