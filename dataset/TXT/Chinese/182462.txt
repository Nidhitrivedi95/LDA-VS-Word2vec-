XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA This place is NOT okay for me...
I have gained serious pounds eating here.

I am that person that stakes out the sushi bar and crab legs like a fiend.  Yeah, I'm that girl.  The sushi is okay for a buffet, but the sashimi is awesome.  Really.  And the crab legs are always really good, if you can get there before the hoarders move in.

I avoid the fried foods and typical buffet fare just so I can fill up on the good stuff. :)  But there is definitely something for everyone here.

Go for lunch!  Dinner is expensive and that makes me sad.
