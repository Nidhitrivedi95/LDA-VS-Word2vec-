DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA On a morning breakfast hunger, we didn't feel like eatting buffetts with the regular eggs, sausages, omellettes.  We had a craving for some good old fashion "Jook" aka rice porridge.  We didn't wanted to go to Mandalay Bay which charges $25 for a Seafood Jook as compared to $4 in SF Chinatown.  So we picked the next best thing...in LV Chinatown and came about Sam Woo.  

We ordered  a Fish Porridge which still had a strong fishy smell and taste, (usually removed with ginger) and the porridge was extremely watered down.
We also order the "Sam See" chow mein (Duck; Chicken; and BBQ Pork)  It was ok, but tasteless...probably by the extreme amount of water sprouts!

Somehow, when we got back to the hotel that night, our stomach wasn't feeling too good.
