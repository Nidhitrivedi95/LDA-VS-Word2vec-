_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w When we were seated we were given the expensive menu where everything was over $300.  We knew there were other menus and therefore asked for it.  The waitress gave us attitude when we asked for the cheaper menus.  We did end up getting from the cheaper menu and they kept pushing for us to order more.  

The place is really busy.  Don't bring your fancy purses because if your chair is facing an aisle,  the servers wipe their hands on your chair.  

Also, it gets really loud inside, the tables around us had the obnoxious loud, douchey people which gets really annoying.  

Overall good food but very poor environment.  Service is poor and they will rush you out.
