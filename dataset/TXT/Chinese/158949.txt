u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ Ok a one star is pretty hard for me to write but geez.  First off this is chinatown?  Maybe I'm spoiled from being from SoCal and having our own chinatown or even just towns where asians have naturally gravitated to have built their own unofficial chinatowns.  Either way it's not their fault but you can easily drive past this place without even knowing you just went through chinatown.

Either way I ordered my normal choices of food and the food was barely edible.  I normally can dust off just about anything and never really leave left over especially when it comes to chinese food.  There is something about chinese food where all it takes is a couple sips of hot tea and you are ready to stuff your face still.  I really don't want to go on a laundry list of bad things but really nothing tasted like chinese food.  Even the batter used on the fried items is nothing like I've had before and was more like something you would put on fried chicken.

When you walk in the door it's not like you have the highest hopes initially anyways since the fish are dead in the tank when you walk in.  Those that think this is authentic chinese food, you've been stuck in vegas too long.
