yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Absolutely amazing!! I would eat here everyday if I could haha. They're quick and customer service is excellent. Order Pho Dac Biet and it came out in less then 2 minutes and it tasted amazing. Good things is they're open 24 hours, means party hard and come there buzzed for the best food you can have after a great night. Went here the next day and tried the Broken rice with grilled pork . Every time I go to Las Vegas I have to go here at least once. There are you many other things in the menu I have yet to try, but I will haha. Prices are decent too, unlike these ridiculous casino prices and to top it off casino food isn't that amusing to me unless it's like a buffet or something.
