I've been craving proper Shanghainese cuisine for a while and one of my friends recommended we go check this place out. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. 

I went with a few friends that don't speak or read Chinese and the menu is extremely friendly, there are plenty of pictures and everything is well labeled. 

The cost is reasonable, around $5-10/dish (excluding the specials). The quality and portions are great. 

The decor doesn't make it stand out in any way in particular, but it does have a 90s Chinese family restaurant type of vibe. The paint choice is a little loud, but not oppressive. 

The service here was alright and the food didn't take long to get to the table.

The food itself was great, we ordered a variety of dishes, some not typical of Shanghai, because my friends were craving some Northern Chinese food. The soup dumplings (we had the regular and the silk skin) were good, the regular definitely being better in terms of the dumpling skin. The sticky rice roll wasn't bad, but missed a few things to make it great. The red bean pancake was good. Ome thing that surprised me was the ma po tofu, I didn't expect it to taste like the ones I had when I was in the Szechuan province in China. Definitely impressed. The rest of the dishes were quite good. One thing I forgot to order was the kao fu, so I'll have to come back for that next time.

A great place for Shanghainese cuisine, and the flavours are great. I would definitely recommend this place. I'll definitely be back sometime.
