KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ We stopped into Pearl while staying at the MGM this Fall. I selected it because of the surf-and-turf prix fixe dinner. All four of us had this, and everyone liked it pretty well. I was probably the least impressed. I didn't like the fillet all cut up and coated in teriyaki sauce, and the tempura lobster wasn't as good as regular butter and garlic steamed lobster. Also, the fried rice -- with peas even -- just didn't go with the gourmet feel of the place. We had good service and a very good Malbec. The dessert was a fantastic, but miniature, chocolate-raspberry pot de creme kind of thing. 

The price and atmosphere were right, but I was just not wild about the food.
