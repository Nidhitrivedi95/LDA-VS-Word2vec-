Everything here is absolutely 5 star amazing. Always clean, always welcoming, excellent friendly service... They even taught me how to use chop sticks! The food is simply amazing, I would highly recommend this place to ANYONE! 

I can eat here for breakfast lunch and dinner, but since I'm on a diet, I'll stick to lunch and dinner lol!
