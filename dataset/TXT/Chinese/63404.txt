dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ I have dined here several times and always have a good experience.  Last dined here on June 5 and had another great meal and excellent service.  Their all you can eat sushi dinner special is a great value and the food is always very good.  This is one of my favorite neighborhood eateries.
