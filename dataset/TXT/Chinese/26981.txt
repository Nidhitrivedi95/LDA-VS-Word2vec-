7wgNlcLTfQq8CHBob7AGHg The food here is exceptionally great, and the workers are just as good. There is a worker named Savanna who I see often whilst dining in to Panda Express. She has always greeted me with a   smile when I walk in. When i see her cleaning the tables or putting together bowls for customers, you can tell by the look in her eyes how much hardwork and dedication she puts into her job! 5/5 on the food but 10/5 for the workers!!
