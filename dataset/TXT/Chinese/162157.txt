UlI0TksGFiIXtcbtg2KalQ There is very little  to eat in this hood that isn't fast food-y and frankly, I could eat pho everyday. I haven't branched out past the spring rolls and rare beef pho but they are both delightful. I have both eaten in and gotten it to go - in the time it takes me to walk over there (6-7 mins) it's waiting for me and since I have ordered the same thing each time (the three times I have asked for it to go as opposed to eating in) they know I want extra hot sauce and paying attention like that is a good indicator of how conscientious they are with the menu/ingredients etc. I say high fives all around.
