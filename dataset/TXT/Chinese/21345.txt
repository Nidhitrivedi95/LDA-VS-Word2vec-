68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw We came to Asian Legend late on a weekday and I thought it would be empty, but surprisingly, there were a few tables and people were still coming into the restaurant while we were eating.
I remember coming to this restaurant when I was young and from what I remember it was good. There are a few locations around Toronto and this is a pretty well-known chain. It definitely did not disappoint as I came with my family who came from Edmonton and they loved the food! 
We ordered siu lung bao (steamed soup dumpling), tea smoked duck, stir fried garlic snow pea leaf, seafood soup casserole and shanghai fried noodles. I have to say that the seafood soup casserole did not look like the picture in the menu; however, it was quite tasty with a variety of seafood, meat and vegetables. It was definitely a really good chinese "comfort" dish and the soup was not too salty- it didn't feel like they put MSG in it, which is awesome!
The tea smoked duck was very tasty. The texture of the shanghai noodles were perfect, not too soft and just the right amount of chewiness. 
As it was late and we were hungry, the food came quickly and we were all quite satisfied. Even though there were at least 4 tables that sat down after us after 8:45pm, the service was great and we were happy with the food and experience!
