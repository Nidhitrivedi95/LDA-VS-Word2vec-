QyfX-6jFfINH1MuXS8R6ZA I'm not a Chinese food buff by any means... heck, this was my first experience at a sit-down Chinese food place. :) We went in and were promptly greeted and shown to our booth, the service was more than attentive, cleaning plates from the table as the last bite was still in my mouth... okay, maybe that's TOO attentive. ha

We tried the crab puffs for an appetizer, and again it was my first experience with crab puffs, but it seemed like there was barely any crab inside the puff. But, what do I know... maybe that's normal? They were tasty though... especially with the sweet sauce that accompanies it. For my entree, I had the chicken and broccoli. The serving was plentiful- way more than I should have eaten in one sitting... but I managed. Hey, I was really hungry when we walked in. :) 

And, as an added bonus, I did confirm the fact that Abacus Chinese Restaurant does have an actual abacus on site. It's up front by the register. Check it out!
