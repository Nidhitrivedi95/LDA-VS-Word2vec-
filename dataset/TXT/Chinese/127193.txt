Came here a couple days ago, for NYD. 
Before you start thinking I'm being too harsh, considering it's NYD and they'd be swarmed, it wasn't. An entire section of the store was empty. There was no line up at the door. At 7pm on NYD. (Felt kinda bad but oh well! Fairly new restaurant - must be hard to make a name for yourself right?)

Let me start off by saying the food was fine. Mediocre. Could be a little more creative? But hey, it's not really a big thing. Basically a chinese restaurant you'd go to without making a reservation during rush time on NYD. (ha) 

So, here's the kicker - we get sat down, we order, it's going well. We get the 2 dish peking duk, with 3 side dishes, and a hot honey lemon & cold HK milk tea. Immediately after we ordered, we got a cheque. Yeah, I know, weird. We check it, it's for the table behind us. No big deal, we laugh it off and pass it over. Then, we wait. 
My mom goes to pour us some tea. She can't pick up my dad's cup - too slippery - it's covered in oil! We get a new one, and we wait.
We get our drinks! A cold honey lemon & a hot ovaltine - wait, that's not what we ordered? We call them over, get our actual drinks, and then, you guessed it - we wait. 
30 minutes in, our snow pea sprouts come out! We devour them in about two seconds flat. Aaaaaaand back to waiting!
Thankfully, our peking duk comes out soon after, followed by our diced beef and our steamed tilapia. 
Life's good. We ask for the bill, and - yep, we wait. They forgot. So we ask again, pay and leave. 

I'm gonna keep go ahead and assume what I HOPE y'all are thinking - probably just a bad night. Hopefully.
