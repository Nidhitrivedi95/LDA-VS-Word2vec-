I find myself always coming back to order a  slush with tapioca because they make that veryyyyy well. And although they jacked up their prices so that its ~$8-9 for a large slush with tapioca, I find myself still thinking it's worth it because it tastes really good.
I've tried the popcorn chicken and the toasts and stuff a few times, and they're just meh. 
Atmosphere is ok it's just a somewhat dark lit area for you to eat and sit.
