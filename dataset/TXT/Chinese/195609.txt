zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ Very good and close to my place.
I seemed to have caught a little cold and figured some good ol pho would help me out.
Service is quick and I didn't have to wait long for the food.
Had the spring rolls and #21 pho.
The peanut sauce that comes with the rolls is just tasty. Perfect thickness.
The soup itself was very tasty had a good amount of meat and noodles.
I had to ask for extra basil and jalapeño but that's just me, since I like all the extras in my phone.
The broth was a little too, sweet, for me but all in all still good.
