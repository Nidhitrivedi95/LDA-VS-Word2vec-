1MGhb6z2XSTsyLvQgylXiA I love this place & am a regular. Food always comes hot & cooked well. The hot & sour soup is my favorite &  can be made extra spicy to your tastes. I usually order the kung pao chicken which has alot of sauce to it & combines with the rice quite nicely. Only issue I've had is that the crab puffs have a habit of being over fried.  Overall all excellent place for a delivery night.
