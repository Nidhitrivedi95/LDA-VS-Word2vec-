t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA It is a terrible regret that I moved away before I had a chance to become a regular at Golden Harbor.  I've been there once and the food was out of this world good.  You can have the americanized staples, which are still good, or you can get into the real stuff and just have an amazing meal.  I wish I could pack this place up and take it with me wherever I go.

It does have an odd cafeteria style service.  But it's BYOB, which I would love to see more restaurants in C-U adopt.
