0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw Good Chinese Hakka take-out.  If you are bored with Canadian Chinese food, this is a great place to branch out and add some hakka heat to the mix.  They have an extensive menu with man Canadian Chinese traditional items.  I've tried and love the chicken pakoras, Hakka fried rice, Hakka vermicelli and Hakka veggies.  It's Chinese food with an Indian flavour.  I have no idea if this is one of the best Hakka places as its my first and only so there is no frame of reference. 

Delivery is fast and friendly.  For $40-$50 you get enough food to feed 4-6 people.
