LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ I cant thank enough the wonderful staff of HK star to accomodate my party of 15 poeple on a week night, at the last minute wihout a reservation on top of that... 

It was Chris' s bday night and after the harsh task of getting ALL the relatives toguether, I was able to seat back, relax and enjoy an outstandind meal at a price very easy on my wallet.

Every dishes were wonderful, every taste in our group were pleased but I am not able to list the 18 to 20 diferent dish on our menu... 

On top of my head: war won ton soup, salt n pepper shrimps, salt n pepper cod, salt n pepper calamari, salt n pepper pork shops, seafood n tofu claypot, chinese brocolis, mustard greens, shrimp fried rice, roast duck, filet mignon cube, mongolian beef, sea bass with black bean sauce and much more than what I cant recall at this time!

Our waiter was funny, helpfull, patient with the children and kind to the ederly person in our party.

Thank you, thank you HK star, we will come back very soon to enjoy your great food and wonderful dinner service!
