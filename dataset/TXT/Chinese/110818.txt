lXZvgVmIz-ko1OiCG-VDTw Once upon a time I craved this weekly and would have given 5 stars but like many places, the quality and quantity start to decrease as time goes by.  Luckily it is not a huge difference.  The soup is a tad diluted from before and they seem to give less of the choose your own toppings.  I only got two Hong Kong style wontons vs 3-4 before.  My mom only got a few pieces of fish vs "a lot" before.  

Nevertheless, it is still quite enjoyable and a giant bowl plentiful of noodles and default veggies (Napa, mushrooms, tofu skin (yes!!).  The fish soup broth options are all good to me from spicy Tom yum to mild Malay laksa (the best!) to the tomato pumpkin broth (love!).  Always love the build-your-own noodle soup bowl concept with lots of meat and veggie toppings to choose from.  I usually choose the dumplings, wonton, bok choy, or fish.  The many noodle options are exciting as well. I have a hard time choosing between ho fun and Korean sweet potato noodles. 

It does come with tea or milk tea but I opt out as they taste like dirt water.  Service is not great so I don't come here expecting it.  The food is worth the chaos and sometimes slow service. 

Overall, I still like to come here occasionally.
