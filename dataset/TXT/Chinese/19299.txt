5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g Came here after a terrible wait at Mothers Korean Grill. Overall it was good, considering that this is Las Vegas and not Los Angeles. We had the spicy beef noodle soup and the wonton noodle soup. The broth for both weren't too salty and had a good bit of flavor to them. The wontons were smaller than what I'm used to, but everything in LA comes supersized already. The beef rolls were wrapped in some sort of thin flour mixed with egg and was quite delicious. I also enjoyed the pork chop which was charred to perfection and has some good taste to it. 

Overall, the experience was great with their speedy service, polite waitresses, and otherwise brutally long waits in the buffet lines. I'd come here again if I ever encounter long buffet lines!
