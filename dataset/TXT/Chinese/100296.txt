jzY_beeQKdvA-uZsqDke2Q quality has gone downhill big time.  taste is off, very bland.  portions are smaller, more rice than anything.  Bad Value.  I'd go to Golden moon or Bayview garden going forward.  Also, they charged me $1.50 for using debit which was expected but after looking at my account a week later I noticed the $1.50 was charged twice.
