fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA Awesome place for Shanghai Chinese cuisine with MUST HAVE soup dumplings! Ding Tai Fung is conveniently located at First Markham Place and not hard to find. My only problem with this restaurant is parking. This plaza is horrendous when it comes to finding parking during lunch or dinner times, I'm almost always finding myself waiting for someone to leave before getting a spot. Also, ensure you have a reservation beforehand as this place is VERY busy during peek hours. Once you are finally seated, the food more than makes up for the long wait times.

The soup dumplings are a must here. Although a little pricey for just 6 dumplings, the quality of the dumpling makings up for the quantity. Easily the best tasting dumplings I've ever had. Other dishes ordered include the pan fried dumplings (also very tasty, a lot bigger and harder to eat),braised beef noodle soup (not the best I've had but worth a try) and the wontons in spicy sauce (great flavor in the sauce, not too spicy nothing special about the wonton itself).

Ordering is made easy by filling out a sheet, mark down the quantity beside the item. Although the sheet is in Chinese, the menu is English/Chinese. The food is quite pricey but the service is fast, easy and the taste makes it worth while.
