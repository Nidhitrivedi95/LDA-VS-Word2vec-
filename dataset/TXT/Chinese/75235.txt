FvwB6cSrkfIlfZFlhKwd6w This place is pathetic and will jump on any occasion to rip their clients off. Most restaurants charge extra delivery fees so that's acceptable. However, once the order was placed online, we get a call saying that there's extra cost if we want to pay by card instead of cash. We agreed to that. Then the girl adds that if we want our crispy noodles to be crispy, there's an extra charge for that too... yet the menu from which we chose from EXPLICITLY mentioned that the noodles we ordered were crispy so why want to charge us an extra if the noodles are already supposed to be crispy? That's when you know you're dealing with extremely cheap people that charge you extra at any opportunity just to make some money off of people when it doesn't even cost them anything more. Disgusting way to run a business and the food isn't even worth all those extra charges.
