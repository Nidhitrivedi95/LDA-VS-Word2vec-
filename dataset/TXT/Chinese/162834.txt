UoAPfKoSKJ8B5uXZ2prfeQ Have had a lot of disappointments here before, but maybe finally figured out what I should only order. Grabbed pork fried rice and Mongolian Beef to go. Beef was tender actually, and plentiful. Was pretty good. Have had Gen Tsao's before, oh and many other things and just cant order that here anymore.
