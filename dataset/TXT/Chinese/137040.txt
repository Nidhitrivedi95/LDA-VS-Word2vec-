qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ It was our first time here. Hubby and i went for lunch on a Saturday and it wasn't busy at all.  We really didn't know what to get so we ended up just getting the Samseon Jjamppong with white sauce, which had absolutely no heat. My husband liked it, where for me, I'd definitely like to try the soup with heat. I was surprised that I really liked this soup. The noodles were delicious and the broth had a miso color to it since there were no peppers. The seafood was cooked perfectly. 
We weren't offered tea but had to wait a bit when we did ask for it. I believe the hot water machine that boiled the water wasn't working or something so they had to boil the water some other way. When they brought the tea out, the little kettle that they gave us leaked when we poured the tea so we got water all over the table. 
We were never asked if we wanted anything else, instead the male server automatically asked if we wanted the check so my husband just said yes. I guess we're just used to other restaurants where they ask if you'd be interested in dessert. 
All in all, I'm sure we'll be back to try the other entrees since it's fairly close to our house and we don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown.
