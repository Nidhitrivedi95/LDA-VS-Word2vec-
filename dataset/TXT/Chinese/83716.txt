HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ Pat, I notice in your comment that you say all your produce is fresh not frozen.  What about your proteins?  In a previous review comment, it was noted that your scallops were frozen.

Frankly, I'm a little surprised that your only response is that your produce is fresh not frozen.   That response does not encourage me to give your establishment another chance.
