RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ I want to give Rose Tea Cafe a 5 but the service really really stinks. I felt uncomfortable even ordering bubble teas to go because I got the stinkeye from the staff. I've been here twice now and can confirm that the elderly man who serves as the waiter is not only unfriendly, but downright rude and intimidating. A small eatery who serves bubble teas should allow their customers to order them to go and display their drink menu someone visible...like, on the wall, maybe. 

No, here is what they do. You walk into the cramped (otherwise cozy) restaurant. Said grumpy waiter shoves you a menu wordlessly and you end up sitting down at a table. Then I'm handed a mason jar of water and the grumpy waiter impatiently asks what I'm ordering. I'm dazed because I just want to order a bubble tea and be on my way. I awkwardly stand up and explain that I just want to order a drink to go. He has the NERVE to appear angry at me and snatches the menus out of the way. When I go up to the counter to order, there are no menus! WTF, Rose Tea Cafe? 

Now, I did go here to eat as well on another trip and that was a lot less awkward but still had the same exact horrible service. The food here is great. The prices for the specials and bubble tea is very reasonable too. The prices for the regular dishes is pretty high for such a small eatery and lack of nicer plates/silverware though. I recognized many authentic Taiwanese meals and the flavors were superb. The marinated egg is excellent. It's such a shame because I would come here quite often if it were not for that one mean, mean man! Can he just work in the back so he doesn't have to talk to customers? Yeesh! Not even a smile or acknowledgement as you enter or leave the place! My friend asked him a question about the curry chicken and he just stared at her. He is just awful.
