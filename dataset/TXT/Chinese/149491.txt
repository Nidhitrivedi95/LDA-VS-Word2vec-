sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg The staff here is friendly and helpful with fantastic food. The portions are extremely filling and tasty. I am a huge fan of their Lo Mein, it is fantastic. Their fried pork egg rolls are huge and is a meal all by itself. The food comes quickly and inside it is very clean and tidy. Excellent tasting fried rice and their tofu is amazing. I am not a fan of tofu, but the way they cook it I will find myself ordering the Hot Korean or Spicy Szechuan with Tofu instead of chicken or beef. Well worth your time and money. The owner is usually there to greet you and asks how your meal was and how your day is going.
