ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ Heard Toronto's known for great Canto food next to Vancouver in Canada, so of course I can't miss the chance to indulge in this delight. Careful perusing of BlogOT.com and ours truly Yelpers brought me to Crown Princess. 

Talk about FANCY.  This place has marble along the walls and crystal chandeliers everywhere, tea served in English tea settings, chopsticks with marble (print), cherng fun with it's own sweet soy pitcher. Think I unintentionally sat a lil straighter and spoke a lil softer; no shouting for my har gow and sui mai at the cart ladies. We ordered our dim sum from a checklist. 

As expected, all of the glitz comes with a price. Mine was pretty much double what I'd normally pay for dimsum, but I'd say it's worth the experience. Nowhere else can one find caviar and duck liver on the sui mai. And now that we're on the food...

1. Caviar and duck liver sui mai: delicious and a MUST get. Caviar was okay....didn't taste it much since there was so little of it and kept getting lodged between my teeth, but i'm a pate lover so that duck liver was an awesome compliment to the otherwise traditional version.
2. Har gow (shrimp dumpliing): not bad, but nothing special. Could use a lil salt.
3. Scallop and Shrimp dumpling: very similar to the har gow, but with scallop.
4. Pork rib: good. I like the broth, very flavorful...think it'd be great with ramen noodles.
5. Beef cherng fun: Great. Def not the standard stuff u'd find elsewhere. It's made with very tender sliced beef instead of ground meat and with a few strands of Chinese greens it in.
6. Turnip cake: solid good, but nothing crazy to talk about.

Very fresh ingredients and creative at times. Worth a trip if in town.
