YpnvKqeVD7dqZ9Mr0SGw6A Where should I start?! I do not know what is wrong with Pei Wei these days.  I ordered on line take out of 2 regulars extra spicy w/extra sauce on the side.  It certainly seems simple enough and the order confirmation was correct.  When we got home, there were 2 smalls w/zero sauce on either order.  The requested "extra" sauce was provided, fortunately, as this was the only sauce we had for our meals.  The sauce containers were placed ON THEIR SIDE in the bag - fortunately the lids were on tight.  I can only imagine if they had leaked!  There was ZERO flavor, let alone any detectable spice, thank goodness for Sriracha and/or hot chili oil.  The rice was not the "normal" rice.  It had a strange texture and tasted like "Uncle Ben's" converted rice.  Additionally, there were virtually no vegetables in either meal and one of my snap peas had something very hard and crunchy (I'm fortunate to have very strong teeth) - don't know if it was dirt or ??? along with a very few tasteless pieces of chicken that were breaded and dry instead of wok seared as usual. 

It seems the more complex Pei Wei's menu becomes, the more their food suffers.  Perhaps it's just too many dishes for the constantly changing cooks to remember.  When Pei Wei first opened the menu was pretty simple, flavorful and consistent in quality.  Now it's a roll of the dice as to what you'll actually receive.  Perhaps Pei Wei needs to return to the basics that made them successful, bring back some of the removed favorites and concentrate on having fewer dishes that are satisfying, tasty and quality consistent.  It will be quite some time before we order from Pei Wei, again, if ever.  I value my money too much to squander it on one disappointment after another.
