FanQrSh9QTDytonKHt9C6Q The worst possible experience ever.

Came with my wife and 18 month old infant for lunch on the recommendation of our Hotel Concierge.

The 1 star is for the good tasting food. BUT Never in my world wide travels have I come across a server who is so rude and nasty. She literally snatched the chop sticks from my infants hand. 

Stay away people!!!!
