Thai Iced Coffee 5 stars

Pho- 1.5 stars, +.5 for presentation. It just didn't taste like pho and was wayyyyy too spicy (I like spice). I didn't even eat it.

Service 0 stars. Our server (Girl with glasses was way unfriendly) not sure if she was having a bad day but it wasn't very welcoming for a first timer. She also left (as in went home) without telling us and we waited for our check for about 20 minutes not knowing she took off. Not cool. 
All in all I'll maybe and that's a major MAYBE order another take out order of spring rolls-that's about it for now.
