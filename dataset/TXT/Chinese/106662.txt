l_pR3x7v2mvE3luVdmGuoQ This place has been a staple in my life ever since I moved to the city. To the untrained eye, the menu looks fairly simple - standard chinese favorites, a basic sushi menu - no big deal, right? 

Wrong. This is as close as you're going to get to authentic Chinese in the city. Fresh seafood (a rarity for Pburgh), traditional dishes on a rotating specials menu and amazing hot pots are what you can expect to find. 

I recently tried the basil chicken with crispy milk, and I'm addicted. Sweet, slightly crunchy milk balls paired with a flavorful brown sauce and crunchy sauteed basil are an unexpected match made in heaven. It's not on their everyday menu, but it's always worth asking if they're able to make it. (this place is great for off the menu offerings if you know what you're asking for)

If you're a veggie lover (or even on the fence), the buddah wrapped vegetables are a must. An assortment of crunchy Chinese veggies are baked in tofu skin and doused with a rich dark sauce - its unlike anything I've had before. So good! And I kind of hate meatless dishes. 

The hot pots are are always a sure bet. The pork, fish, and tofu with veggies may sound like a mismatched assortment of whatever, but they work their magic. Oh yes, they work their magic. It's my favorite, but that being said, you can't go wrong with any of their hot pot offerings. Shit is dope.

I could go on and on about all the amazing things Orient Kitchen has to offer, but they're open till 11 most nights, so you're better off figuring it out for yourself.
