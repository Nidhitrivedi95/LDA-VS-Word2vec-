u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ I've always gone to KJ dimsum at the Rio for authentic Chinese food. I was happily surprised to find out they had another location. This place is more casual. The food is just as good. KJ does a good job with their menu. There are tons of options, and the food quality is consistently delicious.
