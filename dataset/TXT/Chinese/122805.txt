OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Me and two of my girl friends were excited to try the dim sum here!  As soon as you walk in the aroma of the place just hits the spot so you know you are in the right place.  We were seated right away since we came in before the lunch crowd.  All of our dim sum was very tasty and hot.  The best part of our lunch was the Tofu Fa which between the three of us had five bowls.  After wards we fell into a food coma.  We will definitely come here again :)
