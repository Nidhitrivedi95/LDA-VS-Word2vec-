h5pqhSb74UeLNkv534m5Hg I came here because I saw an appealing picture on instagram and was also craving lamb skewers. Its hard to find a place with good skewers and I think I've found the place! Service overall was efficient, friendly and polite. Only downside is that it the skewers were a tad salty however my plain wonton soup definitely balanced it out just right. I also dont really order chicken wings at a Chinese restaurant but this location grilled it to perfection with the right crisp and flavour! Environment is kept clean and I enjoy the Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling :)  I am most definitely looking forward to coming back (even though it is out of my way).
