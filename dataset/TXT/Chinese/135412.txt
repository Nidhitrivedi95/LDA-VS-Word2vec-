QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ Ordered soup dumplings and pan fried dumplings plus spicy/sour soup.  Dumplings were not very good, slightly worse than what you can buy at the supermarket and make yourself.  Never got to try soup dumplings because they made the wrong thing--got steamed buns instead.  Spicy/sour soup was like water and had a layer of goop on top.  Prices are about same as Asian Legend so I was wishing I had gone there instead.  Must have changed chefs or something because this is NOWHERE near 4-star quality.
