OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA I had the rice flour roll with shrimp as an appetizer and it was so tasty. The rice flour roll melted in my mouth, and that drizzle of light soy sauce gave it that hint of saltiness it needed. I had both the roast pork and BBQ pork, which were good. The roast pork has a nice crispy skin on it. I visited on Friday evening and the place was packed. I'll be visiting again next time I am in China Town.
