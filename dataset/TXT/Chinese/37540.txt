aPBTwoHvuVKHP2zkiKvwQQ Stoped in for lunch following church. I had sweet and sour chicken,salad, egg roll and a fortune cookie. All for  $7.00,a terriffic deal. Place was spotless. Server was great and entertaining. Food was fresh and very tasty. I loved the salad. All was a little lighter (tasting) and sweeter,pleasantly surprised.  No MSGs.Wonderful place.
Right next Ace on Bell rd. In Surprise.
