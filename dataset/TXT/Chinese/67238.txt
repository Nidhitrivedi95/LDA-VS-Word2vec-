em3TpGN9BAA85u2lXewDiQ This place keeps getting worse every time I go. Their most recent low was MICROWAVING our dinners. It was unmistakable, I had several pieces of rubbery pork that was cold on one side and scaldingly hot on the other. 

The service is barely passable. The staff is nice and polite but just seem to have no interest in doing a good job. For example we asked our waitress for some plates for our kids. After telling us "ok" she went and played on her phone at a table in the back.

On a side note they only have 2 high chairs in a restaurant that seats probably 80. If we go when there are more than 10 other people dining we pretty much are guaranteed not to get a booster or high chair.  Which is a shame because the teriyaki kids meals with steamed broccoli are great!
