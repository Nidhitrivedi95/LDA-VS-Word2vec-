CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Simply overpriced. 

Everything from the Oriental Fried Rice to the Penang Kway Teow lacked flavor and that something special you would expect from a pricey restaurant like Noodles. Even the Malaysian Fried Rice I came here for did not meet my expectations having had the real deal when I lived in Asia. Lastly, the Double Happiness (Barbecue Pork & Soy Chicken) was truly a double disappointment. 
 
I'd stick to Hakkasan for my Asian fusion fixings.
