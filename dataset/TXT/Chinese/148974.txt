SNkkuchbVtUzCwyENcai_g Within this area, this is probably one of the best Korean restaurants. I always lean towards the soups - kimchi jjigae (kimchi stew) & soondubu jjigae (Tofu Stew). Just don't get it with beef, because the one time I did, they used the same beef from their sweet marinated beef dish (bulgogi), which made my stew oddly sweet. Danji is definitely my go-to when I don't want to trek it to KTown on Bloor. The service is always good, and the food is cheap, and consistent.
