cxVp-a28Cp7lavjaPMvK5w Super cool/hip place! We had a very helpful waitress I think named Savannah who made our meal very enjoyable. What she lacked in height she made up for in kindness! The shrimp tempura is delicious and the broccoli is very good as well. I didn't try the entrées but they were reasonably priced.
