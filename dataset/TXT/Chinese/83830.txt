He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw Very tight seating as they try to cram as many tables into the restaurant to maximize seating. Understandable as there always seems to be a line. I think this place is mainly popular because of the aesthetics and how instagrammable the food is. The menu didn't really appeal to me though. I think the food and overall experience was not worth the price I paid. We ordered the eel bibimbap and there was only two small square of eel for the entire bowl of rice. Not that the food tasted bad, I liked the sauce they served on the side, which went well with the rice. We also ordered a omurice egg omelette curry rice with fried pork cutlet. The egg was nice and fluffy, the best thing on the plate. The pork cutlet was dry and over cooked. We also ordered a fruit ice tea which had a lot of fruits but was so artificially sweet, we had to mix water to enjoy the drink. Overall I wouldn't come back.
