JMRJxV9PxIT78ticltqm9g it's a Saturday night hanging out with my friend. We thought about going to a cafe to spend some time. We were attracted by the dimples cafe because the large bright yellow logo caught our eyes in the plaza. So we decided to give a try. And it was amazing how inside looks as good as seeing from outside. The seating area is nice and clean. The chairs are really comfortable compared to others cafe I've been to. We order coconut pudding, and mango pancake. Those two are really delicious. The most great thing that we could play cards here. It's definitely a good place to hang out with your friends. We would come again:)
