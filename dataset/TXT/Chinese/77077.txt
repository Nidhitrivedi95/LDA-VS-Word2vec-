GdnLwnezKcZwoP-fnVtPNg For my first review on yelp, it's actually a 4.5, but I'm giving a 5. I've always gotten very service and the food portions are pretty good.  If you've been to several Pandas, you've noticed that some give so little. Customer service is very good for what it is. Fast food is sometimes crazy. I would agree that sometimes the food servers get distracted with another workers job, but that's life. Tell me that doesn't happen at carls, mcdonalds,,..etc
