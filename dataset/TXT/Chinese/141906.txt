Rh2smrKvcamnP8VBUgMI0Q I'm not sure why the mixed reviews for this place. First, this place is located on the third floor in the heart of Chinatown. As you probably know, Toronto has a huge Asian population unmatched by most cities in North America.

While I lack enough experience to be sure, this place felt as authentic as it could be. 

You order off of a menu indicated how many of the steamed, deep fried, sweet, selections you wanted. They are sorted almost by T-shirt sizes like S, M, L, and XL and sized/priced accordingly. 

Everything that came out was liked by one member of our party. Some were loved by all. 

Service was fine, but they were not crowded on a late Thursday night. Very interested in pleasing the customer even if it takes a minute to get the full understanding due to language barrier. 

The dishes described in English should be self explanatory and of great taste and quality. I really liked the bbq pork buns and the short ribs. All of the shrimp dishes were very good as well. 

Prices and quantity of the food were very reasonable and we left happy, full, and satisfied. 

I noticed the average was a ballpark 3, but elites were ranking 4/5's. The elites are right.

P.s. While the carpet and chairs are a little dated, the place was otherwise really clean, including the bathrooms!  (But fix the commercial dyson hand dryers,they are broken)
