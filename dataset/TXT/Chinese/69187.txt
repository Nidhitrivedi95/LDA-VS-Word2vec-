EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ This restaurant was truly a gem. The waiter (also the OWNER!) and the staff was extremely pleasant and made us feel like home. Food was beyond yummers! We decided to go back the second night for round 2! Highly recommend if you are near Las Vegas. Did I mention they had karaoke?!
