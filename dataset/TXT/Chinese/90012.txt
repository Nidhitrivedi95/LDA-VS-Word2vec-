iddR-Z7pwpp90Cu8SFJ3QA Excellent Dim Sum, best in Oakville. The appearance from the outside looks "industrial", but the inside is warm and welcoming. Ordering is off a checklist rather than from carts, which is my preference.

Tip: arive at 11:00 to get a parking spot near the door and choice of tables. By 11:15 it was jammed.
