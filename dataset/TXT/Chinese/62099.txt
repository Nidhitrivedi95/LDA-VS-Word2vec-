DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA For a Chinese restaurant, this place is OVERPRICED.  Like seriously, there are plenty of places that serve the same food for a lot less.  I'm not impressed.

We ordered the clams sauteed in black bean sauce.  It was tasty and as expected.  it was a good portion. Then we had a veggie dish and then some noodle dish.  All in all, the food was pretty good, but the prices are just a little ridiculous.  

The service is pretty much like many other Chinese restaurant, as expected.  

Bottom line: I think I would look at other options before I come back here for their prices.
