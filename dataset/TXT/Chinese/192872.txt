Customer service is A++

I walked into this restaurant a little confused at first but understood the concept right away.
 I am vegetarian so the veggie bowl is 7$. I filled up my bowl with countless vegetables, tofu, they even have a "meat substitute" if you ask and it is AWESOME! I loaded up with my veggies, sauces, rice & noodles and it was fired up on the mongolian grill!

The food was DELICIOUS, the service was very friendly,and  the new owners approached me to make sure I was having a pleasant experience, which was very nice. 

As an appetizer I had the cream cheese wonton's which were pretty good!

Its right across from UNLV so, I go almost twice a week after class for yummy, quick, and affordable meal!
