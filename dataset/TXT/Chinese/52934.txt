This was my first time trying out this place and I placed an order online for delivery. It gave me an estimated wait time of 45-60min. I called the restaurant 5min later to make sure they received my order. The man who answered was friendly and told me it will be about 45min. Delivery was ON TIME and came in 45min and I was so pleased to find the food scorching hot and Super tasty. The lady who delivered it was also friendly, especially when my pups ran to her, smelling her out. 

I ordered the black pepper steak, pork fried rice, eggplant tofu (my staple at Chinese restaurants and this one was yummy & not oily), crispy chicken noodle, orange chicken, and hot & sour soup. Literally, everything I ordered was yummy & not oily. By far, the best Chinese in Summerlin.
