beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Came with with a friend for girls dinner. We were seated promptly and told how the conveyor and hot pot works from the most helpful waiter. I even dropped my chopstick at one point and he saw it and promptly swooped in with a fresh set before I could pick mine up! Food was fresh and delicious and the sauce bar is fully equipped with many tasty sauces and condiments. They even gave us Java ice cream at the end which was a perfect sweet ending. Exceptional customer service and overall experience, start to finish. I will absolutely be returning.
