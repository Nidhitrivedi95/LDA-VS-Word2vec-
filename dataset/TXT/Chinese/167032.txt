VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA I really like the dumpling haus.  I love the soup dumplings - as good as any I have had anywhere - and I love the more homey items like the tomato omelette! My husband's mother makes this for dinner all the time, but I had never encountered it in a restaurant before.  The place is cute and clean.  Yum!
