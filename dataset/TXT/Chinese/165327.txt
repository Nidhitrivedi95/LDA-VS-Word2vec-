1) Prices - Ok, yes it's in Uptown, but I was still not expecting the prices at this place. Beware!
2) I generally can't handle spicy, so picked one of the few items on the list that didn't have an asterisk by its name, the steamed chicken with vegetables which was instead marked as a low calorie dish. Alas, it felt as if I were eating salt, and the sauce was still very dark. Normally, when I order a steamed dish at a Chinese restaurant, I expect a lighter sauce, so this was disheartening. 

Next time, if I had an extra few minutes, I would probably just drive to Asiatown.
