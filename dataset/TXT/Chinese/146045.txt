S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A Dinner and a show!
It's the only place I have found in Arizona to get <U+5200><U+524A><U+9762> Dao Xiao Mian or Knife Cut Noodles, and fortunately they do a fabulous job with them! The hand cut noodles are thick with a great chewy mouth feel. The pot stickers are fantastic, we get an extra to-go order every time.
The orders are prepared quickly and it's fun to watch them through the kitchen window as they pull the noodles and the stir-fry flames up. 
This place has authentic Chinese noodles and to me it's well worth the hour it takes to get there!
I usually order a watermelon slush and drink it with a straw because I am used to it. That's punny in Chinese. ;-)
