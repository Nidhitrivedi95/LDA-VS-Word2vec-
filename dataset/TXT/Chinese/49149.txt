CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw The place is clean and one of the nicest Asian restaurants I've been to with the huge solid tables and the environment is well done.

Value of food is very bad.  Tried their $27 signature rice (pineapple fried rice) and $26 mongolian beef and some $13-15 vegetable dish.  At that price (3-4x what it normally costs), you'd expect something great, but it was worse than the average chinese restaurant's food.

Food came out quick, but service lacked in general.  Water was never refilled and the way the order was taken felt like a mom/pop shop restaurant.

I don't recommend.
