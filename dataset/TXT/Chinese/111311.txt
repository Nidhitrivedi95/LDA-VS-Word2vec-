This place has got a few delicious highlights beyond the standard Chinese food.  The cocktail shrimps were HUGE and delicious for a standard buffet.  The pad thai tasted like it has fresh basil infused in it!  Way better than the pad thai I had at Spring Roll!!   i really really liked the chicken skewered and I had as much as I wanted, which was wwway to many servings for my own good lol.  There is lots of parking space and the tables aren't jammed packed.  Good value and good taste overall!
