Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Let me get this straight. A Chinese buffet where they bring the food to you? Yes please! 

This was a great place to try Dim Sum (my first time). We went at a weird time (2pm) so it was basically just us in the restaurant. We were bombarded by servers with carts of food, which was cool in general. I tried  a ton of stuff. The Chinese Broccoli was amazing. They put a tasty sauce on it. The shrimp dishes we tried were all great, and I really liked the dumplings. The service was also very friendly, and they were nice to explain what each dish was, for the most part.  

For a nice experience with Dim Sum off the Strip, give this place a try. Really, try it. Not just saying that. :)
