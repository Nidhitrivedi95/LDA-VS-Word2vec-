dblGQtHAzNy1ACis1m2shw Never order from again, I had been a good customer for over 2 years. Recently I placed an order I had to give turn by turn directions on how to get to my house cause their driver was an ass. Even though I have ordered from them before for some reason they couldn't figure out how to get to my house.... after an hour and a half the driver calls me and tells me he is lost... WTF? REALLY? And by now my food is about as warm as an Eskimos ass, after fifteen min of going back and fourth with the driver I finally gave up and canceled my order and I was told they won't take my order again cause I canceled.... so I should eat cold food cause their driver doesn't listen to directions or knows how to use google maps.... after I called the main number and told them I see they just don't care, how nice! Would give less then one star if I could
