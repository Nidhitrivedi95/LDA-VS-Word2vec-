Ozf92eEJSwwb3LbO50cvag Decent food but rude service. I called in an order of sweet and sour chicken with sauce on side and no veggies. I told the girl on the phone "just chicken nothing else". My wife went to pick up the order and there is chicken and pineapple in the container. Now the chicken is soggy. She tells the lady we just wanted chicken with nothing else. The lady told my wife "If you dont like it then dont come back!" Seriously?! Nice customer service. We wont be back.
