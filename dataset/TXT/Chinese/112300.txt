mFQTnqCaJwhK7OAu3u4A5g I order in a LOT, and, after discovering Green Lady about a week ago, have ordered from there 4 times. The food is high quality, consistent, and inexpensive. 

I generally order the Thai food from there - Pad Thai along with a Tofu dish. It's been amazing each time and the Pad Thai is easily one of the best in the city. I am particular about my Pad Thai and each time I order, the lady who answers the phone is totally accommodating (much more than I can say for a lot of the other places I've ordered from)

I've done both delivery and take out and both have been great experiences. I've never eaten IN the restaurant, though would like to sometime soon. Basic decor, small kitchen.

Like I said, I do a lot of takeout (at least 5 times a week), and this is the first restaurant I've felt passionately enough about to sign up to Yelp for.
