X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Ew, This is what Vegas has come to? A room of losers fighting for places to stand? 
On top of all of that the promoters for this club are DOUSHE BAGS!  
Not sure if anyone heard about the article that came out not long ago, where the promoter was denying heavier girls access to the club. Yep, discrimination, and it still goes on HERE.

Was on one of the promoters face books the other day and he was talking crap about women's appearances and why they don't deserve to get into "his" club. Very nice of you to protect your club from all the ugly people, but it seriously shows the lack of integrity, and professionalism that goes on around here. straight talking crap.
This club isn't worth it, nor are the others...

I wouldn't give my money to ANY of these clubs they are all  powered by disgusting tourist who decide to come and live here and claim this city as theirs please go back to South Carolina/Dakota,  or where ever the F you came from.
