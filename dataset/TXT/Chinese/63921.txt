E0zjBNt4_giYtJqUjugskw Ordered food from here and got it delivered. I got a green tea smoothie instead of a mocha smoothie that I ordered. Their shrimp fried rice was okay, there was a lot of shrimp which was good. Their moo goo chicken was way too oily, it was tasty but my plate was drenched in oil, yuck. I ended up getting free fried donuts coated with sugar. These were delicious, I guess the saying is right, the best things in life are free lol. Prob won't end up ordering from here again.
