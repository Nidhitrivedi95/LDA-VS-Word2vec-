2GtIC6u4hVneccWfTlOxHQ Gosh, I had high hopes for this place...  I mean, it wasn't bad... it was just "A-OK" for me.  Makino in Vegas and Tora in San Diego are in the 5-star zone.. whereas Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet is at a 2.5 for me.  What? I gave the place a 3?  Yeah, I rounded it up only because the sushi chef and hostess were nice.   Right when I walked in, I was overwhelmed with the scent of old bleach that had been mixed in with dirty, hot water.  It wasn't an appetizing smell for me... but as I got closer to the food... well, I tried to ignore the stench.   There wasn't anything spectacular that stood out - the egg foo young was bland, the sushi was pretty good, but the selection was... hmm... expected?   If I'm ever hungry for an Asian Buffet in Arizona, I think I'll go to Crazy Buffet :P
