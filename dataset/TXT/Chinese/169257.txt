vsi_PMRgyFy4_vVfQErtCA Delivery was faster than expected,  kind of the only big plus.  Fried tofu with coriander was good, broccoli with snow peas. . . . Was fresh and tasty but man for $9 I expected more! 
We ate here years ago and decided to get delivery after a long days work. . . . Hoping that nothing had changed. It's either changed or thier delivery customers don't get the same food.
Either way, we'll likely try elsewhere next time.
Oh! Also beware the surprise $2.50 fuel surcharge when adding your tip ;)
