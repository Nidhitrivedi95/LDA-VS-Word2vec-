yEZn1XpLsEC9uBa-X4xAZw Great food. I went and got a 10-inch Banh Mi for less than 5$. Tasted great! They also have other stuff, such as fried rice and sushi rolls, although those are prepackaged and slightly pricier. They have lovely decor with bright, vivid colours that really give a trendy vibe to the place. The shop is actually pretty small, though, so there are only a couple tables to sit down at.

(fyi they only accept credit for purchases of 5$ or more)
