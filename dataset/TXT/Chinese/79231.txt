GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Pricey dim sum, but what do you expect from a José Andrés restaurant inside the Cosmopolitan? While the prices were nothing to shake an eggroll at, the food was actually really delicious and the flavors were, dare I say, pretty authentic

As a dim sum snob, I had some pretty high expectations for $13 har gow (shrimp dumpling). It was actually very flavorful, possibly a little too flavorful for har gow. I had the caldo tlalpeño, which is perfect hangover food. It's a nice, savory but light soup with lots of healthy vegetables so you feel real good about eating it. It normally comes spicy with chipotle sauce, but I requested it on the side and ended up not using it because it was savory enough on its own. 

The guacamole is insanely good, especially with the soft tortillas. It's like curry and naan!!
