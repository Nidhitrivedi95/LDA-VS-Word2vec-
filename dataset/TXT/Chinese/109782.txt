Chow mein is way starchy/ goopy
Use charsiu pork, which seemed strange to me. Also let me caveat to say that I usually am a huge fan of charsiu pork, but I really didn't care for the taste of the charsiu pork on my noodles
Veggies include bean sprouts and cabbage only

But at least the flavor is decent. Nice and garlicky, not too salty

Egg rolls were filled with cabbage (nothing else inside); also tasted like it was fried w ith old oil.
