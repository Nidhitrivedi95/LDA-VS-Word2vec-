8LUKD_9rkJoUIIuT9uiDbA If you want authentic Cantonese beef chow fun (dry style) this is the place. Tell them to go light on the soy sauce and you have one of the best Chinese street food dishes you can get. The dish is savory - not sweet and sour and not hot and spicy - so may not be to everyone tastes - but it is the real deal. Get it with the side order of the garlic stir fried asparagus.

My son is a big fan of the red dragon roll - but I am chow fun all the way.
