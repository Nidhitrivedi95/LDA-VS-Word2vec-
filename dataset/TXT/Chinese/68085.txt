EQZPTDAy-lWijb0i8JpHNw The famous Shanghai style dumpling place by the crew behind Qing Hua. After craving Xiao Long Bao forever, I've decided to give this place a try. we ordered the spicy tofu, the cold sesame noodles, the cucumber salad, the lamb dumplings, the pork, and the crab xiao long bao. 

The entrees were very average. The cold tofu, while being smokey, lacks any type of flavour. It was a clear case of missing salt. The dish lack a glue that gets it together.

The cold sesame noodles were acceptable, while a bit too sweet.

The cucumber salad was very cucumbery, and sour, just like how it should be.

The lamb dumplings were a total failure, by using the dough of the soup dumplings to make the normal dumplings, it falls apart, taste flat, and has absolutely no texture.

The soup dumplings were acceptable, and had a solid balance between the flavours.

Unlike most people on this page, our service was efficient and quick enough.
