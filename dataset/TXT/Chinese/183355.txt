xONNOYgT5BBJj_EVJBMghQ Used to come to China Garden a lot growing up. It was our go to sit down Chinese restaurant. I was super excited when I saw that it was still open. We drove out to Norwin Town Square..where it was located..and umm..it wasn't there. And Norwin Town Square..a shopping plaza btw..was completely different. It was like they tore it all down and rebuilt it..with no China Garden. I was so bummed..but then we quickly realized that they had just moved into a stand alone location across the street. 

The new location is nice. Very big and open..very modern feeling inside. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and pretty much enjoyed a private dining experience. The staff here was really nice and accommodating. I felt nostalgia for and missed the old location, but this one, admittedly, is much much nicer.

The prices here can get pretty steep but since we were there for lunch time we took advantage of their lunch specials. They were so unbelievably reasonably priced!

I got the sesame chicken and an egg roll. I forgot how great the egg rolls were here. Very crisp and very favorable. They have the perfect amount of outer won-ton and filling. Delicious. 

The sesame chicken was great as well. The sauce had a really nice tang to it and the chicken was really crisp. I don't think I used to order this much (my old obsession was their sweet and sour), but I'm really glad I did.

Again, another old school place from my childhood still up and kicking! I feel very fortunate to be able to go back and visit all these places! I would definitely visit again!
