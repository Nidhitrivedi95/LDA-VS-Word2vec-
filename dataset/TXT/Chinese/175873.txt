WLCdg4ib7-_7b8epoXRjAw I get Chinese maybe twice a year. So unlike most, I don't have a go to spot. The reviews for the two places closest to me weren't so great, so I took yelps advice and we ordered (thru the Eat24 app) from Cherry House. We got steamed dumplings, beef with broccoli, sweet and sour chicken for the kids and a wonton soup. Ordering was a breeze. Price was nothing to complain about either. Service was friendly. Food was pleasant enough for Chinese. I definitely can't complain. It was all recognizable :) but the dumplings,.,they were delicious, the sauce that accompanies them...to die for. I'm pretty sure we just established our go to place. There was no shortage of condiments. Menu was plentiful and affordable. 4 of us ate off of what we ordered. Not bad.
