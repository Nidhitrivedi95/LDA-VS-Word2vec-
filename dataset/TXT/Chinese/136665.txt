QHZw2L6LV1qmExNJbfhIsQ Love the food. Not a fan of the wait. It's important to come at the right time if you want to beat the line up as it can get crowded. 

The dim sum was delicious. Ironically, the BBQ pork (Char siu) rice good only because when you go to dim sum, you do not think of just getting BBQ pork and rice.

Other then that, we usually get the typical dim sum food such as siu mai, har gow (shrimp dumpling), congee and they're all pretty good. 

Will definitely come back.
