I8TOosBLYKxZMAYNNyGEyg Wow, shockingly bad food. Recieved a menu on our door and thought we'd try it out. First and last time eating at (not so) Tasty House.  Would rather run a $50 bill through my shredder than eat this food.

Lady who took the phone order was relatively unpleasant. Food arrived very quickly and order was accurate. I now think it arrived so quickly because they only use a microwave and deep fat fryer. I don't think they own a wok or saute pan, the food was tasteless and colorless. I don't think the fried rice was actually fried, it looked and tasted like white rice with a dash of say for coloring, but not actually fried. Everything was bland, there was no flavor developed in any of the dishes. The pork slices tasted like they had been freezerburned, yuck. I am pretty sure this is the worst chinese food I have eaten in my 43 years.

I'm sticking with Dragon Bowl down the street.
