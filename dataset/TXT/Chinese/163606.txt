URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg I found this place quite by accident, my friend was looking for a Chili's where we could meet for lunch.  She gave me this address and I was delighted  to find China Chili instead of one of the run-of-the-mill, not even Mexican food Chili's.  

I ordered the House Chicken and was given the choice of spicy or not.  I opted for spicy, it was delicious. 

So many people have complained about the decor, it was simple and to be honest I did not notice what, if anything, they had hanging on the walls, and I really don't care!  I'm there to eat and enjoy the company of my friends.  The food was great, the service was good considering how busy it was for lunch and the prices were reasonable.

I've recently relocated to Phoenix from the east coast and where I came from there was one decent Chinese restaurant in a 50 mile radius.  China Chili is better than the best my town had to offer.
