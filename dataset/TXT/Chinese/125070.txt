oWEFIvvt_kJCuk2V268XeQ Decent Dim Sum but insanely rude management. 

Went there for the third time with a buddy and we were seated at a larger table due to no other table being available. We ordered and got a few of our dishes but as we were just beginning to eat the manager came over and told us we would have to vacate the table immediately due to a larger group having arrived. Seriously? We asked if we could be moved to another table as we already had food and we were told that we would have to wait at the front  for a smaller table or take the food to go. An atrocious way to treat patrons. 

We got up and left without paying for the food we didn't even get to eat and the manager yelled "You pay and don't come back!" on the way out the door. Don't worry pal I will never come back.
