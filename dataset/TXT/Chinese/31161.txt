9O0jWqGnHkBsXMOd-KOl4w I always have a little trepidation when attempting to have chinese indian fusion or any type of fusion for that matter. Its a real challenge to make two cuisines mesh, but these guys pulled it off. I had the chilli paneer which was off the hook. I would go for that if you can and stay away from the chicken. Not that the chicken is bad but it might not work with some weird fusion style sauce.
