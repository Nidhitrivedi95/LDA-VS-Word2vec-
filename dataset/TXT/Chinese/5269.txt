079CV1EE5WLdQqVEVYFeHQ Several years agoI volunteered at the gay center which was located in the same strip mall. Even then being so close I rarely walked the few feet to eat here.

A friend, Greg loves this place so I have gone with him.

I find the decor and feel of the place, cold and uninviting. We have always gone in what would be considered off dining hours so there were often no one else in the place but our table. We were always greeted with enthusiasm, but this is because Greg has one of those personalities that screams friendly and he always gets it in return. So our service has always been spot on.

But the food lacked inspiration. I have never had a dish that would pull me back on my own. It was never terrible or inedible, just blah.

But Greg loves this place and so do others I see. I am just not one of them.
