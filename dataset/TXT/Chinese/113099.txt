MLwVTDhM2DOESvKGcfKCsg I ordered delivery -- spring rolls and spicy garlic eggplant. The food arrived hot and on time. Spring rolls were good, very crispy, and flavorful. The texture of the eggplant was good, but a tad too spicy since I'd selected medium and the heat overpowered any garlic flavor. My major complaint was that the eggplant was just too oily. It's fine and I appreciate the delivery option, but not really a draw.
