T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw I've eaten here only twice; the first time I don't remember what I ate, but I remember thinking it was a bit overpriced.
The second time I came here my best friend brought me. She had a gift certificate she wanted to use, and we went in for a late dinner (I'm talking an hour before they close late). We decided to get a special they had for two people; two soups, two starters, two entrees, and your choice of two desserts or shareable dessert.
She ordered the Orange Peel Chicken for the main dish, and I got the Orange Peel Shrimp. 
The Shrimp was very tasty, and had a little kick to it. We shared some spring rolls with the house sauces, and got separate desserts.
The down side was the desserts were little shot glasses full of cake. It wasn't that much. We should have asked for a shareable one, it would have been bigger.
The staff was very nice considering we were there pretty late, and overall the food was alright.
