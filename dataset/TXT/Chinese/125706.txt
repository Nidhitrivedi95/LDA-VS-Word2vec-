Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w Visited for the first time today and for starters the food taste horrible I could get better tasting food at the mall for half the price they try to charge here, it was cold the rice tasted old and overcooked the noodles were dry the sesame chicken tasted old I mean just plain out bad and then when I requested to speak to the manager his excuse was its a buffet the food doesn't have to be hot what the heck is that ?! After that he said I had to pay full price and proceeded to be rude about it like it was my fault I ate one plate and not even all of it yet he still insisted I pay full price I told him I would not pay for food that tasted that bad finally he decided to charge 50% only after I insisted I wouldn't pay he's lucky he even got $4.75 out of me because the service from him was horrible and the food was not any better than his attitude I advise people to STAY AWAY !! Go anywhere but here !!!
