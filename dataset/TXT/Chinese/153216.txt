TA1Q7RWVzMigi5X3FAmctw I've never had Hakka food before but it was absolutely delicious! I give the food a 4/5. But what I didn't like was the service as the waitress seemed a bit rude. When we first sat down she had heard us saying we wanted the Chicken Pakora & asked us if we wanted to order it now as it took 20 mins to prepare. However, we were still waiting for two others to arrive & didn't want to order anything yet. Then she kept coming back (2x?) to ask about the order. It was the attitude that was questionable. i remember the bill being dropped on the table, no smiles, looked pissed.... 

From memory, we had...
Asian Garden Special Hakka Chow Mien - the photo in the menu looked better but still tasty.
Chili Chicken - tasty and a little spicy. i liked this more than the chicken pakora
Chicken Pakora - great w/ a little sauce
Shrimp Friend Rice - great for those who don't enjoy spicy foods. yum yum 
Beef Fried Rice - this was prob. my fav. there was a bit of spice in there and it really gave it a little kick
some other veggie dish

It only cost about $10 per person (for 6 ppl). What a great price ! 

They take reservations but you might not need it on any day except Saturday. Lots of parking.
