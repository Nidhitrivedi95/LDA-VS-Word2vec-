oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q This place is great! I am a big fan of the chili chicken, Mongolian beef and Hakka chow mien. Have never had a complaint about the service. There is sometimes a wait but i think that just shows that people love the food. The decor is not what i would expect from a Hakka restaurant and i think it just adds to the charm. Last time i visited this place i had their chili chicken and asked for extra spicy and they definitely didn't disappoint on the heat. They are always pretty accommodating with large groups and are great for takeout with containers overflowing with noodles!
