beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Even though eating this kind of thing in the middle of summer is as strange as having a popsicle in a snowstorm to me, the fragrant scent of boiled meats and other delights coming out of the kitchen squashed any of those concerns upon entering.  I walked to the table as quickly as possible to dive into it all.  

The excellent ingredients and presentation totally take this place to the next level.  Their beef and lamb combo platter was sliced red meat pornography and tasted even better with their vast array of sauces (the BBQ one seemed most popular).  The seafood combo platter packed with shrimp, scallop, octopus, squid, and mussels with its dry ice center garnered the "oohs" and "ahhs" it was looking for.  Even the people at a neighboring table came over to snap pics.  We also ordered the meatballs, live scallops (huge!) and the short rib; all top notch. 

My only real gripe is with the menu itself.  There are a lot of options and it could be daunting for first timers to the restaurant, let alone this type of dining experience as a whole.  It's probably even more annoying for staff since they have to constantly answer questions that could easily be clarified on the menu, like portion size.  To save everyone time, offering combo meals for 2, 4, and 6 people with a little bit of everything should be considered.

- While a cool novelty, the conveyer belt will go ignored unless dining solo or if you're the only one yearning for a plate of blood tofu or cuttlefish.  We ordered a lot and it was more than enough.  It isn't important or as fun to sit by as I thought it would be.    

- Dipping high quality beef into boiling water is never worth it.  Avoid the "Kobe".

- I really want to go spicy next time!

- Can we PLEASE STOP calling this fondue?
