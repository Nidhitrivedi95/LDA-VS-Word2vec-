2NBCBWZNH23vjxDx-ptg8Q The manor house is a chinese restaurant in Corstorphine. It offers exceptionally good food. Personally I would recommend the roast duck as this is done so well. The staff are friendly and there is a good atmosphere. In the evening I would recommend parking in the bank car park which is just over the road. 
The downside is that sometimes, larger functions and parties can create alot of screaming kids which is rather annoying. 
I would definatly say that this place is worth a visit.
