Lai lai wok is no exception. I love the simplicity of this place, they serve you exactly what you ordered on a plate, nothing too special. Tastes way better than some of the other Chinese places on campus. I also love that water and tea are free! What a generous, kind, and giving owner to do that. Makes me wanna go back again and again
