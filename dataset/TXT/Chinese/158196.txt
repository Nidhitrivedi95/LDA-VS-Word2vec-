TxNeo206T0jMvRRQ4nKSIg I went here for lunch on Valentines day. Once we were seated, I didn't see a waiter or waitress for the rest of our stay. Being that it was Valentines Day and my anniversary, I would have liked to order a "real drink" off the drink menu but no one came around.   

The price and the food were okay. There was a whole food section that was empty, but I guess they save that area for dinner. The live cooking section was pretty neat to watch. (I was a little worried about the fact that they have raw meat sitting out in a buffet for hours at a time though).   

When it was time to leave, I had to flag someone down to request the bill, being that we didn't seem to have a waiter or waitress.  

Overall we were unimpressed and probably won't be back.
