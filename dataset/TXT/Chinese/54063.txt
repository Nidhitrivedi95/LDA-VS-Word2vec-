cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ We came here on a weekday lunch during a school break and were fairly surprised to see it rather empty.  Food seemed rather bland and just constantly missed the mark.  The highlight were the noodles, but those too were pretty plain.  There seemed to be quite a variety of food, but the actual quality of all the food is disappointing to say.  

Their rolls were falling apart and poorly made and the food just didn't seem that fresh.  Service was rather lacking and their staff didn't seem too quick to refill food.

Decor was nice although we all found it fairly weird/amusing that there was jewelry being sold in display cases outside the eating area...
