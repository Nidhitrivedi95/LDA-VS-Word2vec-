asAHqgKQtCWiBbC3XriSIQ Thought the food tasted great!  I ordered the Lo Mein, Sesame Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, and Sweet & Sour chicken.  Fast prompt service.  Easy to pick up and run.  Wished the General Tso's was a little more spicy and hot.  They package their food well so that you can save it for another day.  Prices were very reasonable!  Egg rolls were okay and so was the Crab Rangoon.  Good Take-Out!!!!
