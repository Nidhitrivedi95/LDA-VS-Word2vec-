I_vzg2V92U7wdD61tvGtpg We've been getting take-out from this place for years, and I have yet to eat better Chinese food in this city. My favorites would be the appetizers, especially the Fried Dumplings, The Egg Roll, and the Crab Rangoon. The General Tso's Chicken though is tender, sweet, and rich, and the Beef Fried rice is steamy, and light, yet sticks to the ribs, the little meat bits being packed with flavor. I also crave the Sweet and Sour Chicken, and I cheat!  I just dip it in that red candy syrup. Rules are made to be broken.

Be mindful of the little ones when you stop by to pick up your food too. One of them is always doing their homework or showing you their toys.
