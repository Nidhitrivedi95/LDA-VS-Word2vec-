RN-fX-LiwUm46a6G_r1xSw My family and I gave this place a second chance and suffice it to say, it didn't change our initial opinion of the place. For the price they charge us the food isn't good not even close. The crab rangoon isn't crab rangoon; it's just cream cheese. My fiance ordered general tsao and sesame chicken, both of those dishes were the same; one just didn't have sesame seeds on the chicken. General tsao is supposed to be spicy. They used the very same sauce on both dishes. On top of that, their chicken is dry ..very dry. How is the chicken dry with sauce on it I'll never know but it was like biting down on 3 day old chicken that sat out. Chicken was so dry, it needed lotion. 

What I'm confused about the most is the rice. They're supposedly supposed to have been two boxes of WHITE rice that came with the chicken meals. They came in separate boxes, why was one box of rice discolored? When you get to the bottom, that's when the rice was white. I found that to be weird. Their portion sizes need work and the egg rolls are overcooked. The first time I ordered they forgot a few items and had to send someone else out with them, by that time it was cold. 

It takes them forever to deliver, too. I can understand the average 30-45 minute wait but when it's way beyond that timeframe, it's ridiculous. 

Overall, this is the kind of chinese food you eat when the good chinese place is closed for the day and you're drunk and need a quick bite to eat. We thought the place was having a bad day the first time we ordered and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Well fool me once...

Never again.
