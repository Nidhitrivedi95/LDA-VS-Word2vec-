bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A It's good Chinese American food. My favorite is the Shanghai noodles with beef & curry sauce. The Mongolian beef isn't bad for the most part but sometimes I get more onions than beef. The young girl that takes the orders over the phone always sounds like she's having a bad day but the staff is always welcoming when I pick up my food. The lunch special prices are great especially when you're on a budget. The sesame chicken is good but there's more breading than chicken. Overall it's good fast food.
