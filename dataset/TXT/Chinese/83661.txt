HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ There is one place that each of my many and varied friends can agree on for a delicious and relaxing dinner -- Ginbu 401. This little restaurant is meticulously clean (quite possibly the cleanest restrooms in Charlotte) and tastefully decorated. There's nothing pretentious about the place and a person would feel comfortable here dressed for a show or just popping by casually. 

Of the scores of times I've eaten at Ginbu 401, I've never EVER gotten a single bad dish. The sushi is always uber-fresh and the rice/noodle dishes are tasty. My friends who love ginger particularly crave the ginger dressing on their salads; I, on the other hand, relish the miso soup. We ALL agree the crab rangoon are the best in town! 

There is a great selection of appetizers, sushi, hibachi/noodle dishes, etc. on the menu. Everything is very reasonably priced and represents a great value.

When I used to live uptown (for 9 years) I ordered from Ginbu 401 many times and the delivery service was spectacular.

The owner is hard-working, diminutive and delightful lady who clearly takes great pride in her establishment. She is also gifted with being able to discern which servers and cooks to hire . . . everyone here consistently delivers top-notch food and service.

Ginbu 401 is a simply wonderful sushi/asian-fusion spot which I'm glad to say is one of my very favorite go-to spots in the Queen City.

Currently, Ginbu 401 offers a $20 for $10 deal for customers using the Yelp! app.
