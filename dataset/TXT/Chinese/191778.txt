YWm5z2mu-C-pUuL86fcFxQ Unlike most Chinese take-out places, they have a good selection of tables where you can eat in - whether you will want to is entirely your discretion. It isn't bad at all, with nice booths, rather than the standard (often black-lacquer) hard chairs, so it's very comfortable seating, but it can get a bit loud with noise from the kitchen, and orders being called in (they speak a bit loudly on the phone) and a fairly regular stream of people picking up the orders to go. Also, the tableware is not fancy - just a simple styrofoam plate.

That said, whether you dine in or pick up and take it home, the food here is solid, and well worth what you are investing. Like most places, they do not have (or I did not see) dinner combinations, so if you want to get a plate with rice and an egg/spring roll, go for lunch. Dinner will instead be a good portion, and by good portion I mean about as big as your head. If you get the smaller size, they cut back a bit on the meat, and make up the difference in rice. Still well worth it, but you may not have as much for leftovers or to share.
