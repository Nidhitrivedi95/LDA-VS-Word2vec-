OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA Have the rudest server ever. I ordered rosted pork with ribs and gave me just rosted pork. Complained and the server came at the front and talk to the other server. She came back and told me that they dont have ribs anymore. Sure, whatever! I can definitely see ribs hanging at fhe front. Then they always give me my bill when i'm not even halfway done my food. This restaurant should have a good customer training!
