O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw This post is a must... I feel compelled to warn you of the following:

For all those old skool Rol-San lovers who went there back in the days for the Szechuan chicken, chicken corn soup, KCUTSA discount, and lighting fast service... Sadly it no longer exists. I came out of there so angry and still hungry and told our server blantantly that the food taste like shit and that I'm never coming back. So save yourself the thought of a nostalgic stroll down memory lane and avoid this place. New owners and new servers have driven this great past time into the gutter.
