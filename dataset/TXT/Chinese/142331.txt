RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg I don't know if I have really high standards but the food was not great at all. To tell you all I usually don't even leave a little grain of rice... I did not even finished any of the three rolls I ordered, and neither did my husband. The fish did not taste right and the flavor was flat. it gave me a stomach ache and even the ginger tasted funny, not to mention the wasabi was almost brown... yuck. I am sticking to RA Sushi and Kona grill from now on!
