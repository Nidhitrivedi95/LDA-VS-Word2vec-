D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA After many visits at Paris in Vegas, we finally decided to take in lunch at Yougn Kang Street.
The veg spring rolls were crispy & tasty.    The Wonton Noodle & Hong Kong Style Noodle bowls were decent tasting.  While the dim sum cart came by, we also decided to get the Sui Mai (pork) dish.  Waiter was attentive. Overall thumbs up.
