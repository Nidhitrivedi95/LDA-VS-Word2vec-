cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Our party of 4 adults went for a birthday dinner on Dec. 26, 2012 at 6:30pm. The place was pretty full but we were seated right away. The atmosphere is great and the wooden ship decor is super, although the 4 person square tables are pretty tight. Luckily the service was quick (and very pleasant) and our dishes were cleared promptly. It is a busy restaurant so sometimes the service is a bit "drive-by" but the servers were all responsive. My favourite part of the restaurant is the sink that is conveniently placed in the middle of the buffet so you can wash your hands after enjoying your 1/2 lobster, without having to go to the washroom. They also serve Peking duck, which is one of my favourite dishes and something I've never seen at any other buffet restaurant. They had a nice selection hot dishes, fresh fruit and tasty desserts, but stay away from the fish balls..... I didn't get to try their noodles that are apparently made fresh in-house but I've heard they are very good. Overall it was an enjoyable evening. Seniors get a 20% discount. 
The restaurant is a little tricky to find since it is on York Mills Road but fronts onto a side street and can only be seen when you're driving eastbound on York Mills, but it is worth the drive! I would definitely recommend the Dragon Pearl Buffet.
