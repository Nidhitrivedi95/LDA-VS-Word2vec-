Rh2smrKvcamnP8VBUgMI0Q This is a great restaurant with great food. I was suspicious at first because I came at five and no one was here but by six the place was packed. There is something for everyone here. Authentic dim sum, Peking duck, fish, lobster, etc. for those who want Americanized Chinese food they have that too. The prices are great. At first the service wasn't great but then we met Tommy. Tommy was an awesome waiter. Ask for Tommy.
