aJR1iUWwNVBM692gq7adBA I love their crab puffs! They are so light and crispy, and never too greasy. 
I try to get something new each time I come, although I love their curry, and the porc mi fun. 
I go here almost once a week for a quick dinner, and have never been disappointed. 
The staff are courteous and remember the special orders I get, such as adding veggies to dishes, and removing the mushrooms from others.
