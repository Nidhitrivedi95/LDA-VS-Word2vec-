_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA In Las Vegas and hungry?  Go here! 

It's located on the gaming floor by the sports book and it was fantastic.  This place was a recommendation from a good friend who goes here every time he's in Vegas and I am glad he was spot on.

Decor was very authentic, clean and modern.  All the waitstaff were very friendly and all spoke English fairly well.

The menu is vast and there were so many items we wanted to try we all ordered a dish to share.

BLACK PEPPERED BEEF UDON
MOO SHU PORK
MIXED SEAFOOD PAN-TOASTED NOODLES
POT STICKERS
BBQ CHICKEN WINGS (was served cold - not sure why)
CHASHIU BBQ PORK (was served cold - not sure why)
WON TON SOUP

Everything was hot and delish!  I think I had the best pot stickers ever there!  The pan friend noodles with a creamy sauce was also a favorite of mine. 

Noodle Asia goes on my list of places to visit again!
