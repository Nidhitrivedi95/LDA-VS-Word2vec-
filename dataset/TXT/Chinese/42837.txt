beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw We have been consistent patrons of Chubby Cattle, we come to eat here at least once a month; especially during happy hour on Sunday to Thursday from 9:30 onwards. What became our favorite here is the hell soup and mushroom pot; they are satisfyingly tasty but not too overwhelming that you can truly finish the whole lot of broth. They have quiet a selection on meat, seafood and vegetable and all always come to our table fresh. Their watermelon juice is also worth the try. We will keep coming back here.
