6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag I called in an order of beef noodles with wide noodles and beef rolls. We picked it up about 10 minutes later and it was already done! Prices were a bit on the high side, compared to what I'm used to ... $9.99 per item. The beef rolls were decent, I think the pancake they make to wrap the beef in is a bit too thick and there was a strong hoisin or oyster sauce flavor to the meat. I liked the beef broth but the wide noodles were clumped together so when I got home and tried to eat it, it was like eating a dense ball of noodles. It wasn't pleasant at all. 

The restaurant itself had a lot of seating, and the staff was friendly but next time I'll be dining in instead of ordering take out.
