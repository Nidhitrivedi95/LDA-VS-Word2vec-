2meb5cwKh125tF5IwUiIJA So many yummy things to admire and eat, so little time!  If I had run into this place earlier in my trip, I would have come back every day.

The dough they use for their buns is the most delicious that I've ever had.  And, the black sesame mochi and the green tea sponge cake were delightful.  I also had a honeydew milk bubble tea that was to die for.  

For the things I didn't eat, I wish I could have.  All the cakes, pastries, and buns are so beautifully made that it makes you automatically think, "Eat that".  If they had a cyanide mochi, I would probably try it.

Definitely stop at Harmonie when you are in Montreal.  You will not be sorry!
