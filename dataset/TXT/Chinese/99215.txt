Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Came here for the first time with some friends and was not disappointed! Compared to ones I've tried in Henderson, this place is great in terms of cleanliness, speed, and food. 

The restrooms as well as the dining area is very clean and that's something that I always looks for when entering a place that I know deals with a lot of people...and lots of oil/grease. (It's Dim Sum!) 

Speed: there is a wait, especially when going for lunch like we did, but within 20 min we were seated and the food came right to us. Barely gave us time to order drinks, which was fine because we were starving! There were always carts coming and and out, and although those who pushed the carts were hard to understand or wanted us to hurry, they were efficient and getting around the restaurant. 

Food: love the variety of foods both fried, steamed, etc. Good variety of salty (shumai, dumplings, sticky rice, shrimp balls, etc.) and sweet (sesame red bean balls, custard tarts, etc). Tasty and delicious! 

**Also, if you don't like what's coming around, they have a menu that you can order from!
