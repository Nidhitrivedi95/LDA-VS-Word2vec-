-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ The place was a little small all the decor was very Asian themed. Most of the dishes were all different types they had Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese. I went with my family after the movies. We ordered 1 noodle soup, pad thai, and pork fried rice.

The wonton soup didn't come with noodles so we had to add noodles. They tasted like the Ramen noodles. Even though there was a difference in noodle texture the soup was really good. The pork fried rice was much better, the pork meat was so soft and so tasty. That was something I would go back for again. The pad thai was okay I got mine with chicken. A great surprise for me it had tofu in the pad thai. The taste wasn't all there for the pad thai but it was okay for a place that is Asian fusion.

The service was great, the hostess was very friendly we got a table right away. The server Carlos was friendly, he checked on us more than 3 times which makes me happy. 

Next time we go to the movies we shall go back for dinner again
