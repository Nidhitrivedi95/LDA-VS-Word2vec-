1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA The crispy, juicy fried chicken that I ordered was perfection! It took quite a bit of a wait and I was super hungry at the time, but once I got my food I forgot all about the hunger and just dove in. The service was great. I happen to visit on a busy day (even though it was around 2pm) but there was no problem tending to my needs. I also ordered their chicken wings to go. Their almond pudding with lychee was a refreshing break from the oily food I just consumed. 

I don't know if they changed the minimum amount of $10 for those paying with a card, but I honestly find it inconvenient for me since I never carry cash and use my debit to pay for everything. So I was somewhat "forced" to order more that I wanted. *shrugs* I guess I shouldn't be surprised since most places have that $10 minimum =/

Other than that, this place is great. Everything was affordable, which is a good thing for a college student like myself.
