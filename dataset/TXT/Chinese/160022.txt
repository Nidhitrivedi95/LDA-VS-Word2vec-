Despite the slightly creepy fish tanks lining the entry to the restaurant, my partner and I decided to try out Beijing Noodle No. 9 if for no other reason that we didn't have to wait for a table.

We started off with the scallion pancake, which was very good but definitely not worth $9.  Next, we ate the hand pulled noodles with tomato and egg, and the sizzling tofu with black bean sauce.  My partner just returned from Beijing a week earlier, and I almost fell out of my chair when he said he ate the same tomato, egg, and noodle dish every week for only $1.  At Beijing Noodle No. 9, it was $12.  The sizzling tofu was wonderful, and the sauce was so good, I ate it up with a spoon.  Yeah, I'm not ashamed to admit that.  You'd do it too if cost you $18.     

All in all, the food was pretty good, but like anything in Vegas, it was overpriced.
