dCX6CvWGn8oiPSD_yxrm0Q So I waited an hour and a half for my delivery. Even though I live 10 minutes away!! The chicken in the chicken lo mein tasted like it came from a dollar store frozen dinner. Of course everything was cold and to cap it all off the delivery guy spent 5 minutes trying to give me a menu for another unrelated store he delivered for!?
