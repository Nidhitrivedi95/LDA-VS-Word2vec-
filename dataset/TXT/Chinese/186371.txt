yAkaDc6MWX3dy8bnEcCrRQ We go here with friends who have been eating here for over 18 years.  We have probably been eating here for at least 10.  The food is good, fresh and hot.  Most of the time the service is reasonable but it all depends on how busy they may get.  There was one time that it took almost an hour and when our party of six finally got served, one of the six had to wait about another 20 minutes for their food.  Everyone else was almost done eating.  The waitress kept apologizing but I don't know what the problem was but it was apparent it was in the kitchen.  We have had take out from here also.  Be sure to call ahead.  I like spicy food so ask for extra hot sauce as most of the food can be mild.  One time our party tried desserts of mango, green tea and another flavor ice cream which was a treat.
