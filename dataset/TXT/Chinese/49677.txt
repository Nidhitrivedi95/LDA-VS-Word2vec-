CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Some general tips before coming here to increase your chances of a good dining experience.

Tip#1 - do stick with their Chinese dishes, ordering the pad thai or pho is a bad idea.  Unless you are adventurous and curious on how pad thai would taste like if a Chinese person made it.  You get the idea.

Tip#2 - do use your comps here, it's a good way to get a decent meal after a long day to the poker tables.  If you pay out of pocket, expect about $5 to $10 per menu item more than what you would pay in Chinatown (go to Spring Mountain Road).

Tip#3 - don't worry about not speaking Cantonese or Mandarin when coming here, their customer service is efficient and helpful (but not friendly, remember this is a Chinese restaurant).

Tip#4 - do order their crab meat vermicelli with xo sauce ($24), it has tons of real crab meat.  Our waiter Gary from San Francisco (who by the way gave us excellent service) did tell us it's crab meat extracted from the buffet and after tasting a few bites, we confirm it!
