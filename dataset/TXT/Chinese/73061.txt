FiEcKfGo-rbYyhoKHw_0MA This place is great.  If you're starving and in the mood for quick food...it's not your place; but otherwise a great idea...especially for a date night or celebration. 
We got the yin-yang pot (the spicy side is VERY spicy), beef, shrimp, several vegetables and clear noodles.  Played it safe this time but will be more adventurous next time.  The waitstaff is really invested in making sure you have a good time and assuring you that there is no "right" way to do it.  

The produce is incredibly fresh. 

LOTS of food for about $40.
