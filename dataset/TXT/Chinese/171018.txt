Fried rice with beef, tomatoes, bean sprouts and Thai chilies. It's been in some of the Vegas weekly magazines as some of the best fried rice in Vegas and well I haven't tried all of them but it's is pretty damn good. I also love their Moo Sho Chicken. I didn't even want to share. The walnut prawns are pretty good too. If you're noise sensitive you definitely don't want to come the noise level I pretty intense. I will have to come back and try the dim sum and see what it's all about.
