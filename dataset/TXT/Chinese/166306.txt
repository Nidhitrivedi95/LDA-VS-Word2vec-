vbVJzKDhHlhMnKRpES5QzQ Wow what can I say? If you like SPICY food and Chinese food than this is your gastronomic destination! Fantastic: crazy spicy, as in my mouth was tingling numb but ALL the flavors are so delicious, clear and evident, so it's not like it burns your mouth and you can't taste anything. The service is typical Asian though which means responsive but not attentive: but was nevertheless friendly and prompt. Highly recommended: mostly Chinese clientele but the staff was completely fluent in English (I don't speak Chinese but my date is fluent) as they answer all the questions I had fluently and friendly. Get extra napkins and let the sweating begin! We had: toothpick lamb with cumin(awesome), fried pig intestine(awesome but if you don't like gamey flavors like goat etc, this may be tough for you) garlic vegetables (awesome flavor not spicy) and finally the Pièce de résistance: mung bean noodles with chili sauce!
