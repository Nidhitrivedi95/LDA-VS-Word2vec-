hPTx2Y5e4Czbr21XcbDN8g Mei Nung is still #1 in my books for TW-style Beef Noodle.  Many Many Many... A long time ago when this place opened, I was so EXCITED and at that time it did not disappoint as there are really limited restaurants that offer TW Beef Noodle so a resto focused on TW Beef Noodle was like I've gone to heaven.

What made me even more excited was that they did HAND-MADE noodles and it is part of their BUSINESS NAME(Chinese) and it tasted GREAT.  

Reminded me of my trip to Taiwan even though at that time I didn't have Beef Noodle in Taiwan yet, but they do close 1 day on a weekday just like Taiwan shops and restaurants.

The soup broth was GOOD too, but maybe I have higher expectations since I've made my own Beef Noodle awhile back.  The Beef could be better, and I have had better beef elsewhere but the Hand-Made Noodles rocked my world.

Even though I enjoyed the Noodles, the few times I've been there it really depends on the day as it can be inconsistent from one day to another which is why the FIRST time was most memorable for me.

They also have STINKY TOFU served with Pickled Cabbage(Kimchi).  Seriously I don't even smell the stink anymore, even from the ones in Taiwan but the Tofu here should be considered as it is Crispy outside and Moist inside.
