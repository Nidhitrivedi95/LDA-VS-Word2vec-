AgumeejSSVoJ0Bdr5Iguww Wow, the noodles are good! (and the portions are huge!)

I got the braised beef brisket with thick-cut noodles, and it was really, really good. The beef is fall-apart tender and both juicy and flavourful the entire way through, and the broth, while a bit salty IMO, was very savoury. The noodles were fresh and chewy just as they should be, and happily never-ending. Seriously, I was still on the noodles 15 minutes in.

I also got the lamb skewers, which I hated because they were crusted with cumin (ugh) and quite fatty. The dried tofu in hot and sour sauce was a bit too oily for my taste, but still good and very well portioned for 2.99.

Definitely worth more visits!
