The quality of the food is really quite high, and everything we ordered was very good.  I find it comparable to some of Boston Chinatown's best (having spent lots of time there, that's my benchmark).  Their black jasmine tea is that excellent classic tea that can only be found at good Chinese restaurants, and when I asked, they were happy to sell me a pint of tea leaves.  They do a dim sum daily from 11-4 pm, which we did, along with a few other dishes.  The dandan noodles were some of the best we've had--spicy but not too spicy and a bit sweet, and the texture of the noodles were perfect.  The wonton soup broth had clearly been made from scratch and the wontons were delicious, as were the shumai and shrimp dumplings.  Edamame was perfectly cooked and not over-salted. The only dish we didn't love was the pork bun.  It was tasty and well-made, but the pork inside was not the char siu (barbeque) that we expected (or wanted!).  I'm happy this place opened--despite looking on the outside like standard American Chinese fare, it really isn't.  It's some of the best Chinese food in the Chambana area.
