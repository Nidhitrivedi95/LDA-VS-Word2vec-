BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ Went to Plum for happy hour on a Friday with two friends. Very good service. Our server was very accommodating (we ended up asking him to bring us all of their menus) and one of the sushi chefs kindly gave us a complimentary crab salad. What a sweet gesture! (It's normally $9.) It was fresh and delicious. We also got the roti canai (one of the better roti canais I've had!), salmon and avocado roll (pretty standard/good), and the spicy tuna roll (good and well-presented on the plate). I originally got the ginger cosmo but traded with my friend who got the Thai basil sake mojito because we both liked the other person's drink better. The mojito was sweet but also refreshing. Not bad for happy hour!
