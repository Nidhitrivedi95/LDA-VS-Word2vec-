1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Came here for the buy one beef ramen, get the second free special with my boyfriend. We both got the beef ramen (of course) and an order of the fried shrimp wanton things. 
The beef was really tender and juicy, the noodles perfect. The broth wasn't really strong enough for me, but good. I would have liked more condiments to add to it, instead of just onions and chilli sauce.The fried shrimp wantons were DIVINE, though. Absolute love at first bite! 
The waitress was super sweet, taking her time to explain the menu to us, and always appearing whenever we needed something. The food was really inexpensive as well,  which I love.. Since I'm cheap.
