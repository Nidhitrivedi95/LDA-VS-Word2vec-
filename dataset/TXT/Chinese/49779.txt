CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Review # 25/100 Yelp 100 challenge


rice: noodles $18, appetizers $9-15, whole fish $30 plus... You get the idea... Not cheap but not over the too. 4 star.
* Ambiance: casual, no dress code. Very clean and minmalist decor. 4 star.
* Location: by the botanical garden and outer edge of the casino. 4 star.
* Meals: food coming out very fast. Noodles are tasty and authentic. Desert options are pretty good. 4 star.
* Service: friendly but not exception. 4 star.

Averaged to a solid 4 star.

We were hesitated at first after reading some reviews on yelp but one of Taiwanese friend recoomended this place... Also we were looking for some low key and casual place to grab a dinner. It is actually not bad!

There was no wait. The service is OK. The food comes out is super fast. My friend went to bathroom to wash hand before dinner and his food got to the table before he came back!
We had sweet and spicy cucumbers, seafood udon, thai seafood noodles, chilled coconut and mango pudding for desert, and thai ice tea. The meal cost about $85 minus tip! It is not bad for the location!

- Sweet and spicy cucumber $7: not pretty to the eyes but really tasty and fresh.
- seafood udon $18: good portion, very light broth with plenty and quality sea food.
- Thai seafood noodle $18: spicy and tasty tom yum broth, perfectly cooked vermicelli, shitake mushrooms and half a dozen large prawns! Very yummy!
- chilled coconut $10: very fresh young coconut with shred jelly. It was very fun idea and light desert without worry about calories.
- mango pudding $10: served with fresh milk, very creamy, light but strong mango taste. 

Overall, we were stuff and happy! They also open until 2 pm. Definitely, come back!
