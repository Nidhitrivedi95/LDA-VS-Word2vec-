Growing up eating at Chinese restaurants, I really do expect to be treated badly - Cups not being refilled, no one to come check on you, 50 Chinese workers and all of them ignoring you when you need something, etc.  

We came here for dim sum on a Saturday afternoon and I think the food was good, but it doesn't taste any different than the other Chinese restaurants around the valley.  Workers strolling around with their carts, they show you the goods, yell out the name of the food, but you have no idea what they are saying, you point, they put it on your table, and they take your ticket and stamp it.  When you are done fast food eating style, you take your check, tally up the stamps and give you some dollar amount to pay.  I never check the amounts because I don't even know how much is each food item.  They do charge an  18% tip for parties of 6 or more which frankly is BS because they don't give you even a 5% tip worth of service.
