gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw We visited Iron Chef on a friend's recommendation. Once there, we looked up the reviews on Yelp, and I became concerned. However, I was happily relieved when our food was presented. My daughter and I ordered Sushi on happy hour. It was delicious and fresh and nicely priced. My husband ordered chicken and broccoli, with a custom spiced-up szechuan sauce that was fabulous. We also split spring rolls and tempura - also quite good. We will gladly come back to visit. :-)
