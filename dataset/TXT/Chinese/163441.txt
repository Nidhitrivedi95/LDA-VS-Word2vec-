URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg Always excellent. I reserve 5 stars for anything that wows me. I should give China Chili 5 stars because they're always reliable. It's a good good spot for transplanted East Coasters like me who like Chinese comfort food without an overgrease laden spoon. Love that they know how to pack mushu to go, no added instructions or confusion. Meat & seafood are always fresh, well cooked. Vegan dishes are just that, vegan. No muss, no fuss. The chef can make a dish to order if it's not available on the menu!!! We keep going back for: hot & sour, YuShang, Salt & Pepper, old standards. Their specials are great.  We always try a dash of anything different than what you can't get anywhere else and have not been disappointed yet. Overall very happy we found this gem in the desert!
