Every so often I get a craving for stinky tofu and this is the place I go to get it! No one goes here for the ambience, but you know from the smell that hits you as soon as you walk in, that this stinky tofu is authentic! The noodles are also amazing - chewy noodles in rich broth, with a healthy serving of brisket and tendon. I am definitely a repeat customer! It also helps that the middle aged lady (owner?) who is always there is super friendly.

PS. I would definitely give 5 stars if the prices were a little lower.. Kind of high seeing as the rest of Markham charges a little less.
