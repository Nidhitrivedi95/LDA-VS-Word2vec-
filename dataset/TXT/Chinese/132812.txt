prHnRsgY-PuM7vxe8-RwEA Disgusting is an under statement!! Doesn't even deserve a star. What a waste of money.  Be warned the food is nasty, we ordered general tso's and sesame chicken... neither were even close to what they should taste like.. the food was burnt and chewy. The lo mein is awful. Nothing good to say about the incompetent dtaff who told me twice that the forks and soy sauce was in the bag I checked and it wasn't.  I want my $30 back!!
