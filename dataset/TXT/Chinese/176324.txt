WnPMdsIcW9oxyXnMNZB5hQ I've had the kung pao chicken, beef with black bean sauce, several dumpling types, hot and sour soup, curry noodles, and singapore noodles. The kung pao chicken was ok. I wouldn't get the beef with black bean sauce again. I felt it was pretty much all rice. I also don't like their dumplings very much. The filling doesn't have a very good flavor. The hot and sour soup was very, very vinegary. The curry noodles were ok. I think they could have been cooked longer. Everyone liked the singapore noodles They were probably the best. Followed by the kung pao chicken. The employees are nice and the food is cooked quickly
