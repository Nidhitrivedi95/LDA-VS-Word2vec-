uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw I came here twice - once for lunch and once for dinner - and I had to line up for both times even though it wasn't during peak lunch (1:30 pm)/dinner (6:30 pm) time.

The first time I came here was for dinner and I ordered hand pulled noodle with beef offal ($7.99), sizzling tofu skewer ($1.50) and sizzling fresh squid tentacles ($1.99). I thought that the prices were fairly marked. The small bowl of hand pulled noodle was very filling - I could barely finish it. The offal were very tender and the noodle was a good chewy consistency. The tofu was on the spicy side but flavourful. The squid tentacle was mediocre. The sauce that it came with was like hoisin sauce but tastewise, it wasn't anything special.

The second time I visited this restaurant, I ordered more snacks and shared a small bowl of noodle with my mom. We got the beef wrap ($5.99) which my mom loved since there was no onion in it. I thought that it tasted great too (although I wish that onion was included). We got a chive pancake ($2.99) which was quite tasty. However, price wise, it's more expensive than my usual new Northern Dumplings restaurant. Taste wise, they're completely different but one isn't better than the other. I got a lamb skewer ($1.99) and it's the best lamb skewer I've ever had. It was tender, juicy, not too salty and not spicy at all. It was perfect. The last snack we got was sweet potato patty ($0.80) and I didn't like it at all because it wasn't sweet (it wasn't supposed to be sweet but I didn't know that).

I'm glad this restaurant is near my area because I quite enjoyed the food here and I'll be coming back for more!
