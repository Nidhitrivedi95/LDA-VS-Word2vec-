Well you only eat sushi when it's freshly roll
Only miss the spice when you start the sauce
Only know you love it when you let it go

Only know you've been hungry when you're feeling low
Only hit the sake when you're missing home
Only know you love it when you let it go

At the Orient


Honestly, my first thought of this place was okay when I first walked in.  The place is a fusion of all the major Asian cuisines; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai.  All you can eat sushi for $25 and Sashimi for $30.  

The place itself is a mom & pop owned place with pretty good service I thought!  

I ordered the Regular Sushi entree, while my family ordered the Pad Thai, Bonzai Noodles with Udon noodles, and some of us got the full on buffet.  Overall, my sushi came with 2 Tuna, 2 Salmon, 1 Yellow Tail, 1 Shrimp, 1 Eel, and set of California Rolls.  I'm not a sushi snob, but overall I found it fairly fresh to the bite and perfectly plated.  I also ordered a side of Tempura Vegetables, which I thought was a lot, but boy did I scarf it down; love the crunch of tempura!  I think my favorite taste of the table had to be my sisters Bonzai Noodles.  Strong spicy broth that I thought would have been great if she ordered Ramen Noodles with it.  

In the end, all you can eat sushi and sashimi is definitely a big draw for this place, but the food is surprisingly good for what I would consider an Asian fast food diner! - Enjoy!
