GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog We ate here for lunch. I got a lobster taco with grapefruit and avocado which was quite good. My husband got the pescado taco, which he said was good but a little boring. We shared the bay scallop ceviche, which was ok but slightly too acidic and missing something. We also shared the mojo shrimp, which was amazingly flavorful. This was both of our favorite dishes. We had the Lucky 6 siu mai, which we both thought was very flavorful. Overall it was a creative menu and we would be happy to dine at China Poblano again.
