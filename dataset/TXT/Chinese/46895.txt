bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Flavor. Lots of flavor in the calamari, Mongolian beef, and green curry chicken. Not the same-old Chinese flavors. Distinctive. Bold. Delicious. Need to add a comment about the live music on Friday. You need to listen to appreciate it. Not the usual blaring music that prevents you from having a conversation. I encourage you to try Singing Pandas at least once.
