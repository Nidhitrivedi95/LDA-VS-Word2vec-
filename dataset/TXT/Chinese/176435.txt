WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg Our family friend recommended eating the oxtail soup here. They claimed it was just as good as the California's Market Street Cafe. Me, being very defensive about my oxtail soup from the California as the best I've ate, was taken for lunch by my grama and uncle.

Anything free tastes great in my book! So, when my bowl of oxtail soup came I was excited. The first thing i noticed when I opened my bowl (it came in a container), was that there was a lot of shiitake mushrooms and a good amount of fresh cilantro. It smelt amazing too! Ok, at this point I was pretty impressed. I open my chopsticks and now I'm ready to dig in.....well, this is where my "in awe" kinds of stops. Now, I've already waited at a table for about 15 minutes for a line of about 7 people and I waited even longer for the food to reach my mouth! The oxtail was a bit hard to get off the bone (sad face). So I did as my uncle did, grabbed it by the tail, and man handled the meat off with my lipstick smeared mouth. It came off surprisingly easy which just made me mad that maybe the restaurant gods didn't want me to eat it. Oh well~ Now before I forget the soup was good, but if I had to nitpick  (which, yes I do) it tasted too much like shiitake mushroom water mixed with shoyu. It sorta tasted like salty mushroom water, but I still downed half my bowl. Like I said, free tastes good.

The only reason I am giving 3 is because of:
1) The wait. It seemed like the cashier (although she was great, patient, friendly, and kind) didn't really know what she was doing. Maybe she was new? 

2) Salty soup. Nuff said.

3) Seating. Not good for groups of 4 or more. Luckily, we only had 3 which was still a little hard to find seats as it is. It's like cafeteria style seating. 

*just as a side note, my California oxtail soup wins*
