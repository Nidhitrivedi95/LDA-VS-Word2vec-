fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ I visited Wing Lei on Super Bowl Sunday quite frankly because of the the Michelin Star that it received in 2009. I called in the night before to make a reservation and the hostess at Wing Lei was sure to let me know how fantastic the restaurant was by naming all of the restaurants accolades. Needless to say, my expectations were sky high.

Before I get into the meat of the review, I think it is important to explain why I only gave this restaurant 3 stars. Given all of this restaurant's high level of achievement, I rated this restaurant against the very best restaurants that I have been to. It is quite obvious to me that if I were to rate and star Wing Lei against every other Chinese Restaurant in the United States, I would give it 4 or 5 stars without hesitation. 

However, with that said, here is why I was not so impressed with Wing Lei. Given the prestige of the restaurant, I found it appropriate to order the tasting menu offered by Chef Ming Yu. In true Michelin taste, there was a distinctly French flair to the menu that left the cuisine's Chinese authenticity in question. For instance, the first course of cold sea food was a prawn salad served with caviar, the soup dish was a truffle stuffed wonton soup, and subsequent dishes included duck, wagyu beef short ribs, and sea bass which were all plated and presented in a distinctly Western style. Although the tasting menu was for two people, none of the dishes were family style in the traditional Chinese sense, and there was a different glass of wine served for each course. It's not that Wing Lei takes a hit for having a French oriented tasting menu. The food was quite good and the sea bass was especially cooked to perfection. However, by serving a French style meal, the restaurant clearly opened itself up to a different standard of service that unfortunately falls short in my book. 

First and foremost, I was taken back the Maitre d's lack of knowledge, and even unwillingness to explain what was being served. For instance, the wagyu beef dish, was served without any explanation. It was not until I inquired about the dish, when a waiter explained that what I was eating was beef with vegetables. Likewise, each wine was served with very little explanation. A typical explanation was literally "here is a red wine from France, 1999" or "here is a desert wine from Hungary". Given that this menu featured a dessert white wine from Hungary, it seems clear to me that Chef Min Yu or his sommolier meticulously chose specific wines to accompany his dishes. The wait staff's lack of knowledge regarding both the food and the wine does not do this food justice especially because the chef takes an audacious and an uncharted approach to serving a French-Chinese fusion cuisine. A restaurant that attempts to serve food of this caliber must guide their customer through the whole culinary experience or else the customer will be left with a confused palate and more questions rather than pure satisfaction. Ultimately,  this meal left me wishing that I had just opted to go the traditional Chinese route (which the restaurant serves). 

If you decide to dine at Wing Lei, here are my suggestions:
-Forego the tasting menu and go the traditional route. 

-Looking at other reviews on Yelp, it is clear that you cannot go wrong with Wing Lei's Peking Duck.

-You should not go out of your way to visit this restaurant just because they received a Michelin Star once upon a time. 

After all, I do not suspect that Wing Lei is far superior to other high end Chinese restaurants in town such as Empress Court at Caesars or Pearl at MGM. In any case, a visit to Wing Lei is certainly not a mundane experience. If your primary experience of Chinese food comes from Panda Express, expect to be wowed. If you frequent authentic Chinese restaurants and you forego the tasting menu, I think you will come away understanding that you are paying a generous premium for better quality food for a special occasion. Just don't eat at Wing Lei and expect it to be among the world's best restaurants.
