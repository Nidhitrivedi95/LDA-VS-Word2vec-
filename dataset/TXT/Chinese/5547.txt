0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA The first thing you will notice here is Justina. She is warm, friendly, and, if you show up alone, she will sit at your table and get to know you. I had never had Vietnamese food before, so couldn't tell what to order. Her recommendations were the Vietnamese egg roll, Spring roll, and the Black Pepper Shrimp with garlic toast. The first two were good. Although, my pallet did need to get used to the Spring roll, because I did not expect it to be a cool dish, I thought it was delicious. 
My favorite? The black pepper shrimp. It had the perfect spicing between the garlic on the bread and a little bit of cilantro, I definitely wanted more. 
Highly Recommended!!!
