vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw Most of my visits here have been for lunch.  You need to ask for the lunch menu and it has some great deals.  I always get the lo mein.  The noodles are great and the dish is flavorful.  The fried rice is always good and i'm a sucker for old-school egg rolls.  I have had take out at night that hasn't been very good.
