wC-wLFVCIjXArsrMuUJdYQ THIS PLACE WAS DELICIOUS. I'm here on a business trip for a few weeks and this will be the only place I eat from. I got the chicken and broccoli and my friend got the Hunan chicken and everything was made fast and fresh it was absolutely delicious. Flavorful and a good sized serving I will definitely be coming back. This is the BEST Chinese I've had in a while.
