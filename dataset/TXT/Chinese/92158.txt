iP3E7Nl_cGA3xWCORkoLGw Really impressed, for many reasons. 1. They we're open when a mid Sunday afternoon Chinese food craving hit. 2. They delivered super fast. 3. Guy answering the phone was easy to communicate with and accurately accepted my order. 4.the food is delicious which should be # 5 & 6.. It's my ONLY delivery spot now I will be back.. Best general Tao chicken EVER.
