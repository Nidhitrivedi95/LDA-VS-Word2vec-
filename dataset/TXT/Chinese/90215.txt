I need to go here again, why doesn't my boyfriend like Italian!?! Is it the lack of meat? Por Que!!!??

Anywho-
I love noodles and went here with a friend who had a coupon from one of those giant books. Basically it's set up like a Panera, or American Roadside, you order, sit down with your number, they bring it to you.

They have a good variety including Asian, America, Italian,soups, salads, and a kids menu.

Our Order:

Stuffed Shells
Oven-baked pasta shells overflowing with slightly sweet Ricotta cheese and spinach, smothered in a tomato cream sauce topped with Mozzarella and fresh basil.

Lobster Ravioli
Ravioli stuffed with lobster meat, sweet Ricotta cheese and shallots.  Baked under a slightly sweet and spicy chipotle cream sauce topped with Mozzarella.  Finished with scallions.

I had the Lobster Ravioli, and OMG delicious, move over Olive Garden I'm going cheap tonight! Super delicious, and very filling. The food here is good...I need to go back for a good carb kick. The bread sticks are good too, and you can buy 5 extra or so for $1.00..which I did cause I love bread, and noodles - but do they love me? My butt says probably not. 

Anyway - try it out, see if you like it, try one of the above items both yummy. Then Yelp it out loud!
