j3SHAiF8OIlY3kUPnAAlKw Yum, my mouth waters when I mention House of Leng.  I've been to a variety of Chinese restaurants  and I have to say that this place is by far the best one in Charlotte.  The price is great for the amount and quality of food you get.  Dinner may be a little more expensive but the portion is well worth it.  The food always tastes great and the service is outstanding.  I actually think the host/waiter/bust boy is pretty hot.  As far as take out, I have not had any issues. I live approximately 15 minutes away and by the time I get home, my food has always been hot. My favorite is the Shrimp Lo Mein, it is to die for!!!! YUM!
