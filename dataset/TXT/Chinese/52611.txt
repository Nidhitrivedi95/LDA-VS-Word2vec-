cjKplU8iMakS8Q7ZorzYVA I was looking for some Chinese for lunch and pulled in but when I saw the condition I turned around around but the reviews were great so I pulled back in.

In short, I wasn't impressed.  The place was kind of dirty and dreary and not very appealing.  The general tso's was basically like a hot buffalo wing sauce and just not right at all.

Maybe the other food is better?  Honestly, I'll probably never go back to find out.
