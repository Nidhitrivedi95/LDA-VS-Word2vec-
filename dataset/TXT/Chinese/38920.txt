AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Veggie House is out of this world delicious! The flavor profile is unprecedented for a vegan establishment. The Kung Pow Chicken and Beef are everything you would hope for. It's saucy, it's sweet, it's spicy and it's full flavor. The lunch portion is just enough to keep you satisfied, while leaving your tastebuds yearning for more. The house soup is simple, but refined and the hot tea is traditional and welcoming.
