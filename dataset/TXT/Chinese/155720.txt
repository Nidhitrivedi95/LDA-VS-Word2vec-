Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w Siam Cafe is the most authentic Asian restaurant in the Cleveland area. The food comes out hot and the service is very good. It can get busy on weekends but the wait is worth it (and usually no longer than 20 mins). They have both authentic Asian food or more americanized Asian food. Their dinner for 4, 8, or 12 is very well priced and their portions are large.
