BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ I like Plum but in all fairness I would have to say that my rating would actually be 3.5 stars, and not 4 stars, but because that's not an option and because there is never anything egregious about the food, I'm feeling generous and giving them 4 stars.  The food is good, but not great considering the other Thai food restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, but I've not ever had a bad meal here.  Today a group of us from work ordered takeout for lunch - the food was ready in 15 minutes, which was great and three of us got the pad thai with shrimp and the shrimp egg rolls.  I ordered my pad thai at a level 7 and it was disappointingly bland and actually didn't really even taste like pad thai (and was sans peanuts yet my coworkers has peanuts on theirs)...anyhow, needless to say I was really disappointed because I LOVE pad thai - I could probably eat it 5 days a week or more, but my wallet and my waistline couldn't handle that, so it was a bit disappointing to have pad thai that was just "ok", however the shrimp egg roll was delicious and almost made up for the bland pad thai.  The exterior was light and crispy and was delicious!  I've had better pad thai from Plum in the past, so I'm hoping that this was just an off day for them, however, now, I'm craving GOOD pad thai, so I may cave sometime next week and get take out from Nicky's on the Northside which is always a solid choice.
