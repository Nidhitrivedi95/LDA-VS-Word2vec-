X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Definitely had the worst first experience at Hakkasan. I came with a group of 6 girls and 1 guy to Vegas on Memorial Day weekend. We were able to get on the guestlist to see Tiesto on Saturday night so we were all super excited. Our promoter told us to arrive between 9-9:30 to be guaranteed entry so we arrived at 8:45 just in case. We were the first in line and chilled for over an hour until the doors finally opened to the people on the guestlist. Then everything went downhill from there. First off, I just want to say that I understand that it's the security staff's responsibility to ensure that everyone who gets in has legitimate identification to prevent underaged kids from sneaking in. HOWEVER, it is absolutely ridiculous for you to deny us entry after we have solid proof that we are the person on our IDs. Out of all the clubs I've been to in Vegas and elsewhere had any security person question the legitimacy of my ID. Out of the 7 people in our group, 3 of us were stopped for further examination. One of the girls took her ID picture after a track meet back in high school so she looked a lot darker back then than she looks now so we were not that surprised when she was stopped. But even after she showed them her college ID and her credit card to prove that the person on her driver's license was indeed her, the bouncer claimed that her features were different from her ID and refused to listen to our reasoning. We ended up going to Marquee where we were able to get in immediately. What a terrible experience. -_-
