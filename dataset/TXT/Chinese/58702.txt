DeyZIjeRaVMVm2ae2YUkyg I did not know there was a food court here. Huh. Came after church with friends on Sunday. Had the Chow Kuai Teow (fried curry rice noodles with shrimp, char siu strips, and veggies). Portions are huge. I had about a third of my food? The box was packed full. Tasty, but not completely mixed (I found a few white noodles amidst the sea of yellow ones). Quite spicy. Thankful for my soy milk. I love soy milk. 

There is seating, but supposedly, there's a 20 minute limit. We sat longer than that. No one chased us out. 

I wouldn't say it's my favorite Chinese stir fry place, but it's not bad.

Logos note: fairly fast. No waits for food court seating. Cheap.
