X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Total let down. Anticipated this club for over a year and just another over-hyped waste of time and money. Decor sucks, design sucks, service is terrible.  You're better off sitting at the bar 10 feet away from the poorly designed entrance and buying a table there.  The club is located in the furthest possible spot from the valet and parking garage. It takes 5 minutes to walk to the club after the valet makes you give them $40 to park your and they tell you it's hotel guests only even though its empty. Too many great clubs in this city to settle for this mediocre flop.
