1czIVv2iyOHc3WMgtUWXCQ I may have found my go-to Asian restaurant. I sat at the bar, ordered a glass of wine and a take out order. I like that the house wines are good and every one is priced the same - makes it easy. I've been to many Asian restaurants that serve really bad wine. I felt very welcome by the staff.
My to-go order was Sa Cha Chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The Sa Cha Chicken had lots of vegetables, peanuts and was lightly sauced - very flavorful.
I will certainly go back.
