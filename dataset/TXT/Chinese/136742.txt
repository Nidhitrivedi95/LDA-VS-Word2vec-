QI0PGXbGkIdInOOBeq6ieQ I hate giving bad reviews but I drove from sewickley to this TJs. I was REALLY excited and super craving some delicious Chinese buffet. My absolute favorite place to eat is the TJs at the mills so I was eager to try this one out. 
     Awful. I sat there regretting every mile I drove to get there. It has NO qualities of the TJs at the mills. Even the rice sucked. How do you screw up rice?? It was just overall bad and I can't say I enjoyed a single bite.
