Being half chinese, I LOVE noodles... but I am also picky with my noodles!

Watching these be made by HAND was the tip of the iceberg before we actually got to try our dishes! 

My favorite is the B3 with beef brisket and wide noodles and bok choi. You can even ask for a side of extra mushrooms and veggies .... the prices are ridiculously reasonable. The bowls range from $8-10 on average, sides from $3-5, and dumplings around $5 ... you can't beat that!

Try the lychee green tea without any boba and light ice - it's quite the treat! 

The owners are super friendly and remember us even from us only coming a couple of times -- the service, food, and adorable atmosphere make this a little treasure right in our backyard of Vegas!
