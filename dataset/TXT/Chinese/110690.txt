lwxu6HwzEAhben5oVTw-8g One word two syllables: BOBA. Best places for boba in the east valley. I'd come here less often if the west valley location was still open. :( Great boba as you'd expect it to be. They only take cash. Haven't tried to food as we always eat at a nearby restaurant and head over here after for desert.

Customer services is pretty lackluster. You never get the same service. It gets a lil' annoying. That awkward moment when you don't want the person making your food to be in a pissy mood so you smile and make small talk. -___-
