zPcF4fI18gSp42G17oHmmg Horrible restaurant. All of the food was cold/old. We told the staff and they told me the food was only 4 hours old and we wouldn't get sick. I tried refusing to pay but the wouldn't let us leave. Saying we had to pay because we put it on our plates. Had to report them to the BBB and health department.
