qO6CWdRFfbOqDJ2UOulpaA Love this place been fan since I lived in Peoria where they first started. I love the shrimp and beef with chicken, perfect for high protein diets just add veggies vs. Rice. The tofu is good too. We always get the steam veggies vs rice. My kids love the Orange chicken with low main. The delivery drivers are kind and always play with my kids too.
