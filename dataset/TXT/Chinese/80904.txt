gvur69cXFtawJnJbNzFuZQ We enjoyed a sold dinner here this week. Tried some sushi and a chicken dinner. Enjoyed wonton soup and split a non- noteworthy egg roll. 
Spicy tuna roll was delicious- lots of tuna and not overly mixed with spicy mayo or over-rocked. Will definitely go back for it since there is NO sushi in this area unless you count Heinens!!! 
The eel and cucumber was also delish. My hubs loves eel and he totally enjoyed this one. 
We split the bourbon chicken- it was nice but not really something notable. 
Overall I think this is a solid spot for sushi and I would give it another spin for sure. Service was great and the place was pretty busy on a weeknight. 
I also took into account the fact that they do specials! Love that and makes it a nice option for a weeknight dinner.
