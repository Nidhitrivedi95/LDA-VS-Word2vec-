O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw I've going to Rolsan on Spadina since forever.  Food is great but got pricey like everything else.  No problem.  When we got the bill it was $9.00 extra.  Must have been an honest mistake.  He apologized and issue solved.  We went back the 2nd, 3rd, 4th time and the same thing happened.  What the heck was happening here?  We looked around and realized that they are taking advantage of intoxicated party goers especially in large groups and charging them extra.  They write your order in Chinese with no price, just the final total.  NOTE TO ROLSAN:  We weren't drunk/high on anything.  You should have had better judgement since you're ripping people off every day.  Weekends specially.  Watch your bill everyone.
