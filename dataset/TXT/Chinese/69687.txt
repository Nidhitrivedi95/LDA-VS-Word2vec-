f-ookZOX4pBNldaOHMkJ4A I happened to walk by here late one night, on the way home, and decided to try some pick up.  Important to note: Chinese food (the fast-food, greasy kind, that is) gives me nightmares.  As in, literally I have bad dreams after eating Chinese food.  I had experienced this with just a mild sampling of Swatow, so even well-received bad-Chinese food does it to me.

I had an egg roll, Shanghai noodle, wonton soup and sweet and sour chicken.  The order was fast, ready in about 10 minutes.  Everyone else in the place at that time looked like a gang member and I felt like 10 minutes was long.

Everything was below standard and I wouldn't get again, except the Shanghai noodles, which I really really liked.  So why 3 stars if I'd only get 1/4 dishes again?  Open super late, and - drumroll - no nightmares!!  So I'd definitely be back to try other dishes.
