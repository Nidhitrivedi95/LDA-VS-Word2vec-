Fhjzzo7ranqqgEdbiPD50Q The first time I went here I would have given this place 4 stars. It was really good.  I was getting my tires rotated at Discount Tire up the block and tracked this place down on yelp and with the good reviews I was down for a nice lunch.  The meal was delicious and less than $5.  Fast forward to today.  I went in and the guy taking my order said that if I wanted to substitute hot and sour soup for egg drop, I would just have to pay full price.  In that case bring out the free soup which will just sit there.  For a friend, I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and asked if noodles could be substituted for rice.  He told me that wasn't possible even if I paid an upcharge?!!?  Come on buddy, you own the place, go back there and cook some noodles instead of rice and trying making a customer happy.  Anyway, after all of that, the food wasn't nearly as good this time as it was last time.  Last time the Mongolian Beef was crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.  This time it seemed pretty bland.  I will give this place another chance, but I won't crave this place as much as since the first time.
