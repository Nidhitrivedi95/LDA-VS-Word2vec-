ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg Very pricey but ordinary Chinese food.

Sweet and Sour Soup tasted as if it had come from a corner takeout but cost three times as much.  The same with other dishes we had like the spicey chicken, scallops, and beef with asparagus.  The only dish that stood out was clams.  That tasted great.  And the service was terrific, with the waiters hovering nearby and refilling glasses quickly.

Maybe this restaurant needed to dumb down the food to accommodate the wide variety of guests in Las Vegas.    Maybe we just ordered dishes that were too simple (other reviewers seemed to like the Peking Duck but we didn't order it).

Overall, Jasmine felt uneven:  the decor and service were top quality and white cloth, but the food was kind of like a neighborhood Chinese takeout.
