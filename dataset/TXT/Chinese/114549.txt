mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w First time here n Never been here!! Would never come again! I usually go to china town for dim sum, but didn't want to drive all that way since I live in the Henderson area n jst Wanted some dim sum to go!! And couldn't get any! The lady brought out a tray with a few dishes that was NOT appealing! Looked old. And I asked if I could see other dishes, she tells me there isn't any but I can special order it! I than asked her if I was to sit and eat in the restaurant! That is the only tray of food they have and she said yes, but I can special order it!! I've never been to a dim sum place that they only have 1 tray of food!! And they got the best of Las Vegas 2013!!?? I'm confuse how they even got that!! Horrible!! Horrrrrrrible service!! And they only have one tray of food to pass around!!! Still so confuse!!!
