qgEKyJfuL5LBA6D3V9nR9g So far the best Shanghai restaurant in GTA in comparison to the bigger brand names or well known Shanghainese restaurants around the area/ Markham. 

Their food is great, servers are attentive, prices are reasonable, spacious and clean.

Xiao Long Bao was tasty, skin was thin, juicy pork and lots of soup inside the bun that's not fatty or greasy. 

The fatty pork rice with preserved vegetables was amazing! I had it with vegetable rice. Sauce was just right in flavor, not salty. The pork was tender, fatty (you can cut those part out) but that fat is what brings out the flavor of the dish. Over all I will reorder this for sure!
