Fyuotg1ShiQZLtV5Dmjakg We called in for delivery. When the lady answered she just said "hello!" So at first we thought that we had called a residence. So we placed our order and before we could confirm the price or the estimated time of arrival, she said "ok they'll be there soon bye!" And hung up. An hour later our food arrived (we live 2 minutes away,ordering on a Thursday  ). Instantly once we opened our door the stinch of the food overwhelmed us. The orange chicken had juice dripping from the bag so I had to be careful to not get it on the carpet. The shrimp fried rice was the smell. Very fishy and rotten smell. So we tasted it, just to make sure that we weren't mistaking smell for something else...but nope. The nastiest thing I've ever tasted. Tasted like it had sat in the garbage for a day. My son was holding his nose through the house. We would have drove to our normal Chinese spot but I injured my leg and they don't deliver.I don't know if we just ate their on a bad day or trash day..$36 down the drain...we ended up eating cearal tonight.
