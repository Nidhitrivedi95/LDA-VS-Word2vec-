Ksz-HV_hafeeEQe9Zaos_Q World noodle is ok. Food has a lot if flavors in it. But it's mostly thai food.  They do have vietnamese food and Japanese mixed in, but mostly thai. Not a bad place, just mediocre. But in my opinion, if you want thai, vietnamese, or japanese food, just go to a restaurant that specializes in that kind of food. Oh, thai tea is good, though they serve it in tiny glass and no refill (of course). I don't mind no refill, just not in a tiny glass where I am forced to ask for another glass.
