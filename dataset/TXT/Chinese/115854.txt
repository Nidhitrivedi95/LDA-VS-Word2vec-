N2M0WyGCyTV5jMOYPH7odA Absolutely amazing.  I had the Dragon, spider and tarantula rolls.  They were amazing.  Absolutely amazing, that's all i can say.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely polite.  I wish I were starting in Charlotte longer, just to be able to go tob this restaurant again.
