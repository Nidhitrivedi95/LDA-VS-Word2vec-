UcIrRf2mWgqqlg-HNoDl0A Ordered delivery last night, which arrived quickly and thus the one star. The food was gross and greasy. The meat did not look good at all. We had the sweet and sour pork with white rice, beef and broccoli, house stir fried rice, and egg rolls. Not a fan of any of it. Wasted $40.
