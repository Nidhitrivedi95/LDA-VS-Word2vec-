7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew Very unimpressed for dim sum on a Tuesday.  Not very many carts with food. Someone was carrying food but bypassed our table and went to other tables.  We had to call them to our table.  By the time the person came to our table there wasn't much selection.  Service here is indifferent and lackluster.  Many tables are just waiting for any carts.  Definitely not worth coming her for dim sum, especially on a Tuesday.  This is the worst dim sum experience I've ever had anywhere.  Was here before for dinner and it was uneventful.
