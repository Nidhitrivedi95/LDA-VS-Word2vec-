O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw This was fun! My boyfriend took me here after he had gone for lunch with a colleague a couple days before. I was skeptical as I would much prefer Vietnamese food over Chinese. I'm usually not into gluey.. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised. When we walked inside the place was huge! There's a front dining room, a middle dining room, and a large back dining room.  Each table had a stack of white plastic sheets on it. When people were done eating the waiters would come around and just take the 4 corner from the sheet and remove all the plates everything at once! Quick turnover. Never saw that before.

At the table there's a sheet of paper where you make your selection of how many of each thing you'd like. They start you with tea for $0.60 per person if you wish - it was delicious. We ordered 5 or 6 things. I remember the pork buns - yum! Also the pork dumplings were very good. I didn't like the short ribs - those were a little gluey, but had a good flavor. We got these rice ball things covered in seeds for desert - those were filled with black bean, absolutely delicious! Fun atmosphere, everyone is eating and having a great time. Check it out. My first "All Day Dim Sum" experience.
