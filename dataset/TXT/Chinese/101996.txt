keQlXWfz2K7GukqaReVyow So I came to Madison hoping against hope that there would be a Chinese restaurant I could at least stomach. (Coming from a Chinese family, after living in California and visiting Taiwan every year... you get the picture.)
 
Imagine my surprise when the first Chinese place I go to is GREAT! My mom and I were both impressed. We had a great time talking to the two male waiters, who are both from the same hometown in China as my mom. Be prepared for the food to be spicy, but if you like that- this is the place for you.

Here's what I have tried so far, and every single one I fully endorse:
-Sichuan Style Cucumber Appetizer
-Spicy Stir Fried Green Beans
-Twice Cooked Pork with Black Curded Bean and Pepper
-Chicken with Three Pepper
-Sliced Fish with Salted Mustard Cabbage (it's a soup, don't be surprised, but IT'S SO GOOD. really spicy though.)

But everything is worth a try! Packed on weekend nights (with Chinese!), but the place is big so no worries.
