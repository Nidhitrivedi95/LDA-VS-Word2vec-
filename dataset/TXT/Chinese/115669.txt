N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ The jerk chicken is very good but besides that this place was a real disappointment. Highly overpriced, nothing exciting on the menu, and just another new 'hip' restaurant blasting 90s hip-hop creating an atmosphere more a kin to a club than an eatery. Perhaps the volume is a way to distract the patrons from the product or used to lure the 20-something credit card class in off the Dundas West strip. 

Overall, just more of the same and too pricey for what you actually get. I was very excited to try this place but was very disappointed and will not be returning.
