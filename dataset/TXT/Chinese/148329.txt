sfd19Wo_7g2TwaoJmA9B8A I have been to Hunan Coventry several times. It's one of the nicer Chinese places I've been too in Cleveland. The restaurant atmosphere is casual but classy and there is parking garage across the street. It's Coventry though so you're experience may very. 

I am a fan of the Cashew Chicken. I am not a fan of their Moo goo Gai pan.  I've always found their portions generous and their prices reasonable. 

I will go there there again the next time I come back into town.
