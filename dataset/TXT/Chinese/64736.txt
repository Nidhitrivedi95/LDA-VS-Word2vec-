E9aC5bLfXdQVZ5csvLuLJg Being from Taiwan, and having visited Taiwan last early this year, I was really looking forward to some good Taiwanese food.

Came here to Phoenix on one of my business trip last week.  Ordered the beef noodle soup, and oyster omelet.  Wanted some soup dumplings, but the waitress said it would take awhile....not sure what that meant, so didn't get to try that.

The food came quickly, within 5 min.  The beef noodle soup was OK as the soup was very bland.  You can tell it was not stewed, but simply a basic soup that they may have added some soy sauce to make it brown colored?  Keep in mind that it wasn't bad, but just didn't have any beef flavor that I was expecting.  The noodles, the meat, and bok choy were all OK.  Just didn't have that traditional Taiwanese style that I was expecting.

The oyster omelet was interesting.  The oyster used must be quite small as I barely tasted them.  The sauce was actually OK.  So the real issue here is the vegie used.  Typically, they are lettuce or some light green vegies, but in this case, these vegies are have stalk on them.  I'm not exactly sure what they were, but just didn't taste right.  Then there is the excessive amount of corn starch used.  The edges tasted great, but towards the center, I tasted several raw corn starches, which was not very pleasant.  

Overall, I had high expectation, but was let down with this experience.  I do want to comment that the 2 girls in front were helpful and friendly.  But whoever is back there cooking, perhaps they can do a little better next time.  I will try again on my next trip as I do want to try their soup dumplings.  If so,  I will update the review.
