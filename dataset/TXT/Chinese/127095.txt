PAJlmByrU8zAB3WsXxA30Q After deciding to experience something new ( over game of cheese), i can confirm it was a very unfortunate decision. Not only did my friend and i wait for over 40 minutes for our appetizer, but we did not end up receiving half of our order. The waiter, however, had the audacity to add it on to our bill. To top it off, we were the only two guests in the restaurant who were given plastic utensils and cups because the restaurant "ran out". Needless to say we will be skipping this place next time we visit the plaza.
