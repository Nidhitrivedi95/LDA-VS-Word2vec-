mF2EW3twSrFPmT_RVV1-Qg Came back for an encore on Mother's Day with a party of six.  Same experience, different day!  Pot stickers, egg rolls, Tsing Taos, and wine by the glass to begin.  Had an assortment of main courses to share:  Mongolian Beef, a filet dish, a sauted chicken dish and multiple sushi orders.  We all mixed and matched.  The six of us left happy and contented!  Not a cheap meal, but well worth the cuisine, atmosphere, and service.  Will be back once again...
