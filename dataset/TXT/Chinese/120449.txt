O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw This is one of my favourite places for Dim Sum in regards to the food. The service = not too much. The waiters are not attentive. I came here with my cousins a few days ago and our empty dishes were piling up. Many waiters walked by and yet none of them cleared it for us. The dishes were cleared when our other orders came. 

Every time I come here, it is always packed. The restaurant is separated into two sections. Normally, for those who were going for the All-Day Dim Sum menu are seated in the back section. This room has no windows which seems pretty weird if you ask me. Anyway, those we were ordering Chinese dishes were generally seated in the front section. 

The food will not disappoint you. Everything on the Dim Sum menu is delicious. They do not push carts around. Everything is ordered by penciling in the item and quantity.

Lastly, I only have an issue with their service. One thing that really bugged me was when the waiter came to take the bill away from me. The bill was right in front of me as I was counting cash from my wallet. It was really rude for her to just reach over for the bill.  Normally, waiters are notified by their customers when they are ready to be cashed out/not. That moment right there just restrained me from leaving her much tip.
