hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA Ate at Krazy Buffet since (west side) since it has been opened.  Husband and I eat there at least once a month.  Since it has been opened the place has become VERY rundown, dirty and in need of a good overhaul.  The food is good to very good, but eating in this atmosphere makes it feel just plain nasty.  I have told the manager about our concerns and he seemed surprised.  Until there is a face-lift we won't be back.
