B19KKE75ZxqoR3EDuvA1qw The restaurant looked kind of dirty except the tables...not astetically pleasing...Walls were dirty lighting really funky...Not much variety in foods either....some of it not labled at all. ...Couldn't find the cocktail sause for the fried shrimp. ...

The soft serve ice cream had a nasty taste to it like the machine hasn't been cleaned. Never got refills on drinks...they never asked
