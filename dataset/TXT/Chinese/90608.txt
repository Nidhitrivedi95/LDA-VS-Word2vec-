IHt79wxZHkD7QSzlDRDivw Came here based on the yelp rating and boy did it deliver!

The plaza isn't anything much other than a couple of other BBQ places, a depressing food court and a larger family restaurant but Ho Ho BBQ is worth the trip.

I ordered the BBQ pork and half a roast duck.

I picked it up in the late morning, kept it on my kitchen table during the day as the person who served me advised me not to refrigerate it and it was served at around 6:30. By the time the serving plate made the round and came back to me, most of it was gone. I'm lucky I snuck in a few pieces once I got home. It was from those few pieces I knew that I picked the right place. My only disappointment was not buying enough.
