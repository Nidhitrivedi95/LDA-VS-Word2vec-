BJ9GwNMo8vIgSuKc6B_mOw I'm a frequent diner at the restaurant as the food is really decent, we won't deny that. However, we will NEVER return to the restaurant again under any circumstances based on our experience today.  

We had a party of three around lunch hour and were seated in the end of the restaurant against the wall with the paintings.  A while after we sat down, our friend, who sat facing the wall across from us said there is a COCKROACH on the painting. We turned around and saw a cockroach crawling on the painting above our heads.  We told one of the wait staffs in a black blazer that there is a cockroach on the painting, he looked and said "i'm sorry about that" and walked away.  We honestly thought he was going away to get something to at least take care of it. But no, he came out with tea, sauce for other customers and carried on with his business.  We figured he wasn't going to do anything about it, so we pointed it out to the hostess who just guided some other customers to their seats and she said she'll get the manager, which she did.  The manager, instead of approaching us, grabbed another staff from a distance and told him to take care of it.  This poor staff took a paper napkin and climbed onto the seat next to us and killed the cockroach.. above our heads.  That was the end of the story, not a word from the restaurant as to why there is a cockroach on their wall or a more serious apology, even though we don't really know what to expect when you see a cockroach crawling over your head in a restaurant.  We didn't make a scene for personal reasons but it was disgusting and we will not return again. 

I'm not sure what is more disturbing, the cockroach or how the staff handled the situation.
