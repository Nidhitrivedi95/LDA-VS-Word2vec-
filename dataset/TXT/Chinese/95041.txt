jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg I always make sure to stop by here when in Las Vegas. This is a true authentic chinese restaurant! It will definitely satisfy your chinese food cravings. I always get the peking duck and they carve the whole duck in front you and serve it on shrimp chips. Always call ahead to find out if they have the duck available since they sell out quickly. I was the lucky one today to get the last catch of the day! Lol i meant the duck. The staff are very attentive too and its about 10 mins drive away from the strip. So if your using a cab to get there make sure have the address ready from yelp to let the cab drive know too since they all arent familar with the restaurants off the strip. Its nice to at times get away from the fancy dinners on the strip and try it out.
