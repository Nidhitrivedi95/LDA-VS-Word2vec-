KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ The food is good, but the fat Asian lady that looks like a man, was rude on the phone to take our pick up order.  I didn't think anything of it other than they were probably just busy. When we went to pick our food up, she forgot to put our order in.   She then said it would only take two minutes to cook. Yeah right.  She wanted us to pay right away, I told her that we would pay when our food came. She rudely rolled her eyes, and seven minutes later, no food. Cancelled my order.  China Grill up the road is just as good, if not better and they are much nicer!  My co-workers have spread the word and we now go to China Grill.
