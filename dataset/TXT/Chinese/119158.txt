Ns4tjgLfqR1qawGlNFROBA So I haven't been here in forever and recommended it for our Saturday night family dinner because it was amazing. Unfortunately it was better then than now. We waited an hour from when our whole party arrived to actual food in front of us. And when it did arrive, some dishes were cold (from waiting on the counter while the others were being made) and they weren't as good as I remembered. The Shenzhen chicken was super sweet, the Hong Kong noodles were bland as was the fried rice. The saving grace was the Teppan-Yaki beef. If all the dishes were as flavorful as the beef it would have been excellent. The waitress was sweet when she came around but ultimately drinks were not refilled without asking and I had to ask for chili sauce (to balance the sweetness) from the bar cuz she didn't check back with us. I probably won't be back, but will remember the restaurant as it was, and erase this dinner from my memory!
