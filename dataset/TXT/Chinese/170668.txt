vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA So my friend recommended this place for dim sum and she says it is always packed and the steamed bbq buns are really good. I decided to check it out for myself. Who new there was dim sum in this older hotel in Vegas.  We came here around 12 on Sunday memorial weekend and we waited about 10 minutes before being seated.  There were a lot of chinese patrons eating there so that was a good sign.  

Stick Rice in Louts leaves- It was very good and tasted fresh but it only came one in each steamer so we had to order 3.  
Shrimp dumplings- standard good nothing bad to say.
Rolled noodles with beef- I actually like this a lot despite how light the sauce is compared to other dim sum places.
bbq buns- they are very good and fresh tasting
stuffed eggplant- decent lil dry 

I would go back to this place when I am craving for dim sum and chinese. 

Only three stars cuz it is a drive from the strip and it really smelled like smoke walking thru the casino.
