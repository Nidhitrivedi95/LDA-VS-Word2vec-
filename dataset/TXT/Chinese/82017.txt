H2RgkjPs3W-CxbyygCJJew I had looked up a sushi place on yelp that was close to me, and found Pacific Gardens on top of the list so I gave them a try. I am so very happy I did! Pleasant layout inside, courteous staff. 
Their prices are very reasonable and they don't skimp on portions for anything. If you order the lo mein, be prepared to take leftovers!
The sushi is fresh, and presented simply. Their Caterpillar Roll is excellent. So was the salmon roll. Their sashimi slices are hearty and satisfying. The rice is cooked just right! I've also had their tempura and it was tasty and not over-breaded at all.
I say if you're looking for a nice quiet sushi place that isn't all about the atmosphere, try this one. You won't find thumping music or harried waitstaff here. Just a perfect place to be.
