ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg We went to Jasmine for a special occasion knowing we would spend some money but have a culinary experience well worth the expenditure. At first glance the restaurant is beautiful with an incredible view of the Bellagio Fountains! We were seated at a great table and the service throughout was very pleasant and attentive! We ordered the four-course chef tasting menu which started with an OK, decent lobster salad. This was followed by soup, a beef main course and desert. Unfortunately we were nonplussed. It wasn't great, in fact, just OK and frankly, one could get as good sans the atmosphere, at any decent Chinese Restaurant for far far less! Suggest going for a drink and maybe an appetizer for the ambiance!
