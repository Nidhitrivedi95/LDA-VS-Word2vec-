There was nobody but us and another family in the restaurant and the waitress walked around banging the plates super loud on the rest of the tables - extremely rude- and when she asked us our order she was yelling at us. When she came around with the water and our entrees she smacked it on the table and walked away. Food and portions of the entrees are good, but the rice portion was extremely small. I will never sit and eat here, perhaps will take it to go.
