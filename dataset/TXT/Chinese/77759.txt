Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA Probably one of my favorite new finds in this city.

I was craving noodles one night so I yelped for good noodles in this city for vegetarians. This place popped up. Originally I tried the Chinatown location and loved it so last night I went to this location. It was just as good as the one in Chinatown. I liked the service better at this one.

I ordered the Pad Thai and when she asked what meat I would like I told her I don't eat meat so she asked if I wanted tofu. It was not offered on the menu so I was pleasantly surprised. It's always nice to be offered different options in proteins instead of just settling for no protein at all. 

My boyfriend ordered the sliced beef noodle soup with vermicelli. He loved it. He said it was probably one of best soups he's had. The soup had a dark rich colored broth that looked and smelled really good. 

We'll be coming here more often!
