oRgoOhwCex1X9j1iQ9ou3w Went to special price morning dim sum. Ordered five dishes.  Two dishes were lukewarm. Service was quick and good and the waitresses were polite. I gave 12%+ tip and got thank you twice.  The dishes cost $3.30 each so they should be really good.  Not all came up to that standard.  
This is what I ordered:
1. Chiu Chow Dumpling: 5 star for quality but the dish was lukewarm.

2. Steamed vegetable and mushroom dumpling: 5 star for quality and steaming hot

3. Sticky rice w/meat wrapped in lotus leaf: 1 star for quality, almost no ingredients.  Only sticky rice and egg yolk and 3 very tiny pieces of diced pork.  Also less than lukewarm.

4. Steamed black chicken with cordyceps: 4 star for quality.  Chicken was too tough (maybe too old)

5. Sea food and sea cucumber dumpling (only 3 per dish): 3 star for quality.  Too similar to Har Gow 

With tip we paid $25 and it wasn't worth it.  Much better quality, selection and value in Richlane.

We might give it one more try.
