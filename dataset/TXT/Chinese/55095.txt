CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw Some of our friends went here and said it wasn't all that, but I wanted Asian food and this was the only Asian restaurant in our hotel that was open at the time, so my friend and I decided to give it a try anyways. I actually enjoyed their food. Most of their lamb dishes are made with cumin, which definitely takes some getting used to, there's a pungent taste to it. Their noodles are handmade, the dough kneaded and and threaded individually into noodles, tasting very similar to udon noodles, just not as visually symmetrical. In my opinion, the food encompasses a traditional Taiwanese style of cooking. The food is lightly seasoned, the meat is tender and well cooked, and the vegetables fresh. The presentation of the food is simple, consistent with the cooking style. The restaurant set up is modern with Chinese writings on the mirrors that makes it look too busy and a little tacky. Word of caution, if you're not accustomed to more authentic Chinese food and are looking for more Americanized Chinese dishes, something safe, then this would not be the place to go, it's more of an acquired taste.
