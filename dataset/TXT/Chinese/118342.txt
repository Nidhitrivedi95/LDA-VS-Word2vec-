nl_gkvVXtsIlhGE0sP0qFw Crazy price, crazy buffet!  They have a very large selection of seafood, including nigiri sushi, sushi rolls, sashimi, baked salmon, various shellfish, including large and flavorful snow crab legs.  They are quick at refilling the stations too, even with the more expensive items like the sashimi and crab legs.  They also have a Mongolian bbq station, your standard Chinese food buffet fare, and a wide selection of fruits, including some canned Asian style fruit like lychee and longan.  Service is good and drinks and dishes are attended to regularly.  Also, in the mail there is often a 30% off total bill coupon in the Clipper coupon magazine which makes dinner (usually $12.99) an even better deal.
