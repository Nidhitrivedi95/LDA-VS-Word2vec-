jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw This was probably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life. I went with four of my friends and we patiently sat and waited for somebody to take our order for 15 minutes. When the women finally came up she said "what do you want" and when the second person started to order she said "hurry up I don't have all night" we waited probably a half hour for our food and they just never brought out two of the plates. And when we asked about them the guy rolled his eyes and came back 10 minutes later with them. When we went up front to pay our waitress walked up to us and said "where's my tip, gimme tip" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? If that's how you think you run a business you're very wrong. I have no problem tipping for good service, but after that night you all don't deserve a penny
