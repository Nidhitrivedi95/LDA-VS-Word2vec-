aJR1iUWwNVBM692gq7adBA I ordered the Crab Puffs, wonton soup, and orange chicken with fried rice. I hate to give a bad review but I'm so tired of being disappointed in the Chinese food in Phoenix! I can only speak to what I ordered:

Crab Puffs - should be called cream cheese puffs. There was no crab whatsoever. 

Wonton soup - loaded with veggies, decent. 

Orange chicken - again decent flavor with thin sliced chicken/lightly breaded.

Fried rice had a funny taste...nothing about it was "fried" or authentic. 

I give them two stars because they were friendly and quick to deliver. The food was disappointing and I ended up throwing it away after a few bites.
