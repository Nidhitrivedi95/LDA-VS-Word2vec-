2SyYW8GiDZsqtPb-aCbosg I loved noodle from this place. Especially when I was tired of all these fancy overpriced lunch options in downtown.

This is place right for you if you:

Like noodle soup 
Noodle
Wonton - shrimp, pork etc
BBQ chicken - moist
Cheap price $6-$7?
Etc? 

There will be long line up if you go there during the lunch time. I found that after 2pm seems to be pretty easy. -in case you are flexible with lunch time-

Hope someone else enjoy this place like me.

Thank you for reading my sloppy writing ;)
