qbDaSyxDfUZNheucJym2Pg This place is crazy when you go there.  No music, strange people and a beat up looking restaurant.  That being said, they have cheap and good Chinese food.  The General Tso's platter comes with about 2 white meat chicken breasts and a load of fried rice.  To start you get your choice of soup and some shrimp chips.  All told, lunch for just over six bucks.  The waitress in there is really no-messing-around so make sure that if you get a drink, you call it to her attention when it is empty.  Never hope for a shrimp chip refill either.  

Don't worry about having to wait, you never will.  Good place to grab lunch if you are in the area.
