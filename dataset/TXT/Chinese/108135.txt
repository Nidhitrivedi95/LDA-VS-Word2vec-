I came here recently with family for lunch and we ordered a bunch of dishes, the standouts were: 

Har Gow and Siu Mai: were so plump and juicy, they reminded me of why this is a dim sum staple

Turnip cake with pork: so soft it practically melted in my mouth and the pork added a nice meaty flavour

Several types of sticky dough dumplings (not sure what they are called): one was filled with veggies and nuts which added a nice crunch, I really enjoyed those dumplings, they were perfectly cooked. We also had some that were filled with sweet rice, those were A-OK. 

Chicken feet: not the best I have ever had but certainly some of the biggest; those must have been some monstrous chickens they got them from. 

Fried ribs: The BEST I have ever had, so big and meaty, perfectly crispy without being too dry. These were so good we had to order a second helping. 

Egg tarts: we had to wait 20 minutes for these, but they came to the table hot out of the oven, the dough was perfectly flaky and the inside warm making these possibly the best egg tarts I have ever had. 

All the other dishes we had were also well done; everything came to our table hot. The restaurant itself is quite nice, has a modern western feel not the Chinese banquet hall feel that is so common to many dim sum places in Markham-Richmond Hill. The service seemed pretty prompt and friendly all though I did not have much interaction with the waiters as I was not in charge of the ordering. I will likely return to Yang's for dim sum in the future as I can safely say it is some of the best dim sum I have ever had.
