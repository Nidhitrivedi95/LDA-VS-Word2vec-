yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA During my Vegas weekend, the GF actually got some crazy sickness and had to be bedridden (which totally sucked). Especially on the strip, trying to get some good, hot soup on the go is nearly impossible (especially since it was President's weekend) so we went off strip to this Pho restaurant. 

When you come in, you know it's a good Pho restaurant when 100% of their clients are Vietnamese and they're all here to eat pho. As we were immediately seated, they took our order of pho and egg rolls. Like any pho restaurant, their food came out almost as soon as we ordered. The pho broth was light and flavorful. Even the GF that was dying said that there was so much different types of flavor going on in the broth. They also gave generous portions of meat in the pho as well. I would say that their meat to noodle ratio was almost 1:1 unlike the other Pho restaurants that I go to in L.A. 

The price here isn't that inflated as well. A bowl of Pho ran 7-8$ depending on which one you got and the egg rolls were 6$. The egg rolls weren't anything special but they were skinnier than the ones I usually get. 

If you're looking for some good pho (especially after those crazy nights), get off the strip (don't go to the one in TI) and come here. It's cheaper and better quality and bigger portions.
