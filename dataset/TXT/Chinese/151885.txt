T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ This establishment was clean around the stations of food. I did see a few flies around but in this 100 degree weather, the flies and I would rather be inside. There was an assortment of options for food. I enjoyed the wings and salad/fruit bar the most. The soft serve ice cream was also tasty. As for the customer service, the ladies were polite and took plates away quickly. Polite, clean, and quick ...fair enough to receive three stars
