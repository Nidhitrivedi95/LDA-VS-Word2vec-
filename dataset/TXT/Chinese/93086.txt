iyPtSR0s6EkvaQFbdJ_jVA The food here is decent. Pricey for dim sum but it's better quality than the cheap Chinatown dim sum. However, I think they use a lot of msg for their steamed dishes. Msg doesn't normally affect me, I mean I have no problems eating in Chinatown, Chinese food court, instant noodles, etc etc. But after eating here, I had the biggest headache ever, like pounding headache. The fried calamari was delicious, some of the best Asian style fried tentacles. The calamari pieces were also huge. The sticky rice was pretty good and a lot larger than I expected. Spring rolls were alright, nothing special.
