Qme4ZWzZEdZUwnpo-sPPIw Noodle Bowl offers a good selection of meals from a variety of Asian cuisine (Chinese, Vietnamese, Singaporean etc) and the main advantage here for me is it's decent food, prepared quickly and good if you're on a budget. 
The food quality is good, but the taste is somewhat lacking in most of the options, but I attribute that to the meals being more healthy than something you would find at a chinese joint in a food court.

I also find the waitressing staff more friendly than average for a restaurant of this caliber.
