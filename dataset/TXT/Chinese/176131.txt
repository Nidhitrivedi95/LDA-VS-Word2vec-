WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg Avoid at lunchtimes due to sheer chaos, but this place is a greasy, spicy treat. 

It's one of my favourite places downtown for Chinese/Hakka food.  Try ordering a "Dried Chilli Fish with Fried Rice" for a delicious spicy & crispy dinner/lunch.

The hot and sour soup is also the best I've ever had.  The chicken pakoras are very different from places like Lin Garden or Fredericks, but very tasty in their own way... almost like Hakka KFC nuggets o chicken or something. 

A guilty pleasure worth indulging. Love going here but my arteries probably don't.
