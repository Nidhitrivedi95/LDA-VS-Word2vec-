QvEoE_oGwHPXvw5IylllNg Just so-so.  Lost my online order, because printer wasn't working "again", so not a one time problem.  Food was bland, not enough taste and felt like each dish was missing something in the sauce or seasoning.  Granted, I travel to China often, so I have a high bar, but there are a half dozen better Chinese places in the valley.  Fried rice was missing oyster sauce and soy taste, sweet and sour was too mellow, honey chicken needed more salt, pepper and soy.
