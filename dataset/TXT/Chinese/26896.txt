7wgKazvblPECOzBrd6N50Q Went to Beijing when everything else was closed around town...expected the quality of food would be better for a restaurant with about 25 people in it at MIDNIGHT.

We had the orange beef and the general tao chicken...very very below par for this standard fare...
Sauce's taste was off, very little meat in the breading and texture was bizarre.

Expensive for that quality, place was overall ok, but would not go again.
