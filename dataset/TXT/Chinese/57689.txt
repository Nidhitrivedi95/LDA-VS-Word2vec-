D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA We didn't get to eat here so I'm not going to be able to comment on the food but my comments are just about the reservation system and the hostess. I made a reservation on Open Table. When our plans changed, I tried to cancel. I could not cancel on the Open Table site, but it did give me a phone number to call Yong Kang Street directly. When I tried to do that, there was a recording that said that the mailbox was full....."goodbye". I didn't want this negative item on my Open Table account so the next day when we were in the area, I stopped at Yong Kang Street to talk to someone. The hostess informed me that they were not taking Open Table reservations, even when I showed her a copy of mine with the confirmation number. She also said that the system was down and she could not fix my reservation. Huh? Are they taking reservations from Open Table or not? I informed her that I tried to cancel my reservation by calling the phone number that was provided and she suggested that I discuss that with the manager. UGH! We won't be eating there, even if it's good if that is the way that they manage things.
