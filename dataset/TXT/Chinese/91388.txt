ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg Li Wah is the place to go for dim sum in the CLE! One clear indication of this is the packed dining room on weekend afternoons. It's like the entire Cleveland Asian community had made previous plans to congregate here every single weekend.

Of course, that's partly due to the skilled chefs at Li Wah. This place prides itself on having one of the most extensive dim sum menus in Ohio, and with 30+ items to choose from, I can see why out-of-towners consider this their one-stop destination for "Chinese tapas." 

Standout items include:
-Mexican buns
-Clams with black bean sauce
-Shrimp stuffed fried bean curd
-Hargow

My one small gripe about Li Wah is sometimes the pastry chef goes MIA on the weekends. The last time I checked in for dim sum, they weren't serving preserved egg pastries nor the baked bbq puff pastries -- two items I MUST get anytime I see them listed on the menu.
