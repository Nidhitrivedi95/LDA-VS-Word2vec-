0PM5oFKO29sZmL5efmHxug We came here for dinner one night and ordered scallion pancake, pork and leek dumplings, braised pomfret, and Korean cold noodles. The scallion pancakes and dumplings were great. Fish was pretty good and the Korean noodles were cold but good. It was a little strange eating cold noodles but it was great because of the heat wave in Canada! Barely saw the waitress. She only took our order and served it and gave us our check. But, we still love the place. Will definitely return when in the area!
