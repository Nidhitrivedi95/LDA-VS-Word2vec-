They have a live fish and lobster tank where you can pick your kill and they will deep fry or cook the whole thing for you. It is crispy, fresh and amazing. I've tried the lobster, fried flounder, walnut shrimp, ong choy, hot and sour soup, mongolian beef, salt and pepper pork chops and etc. I haven't had anything I didn't love. It's best to go with a group of people so you can share your big dishes family style. On top of that, the prices are amazing, and portions are big!
