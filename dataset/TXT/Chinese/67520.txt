emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw Having been in Arizona for several months now, I have been on the hunt for good Asian cuisine. What can I say... I was pretty spoiled living in LA. (Why can't there be a 24/7 Korean soondubu place here?! But I digress.)

So I consulted Yelp for a good dim sum place one fine Sunday morning. Unfortunately, that morning my friends in town had to drive back to Irvine ASAP, so even though C-Fu Gourmet had the most mediocre Yelp reviews, it was the earliest one open (9:30am while Phoenix Palace opens at 10am) so I brought everyone along to Chandler to see what quality of dim sum Arizona had to offer. It also helped that my coworker recommended C Fu Gourmet, so I had high expectations. 

It was.. ok. My party of 5 were the first ones in at 9:30am, so I don't blame them for being a little slow. But the variety of dim sum was underwhelming. Not bad, just nothing spectacular. Plus, their dessert cart was meh!

In the end, we paid about $60 including tip for a party of 5. Service was really slow, even in giving us the check.

I'd come back to C Fu if I really needed dim sum at 9:30am, but if you can stand to wait an extra thirty minutes, I prefer the dim sum and service at Phoenix Palace across the street.

One thing though, the actual restaurant at C Fu Gourmet is much nicer than Phoenix Palace. It looks more impressive and more expensive even though it's the same price in the end. Too bad the food and service don't live up to their looks.
