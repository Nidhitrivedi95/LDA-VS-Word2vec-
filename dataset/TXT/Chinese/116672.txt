NaO8109RYqscYu8fLzURsQ Ordered a "D" Combo for delivery. Food arrived piping hot within 30 minutes.

Food that is delivered or taken out normally loses some flavor and texture while being transported. Not the case here. The soup was piping hot. The egg rolls were crispy. The sesame beef with crispy spinach was hot and crispy and delicious.  The chicken fried rice and the peanut butter dumplings were fantastic.

The menu states the combo is for two but we could have easily fed four. Great job Kam DO!
