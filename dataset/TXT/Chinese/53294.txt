cnRMezUuLesmJHruUpAECA The Wok bar is great, the employees are really friendly, the food is priced right and they have a great selection of beers. I was there last night and found out they have live music and once a month, a beer tasting.  They offered complimentary tacos which were very good albeit not mexican, my 
favorite was the spicy beef but the pork and chicken were tasty as well.
They had beer specials that were very reasonable for any establishment in any part of the city but amazing for uptown. I love the foreign feel of it as it is hidden upstairs, so you have a bird's eye view of Tryon. I will definetly be back, next time I will bring my POSSE.
