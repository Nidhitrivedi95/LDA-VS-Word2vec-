taXKuFldSoerm9SXrckh_w As an Aries, does eating lamb count as cannibalism?  

The birthday festivities continued well into the weekend where I had to put my foot down and say enough is enough.  It's good to celebrate my birthday but if I eat anymore, I'm gonna have to buy new jeans, a size up.  Eeks!  So lunch at GTB was the last indulgence [minus the two giant birthday cakes I have sitting in the fridge --- lawdy!] for my birthday week.

Lunch today was delish.  I don't know what's up with the latest slew of 3 stars and below because this place is great!  It's laid back, not pretentious, and they serve up some authentic fare.  Music does not play in here so it's just you and your buddies filling in the silence which is kind of nice.  Service can be spotty since this place can go from empty to packed fast and they only have like two or three servers so be patient.  Both English and Chinese are spoken here so rest assure, your order will be placed correctly and all questions will be answered.

For the five of us, we ordered:  Toothpick Lamb, Walnut Shrimp, Beef with Bitter Melon, Hot Pot with Vegetables and Pig Intestines, Salt & Pepper Squid, and West Lake Beef Soup.  The food was great!  My favorite was probably the Toothpick Lamb --- braised lamb cubes marinated in cumin and crushed chili peppers... aw yis!  The Walnut Shrimp was pretty standard with a more than generous amount of sweetened mayonnaise on it, the Bitter Melon was definitely bitter [I like it!], the intestines in the hot pot was cleaned which is the only way to eat it [if you eat these dirty, you're dirty.  Don't talk to me.], and the Salt & Pepper Squid had good flavor.  All this and a West Lake Beef Soup cost us about $75.

GTB is a solid place if you want some authentic Chinese food without the wallet-gouging prices.  Portions are generous and the food is hot and tasty!
