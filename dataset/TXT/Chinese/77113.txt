GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, hands down! There is no better place for spicy, authentic Chinese food, and they even have karaoke here! Szechuan Gourmet is located next to Tink Holl market, and although it doesn't look very fancy it makes up in that department with their delicious food. On top of that, they are open fairly late, so you can sing and eat til' your heart's content. 

My favorite dishes: spicy bean noodle, sauteed loofah with mushroom, lotus root with peanuts, dan dan mien (noodles with minced pork soy bean paste), fish filet with veggies and hot peppers, and the salt and pepper crispy prawns. I've also had the ma-po tofu, dried pot- intestines, dried pot- lamb, braised eggplant, and giant grilled prawns on skewers (this is not on the menu, it's a special request item). 

All the food here is pretty delicious. Although I've been here many times, I'm still trying out new dishes! It's a great place for groups as well, and if you spend enough they allow you to use the KTV room for free! The place is usually busy, so you can tell the food must be good!
