C5bmtDRAtl5iMGmBCF5prw This buffet has been there for 30+ years. It's one of the best low cost Chinese buffets I know. I come here mostly for the soups and meat. They have beef and broccoli and mixed vegetables with seafood, soft lo mein type noodles, along with chicken chop suey over crunchy noodles, and they're all good.

Both the egg drop and hot n sour are very good. I like the fried mushrooms and zucchini. The char siu pork ribs are delicious but only put out for dinner. The fried chicken and honey sesame chicken are other favorites. They don't have the selection of the mega chains, but I like the homemade flavor here better. The ribs are my favorite.
