Best thing I had there was a drink that will knock your donkey out. It's called "Lights Out" and it's appropriately named. My advice is to have a few rolls and lots of pre drinks at Buddha then go up to one of the clubs in the casino and after 5 hours of more drinking and dancing go to the coffee house and get pancakes.
