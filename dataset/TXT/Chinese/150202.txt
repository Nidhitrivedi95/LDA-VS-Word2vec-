Ok...truth be told, it isn't really punishingly hot as it is persistent.  The spiciness is there but it's not immediately overwhelming.  The numbing feeling and the chili oil stick on your tongue though.  After 5 minutes, I was dying.  I've had spicier things before but the feeling dissipates...here it sticks around.  For that reason, I can't take their mapo tofu.  I did like their hot and sour soup, kung pao shrimp, and the shredded pork with bamboo shoots.  I've never seen bamboo shoots like they served here but man they were good.  Tender and not chewy or stringy at all.
