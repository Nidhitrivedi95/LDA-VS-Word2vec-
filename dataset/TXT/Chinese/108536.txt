LiqKk5cteNMf46-JYvnwCw We came on a friday night this time around. It was pretty late and this place was the only Asian dining place open late. They have private rooms for karaoke. It took a while longer to get our food this time. I ordered the house rice noodles, spicy chicken and mixed nut chicken. The chicken was not my favorite  but I really liked the noodles.
