4STzP1q1uM8ONkKookifsw My wife and I lived near this restaurant for nearly 6 years and we only started getting food from here a year before we moved. I wish we checked this place out sooner. The hand drawn noodles are very delicious. We have only gotten take out here, and they are extremely fast. I usually have my food within 2 minutes. So far, I have only seen asians eat here which tells me a large segment of the population is really missing out on some good food.
