kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA man,this place was pricey for chinese food. but, it was absolutely delicious! it was for the most part, standard asian fusion/chinese flare but packed an extra punch. also probably why they charge 300percent over Panda Express. :)

very elegant use of the space here. dimly lit and long facades covering the tables. maze like walkway to get to your table. very secret garden like. and sexy. 

service was pretty good. at the table we ordered some dim sum, the pork belly, the udon noodles, the haka noodles and the sweet and sour pork. everything was magnificent. the pork belly just melted like butter. the noodles were perfectly seasoned and not too salty. the sweet and sour pork was crunchy and tangy. oh, and the dim sums were all amazing. 

prices were not too crazy considering this place is apparently one of the new IT restaurants on the Strip. 2 couples with a couple rounds of drinks at just $300 with tip. oh, and we got complimentary admission to the Club!
