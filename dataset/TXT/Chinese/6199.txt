0ebavvJVXAzKKQ8C9cOt6g We ordered veggie chow mein and egg foo young and veggie chicken for my roomie. 
The food quantity is great! U get lots of food for a $6 avg menu. 
The egg foo young is very tasty with right spices. The noodles are very crispy and the fried rice is not bad too. 
The downside and reason for taking a star off is it bland. I've had chinese at other places where they have right amounts of salt n chilli. They need to work on that. 
Other perks include just 12$ for a free delivery which is great. U order a starter and main course and they get it to u for free! 
I've had regular coupons in mail box and they do discount stuff. 
So if ur looking for something cheap and need something heavy, order from chopsticks. U might need to make some modifications with salts and peppers/ sauces based on ur taste buds!! 
Happy eating
