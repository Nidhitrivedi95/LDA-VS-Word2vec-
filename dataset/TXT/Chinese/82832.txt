Part of the experience is looking through the window that lets customers see the food being made, which is cool. But I don't think I really like ramen noodles; they were chewy--which I'm not a fan-- and it didn't have much flavor. Everything else in my (kind of small ~$10) noodle soup bowl was good - bean sprouts, chives, pork, and egg.

We also ordered the pork soup dumplings, which were new to me. I'm glad I put the whole dumpling in my mouth rather than biting it! The burst of soup was a nice and tasty surprise. 

Another upside was the taro milk tea which was pretty good for Pittsburgh; it was creamy in the best way. One thing was that I didn't ask for bubbles/boba, I said it was milk tea, not boba--it just came with the drink.

If anything I'd come back for the soup dumplings, not so much the noodle bowls.
