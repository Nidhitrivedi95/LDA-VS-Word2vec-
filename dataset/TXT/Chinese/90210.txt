IDW4QFw-fN_wk81G9OV-Mg I wish I could have gone 2.5 instead of three.  

The cashier/order taker was being trained and was slow and didn't speak great English and didn't know how to count change.

The cooking of the food was slow as well.  Maybe I just expected it to be faster than it really is.  Staff were friendly.

The Beef Stroganoff is a bit bland, but I like things sauce-y, so I added some creamy marscapone to it when I got home & it really brightened up.  It could use a little more meat in the noodles, but the noodles weren't overcooked, which was good since I had to drive them home.

I just wanted some noodles without fuss, so this fit the bill for this evening.  Relatively easy to get in and out of except for the construction they are doing on Hawthorne, so you have to go around the block to get there... you can cut across Torrence from 4th (I think it's 4th).

Mangia!
