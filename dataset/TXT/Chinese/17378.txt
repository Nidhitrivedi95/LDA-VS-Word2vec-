4rSHsXO4ozQoD0hoPCDatQ I spent over $50 to feed my friends and family their food on a takeout order. Everything was good, good as usual, except for the order of Pork Lomien Noodles. It smelled sour when I got it home (5 minutes after I picked it up). I tasted it and the meat was rancid. I've been a customer of their's for the past year and I've never had a problem with their food. I returned to the store with the Pork Lomien noodles thinking that I was doing them a favor by alerting them to the problem so they wouldn't serve it to anymore of their customers. When I explained the problem to the manager, she refused to smell the lomien noodles. She refused to give me a refund for just the pork lomien noodles and she refused to make me another order. I told her that her attitude was uncalled for and she dared me to call the Health Department because in her words "we make everything fresh!" I told her that she was being ridiculous and that I would be making a complaint and she said "f@#k you! Get out my store!" I don't know what her issue is, but I will never give them another dime of my money. Absolutely incredible.
