My friend thought her pad Thai tasted a little fishy. We also ordered a panang with a medium spice and it was extremely hot. We all ordered wine and I glanced at my friends glass and there was lipstick on the glass (not from her). I pointed it out to the waitress and she got her a new glass of wine.
