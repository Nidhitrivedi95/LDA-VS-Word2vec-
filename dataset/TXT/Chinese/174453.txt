WEw08dCcOiwH3Sw1f_8DKQ I came here for dinner with a group of friends who had never eaten Xinjiang/Chinese Muslim food before. (Reactions from friends included, "naw, you're making that up" and "isn't that an oxymoron? A Chinese Muslim?" People got schooled that night!) 

The restaurant itself is nice looking, with some Arabic/Chinese calligraphy on the walls and new-enough decor. The service was very quick and efficient, which was exactly what we wanted, as hungry as we were. We ordered a dozen lamb kebabs and a dozen beef kebabs. They were perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of spice. The lamb hand-cut noodles were delicious and had a nice slow burning spice. The chestnut chicken was just ok, a tad overcooked. The pancake stuffed with lamb was decent, but not nearly flavorful enough. The best dishes aside from the kebabs were easily the sweet and sour fried fish, which was tangy and crunchy, the lamb hand-cut noodles, and the vegetable dou miao. The marinated beef tongue cold cuts were also a good appetizer to the main meal. I will definitely be coming back, and zeroing in on the lamb and beef kebabs.
