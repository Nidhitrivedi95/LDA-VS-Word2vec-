t_SvwKRaMyNHj2NOMvMv1Q Second time this has happened. After ordering on phone I was told 20 to 25 minutes. Arrived there 20 minutes later. Paid for food. Had to wait another half an hour to get my order. It looked like they rushed making the meal. Normally it's good. Not this time. I think they missed my order and then threw it together. Very dissapointed.
