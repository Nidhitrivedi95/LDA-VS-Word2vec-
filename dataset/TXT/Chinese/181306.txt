xdfGzrJ1mx3mBx6m14Ebhw I'm from Where the Asians Live in the GTA (aka RIchmond Hill/Markham). I was raised on excellent and affordable Chinese barbecue and I crave roasted duck as well as crispy roasted pork every so often.

Now that my life is downtown, I still get that craving so I'd been looking for a new bbq place.  I'd walked by Goldstone many times and thought that their meats hanging in the window looked much better than a few other places downtown, so this was on my To Try list.

I came here for a quick lunch and got a duck/crispy pork bowl.  The serving was really, really small.  I mean, I knew it'd be smaller than a plate but there were only a few small pieces of each kind of meat.  It was TINY!  But it tasted good, so I thought I'd just order a plate next time.

But when the bill came I saw that my tiny bowl of rice with a few tiny squares of meat was over $8 after tax! $8+ for so little food! I get that it's downtown, but for that price I could eat much better at lunch in the middle of the financial district!  That was ridiculous.

So I asked one of the servers how much a plate would cost and she said $2 more.  But when I looked at the plates that were being prepared on my way out, I found that the rice plates had a lot more rice, but only about 4 more pieces of meat.  

I think it's a total ripoff, so I'm going to keep looking for a new Chinese bbq place.
