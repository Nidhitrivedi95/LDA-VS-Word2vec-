HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ I was hesitant to try this restaurant after driving by it for months and seeing the very modest appearance.  After hearing rave reviews from many people we finally gave it a try.   It is now my favorite sushi restaurant in the Charlotte area.  We probably dine in or take out there once a week.   The Fire Island sushi is our favorite dish.
