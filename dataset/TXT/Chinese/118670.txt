nNKGSpRiHm79HlA2mMdrAg Eventually make up my mind to go to this restaurant.  Unlike other restaurants in the chain, this one is of a smaller size and not as glamour as the others.  It is a standalone building structure with private lot.  There are not that many spots in the L shape parking lot.  The restaurant has advised that customers can park to an adjacent lot.

There is a big sign for 20% with any patrons coming in with a senior.  So I can see most of the tables have seniors.  The dim sum is average.  The best being the steamed beef balls which are fresh, soft and moist.  The steamed chicken feet is not that fresh.  The vegetarian rolls with bean curd wrap unexpectedly is a large dish with at least 4 or 5 rolls each cut into 4 pieces.  The steam bun with running yolk is very good.

The service is good with our tea pots always filled up.  Even with the 20% discount, you can still pay by credit card.
