X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I've been to Hakkasan maybe 50 times or more. The Dj  booth tables are the best spots. The dance floor tables are awesome too. I've had a good time in every party of Hakkasan, especially the ling ling room. The only times I did not have a good time were when I was forced to be in overcrowded general areas. The walk ways between bars are narrow and if you are not at a table touching the dance floor you can't see the affects or Dj booth clearly at all.

Hakkasan is great if you love mainstream music and enjoy raging  shoulder to shoulder with everyone else. It is also great for when you feel like balling out and treated like a king when spend the right amount of money.

If they had  more original sets and didn't over crowd, Hakkasan could get 4-5 stars. The ling ling room is a 4 star hip hop spot. I've had awesome times in there.
