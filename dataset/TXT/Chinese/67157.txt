ElqLoKM__uU7DcYzRnMpNw I went there for lunch yesterday with my friend. We both were pretty impressed. The combo or whatever is $7. You get your choice of a main dish with rice and either a wonton soup, eggroll or something else. We both were really happy with our meals. The portions were big enough to eat only half. Today I had the other half at lunch at the work cafeteria after sitting for a day. It stood the test of time and was still good. I think it is really good for the price. The service was pretty friendly too.
