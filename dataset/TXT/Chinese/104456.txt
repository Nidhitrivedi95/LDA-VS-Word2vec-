KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ Disappointing this last time. Had orange beef that had a soggy texture overly smothered in sauce. Also another chicken macadamia nut also smothered in a thick sauce. Chicken seemed more Chinatown style versus high end, meaning that the fat was retained to connect the pieces of chicken. Me no go anymore. All three of us concurred on our opinions.
