68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw Friend took me to this place today. Pretty good food, my family went to Asian Legend once in Scarborough and we were very impressed, food wasn't typical Chinese fair, it had a lot better presentation as well as the decor is nice.

Food was really good and the prices are decent. Nice place to go back to.
