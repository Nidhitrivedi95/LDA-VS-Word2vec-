XUDOc980cjB0PZvVS-T6Eg This was my first (and last) visit to Jimmy Wan's.  I was drawn in by the Peking Duck, hoping to re-live an experience I had in Beijing. I was not greeted and waited at the host station while a person shuffled papers and took a phone call.  Eventually I just went to the bar, and the server there was very nice.  She took my order and was relatively pleasant throughout my entire time at the bar.  However, the duck arrived in record time, and it was cold and tasted old--like leftovers from the day before.   Although the skin was crispy and flavorful, it was not enough to make up for the blandness of the meat. I was so excited from the reviews that I ordered the whole portion instead of half to the tune of $45. Boy do I regret it!  I packed the rest of my dead duck up and left quietly, while the owner and host continued to ignore me as they welcomed other customers, and or bid them farewell.  Over all I am very disappointed with my experience and will not return to either location.  My search for great Peking Duck continues....
