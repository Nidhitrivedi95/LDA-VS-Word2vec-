pzYqRsyspY-cy77cjdSWOg Would have been 4or 5 stars but the cooks were eating which is no big deal but when 3 of the 4 of them went back in the kitchen to cook they rinsed their hands..no soap and hand washing lasted for maybe 15-20 seconds. On man actually used soap and almost washed his hands for 30 seconds! However the food was very good and fast and the service is nice. It would be nice to adhere to hand washing regulations
