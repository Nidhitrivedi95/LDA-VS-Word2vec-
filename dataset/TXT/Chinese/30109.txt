97V91GSG-OQvrvOc9GXoGA I really like the decor and the service was very quick. Everyone was very nice and helpful. I had the five-spice duck (It was written on the chalkboard and in a written part of the menu, not sure if it's always available) and milk tea (my new favorite thing in the world). I also split the beef meatball soup with my mom. The duck is amazing, but beware: it has bones. It had all different pieces, wings, neck, and what-have you. Such a great flavor! The milk tea was fantastic, and the homemade chili oil is hot but very very good. The soup was stellar, the broth has such a deep umami flavor. It could be a meal in itself.

I don't know much about Taiwanese food, but I really love this place after one visit.
