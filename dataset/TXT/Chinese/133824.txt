PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg Its nice to support the locals vs the big chains, however some times its a trade off. 

It was nice to get free won ton chips at the table.  The upgrade to brown rice is a bit steep however at $1.

The dishes them self were decent but nothing too impressible and when you ask for hot sauce you get a small dish of chilli oil, hardly enough for a true fire head. 

If you are in the area give it a try, but don't drive too far you will be just as happy or happier at a peiwei for about the same price.
