ix10sks4hVvv-3Jb6sKjvw My family and I have been coming here off and on since I was a young boy in the early 80's both dining in and ordering take out, always had a great experience here..never found anything wrong with my food as alot of people have stated in this world full of snobby, unsatisfied, ungrateful complainers..but to enlighten all of the high class pricey Panda eaters..I have found a dead fly in my General Tso's chicken before and my wife found a dead moth in her Chow Mein.

The buffet may not be much but it has always worked for me.  The waitress sometimes waitresses are very polite and touch tables regularly, will refill your glass if you set your empty glass to the outside of the table as dine in tradition would tell you, they always earn a nice tip from me and my family.  Best time to dine in here is at 11am when they open up, food is fresh and hot but we dine in here at any time of the day.  Also, if you ask the waitress she will give you chopsticks.  The building may be a little rundown and old but it happens to the best of places whether we like it or not..get over it.
Don't like it??  Real simple, don't eat there.  Whether people say yay or nay, we will always come back again for an all you can eat at this buffet.
