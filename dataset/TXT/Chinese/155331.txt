tK-PQOhZo94fonbQVXaOSg I decided to try King Wok after reading reviews on Yelp... It's also really close to my house.

This place is not that good.  It's just eh.  I thought it lacked flavor that I love in prepared food.  It is inexpensive, which is a plus.  I got eggrolls, almond chicken, and chow mein.  Their sweet and sour sauce was too sweet, the almond chicken sauce tasted like flavorless goo, and the chow mein tasted sweet too.  I really liked the people who worked there and really wanted to love it, especially because it's almost the last business left in that shopping area.  

I think I'll have to try something else there... Definitely worth a try though.
