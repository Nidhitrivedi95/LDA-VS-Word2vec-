hU1vaeTPmawvpzOyTEAK0Q Massage technique was great (Joyce walked on my back) BUT The noise level was unbearable and for this reason alone I would never go back nor recommend it to others!!!

From the previous reviewers, the noise generated from their own staff is just plain rude. I don't mind the open concept at all or even light whispers. What I do mind when I popped my head up to look at why it was so noisy - I saw 4 masseuses sitting 6 ft away from me, openly laughing, talking to some kid (someone brought the kid to work), cooing at the kid, trying to feed the kid, the kid running up and down the hall with noisy squeaky shoes on.

I asked them to keep the noise down and they did apologize and move to the back room - where they should have been in the first place. 

ALSO - the person that laid on the massage bed before me was a smoker.  Either they didn't change the sheets or whatever it was - it stunk.

Groupon/Deal or not - not coming back.
