Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg The other reviews are right this place does have a nice look to it. Sat at the bar and  even though I was ordering a drink I was having diner.  The bartender should have offered me water. The house salad had really good flavor but too much dressing. Salad was swimming in dressing. The Mongolian beef, after I could taste it from the salad dressing was very good. I would go back again and just ask for dressing on the side.
