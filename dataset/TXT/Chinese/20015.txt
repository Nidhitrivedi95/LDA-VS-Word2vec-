5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ Ugh. So let me get the food out of the way: it's about 2 and a half stars.

So in to allllllllll of the bad:
* Menu is super basic looking, has all of their offerings but very little by the way if description. Not even pictures. Absolutely nothing mentioning portion size.
*Speaking of portion size: you're paying what I generally regard as the standard price for each dish but getting slightly less than half as much as you would at any proper Chinese food place.
*Atrocious service.
*Made an order of food and drinks. Only received drinks for two people out of four (a pot of overpriced tea with two cups), slowly after we received two soups for the drinkless people. Still no drinks. Then later received the appetizer platter for the drinkless people. Many minutes later we were presented with one plate of rice (out of four that were ordered). About 5 minutes after that we received one plate of friend rice for the drinkless peopel to split (which wasn't mentioned that it would be a split). Still no drinks and missing an order of rice for a person. Many minutes later, the waiter comes by and askes how is everything. We then had to tell him that he still forgot 2 drinks ( which he forgot what they were), an order of rice, and two orders of orange chicken. Then many minutes later we finally received drinks, with the orange chicken following a bit after... Still no rice for one fellow, just decided to cancel that order of rice.
*Additionally, there was no salt, pepper, sauce, or sugar at all on the table for the while meal ( we ended up asking for sugar).

Wow. 

Steer clear.

Oh yeah, the orange chicken was soggy and well more saltt than sweet/orange when it finally came around. 

96$ for 4 people, the worst service I've had in quite a while.

Final update: been waiting now for about 10 minutes to get the check and leave as quickly as possible. Barely ate any of the entree because it's super not great.
