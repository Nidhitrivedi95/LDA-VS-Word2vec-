VaLnPWq6cLnK5x2wXBVOKQ As a HK style restaurant, I would say this one has the better food quality and taste when comparing to other HK style restaurants in TO. But of course, it's abit more expensive as well, but on average about 2-3 bucks more per dish than the norm. So for me, who prefer quality over price, especially when the difference is 2-3 bucks more, I would pick this restaurant.

I have tried several dishes there but the one I liked the most is the "baked pork chops on fried rice". The pork chop is thicker than the one you usually get in a HK style restaurant and actually has some real meat taste (which often lacks in HK style restaurants). So I would recommend this dish because it just work so well with my palate.

But the place closes at 8pm, i wish they would open just abit longer so it can fit my work schedule better as well. :) But I guess I cannot have the whole world.
