1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w I've never been a huge Chang's fan.  It's okay but never my first choice.  I had lunch here last week and while the food continues to be average, the service was fabulous. They made my salad with the wrong dressing and brought me out a whole new salad (I honestly hadn't even noticed).
