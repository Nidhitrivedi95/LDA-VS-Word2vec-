Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA Great Thai place that my co-workers found.  Love the place, although it's not really as hot as you think a 10 star would be.  I'd say that it's been toned a little for the customer base.

Food is fantastic.   Thai iced tea is awesome too if you need a little something to take the edge off.

Price is very reasonable for Thai food and I'd definitely recommend the pumpkin yellow curry!
