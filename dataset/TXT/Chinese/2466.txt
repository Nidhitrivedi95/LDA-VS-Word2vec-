_blrEZQZ6et5QEUa-a2WLg This is one of the Panda Express restaurants that I patronize in the Vegas fast food landscape. Four stars because I am a fan of Panda Express. This location lives up to their name.
  Panda Express is no authentic Chinese restaurant, however it serves quality food. In my opinion, their chow mein noodles is tastier than those served in some of the Green Valley area Chinese restaurants. In comparison to some of the fast food chains, I don't feel like I'm eating fast food.
 I have been and still am a Panda Express fan.
