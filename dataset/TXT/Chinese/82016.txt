H2RgkjPs3W-CxbyygCJJew I live right down the street from this place and I absolutely love it! Upon walking in, we were greeted like we were family and the service remained spectacular throughout the meal. I honestly didn't expect the food to be as great as it was. We tried some hot dishes and a lot of their sushi... Everything was phenomenal. The draft beers are $1 all day long as well. Needless to say, I will be telling everyone I know about Pacific Gardens. Keep up the good work!
