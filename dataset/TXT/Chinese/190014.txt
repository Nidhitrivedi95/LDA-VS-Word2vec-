It is just like every other Chatime, but an experience deemed it worthy to get a review. 

When we arrived, there was a small hold up. No, not a line up, but a hold up. Due to some malfunctioning of the machine. However, I observed the concentrated facial expression of the Tea Shop barrista and thought that she handled the situation quite well under pressure. The minute she fixed the machine, they were able to print a whole series of orders in one go, as well as handling the upcoming order with ease. The quality of tea that day was perfect as well, so I thought that's worth mentioning.
