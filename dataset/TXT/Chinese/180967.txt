X9ftU-exKhTMOjtr3B52rw This is my favorite Wonton (Cantonese Shrimp Dumplings) stop. I usually come here to buy their raw dumpling 12 pc at $14. Price has gone up. Their original store first started in RH. So missing the hungry feeling and satisfying after eating their giant wontons.  

Food Quality Great, shrimps always exquisite and fresh

Service....fast and adequate . A new way to experience shrimps flavours. They also make fish paste and marinated beef with your choice of noodle. 

I highly recommend to pick up their raw items and cook your own way at home. You can eat in store.  See what you like ;)
