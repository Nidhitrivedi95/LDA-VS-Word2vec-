PAJlmByrU8zAB3WsXxA30Q This place is pretty hidden - it's a plaza with a few other Korean restaurants, and it looks pretty small and dingy from the outside, but it's like Narnia in there. It's huge, and it's pretty fancy, completely unexpected. Okay, Narnia might be a bit of a stretch. But I was definitely surprised when I came here for a small banquet. The food is delicious and well cooked, and the service is good as well. Everything was flavourful, without being over-sauced. I left feeling pretty thirsty though. I'd love to try their dim sum some day since the reviews on here are looking pretty positive!
