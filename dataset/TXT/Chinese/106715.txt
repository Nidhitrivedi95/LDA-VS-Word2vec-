L_tieGcFMQVSmk7XiA093A This is by far the best chinese restaurant ive been to in canada!

Chongking style Hotpot is extremely good and authentic!(well i would say not enough for me as someone grew up in a very spicy province in china, but as far as canadian restaurant goes, I cannot find a better one :)  it is about mild spicy if you do it in chongking or sichuan just FYI) but numb is real

Price is very affordable, stuff is more than extremely nice, which is something unusual in an asian restaurant! I rarely give more than 10% tips unless in quebec, but this is the one makes me feel guilty if i dont do 20%. The reasons are below: 
The one served me made some very nice recommendations which I really enjoy. They do disturb me with standard dumb questions like "is everything alright", but they just happen to show up whenever I actually need something, from adding water, ordering another round, to bring down the curtain when it is glaring and lift it up when it is enjoyable outside, taking empty plates, pointing out washroom etc., without making me actively ask for anything once for help in 2 hours dinning experience. I've had too many knock-yourself-out buffet service in other places. This is the one makes me feel I was actually well-served without annoying me. 
I cannot say for others though, experience may vary, maybe it is because it is not very full at the time.

The place is really clean, and the atmosphere is quite good as well.
I saw some comments whine about ventilation, honestly I did not feel it at all. I mean it is hotpot, you should understand there will be some hot air hit you. I did not smell anything from other tables.

The only thing im not 150% happy with is they do not accept credit card, but i can live with that.
Bring cash for 10% off.
