My family and I hadn't been in the area in awhile and came for the dim sum place that is next door. However, it was closed so we came here instead.

When we sat down, the lady that took our order seemed annoyed for absolutely no reason. After repeating our dimsum orders twice, we also ordered a chicken dish from the main menu.

The food came out in weird intervals and look a very long time. The first to come out were the shrimp triangle dumplings, the BBQ pork buns and the black bean spare ribs. The shrimp dumplings tasted like they were frozen and reheated. It basically was like mush and broke apart when I bit into it. The spare ribs had only a sprinkle of mashed up black bean on top and the flavor definitely was not incorporated into the dish at all.

By the time the next round of dishes came, we were long done with the first round. Next came the scallion pancakes and the chinese fried dough. I had the pancakes and they were actually pretty good. My brother and mom didn't have any complaints about the fried dough either. However, my mom wanted some soy milk to go with is, so she asked our waiter. It never came.....

Then after we had finished those, the shu mai came and after that the big bowl of congee. I was pretty excited for the congee excepted the duck eggs were hard and rubbery. I had to really try to chew them. The pork was also SOOOOOO salty. It was like cured or salted ham. It was definitely not enjoyable.

After all of the above dishes were finished, we were still waiting for the chicken dish we had ordered separately. At this point, we've been waiting longer than we spent eating and really just wanted to get out of there. So I called a waitress over and said that if they hadn't made the dish yet, we don't want it. She goes to check and THEY NEVER PUT IN THE ORDER.

TWO forgotten orders, slow service and mediocre at best food earns this place two stars in my book.
