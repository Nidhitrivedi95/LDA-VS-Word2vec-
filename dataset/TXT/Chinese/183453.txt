XplJHcYSQTFlwv3Rk8WsYw It was hard to find a place with really good shanghainese dim sum. But this place was it!! When my precious go-to place for soup dumplings closed, I tried several different places and this one was the best :).

The only problem is that the prices are prettyyyyyy high here and the service is sometimes shaky. I remember having a few problems with the attitudes the waitresses before but the owner is always really kind and looks out for the customers. Maybe the waitresses were overwhelmed because I usually notice only like 2-3 running around. 

Anyway everything here is pretty great just the prices are a little higher than id like. But it's so worth it when I'm craving the dishes that they make so well.
