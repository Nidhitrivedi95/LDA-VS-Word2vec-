OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw This place is a below average dim sum place.  Maybe by Vegas standard this place is good, but by Bay Area standards, this place is crap.  It was difficult to find parking at this place; I am actually surprised by this, given that the food is not that great.  The wrapper for the Har gow was dry and tough and the Shumai just tasted ok.  The shrimp rice noodle roll was also just ok, the skin also didn't taste good.  I am probably not going to come back here.
