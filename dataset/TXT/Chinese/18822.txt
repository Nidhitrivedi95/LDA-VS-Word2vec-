5GOrW-PkisP0eXlSxy4AFg The first time I came into this place, I felt like they wanted to throw me in the wok. And yes, this is a 5-star review, so let this be a lesson in perseverance. The place is unassuming on the inside, although much nicer than it once was. The food is served on paper plates, the soup in Dixie bowls. In short, it is as unpretentious as possible, and they aren't going to win you over with personality (although they warm up to you once you get to know them, and they're actually pretty awesome).

That being said, even if they insulted my grandmother, I'd keep coming back. This food is that amazing! There are two local chinese places me and my wife frequent, and this is my personal favorite. That Dixie bowl egg drop soup with the bag of crunchy noodles is the best I've ever had, and they have Sriracha hot sauce at the table just to kick it up a notch. It is a huge serving, and it comes with all of the combos. My work friends swore by the Cashew Chicken with white rice, and my wife prefers the Lemon Chicken with white rice (and both are quality options), but I go here for the best Orange Chicken in town, with the best pork fried rice. This stuff is to die for, and the servings are so big you will never leave hungry.

Of course, the crab puffs are amazing, and some of the other options have been good as well. I don't know that there has been a meal we've been down on while we've been here. They do everything right!
