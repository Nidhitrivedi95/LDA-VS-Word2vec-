9WAnQD1nj1j3zLZ7ONtvfQ We hit up Little Buddha for dinner since we were going to go to Playboy Club and Ghostbar for drinks later that night.  We were a group of 5 - 2 vegetarians and 3 meat eaters so the menu had plenty for everyone.  The sushi was tasty, the nigiri was fresh.  A few people tried some rolls and said they were excellent.  The vegetarians loved their noodle dishes while us meat eaters enjoyed chicken lettuce wraps, the duck, and Mongolian beef.  Everyone loved their meals.  WARNING, if you order the Mongolian beef, be aware of the Thai Chili Peppers in there!  One was hiding under some sauce and I bit into it and yikes! To say it was hot is an understatement and I love my fare share of spicy foods.  But our waiter rushed over with a glass of milk and more water and crisis averted.  After picking out the rest of the Thai Chilis I gobbled up the rest of my meal.  The portions are quite large, I think it would be a nice touch if their menu was created with smaller portions and lower prices for sharing (I see more and more places leaning towards menus like that).  The lychee martini was delish and everyone ordered up boat loads of Saporo and Saki.  The service was decent, nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about.  The décor was interesting with millions of little Buddha statues of all sizes everywhere, but typical Vegas (grandiose and swanky-esque).  Overall when we make our way back to Vegas we all agreed we'd come back for more.
