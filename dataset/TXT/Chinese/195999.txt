Yeah, the waiters aren't supermodels and the food is not super gourmet, but it's delicious and simple, and I do enjoy the Chinese soap operas on their big screen TVs.

I have a complete review posted on my blog (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com) with pictures of the interior and of one of their dishes.
