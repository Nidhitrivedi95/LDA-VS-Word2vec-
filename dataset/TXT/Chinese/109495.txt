lOW5kH6nHVOYfmoAfpWvHw After reading a great review in the New Times, I decided to take my parents (visiting from Chicago) to this restaurant. Living in the Second City, they know good Chinese food. We frequent the dive restaurants along Wentworth Ave whenever I fly into town. 
I set my expectations high based on the top rating on Yelp, big mistake!
The restaurant is hard to find! Bonus points there, most dives are! Atmosphere: 5 stars in a good way, yep  nearly bare walls, and a cavernous dining area. On the night we visited, there were only 2 other diners present so we had the place pretty much to ourselves. Its BYOB, 200 bonus points there. Brought our own boxed wine, yep, we don't care about all that "fine"bottled wine, but please, bring us CLEAN glasses not ones with lipstick from previous diners! 
The 1st course was hot and sour soup, it was neither. Bland bland bland! At least had a nice chunky texture to it.
I had the twice fried pork, not bad, but not the 3 star spiciness that is advertised. Dad had the pork intestines with veggies, rated 5 star heat. Great taste in the dish...5 star heat? I think I've had more heat in an "Angry Whopper" at Burger King. When its advertised 5 star heat, I want to breath fire!!!!!!!
The 3 star Kung pao chicken was the winning dish. Hot Spicy Chunky flavorful!
The spicy bean curd was average, not hot, not dull either. Just ok.
We did have some communication issues with the server. She wasn't that fluent in English....not a bad thing, but when we wanted to talk heat, she didn't exactly understand.
I would like to give this place another try, and hopefully a better rating, but compared to all the delicious restaurants in the China Towns in NYC CHGO and SF, it dosen't stack up.
