6OhahrmtLGmkUdPfaMck0A Came here on a Wednesday night. The restaurant itself was decently filled for a weeknight. The restaurant was clean and had a very modern atmosphere.

In terms of their dishes, I found their hot and sour soup to be moderately spicy but not at all sour. Their Dan Dan noodles were good and had a lot of peanut butter sauce but was a little too salty for my taste. Their xiao long bao was hot and soupy, but felt like it was lacking in meat. 

They're also not the cheapest place around town. For a table of 4, we ended paying $70.

A very average meal that did its trick in filling me, but I've definitely had better Shanghai styled meals for a cheaper price.
