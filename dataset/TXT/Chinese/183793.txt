xSplhd6mlpQzbjUAq3rP6w They deliver! Was home on a Saturday afternoon and was looking for something local that could deliver and found this place. We ordered the spicy orange chicken, crab puffs and Hong Kong style curry beef brisket. We were quoted 30 min for delivery, they showed up in 20. The chicken was very tasty was all white meat with no weird chewy pieces. The curry beef was amazing, very good flavor with fresh veggies. The crab puffs were of course great, it's kind of hard to mess up deep fried cream cheese stuffed awesomeness. 

We will definitely be back try what else they have to offer.
