tWtuHpIFtQHMQq8q8DG3dA This place is great, Asian with a hip twist of NY. The menu is simple, healthy, and affordable. This is a great place for lunch but it is small so seating is limited. I saw lots of business people getting food to go. You can order online and they will do curbside delivery if you like. Hours are 1030am - 8pm. All the sauces are yummy and mixing them is fun too. If you are not big on sauces just ask for it on the side and add as you like. I was not disappointed with my visit and will return next time I pass through Cleveland.
