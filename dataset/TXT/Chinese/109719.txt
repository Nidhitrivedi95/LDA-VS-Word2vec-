lpqtCUzSnKc1QGi4wO6ovQ This bubbled up towards the top of my Yelp search when I was looking for an inexpensive lunch in the area.  I ordered the #1 (chicken and peanut sauce).  On the menu board it says "with or without soup" which I didn't understand.  When you get served, though- you get a bowl with the hand-stretched noodles, peanut sauce, some veggies, chicken, little crispy (onions?) and a separate bowl of soup stock.  I wasn't sure if you were supposed to dump it into the noodles but I did and the flavors mixed perfectly.  Seems well above average for a mall food court, and you do get to see the staff pull the noodles by hand right in front of you.
