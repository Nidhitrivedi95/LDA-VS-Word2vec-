ziAwyzwgQGYgJmCae042gw I spent 10 weeks and thousands of dollars finding specialists and having every test in the book done to obtain a diagnosis for my severe abdominal pain ... finally I was told it was my gallbladder. My gastro wanted to put me on tons of medications in the HOPES that it would get better in another 3 months. No thanks. Someone recommended Dr. Jing Liu and I figured it was an avenue worth exploring. I made an appointment and had a wonderful consultation with her ... she's so perceptive (she can diagnose issues by looking at your tongue and feeling your pulse) and easy to talk to. She asks good questions and quickly arrives at a plan of action. She put together a cornucopia of Chinese herbs geared toward making my gallbladder and other digestive organs healthy again. After just a few days, I felt considerably better. And after one week, the pain I had suffered from for 2.5 months had vanished. I remained on the herbs for about a month and I'm completely cured. Are the herbs icky? Yes. Are they worth every nose-hold to choke them down twice a day? Absolutely! My only regret is that I didn't find Dr. Liu sooner on my gallbladder journey ... she could have saved me so much time, money, radiation from all those tests, and pain. 

Since that time, she's also treated me for bronchitis/sinusitis (and what I like most is that she knows her limits ... I was so sick, she told me to go get antibiotics from my doctor to fight the infection while she treated my cough and congestion symptoms with Chinese herbs), and helped cut the duration of that illness. 

Drl Liu is now my first stop when I have a health issue  ... I trust her methods 1000x more than chemical-laced Western medicine that masks symptoms vs treating problems!
