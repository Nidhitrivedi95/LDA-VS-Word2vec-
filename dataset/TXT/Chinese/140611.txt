R7-3MCD6_RL_VxN65yCh2Q We used to love, love, love this place but the pasts few times we've gone in something bad has happened. One time I brought home food and a bell pepper (in the Kung Kao chicken) still had the sticker on it from the grocer! 

I still go, just not nearly as often as we used to and I have to really be craving it enough to not care if they don't clean their produce.
