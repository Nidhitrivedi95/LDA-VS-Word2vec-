yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA If you are in need of decent, cheap pho and various Vietnamese comfort foods, this place will not disappoint. Though not at the level of places in Westminster or San Jose, I feel the tranquility that only an ethnic foodie dive can offer to escape the strip.
The pho is tasty, the fried rolls are satisfying and the pork chops are seasoned expertly. It's open all hours so spend the money on a cab and get your hungry self over there-it will save you money on that strip club you were considering. Plus a great hangover prevention move.
