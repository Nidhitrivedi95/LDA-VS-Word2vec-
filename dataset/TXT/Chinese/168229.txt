VNBJZ36URHCwwF2UqM7xWw We visited here and were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food.  We had chicken & broccoli and general kno's chicken and pork lomein.  The general chicken was the best ever. Just enough spice!!!!!  Prices we a little high but we did have left overs and it was just as good for lunch the next day.  Will de go back and try other entrees now that we know how good it is.
