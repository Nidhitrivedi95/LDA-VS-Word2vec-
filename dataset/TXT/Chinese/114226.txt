Mv-15Zh_yzGZ8KbcN328GQ this place is AMAZING!  the sizzling rice soup is out of this world.  crisp, fresh veggies, chicken, & jumbo shrimp in a PHENOMENAL broth.  probably the best broth i've ever tasted.  my in-laws took my fiance and i for dinner there, and it was fabulous.  wonderful service, fresh food, and a very tidy space.  i can't wait to go back.  i hope they never close!
