e-finkL51hroOJ0GZ8jcXA I will be the first to admit that I am very inexperienced when it comes to Asian cuisine. Dare I say, I'm almost afraid of it. But recently, almost as if it's my pre-New Year's Resolution, I have taken on the mantra of trying new things. I met my cousin and her husband there for dinner and we were seated very quickly. China One West has a 'clean plate club' that is strictly enforced (I learned from my cousin right away), basically if you don't eat everything you grabbed, you have to pay extra. Okay, I know the deal, so let's eat!

I go up and put a small sampling of anything that looks appetizing. I don't know the food well enough to take huge chances. But I was able to fill my plate up - large selection and quite the variety. They even had some spicy chicken (in that red sauce that would easily dye your clothes a dark red if given the chance). Surprisingly, I don't remember finding white rice. But man, I was able to find some food that I wanted seconds of very quickly.

Asian desserts, those were quite the treat as well (no pun intended). I guess their ice cream machine was broken (vanilla was fine, but the chocolate mix was low - so a swirl was out).

I saw a few Yelper's mention that the staff wasn't very friendly. Well, I wanted to disagree and stayed optimistic but after our first helping we were brought the bill. Umm, this is a buffet and I guess if you sit with empty plates too long they assume you're finished. Well, we went back up maybe 2 more times and I never got a beverage refill or was checked on by our waitress that got us drinks in the beginning. Once that bill came she was done with us. I got my own drink on trip #3, which I think is fine, but she came back on round 4 to refill drinks so I just don't get it.

Poor service and the gut rot the next morning were enough to make me question when I will return. However, it was a good selection and the price was fair so I want write them off indefinitely.
