a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg Best Chinese take out I have ever had ! Very very pricey ! But absolutely worth it ! I have a few different things on there menu an all where great and good size portions ! The down sides are how pricey an that they charge 5 bucks extra for delivery and don't give that to there drivers also I wanted to substitute white rice for the fried rice and was willing to pay extra but they wouldn't budge at all on that !! So I ended up telling them to keep the white rice an I ordered a side of fried which was 7.95 a piece ... You would think they would compromise a little I spent over sixty bucks on take out ! But overall food was fantastic when it arrived to bad won't be able to afford to have it anytime soon !lol
