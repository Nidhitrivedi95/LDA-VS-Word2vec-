6s7uduX1Q1KSjOKvwxYkRA Food was pretty good, great portions.  Minus two stars because we ordered a sushi roll but never recieved it.  Waitress had to correct the bill twice and she had a heated conversation with the sushi bar staff in front of everyone.  I was pretty pleasant throughout the whole ordeal because these things happen.  Still, the whole situation could of been handled better by the staff.
