3-nPI5TJVKXEBJnFU0L8yw I have been coming here since I was little. My family always get take out. The food is always so good and always made to order. Today I ate in and the store is basic but really clean and refreshing. They have a cute fish tank that is also really clean. The TV isn't overly loud and they have the news playing, which is nice. Best Chinese food in Gilbert!

I got the orange chicken combo with a large drink for less than $9.00!! Amazing.
