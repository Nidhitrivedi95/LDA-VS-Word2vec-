4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA I went here for dinner last night for the first time. I have been in the shopping center many times, for Kohl's and Sprouts, but never noticed J & K before. I was looking for Chinese food here on Yelp! and saw this one had good ratings, so I decided to try it. I will return again. I went alone, so I had the 'Specialties for 1' orange chicken, which comes with choice of soup, I had egg drop, egg roll, 2 wontons, greens and white rice. Everything was well prepared, hot (temp), and delicious. The place was packed, and service was still good. I did not experience any rude Asian women while there.
