rwKJHC-DE2aLTZiS_xFy7g This place is awesome.  Awesome hand made noodles and very speedy service if you have 3-5 people.  It's a great place to eat and go.  It's not a good place to sit and talk because the restaurant is noisy and the seats are not comfortable. 

The price is a little bit on the expensive side because a small bowl is $7.49 and about a dollar more for the large.  There isn't a real large difference between the two, quantity wise.  They also have a variety of side dishes.
