1czIVv2iyOHc3WMgtUWXCQ I am am so glad that this place exists. I like the big brother restaurant Zen Asian Fusion too. That is an event. This is casual dining. I would love it if they increased their gluten free options and had a gluten free desert. Still the food is warm and good. Hardly ever had to wait to be seated and the prices are modest. The environment is comfortably informal though not really cushy. Lastly they let you browse and read the books in their decorative bookshelves. Can't take them home though. Still a good conversation starter to see which ones you know.
