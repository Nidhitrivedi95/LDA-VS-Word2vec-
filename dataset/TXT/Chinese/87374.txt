HTAAMVDZ4P0VX5F9euJBoA Third try and it was a disappointment. Took the sizzing rice soup home and doctored it up.
The shrimp & lobster sauce  was worse than I make at home. The cashew chicken was fair at best. Sorry this is a BAD example of chinese food. The take-out place up ther street is SO MUCH better!
