D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Satay Thai Bistro & Bar was a total accidental find. Our reservations fell through at another close by restaurant and we found this place.  I always love some Thai, but STB&B was great.  This has become a regular stop for myself when in Vegas.  I have even taken quite a few clients here for dinner and drinks.
Some of my favorites are the Crispy Tofu and also the Roti appetizer dish.  I also love me some tofu and mango.  Of course, I always have to mix these with some of their delicious coconut rice.  
I've been a dozen or so times now and they are always very welcoming and friendly.
