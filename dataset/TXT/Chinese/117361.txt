NdqDt4c2ZWpGTUWvcDDKkw This place is awful.  It's always totally empty, and for good reason.  I went for lunch today since it's walking distance from my workplace, but I will never go back.

I got yelled at for asking questions about the menu, it took forever to get my food, the food wasn't that good--and then it made me feel sick all afternoon.  I got the lunch special with vegetables and tofu, steamed rice, and hot and sour soup.  It was all bland--amazing, since this restaurant is one of the few Chinese places that still uses MSG.

It looks like they used to do a buffet, but now the food tubs on the buffets are filled with old magazines and trash.  Not even kidding...I don't usually write entirely bad reviews, but I can't think of a single good thing about Yen's.

If it were the zombie apocalypse and I were locked in this restaurant, I still wouldn't eat the food.  Gross.
