alFUbO9iXROUPcApQyjduA My go to for (Chinese food) delivery. Foods pretty decent and I really enjoy their wonton soup. Always a pleasant group to deal with, delivery is fast and they don't forget the fine details such a soy sauce etc.
I thoroughly enjoy their grilled dumplings. They are plentiful and the filling is flavorful.
The number 9 combo is my go to combo meal. It's a good variety, you get chicken fried rice, beef & vegetables and 3 chicken balls plus a spring roll and wonton soup for $12. Amazing value for very good quality food.
I do enjoy their barbecue pork, it is leaner than I'm accustomed to but it's still very flavorful.
The chicken lo mein is another go to classic for us as it's very flavorful and has a good quantity of meat, veggies and noodles. 
I begin to crave the Wonton soup as soon as fall hits, it's a delicious warm up.
