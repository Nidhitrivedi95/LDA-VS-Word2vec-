vVdY2qDO7dkUrU8LXYZ1uA Our go-to for Chinese take-out!  I love that they are not afraid to make something more spicy (WAY more spicy) if you ask for  extra spicy!  (Some places just won't make it very hot, maybe they think you'll bring it back or something.)    My husband loves their lo-mein, while I am a huge fan of all of their spicy vegetarian dishes.  Always friendly and super-fast!
