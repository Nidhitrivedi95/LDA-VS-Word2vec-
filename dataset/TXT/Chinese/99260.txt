Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Perhaps I am unfairly comparing Orchids to the dim sum places that I've frequented both in SoCal and NorCal. But hey, I gotta call it how I see it. The dim sum is ok, definitely not the best I've had. But considering that this is Las Vegas and that there IS a dim sum option available, I would rather have ok rather than nothing.

Besides, they still use the old school carts that roam around the restaurant. Major props for that!
