If you're hungry before last call or don't want to cook after a grueling day at work, this place is for you. They even have pictures of some dishes to choose from on the wall as you walk in. Take out is quick depending on the size of your order. I usually get the Shanghai noodles pretty average but filling. I kick it up a bit with some chili garlic sauce.  Everything tastes better with garlic chili sauce is my motto or if it doesn't kill you, yolo!
