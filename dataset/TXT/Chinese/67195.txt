em3TpGN9BAA85u2lXewDiQ Granted we only had 2 rolls, a California (yes, we're American) and a crazy tuna, they were both fresh and delicious. The atmosphere was surprisingly tranquil and tasteful. This is NOT a corner Chinese food joint, in fact, nits on the more formal side. Great for date night, which was why I was there. Service was great and the menu extensive. Just about any roll you could want as well as all your standard Dishes, including kabobs for the kids. Drinks are inexpensive, and they have 4 or 5 varieties of Asian beer. No craft beer. I'll definitely go back.
