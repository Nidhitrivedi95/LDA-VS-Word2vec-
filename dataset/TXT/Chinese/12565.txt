2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg If you are looking for cheap eats in Toronto's Chinatown, this is probably one of the better choices. Most of the dishes we ordered were a bit bland, though quite edible. Ingredients tasted fresh. The tastiest thing we ordered was definitely the Barbecue Pork. We ordered the large serving and it hit the spot. It had a delicate smoky-barbecue flavor and was not slathered with soy sauce as another reviewer on here complained several months ago (maybe the cook got the message). If you order the large serving ($5.50) in addition to a vegetable entree (the Pork Barbecue has no vegetables), you should have a fine banquet for two.

The other entrees we tried, which impressed us a good deal less were the Hot Pot with Seafood and Vermicelli Noodles (tasteless, though the shrimp and scallops were tender), Chicken with Cashews (pretty generic), and Baked Oysters Xo Style (just tasted weird). Among the soups we had, the Corn with Chicken was a nice chowder, while the Wonton and Egg Drop, along with the Spring Rolls, were so-so.

From the looks of other plates coming out of the kitchen, Roast Duck is one of the better selections alongside the BBQ Pork. They do a whole fish dish that looks interesting too. Good luck trying to figure out the rest of the extensive double-menu. The place is interesting and authentic enough such that we will probably return and try more hit-or-miss ordering.

Ultra-casual atmosphere with attentive service. At peak times you may have to wait standing up for 10 to 15 minutes. The restrooms/washrooms are clean. The lighting is a bit severe and may give you a headache, but at least you can see what you're eating. Eating conditions are a bit cramped with tables shoved together or against the walls, so you may not wish to come here if you are exhausted from shopping and carrying bundles.
