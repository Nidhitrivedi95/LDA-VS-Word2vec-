UC8SLfl2dpMd7ZXWvFYAUg Last week our family took out from China Joy.  Overall I think we all liked the food.  Some in our party were a little put off by the elevated spiciness of the hot & sour soup, but I was fine with it.  As hot & sour soups go I thought it tasted pretty good, and I consider myself an expert on the subject...  We also had an appetizer assortment which was also pretty good as well as a chow mein.

What prompted me to YELP China Joy, however, was the prodigious volume of mayonnaise on the walnut prawns.  Curiously this dish is not on the menu I'm looking at online, so either the menu is old or China Joy improvised the dish when we ordered it off-menu unbeknownst.  While maybe not one of the great mysteries of our age, here's what we know: we ordered it, we ate it and it jiggled with excessive mayonnaise. This had to have been a mistake - they can't possibly serve this dish like that on a regular basis.

Overall, the food was fine, but please tell the Chef to go light on the mayo if you order walnut prawns.
