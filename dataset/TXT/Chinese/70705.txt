F9h98ZFHLCHG7SdVbXMz0g I wanted to give 0 stars.

I called and ordered one piece of "yau ja gwai" (aka "yau tiu", the fried dough that people normally eating with congee).  Of course it was my mistake that I did not ask how much.

The restaurant was almost empty when I arrived at about noon.  It was quite dark inside.

I went to the cashier and found out it costed $6.5.  It's the most expensive "yau ja gwai" I ever had.  

When I got home and opened it, the content inside the box was actually "ja Leung" (fried dough inside steamed rice roll)!!!!!

When I called and ordered, I clearly said "yau ja gwai" not "ja Leung", it seems that the waitress does not understand Cantonese much, and how authentic a dim sum place is when the waitress cannot even understand Cantonese? 

Even for people who cannot speak Cantonese, I am pretty sure you can try to pronounce the word and they don't even sound the same.

(Dim sum is Cantonese food, and I would say 99.9999% of dim sum place in the greater Toronto area is operated by Cantonese people)
