X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg My friends and I came last night to see Tiesto and it was amazing. A lot of these reviews are complaining about the stairs but its so minimal, come on people. Hit the gym if your that tired after a few flights of stairs. Anyways, the dance floor is amazing, the sounds is crystal clear and I never waited more that five minutes to get a drink. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I will definitely be going back again to Hakkasan
