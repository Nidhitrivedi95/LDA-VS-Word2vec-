LbeJgPgKKHw5qH0f02NHEQ When they say spicy, they mean spicy. And I like spicy so that's OK with me. But that's about all I found to recommend this place. The fried rice that came with my meal was very dry and no vegetables were mixed in. I also thought the portion sizes were small for the price. I'm from Philly so maybe they just do it differently here. Its a shame there not more choices because this is the only place in this part of town.
