CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw I was staying at the SLS hotel so it was convenient place to grab a snack! I am chinese and my last name is Ku, so that also drew me in. 

We just wanted to try one of their dim sum dishes. We went with the shrimp & pork sui mai which was topped with peanuts and gold flakes. Nooo idea why they needed to add gold flakes but it was visually appealing. Lol.
