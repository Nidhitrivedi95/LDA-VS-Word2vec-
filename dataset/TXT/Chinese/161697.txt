uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw They have the best hand cut noodles and hand pulled noodles in town!!

The tomato & egg noodles is  surprising good~  And of cuz, their beef noodles is very very good!

Waitresses keep saying that it will be a loooong wait for hand cut noodles, and will convict you to order hand pulled noodles, but it's definitely worth the wait! (I personally like hand cut noodles... so~!)

However, I'll recommend you to go with someone who can speak in Mandarin.  I will consider their service as "standard", which you can get from other Chinese noodles restaurant.  (Just pay attention on their foods, not their services!)
