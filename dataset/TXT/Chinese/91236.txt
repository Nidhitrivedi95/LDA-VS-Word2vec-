iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A Just good chinese takeout. Fresh, fast, yummy, not over-soyed or over sweetened.  Friendly people, fair pricing.  I actually woke dreaming of their brown gravy from the egg foo young. It was that good!  The Chinese  first place I've tried in Vegas that I've gone back to a second time!  And will continue to return!!!
