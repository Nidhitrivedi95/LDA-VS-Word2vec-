JkzqS4JDOpoHrj534rzvAA I was excited considering all the options but none of the food was anything special.  It was all okay, edible but nothing special.  The pancakes were fine, waffle was a little soft but was fine, Orange Chicken was fine and my wife's eggs and hasbrowns were pretty good.  Service was friendly and good and the food was fine but just don't expect to be blown away.
