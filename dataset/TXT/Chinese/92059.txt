IOwTrStIy6NinyquhBrLZQ I order  general chicken, beef and broccoli and also string beans! Half and half on the noodle and rice! I got to say this is the worst Chinese fast food I been to! I wish I should just go to Panda Express! This place is really salty and I don't even think they know how to cook Chinese food! Very disappointed! Don't ever go here!
