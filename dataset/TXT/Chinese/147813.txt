se_K9gbKMAECYVnE_0hc_w I love the food there, they make an amazing dumpling and pop pan.

HOWEVER!! The most disgusting thing happened today. Today, I saw several rats in running around the floor. I wanted to throw up immediately, but instead just paid and walked out (I'm too nice, I know). I should have shouted on the top of my lungs "RAT".

Be aware, don't eat here.
