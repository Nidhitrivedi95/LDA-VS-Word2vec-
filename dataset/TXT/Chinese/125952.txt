oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q LOVE Eddie's Wok N Roll! I would say it's my second favourite Hakka restaurant, although I frequent it often because of its location to me. 

Portions are generous at Eddie's, you'll definitely have leftovers. 

This is a place where my husband and I often take company and they all seemingly like it (varying from guests who like mild foods to spicy). 

My recommendations would be the chicken and shrimp hot and sour soup (there's visible portions of meat in there, no looking around for a shrimp). The chicken pakoras, chilli chicken (I prefer to get it dry instead of with gravely), crispy beef, Manchurian paneer and Hakka chicken noodles. These are our regular dishes which we circulate.  

To me Eddie's always delivers in satisfying my cravings
