xEHTmRGyoj6y8m2qY50opw So I was on my way home from work and I didn't feel like cooking and was craving Asian food. I was happy to see this place on my way so I decided to stop and check it out. 

As I walked in I was hit with the smell of stale cigarettes which really made me want to turn around and walk out but I was only ordering to go and it may have been another customer that walked in before me so I headed up to the register area to check out the menu and place my order. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were many options of different Asian cuisine. I'm a sucker for Thai fried rice so I decided to order that and crab angels (crab puffs). 

Again I was just ordering take out so when I got home and opened my fried rice I couldn't believe how much was in the container. There was enough for 4 meals!! The crab angels were just ok I have had better. 

I would really like to give this place more stars simply for the amazing Thai Fried Rice I got, but it was missing the pineapple that I was craving and that it said it had on the menu.

I will go back and try this place again and possibly change my review to a 4 or 5.
