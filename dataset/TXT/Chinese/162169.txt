UlI0TksGFiIXtcbtg2KalQ Stumbled upon this unpretentious place while driving through nowhere. Probably an old burger joint converted to a Viet restaurant resulting in an odd decor but a familiar restaurant experience.

We ordered three dishes between the two of us, probably too much food. My grilled chicken on vermicelli dish was very tasty. The barbequed meat was dark, nicely flavored, and the dish wasn't excessively filled with noodles either. My friend ordered beef wrapped in betel leaves and he enjoyed it as well. We got an order of pancake and it was this fabulous looking thing (see my pics) stuffed with bean sprouts and bit of shrimp and pork. The dish had generous amounts of basil and mint which I really love about Vietnamese food.

No frills service and minimalist ambience but tasty food nonetheless!
