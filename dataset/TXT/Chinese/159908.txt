U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Came for a quick lunch. It was not busy but the hostess was not at her post. I had to wait around, wondering where she was. Finally she came to get me and seated me next to a very rowdy Chinese family. 

I received a glass of water and I placed my order. I ordered the chicken and seasonal vegetables. She brought me over a fork and set it down without a word. I tend to get a little irritated at that, because I'm a white person, I'm an ignorant who can't use chopsticks? 

The food came out ridiculously fast but I was a bit leery the chicken was undercooked. It tasted okay and I never got sick but it didn't seem particularly well done. Similarly, the vegetables were cut a bit haphazardly. Typically, vegetables are cut small enough to easily pick them up with chopsticks. These vegetables were left in unmanageable chunks. On top of that, I never actually got a plate. I just ate off the serving dish because no one bothered to give me one or check on me.
