QTYA1yCbsCjRU6BYDdQJuw Incredible value for money!  Had the M6 combo (beef stew with vegetables and white rice) which comes with a mango pineapple smoothie for $9.50.  Everything is awesome and beats my expectations! 

This cozy little cafe is extremely clean. Service is outstanding.  I don't know why it took me so long to come here. Will definitely return!

For those of you who don't already know, they're a branch of the Hung Fook Tong in Scarborough.  You'll find the same yummy items on the menu, ranging from rice dishes to snacks to desserts and beverages.
