sVqV9lzvx98kWU39Fn4c6w My best friend and I stumbled across this place after leaving Carolina Place Mall. I was shocked. The outside does the atmosphere, service and staff no justice. Great food and drinks!! We had a great time as well. The server was very friendly and had some great recommendations as it was out first time there. I own a non-profit and they also offer a private meeting room, with plenty of amenities. The interior and decor is very nice, that atmosphere is very relaxed, clean, polished and contemporary. Others complain about how dark the parking lot is, it could be brighter, but I mean who is going to get you the Sushi Zombie? Smh this is a great place, go and try them out!!
