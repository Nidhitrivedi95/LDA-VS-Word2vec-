AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw Yay, wings!

Seriously. The wings here are a true thing of beauty. They are the crispiest and most delicious wings ever--even when they're drenched in General Tsau's sauce (which, by the way, is also glorious).

Clearly, I'm a fan. I also enjoy the sweet n'sour chicken. It's pretty tasty, too.

I've seen a bunch of Yelp comments in which folks are complaining that the food is bad or that it's not "authentic." If you're looking for authentic Chinese food, go to China. Don't go to a dive bar in Scottsdale.

The food at Chop n'Wok is Gringo Chinese. But it's glorious. And it's everything you could ever want when you're throwing down a bunch of beers.
