DQMaUSbKsRtB5lJD3egqxQ If you haven't been to Wah Kee, this restaurant needs to be next on your dining experience list. In a sea of pre-fab noodle places, Wah Kee continues to create all dishes from scratch, all noodles from scratch, and all of the  food is fresh and prepared masterfully by seasoned chefs. This dining spot has been around for years  and is family owned and operated. It is not glitzy like some of the national chains- but if you are interested in very good, authentic food at a very reasonable price, skip the bagged noodle places and try Wah Kee.
