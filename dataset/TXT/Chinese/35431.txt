ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ Had company Xmas lunch and for most it was their first time. 
Decor was unique. We were seated with the big tall chairs, which made for a laugh. 
Different from the Mandarin. Some prefer mandarin, some enjoyed the change. 

Service was good. Cleared dishes almost immediately. Nothing spectacular, nothing horrible. 

They has salmon & butterfish Sushimi, but they served it and were a bit stingy. Only gave 3 pieces salmon & 2butterfish, and when I asked for more (on the same plate) they gave me 1 salmon. 
They did have a nice selection of sushi in general. 

Peking duck was a nice surprise. Noodle station was good and fun to watch them hand pull the noodles. Had no problem getting a 2nd dumpling added to my bowls. Spicy beef broth was good, but on the salty side. 

Overall enjoyed the selection of foods. Quality was a bit higher than Mandarin, however felt not as many different selections. Trade one thing for another, but would definitely go back with the family. 

Enjoy!
