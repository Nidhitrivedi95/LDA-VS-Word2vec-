M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g When you in Las Vegas, this is one restaurant you must visit. Beautiful decor, clean, and staffs are friendly. The menu offered many speciality dishes. They have fresh eel which I didn't think I would like was delicious. The curry crab was the bomb. Just eating the curry sauce and steam rice was already so good. The string bean was fresh and crunchy, not soggy like most places.  We ordered wine with our meal.  The bill was reasonable and affordable. Will definitely come back again.
