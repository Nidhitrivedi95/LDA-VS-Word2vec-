3v1c2BsFFcWlpV3S3LS8dA Living in South End the Chinese food options are quite limited (basically null) so I decided to drive a little bit out of the way this weekend to try this place out.  I ended up ordering take-out (seafood lo mein for me, broccoli and garlic sauce for the lady friend with two orders of fried rice).  Service was nice and quick; they said it would take about ten minutes when I got off the phone and when I got there 15 min later the food was ready.  Prices were very affordable and they looked to have some great lunch specials.  I will definitely be back and I look forward to trying some of the more traditional dishes as well.
