FbMZ0N5iAicep5ssYLZB9w So decide to try this place on a whim and boy was it the biggest mistake of the day.  Walk in around  lunch time and  was greeted and seated right away.  My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken and I got the sweet and sour chicken.  The lunch specials come with the following egg drop soup / iceberg lettuce w/ ranch / an over cooked bland egg roll / cream cheese puff / brown white rice ( its supposed to be fried rice) and then the main dish.  Its a lot of food for $4.95 but its gross.  The orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken had so much breading that you really didn't know if it really  was chicken.  My daughter had to use the bathroom and it was dirty and we saw a roach on its back alive.  Also the lights are so dim in there that its hard to see.  Maybe they did that on purpose.  I would NEVER go back here again... Don't waste your money..... Panda's would have been a BETTER choice.  I left hungry and disappointed...
