966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA This is my new go to spot for food in Vegas. If I can't think of where to eat, I'll head over to Wendy's. With a menu that serves Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine along with fusion items there is something to please everyone on the menu. 

We had the house wings which were seasoned with Chinese five spice powder and fried to a crispy crunchy texture and topped with crisp garlic and little black fermented soybeans. We also ordered the ribeye bao burgers, which were three white Chinese steamed buns filled with a slightly sweet and savory meat and onion mixture. They were really easy to eat and it was hard to be nice and share them. 

There are tons of noodle dishes on the menu as well as dumplings, duck and a fantastic dessert and drink menu. How does a Thai iced tea with a scoop of ice cream in it sound? It looks enticing in the photos and super indulgent to consume.
