OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw its very difficult to find an affordable yet mouth watering dim sum. This food critic here can tell you that the dim sum here is mouth watering tasty. The flavor is very rich, but not as great as the dim sum in san francisco, canada, los angeles, or hong kong. the only reason why i rate a 4 star, is the service is not so good. The waiters are always asking, " are u done yet?"
