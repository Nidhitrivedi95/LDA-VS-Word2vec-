rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g This had so much potential, but alas, all the hype I heard about this place was not true. The dim sum itself is not spectacular. It's about as good as most other places I've been, but the selection wasn't very diverse. Maybe we went too early and not everything was out yet. It seems like that's the catch 22: either you arrive early to beat the crowd but have to wait for the good food, or you come later when the food is all ready but you have to wait forever to get seated. Actually, I'm not sure if we were too early for the good stuff or if they good stuff just never came our way; the hostess had seated our group all the way in the back, away from everyone else when the restaurant wasn't even close to being full yet. Seemed like a rather racist decision on their part because my group was predominantly non-East Asians. 

Now that I think about it, the service was definitely bad enough to warrant a two-star rating. The ladies pushing the carts were really terse with me. I was ordering everything in Mandarin (because that's the only Chinese I speak) but since people in my group had dietary restrictions, I had to ask about the filling for the different types of dumplings and bao that went by. The ladies got really annoyed about me asking and were pretty rude. They also seemed angry when I asked for four boxes (one for each person) and rejected the two big boxes they initially handed me (even though I had asked for four small boxes to begin with). 

Food-wise, it was okay. I've had better had other dim sum places, but my favourite dim sum restaurant in the valley closed, so this is kind of all I'm stuck with. Still, I feel bad for having brought my friends here to try it out. All the good stuff I heard about this place just aren't at all true. Disappointing, to say the least.
