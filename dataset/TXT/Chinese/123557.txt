OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA This is my social club in Toronto Chinatown. Its a great place to relax, drink as much tea as you like on the house, and enjoy their Hong Kong style delicacies. Sometime members of certain organized groups get in loud arguments, but just mind your own business and chalk it up to "ambiance" I used to come here with my friend Shrimp Boy in the 90's.
