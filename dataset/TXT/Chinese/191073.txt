Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g So we went to Bund Shanghai for lunch this afternoon...... The vegetarian dumplings, crispy pork buns and xiao long bao were fairly decent, but nothing to write home about. Then our last dish comes out and that was the "Shanghai Crispy Noodles." We mix it together, get a small portion to just try it and I find a F*CKING EYELASH in my noodles!!!!!!!! We immediately stop eating, ask for the plates to be taken away and for the check.. They bring the check WITH THE NOODLES STILL ON THE CHECK!!! I ask my friend to tell them to take that off since we didn't eat it and the cashier starting acting up!!! Throwing the check to her coworker and slamming it around. She then told my friend she didn't know what was on the plate and that it wasn't "long enough" to be a hair.............. Without losing my mind, we got it taken off, paid our bill for what we did eat and got out.. DO NOT BOTHER EATING HERE!!!!! THE SERVICE HERE IS BY FAR THE MOST ABSOLUTELY FOUL/HORRID/ROTTEN SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE AND WE WILL DEFINITELY NEVER RETURN!!!!
