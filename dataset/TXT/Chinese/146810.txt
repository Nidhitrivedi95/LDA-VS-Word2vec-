s6KtKeubYAa-sY9OC3i58Q The lady at the front is mean and impatient, please know what you want before you approach the counter...or walk in the door for that matter. Everything is extra. No free refills. No outside drinks. No public restrooms. But the food is ok, good munchie food. Decent prices and good lunch specials. Too much of the food could cause upset stomach however...I think we go there because it is the only Chinese food place near us. However, we DO still go there...and the food is good when you are hungry. I think because of the history behind it, it is definitely one of the South Sides must do's. It is no Ming and Gee (Glendale, AZ)...BUT, people like it.
