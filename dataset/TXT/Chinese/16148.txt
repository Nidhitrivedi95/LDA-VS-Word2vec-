3WKPtBiuph0SelrE9COngA The food here is so good I order almost once a week and it's always delicious. With most Chinese places I order the same thing every time and am a bit wary about branching out. However everything I've ordered from Yu's has been delicious without fail. My favorite is their Fried Tofu which is wonderfully chewy with a ton of flavor. I love that the combo comes with both rice and noodles, which are wonderfully mouthwatering.

As a fan of curry just the other day I tried their curry and was pleasantly surprised by the taste, normally I eat Thai, Indian or Japanese style curry so this was a nice change of pace.

I'd suggest this place to anyone. The place is nice, the service is fast and friendly and the food is always wonderful. They also deliver so I'm one gleeful fan!
