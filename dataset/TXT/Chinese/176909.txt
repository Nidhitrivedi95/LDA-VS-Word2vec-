The food itself is my biggest complaint as most of the dishes range from alright to below average. I find their dumplings especially lacking as the shell/skin tastes oily and not quite right. Most of the rice and meat dishes taste decent though so you are still able to have a decent meal. I will probably end up here again but I won't be overly excited.
