First timers may find it uncomfortable. Stay away from any of the spicy dishes if you wish to not experience it. Personally, I'm not a fan of it. I prefer the bum's-going-to-hurt-the-next-day type of spicy. 

Food can be inconsistent. I got (B7) Hot Pepper Shredded Chicken Chow Mein. I love this dish, but the first time, it was strangely on the sweet side..I decided to get it again and the taste was spot on. Also got the chili wontons again, but tasted different from the first time. I was able to taste and feel the peppercorns as opposed to the first time. I also recommend (B1) Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup and (B2) Beef Brisket Beef Noodle Soup. Some may think these do not have much flavor, but I personally think that it's supposed to taste clean, meaning simple flavors. Reminded me of some noodles I had when I visited China. 

I think my favorite aspects of this place is the simplicity of their menu and their prices. By only having a handful of appetizers and entrees, you are not overwhelmed by their options, and I believe it would be less chaotic for the kitchen. Food comes out very fast. Their dumplings and their pancakes tend to come out after the noodles as it takes longer to cook, but still fast considering the circumstances. Place is clean, and you can tell they put thought into designing this noodle bar. I appreciate the small things such as using mason jars as cups instead of the typical plastic/glass cups. 

As for service, I have nothing bad to say about it. They do their job. They check on you maybe once during your meal which is fine for me. I don't have to say constantly say "I'm good" while I'm chewing my food. Plus, the place is small, so it's easy to flag them down if you need anything. 

Being a fan of noodles, there's no doubt I am a fan of this place.
