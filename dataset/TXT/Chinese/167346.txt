The 3 cup chicken never misses with tender chunks of meat fried over the flame and perfectly seasoned. Served with rice and a large helping of pickled tomatoes and peppers. Pizza specials are often unique and always yummy. Thin crust with bacon and spinach is a favorite. Bar seats at the back allow a birdseye view of the cooking.  It's like entertainment at no cost!
