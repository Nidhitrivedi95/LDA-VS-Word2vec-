We tasted the chicken chow mein (HK style), salt and pepper calamari (the best in Vegas), Chiu Chow dumplings (very yummy! don't often find Chiu Chow food in the U.S.) and bean curd skin rolls....all so VERY good. The staff was attentive. While it seems like slow service I call it relaxed and the wait was worth it because the food was made to order and so fresh!  Oh yes, don't forget the sesame balls. We ate the lotus seed filled one and they were so good we took home an order of red bean filled sesame balls! We will definitely return; it is more convenient than driving into Chinatown (cuz I'm lazy!)
