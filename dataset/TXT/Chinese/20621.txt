6_KCUxu2kOgP-pRnSNXG8Q My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place at the Palace Station when I found out that our original destination, The Oyster Bar, is only 21 and up plus a long wait. I like that this place is open late, or else we woulda had no where else to go, walking distance at least. 
The food was actually pretty good and very inexpensive. They had a late night menu for 4.99 per entree. My boyfriend and I had the chow mein, kung pao chicken, and hot & sour soup. They all tasted very authentic. In my opinion, I think people are being too harsh on this place, especially about their service. But really, at a Chinese restaurant, you should never expect good service. That's just the way it is. Although, at least the food comes out quick and makes up for it.
