OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Well, had lunch here Sunday, and it was fine.  I think the offerings from one dim sum restaurant to the next are generally the same (har gow, siu mai, pai gut, fung zao, et al), with the probability of the cooks in the back wanting to make a dish other restaurants don't have, which is a good thing for competition.

I got in around 10:45-ish and was immediately seated, asked what beverage(s) I wanted and started to order away.  I notice the siu mai skin was thinner here than at Harbor Palace; for me that's neither good nor bad, just a difference.  The one thing I should have ordered but didn't was the you tiao ("Chinese doughnuts") that are served with jook.  It's, what, a foot of dough fried until golden brown and delicious?  I wasn't getting any jook, and I haven't had you tiao for ages.  At least I know where I can get some quick, since I live down the road from them.

I like the ambiance/feel of the place; it's a more subdued feel, and more "modern," as opposed to HP, which I know has been in operation since at least 2002, when I first went there.  (Not to bash anyone, but in time the luster and sheen of Chang's will fade, too.)  I guess the owners wanted that pavilion vibe, which I can totally dig.  Unfortunately, the windows look out onto the parking lot outside; but, I still give them credit.  And, it was good to see that not only were the typical Asians there, but also whites and blacks, which always helps demystifying the culture.

I'm going to give Chang's the same rating as HP, because I feel the food and service were equally the same.  Chang's is a good place that's not too far from the Strip and serving the locals.
