3j_mvJHnT7nJd7su_7zazw 5am dumpling soup with a side of kimchi and broccoli? Yes please! Prices were high but my soup was wonderful and my friend's sushi roll was raved about. Our waitress was sweet and accommodating. I am a big sauce person and when I requested chili sauce I was brought a saucer of sriracha, some sesame oil, pineapple sweet and sour sauce and hot chili oil. That food cured the hangover before it even started!
