O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw Rol San is amazing for dim sum at any time of the day (all-day dim sum rocks)! The pricing is fair, and dishes are always proportionate and tasty!

I frequent this place pretty often since I live close by. It looks like a dingy little place, I won't lie... I discovered this place when my friend and I were desperate for some dim sum late in the day and we just randomly chose Rol San because of the giant all-day dim sum sign. But I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, despite the exterior of this place. If you're looking for good, cheap dim sum, this is the place for you!

I haven't tried any of the dishes here other than the dim sum so I can't really comment much on other dishes that they have.

My favs:
Har Gow
Sui Mai
Deep Fried Taro with Pork and Crab
Chicken Feet
Short ribs
