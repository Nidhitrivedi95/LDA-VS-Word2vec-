8f9Tl2gq78wqjtrToOTo7A Price is a bit more expensive than other Hong Kong Style Cafe.  I usually came here for a breakfast combo or an afternoon tea combo.  I really like their HK style milk tea, French Toast (with peanut butter), and Deep Fried Octopus.

This location is bigger than other locations, and recently I came here for a group of 20+ people.  I'm glad that they take my reservation.  They also assign a waitress for us, as we have many non-Chinese in our group.

Their desserts are very nice, and it's good to share with a group or between couple :-D 

I'll give 4 stars if this place is not pricey...
