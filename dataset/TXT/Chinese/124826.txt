ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ This is one of my favorite places to eat dimsum at.  You know it's fancy Chinese when they use real table cloth in instead of plastic! Actually, is quite nice inside. But the food is really good. I usually come here on the weekends, first thing when I wake up. They open at 9am, and to me that's when dimsum is supposed to be consumed. At some point in the morning, they will get packed, and I'm not sure when, because I always try to beat the crowd.

The pumpkin congee is my favorite dish here. It's XL though, so beware of that when ordering. I also really like their zen dumplings. Those are the two things I always get, and then I try a bunch of their other stuffs. All are excellent.
