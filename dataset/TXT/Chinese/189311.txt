yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA thanks for the tip, yelp!

nice decor (especially impressive for a pho restaurant!), open 24 hrs, and, most importantly, yummy pho (tasty, rich broth, perfectly chewy noodles, fresh veggies). this place was so good my vietnamese mom, who is a pho expert, expressed her approval!

other non-pho dishes were waay too oily. the noodle dish we ordered was shiny and there was a pool of oil at the bottom of the plate... and the chinese donuts were overly crunchy, missing that slightly sweet and chewy flavor that i love, and also dripping with oil. 

i'd definitely go back for the pho, but would probably discourage being too adventurous with their other menu offerings :)
