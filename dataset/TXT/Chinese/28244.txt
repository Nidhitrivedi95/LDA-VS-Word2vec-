They have a relatively small menu which I personally like since I'm indecisive and it makes choosing a lot easier. I ordered their Braised Beef Noodle ($7.99) with regular round noodles. Their noodles were nice and chewy. Some of the braised beef were too fatty for my liking but other than that, it was a good dish. 

Tip: they accept cash and debit only, no credit.
