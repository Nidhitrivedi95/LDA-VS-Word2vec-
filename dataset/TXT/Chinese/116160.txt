n5jTCFF6LqNIAz6Jx5-3tw Pretty good portion sizes!!! Ordered Thai coconut curry and the dynamite chicken. Both ordered with brown rice....tons of rice!!! Not usually a complaint but actually it really was just too much rice.  Dishes were tasty but the Thai curry was really spicy. They did not ask a spice level so I assume this is the normal spicy, if you don't like it spicy you should say "mild".  They need better drink selections as far as sodas....but they do have flavored teas like chai latte.
