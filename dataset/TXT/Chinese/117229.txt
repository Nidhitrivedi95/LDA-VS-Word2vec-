Fresh ingredients in true flavourful soup base, I opted for the Golden Vinegar noodles ($10.99), an appetizing sour taste that ends with a hefty spicy bite; admittedly too spicy for me to handle. Along with the soup comes an assortment of vegetables, ham, 1 chicken wing, 3 slices of raw pork, and a bowl of noodles to be mixed into your soup base. 

The Steamed Chicken with chili sauce ($6.99) as a starter was delightful.  The flavour and spice level was on point.  Spicy and savoury without the scorching torture as experienced from the Golden Vinegar noodle. This dish alone warrants a recommendation of this neat  authentic lil restaurant.
