jkQpuxSySj1APnZ5AR8Sdw Tasty's has one of the greatest lunch deals in Toronto.

For $6.73 you get a soup, spring roll, main dish and rice/noodles. This is great value for the amount of food you get.

Why I give this two stars is because the ownership of the restaurant recently changed, and with it went a change in the hot and sour soup recipe, which used to be the best in the city. It is, as expected, a greasy msg filled meal, but the greatness of the hot and sour soup made this deal 5 star. 

I hope they bring back the original hot and sour soup.
