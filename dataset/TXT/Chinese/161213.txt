The  Crab Rangoons are served with a chilli sauce which only adds to the spice inside the rangoon. 

Servings are large and filling. The Egg Foo Yung is the BEST I have tasted anywhere in Las Vegas. The Eggplant Delight is a wonder! Thick pieces of Eggplant and vegetables.

Lastly, the service is attentive and sincere. If you aren't eating here you are missing out.
