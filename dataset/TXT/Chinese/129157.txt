pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I've been to Sushi Samba twice now and it is now, one of my favorite sushi/brazilian fusion joints in Las Vegas. 

The first time, we splurged on a 9-course omakase that included kobe beef cooked on a rock and various delicious & well-crafted dishes. As a sushi lover, I only eat fresh, perfectly cut fish and Sushi samba has this side down.  I also LOVE their children's menu which includes the cutest bento boxes. Both salmon & chicken are good and its arrangement of fruit skewers and ice cream sundae topped with krackle pop candy (?) is amazing. My family love to dine out with kids and this place by far, has the best children's menu for reasonable price.

The second time we got the sushi/sashimi boat and three-meat dish. Meat was good and sauces were once again, excellent. I really enjoy sushi/brazilian fusion because it nicely satisfies my entire palette. 

Mango mojito was good and reasonably priced but I made a mistake of letting the waiter choose our bottle of sake which turned out to be nearly $125 per bottle. Sake was very smooth but our entire meal came out to over $500 which I believe, is too high for fusion/sushi. But again, the Kobe beef and excellent sake made up for the price but next time, I'll be more careful when letting them choose my drink. 

Overall, Sushi samba is a great joint if you want to enjoy a night out with friends and family with good sushi & unique fusion dishes. However, be prepared to spend some $$ or you might be unpleasantly surprised. :)
