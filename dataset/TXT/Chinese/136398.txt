qgEKyJfuL5LBA6D3V9nR9g My love for <U+5C0F><U+7C60><U+5305> continues ... so we need to keep find new places with good <U+5C0F><U+7C60><U+5305> to eat. We tried this restaurant tonight here in Scarborough, it is suppose to be the sister restaurant of <U+9F0E><U+6CF0><U+8C50> in Markham. The restaurant was big and spacious, not like the typical Chinese restaurants where the pack all the space with seats, lots of room between the tables.

We ordered a few dishes: <U+5C0F><U+7C60><U+5305> (Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings) -  very juicy, thin dumpling wrapping. <U+5143><U+76C5><U+96DE><U+6E6F> Double Boiled Chicken Soup - clear chicken broth, the noodles were very chewy. <U+64D4><U+64D4><U+9EB5> (Dan dan noodles) - it was not spicy, but fill with peanut sauce, the same noodles as the other noodle dish, very chewy. <U+725B><U+8089><U+997C> (fried beef pancake) - steaming hot, juicy on the inside. <U+8C46><U+6C99><U+9505><U+997C> (Red bean pancake) - hot off the fryer, crispy on the outside, but needs more red bean paste inside.

Overall, the food quality is pretty good on the dishes that we got. I like it better than <U+9F0E><U+6CF0><U+8C50> for sure. Seating is more comfortable so that might made the meal more enjoyable. Let's see if this quality would keep up overtime.
