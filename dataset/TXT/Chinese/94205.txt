JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A Really great noodles, all of the side dishes were somewhat spicy, but we tried all of them. I already have my nest dish chosen for my next visit and will take someone new so we can also order the seafood pancake. Hostess was very helpful and even cut up the meat off the bones  of the beef soup that I ordered.
