5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ While staying at Aria we tried Blossom restaurant since I was craving for Chinese food.

I was in heaven as we entered , the smells were like home for me and brought back childhood memories of the Resturant I went to in San Francisco as a little girl. 

There were just the two of us and unfortunately needed a few more people to order the Peking or roast duck...we ended up ordering Choy sum, chicken mushroom clay pot and Singapore curry noodles. The dishes were amazing and we enjoyed every morsel. We will be back!
