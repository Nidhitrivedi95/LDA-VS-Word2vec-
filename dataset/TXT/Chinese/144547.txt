RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ They have a great selection of bubble tea. I had the black tea and milk, it was over ice. I like iced versions of bubble tea much better than frozen versions. My cousin got a mango bubble tea which was nice and sweet and also over ice. I liked mine so much, I got a second one to go. 

The menu was a little overwhelming. If you are unfamiliar with more authentic thai food, then much of the menu will not make any sense to you. The meals are listed in one line with the name and protein of what the dish it. There is no description to what you are about to order, so it's a little bit of a gamble. 

I ordered chicken over pan-fried noodles. It was very good. The sauce it was in was very tasty, the meat, veggies, and noodles were all cooked very well. Again I wish the menu gave better clues as to the contents of the dishes, and I would have ventured a little further out of the safe zone. 

I would love to go again, but it would be nice to take someone who knows the food so I can get a better recommendation. If nothing else, I will fill up on bubble tea.
