NI75svhUpw1u0ClzrPFPCQ Terrible !! I ordered food online and this is the first & last time I'll order food from this restaurant. I had paid online for this order. The delivery guy came and started asking for cash. When I mentioned I paid online, he said "that's not possible?". Then we spent another 15 mins resolving the issue with the owner. Finally, I thought I'll enjoy my food. I ordered "Chicken Egg Foo Yung". It's a Chinese omelet. The egg was burnt and dark brown in color. There was hardly any chicken in it. I started to eat but it was so bad that I threw it in the trash bag and made my own omelette. Frustrating !!

Please try some other Chinese restaurant. Grand China is not worth the money.
