S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ First time back in about a year.  First time eating in the restaurant versus take-out

Had Banh-mi sandwich.  Still very, very good.  Great bread and vegetables.  Fresh and tasty.  A little light on the meat, but still a great bahn-mi.

The service has declined.  The gal who has been there a while did a good job, but the man working there had very poor customer service skills.  I am in the food service industry, so I know how important it is these days to treat customers right. Granted, the three servers and apparently one cook appeared very busy, but it was not a full house.  Poor customer service will definitely cost you repeat customers. 

The dining room is not clean (dirty floor, stacked papers, semi-clean restroom).

I used to make a special trip there for the bahn-mi, but I think those days are over (mainly due to poor customer service). 

Best idea:  Order at the counter, pay, leave, enjoy your food at home or in the parking lot.
