0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA I was having a frustrating day at work and couldn't care less about getting back to work late from lunch.  Pho had been on my mind heavily at that time, and I decided to indulge.  I read up on some places in Chandler, and this was the closest one to the job.
This was a while back, but from what I can remember, the pho was good-not the best-but good.  They gave me all the fixins, the broth was just right, meat was tender, and the noodles were cooked just so.  
The service was...interesting.  I won't say its bad, its just very non-chalant.  Kinda breezy.  I'll leave it at that.  And since service is so important to me, I had to give the place 3 stars.  
The decor and actual building don't garner a comment from me.  I couldn't see anything anyway after the steam from my pho clouded my glasses up.  
What can I say?  I went there for pho and got satisfied.  Not the best I had, but it hit the spot.  The menu looked like it had some awesome stuff on it though, however the prices aren't the greatest.  Honestly, I should try this place again and review it afterwards.  One visit won't give you the full flavor of any place, and this one seems like it has more to offer than what I required from it.
Give it a try.
