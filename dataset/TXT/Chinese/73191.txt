FIs33y1BVzzcfrDDHh8O5g What a wonderful surprise to stumble upon this Gem of a restaurant.

When in Las Vegas, one thinks of the big casinos and fancy restaurants. I had a friend tell me 35 years ago...the real Las Vegas isn't on the strip...venture out. That advice still rings true today...

This restaurant is perhaps one of many Thai restaurants in the area, but this is a real gem...family owned small business with roots from Thailand...

They have a quite diverse list of menu items...certainly there is something for just about everyone. Tonight I needed some good hot soup and perhaps a small something...I chose the Tum Yum Goong Soup and Chicken Larb...my goidness, all the flavors...remarkable.

Experience something wonderful, off and away from the strip...authentic Thai, from a Thai family...doing what they love doing...sharing culinary masterpieces...!!!
