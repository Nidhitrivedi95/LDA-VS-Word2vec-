eOvNqnu9CZDCHe26sqj7bw This place is super cheap.  The combo comes with rice even when dining in!  I don't recall other places allow this.  And the combo is cheap, too.  $14 for a dinner for 2.  If you deduct $3 for the 2 bowls of rice, the 2 dishes only cost $11.  In terms of food quality, you have to be willing to accept lower quality ingredients due to the prices.  Certain dishes taste better than others.  For example, the free range chicken (half chicken) and stir fried vegetable with chicken slices are quite good, honestly.  Portion is okay.  

Service is simple but sufficient.  Place is clean enough.  Honestly, I don't expect much at this price point, as long as the waiters are not rude.

I will be happy to return for a simple, inexpensive dinner.  Sometimes, home style, comfort Chinese food is all I feel like having.
