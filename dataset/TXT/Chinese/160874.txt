UC2dfjZg8mrRh10maovQfw Best place for dim sum in Scarborough, morning tea between 9-11am are exceptional value, staff is super friendly. Their fried noodles and rice dishes are of huge proportion, definitely good value, dinner is also very good, love their king crab dinner, ample parking and good service is why this restaurant is my regular spot.
