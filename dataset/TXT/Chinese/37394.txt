anGYRueZJKYCJefKFccfjA AYCE dinner was 17.99 for adults and 9.99 for kids, which was a decent price tag for the amount of food you get. 
However, the freshness and quality of the food was questionable, maybe it is because I went for Hotpot in the summer( I know, who does that right?), but the veggies were definitely going bad. 
There were only two tables in the entire restaurant for the 1.5 hrs I was there, and service was not extremely prompt. 

Yeah, not my favourite place, but cheap compared to other AYCE I guess.
