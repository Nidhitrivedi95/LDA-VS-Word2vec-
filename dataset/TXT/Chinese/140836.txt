raHgmWxE8AVSivo92GX5Wg I first discovered the sister company to this one in Kensington market (King's Cafe).  My wife is vegan, so it's never easy finding a spot for her to eat. But, King's Cafe was fantastic.

When I realized Zen Garden was exactly the same but only a 5 minute drive from where I work I was so excited.

Since then, I've been coming here almost daily for lunch takeout.  I've tried almost all of their lunch combo meals and not only is it super filling, but it's so well priced.

For those that want healthy food, vegan food, fantastic homemade iced tea and other great stuff at a fantastic price - you have to check this place out!

Plus, the energy and staff here are so peaceful.
