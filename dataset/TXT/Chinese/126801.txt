P6SBB1EPVJ6VwVnxuY0mww The second of the 2 Edinburgh branches of Jimmy Chung's (the other is on Waverley Bridge), this place pretty much does what it says on the tin: all-you-can-eat chinese food for a fixed price. 

And it does it well.

It's not the fanciest restaurant in Edinburgh, but then it doesn't pretend to be - that's why it's works so well. The price varies depending whether you go on a weekend, or whether for lunch or dinner; I went on a weekday for lunch and paid just £6.99 for the whole thing.

The buffet includes starters (such as sesame toast, sticky ribs and various soups), more main courses than you could ever sample (including chicken satay, chicken in black bean sauce and egg foo yung), various noodle and rice dishes and even desserts (the best of which are definitely the banana fritters served with sweet syrup).

There is a salad bar, but in all honesty this isn't the place to go if you're watching your figure. All dishes are clearly labelled, including any allergens and spice level where appropriate.

My only criticism would be how over-priced the drinks are (£3.80 for a small glass of barely-drinkable wine), but on the other hand the staff are more than happy to serve you tap water without complaining or getting offended.

Ideal for when you need to fill your boots for a little money as possible.
