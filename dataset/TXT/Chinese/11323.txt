2gDHQELrlq3jVuZZfJeWUg Really good! Cute decor, delicious food, reasonably priced. We had boiled pork and chive dumplings, hot and sour soup, cucumber salad and a chive and pork pocket. Everything was good, the dumplings fat and juicy and the cucumber salad crunchy and favourful. The only minor complaint was that it was a bit hot inside - either they don't have AC or it isn't very strong. It wasn't a very hot day so I could see this being a problem in warmer weather. (There is a cute patio space, but it isn't open yet as their licence hasn't come through.) Service was a bit frazzled, but the food was so good that I will definitely be back!
