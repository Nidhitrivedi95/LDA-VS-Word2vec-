mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ I don't know why a previous review said this place was expensive because even my Asian mom said this place is cheaper than the other places and that's always good if you're not eating your wallet empty. 

First thing that came is the gluten puff in shanghai style. It showed a picture in the menu and it came a lot smaller in real life. It tastes very good, tons of flavor coming through, especially the star anise. Just a tad bit on the salty side. Dish comes cold. This dish also comes with PEANUTS. 

The second dish that came is the shanghai style braised duck. Also very tasty. It comes cold which results in firmer meat but it's fine. 

Third dish that came was the pickled green mustard and pork pan fried rice cake which was extremely salty. Server also forgot to give us a spoon with this dish. It also came with a few pieces of pork. You have to balance the greens and the rice cake or else it's really a mouth full of salt.

The last thing we ordered I am still waiting for 30 minutes after the last dish came  - the shanghai dumplings also with peanuts. I think they forgot our order. We finished all of our previous dishes and it still had not come out. These dumplings are a little bit more doughy than I am used to. Meat inside is good, tons of soup inside despite the deflated look.
