x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg Ordered take out once. I don't even want to go to the restaurant after tasting their food. I'm Chinese. My friends are Chinese, and they have ordering take out from time to time. However, I don't feel like their food is legit. The taste can't be worse. It has been modified so that most of people can accept it. Won't go there if I want to have real traditional Asian food.
