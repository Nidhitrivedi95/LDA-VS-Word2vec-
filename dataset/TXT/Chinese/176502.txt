wOmtCPiB-xeU-HknjTW4hQ First time here. Went for lunch right a 11am. First customers of the day.  I say that because service started off slow but became more attentive as others came inand they got their groove.  
We had the lunch specials. Beef and broccoli and Mongolian beef. Both plates were well filled for lunch specials.  Both came with egg drop soup and dry noodles and sauce. The platters came with cooked noodles and rice.  Very filling.
Overall taste and satisfying. Nothing outstanding but a decent neighborhood Chinese sits down place. Better than others in the area for the price.
