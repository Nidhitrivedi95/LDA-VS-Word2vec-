VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Food was not that great, kind of greasy. Container only 3/4 full. Even the soup - I bought the large quart size and received just over half full. Cost was expensive, VERY expensive if you take into consideration none of the containers were full. Egg rolls and spring rolls more dough than filling and extremely greasy.
