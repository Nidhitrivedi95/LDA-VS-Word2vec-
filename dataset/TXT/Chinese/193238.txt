ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Yahoo for the Clever Koi!  I come to Phoenix all the time for work, and I try to find local gems whenever I visit.  And this was a score.  

I'm pretty sure a good part of my positive experience had to do with alcohol.  Let's face it, it usually does.   I decided to go for a classic Old Fashioned, and then another, and then another.   What can I say? Whatever they were doing behind the bar was working because they were delish!

Since I was drinking enough carbs, I decided to eat carbless, so I ordered some lettuce cups and wok roasted brussel sprouts.   (I also had a bite of a pork belly bun - holy cow yum).  Although it seems like I ordered the most boring items on the menu, everything I tried was outstanding and full of flavor.  I did not feel like I was skimping out on anything.

The service was very good.  Young, hip, casual guys checking in on us periodically but not overbearing.   

The atmosphere is very modern and trendy which is perfect for this kind of place.   It's small so I imagine there can be a big wait at times.

This may become a new regular spot for upcoming trips to Phoenix!
