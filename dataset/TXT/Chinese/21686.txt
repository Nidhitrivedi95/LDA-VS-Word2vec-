6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q Yes, the restaurant is at a strip hotel.  Yes, most people know that you can get more value for your dollar if you go down to the multitude of restaurants on Spring Mountain Rd.  But, if you are at the Wynn this is an very good alternative.  Yes, there are no reservations but aside from the Buffet, Terrace Point Cafe (open 24hrs), ZooZaCrackers (deli) where will you dine at the Wynn without blocking off 1.5-2 hours for your meal.  Once you look at the menu one can see that Red 8 is a cornucopia of asian food ranging from Malaysian (the chef is Malay), Chinese, Thai.  There is a small selection of dim sum that is very good.  The highlights of the menu (in my opinion) is the dim sum, Oxtail Soup, Malaysian Beef/Chicken Satay, Malaysian Spicy Fried Rice with Prawn Crackers & Mango Chutney, Roast Duck & Roast Pork Combo, Chilean Sea Bass Salt & Pepper Style, and Coconut Pudding for Desert.  
There are other great dishes.  Ask the staff what the chef would send to his friends.  Also, it appears to me that many dishes have a kick so if you do not like items too spicy I would let the staff know when you order.
Again, you will be paying strip prices but if you do not have reservations at other restaurants Red 8 is a good alternative unless you want to eat the cafe or deli.  
Also, Red 8 is open until 11pm on Sun-Thurs and 1am or Fri/Sat.
Enjoy.

Update 12/16/07:  I heard the executive chef is leaving for another restaurant.
