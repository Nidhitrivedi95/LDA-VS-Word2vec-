zRGCIIez1z4ve5Hppa7eVQ Really enjoyed the food here. I tend to stay away from Asian cuisines other then sushi because of the lack of veggie options ( or if something is veggie, it has a a meat broth in it). But they had a pretty solid amount of choices. The food was prepared very quickly and tasted great! It was really cheap to eat there. It seems like a lot of people do take-out rather then sit-down. I did the take-out there once and is was prepared right on time. 

Definitely give this place a try; good food, prices and really quick.
