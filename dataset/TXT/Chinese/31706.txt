9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw We went here for our engagement dinner with our family. It was BUSY for a Wednesday night and parking...well let's just say there isn't that many parking spaces available. For a party of 13, we were stuck in the corner closest to the door. Every time someone opened the door a gust of cold air would come in or the smell of cigarette smoke. YUCK! This was when it was raining for a couple days straight. Luckily, my brothers and sister are tiny, because putting them 4 in the chairs closest to the wall worked out. No average size adult would be able to fit....yes that is how crammed we were. 
In typical Chinese fashion, there was Lobster, Red Trout, Fried Flounder, Chicken, Beef and a lot of veggies. I felt that everything was just ok. Nothing too special and they had messed up one of the kids orders. I believe my Grandma liked it for the most part and that's all that mattered to me. Overall, I do prefer other places, but I won't be against coming back here again as long as I'm not sitting next to the door when its freezing outside.
