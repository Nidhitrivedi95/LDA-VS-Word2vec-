0oSWfLMJZnl2HhOc2lQb2g I love this place. It beats Li's and Panda Express hands down. They are always friendly, the food is always fresh, and if they haven't made something I love they whip it right up for me. They also have a fantastic Tofu Kung Pao that you can order ahead and pick up that is delicious! And the portion sizes for their combos are huge. Also the soup is an incredible deal and the Hot and Sour is always spot on!
