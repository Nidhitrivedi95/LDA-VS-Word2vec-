I typically order one of the same three things every time I get in the mood for Chinese take out:  General Tsao, Chicken and Broccoli, or Triple Delight.    I LOVE their General Tsao, it is spicy but not overly and I think the sauce is the perfect amount of thickness.    I tend to go for noodles instead of rice, but do enjoy their steamed or fried rice.

The girl on the phone knows me (by my phone number) and usually asks me which of my staple three entrees I preferred that night.  That alone adds a brownie point.

The food is prepared quick and steaming hot - I typically let it sit on my counter for 10-15 minutes before even attempting to eat the steaming goodness.

I recommend this place as a quick take out spot if you are in the mood for delicious, fresh and fast Chinese (americanized) food.
