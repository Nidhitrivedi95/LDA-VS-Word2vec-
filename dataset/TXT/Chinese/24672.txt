6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ 3.5 Do you like places like Guu but have a young one like I do?  Donburi might be the place for you.  More after the jump.

Pros:
Good for families
Lot's of "Japas"
Friendly service
Old school anime on the TV's!!

Cons:
Portions could be better
Nothing totally amazing

Donburi in my opinion is basically a family friendly version of Guu.  Same kind of food but in a more relaxed setting.  You can easily bring a baby during the day without any trouble.    

Donburi has a lot of rice bowls to choose from.  It's their specialty I suppose.  There are some udon bowls but rice bowls are the mains here.  Beyond that, they have a ton of Japas which are basically Japanese Tapas, clever eh?  They have a wide range to choose from.  

We ordered the Oyakodon and the Katsudon.  Each rice bowl comes with miso soup and salad.  The Japas we ordered were the Takoyaki and Agedashi Tofu.  The food came out quickly which is always nice.  Here's the thing for me, I wasn't overwhelmed or disappointed.  It was basically OK for me.  It's not an overall bad thing but it will be hard to justify coming back again, that's all.

The service was very good though.  The staff were nice and friendly.  We needed an extra bowl for the baby.  When I asked, the waitress knew it was for the baby herself.  She looked around for bowls and ended up going to the back to find a baby friendly bowl.  She even washed it herself which was super nice of her. Extra point for that.

Also. they have two flat screen TV's on the wall.  One is playing what I presume to be K or J dramas.  I don't watch either so I don't know.  The other plays anime which I don know.  It was playing Gundam Wing episodes while I was there which is super cool.  

So yeah, If you're craving Japanese this is a nice place to go to.  I'm still on the fence about going back myself.  It will be a good experience though, so give it a whirl if you're in the area.
