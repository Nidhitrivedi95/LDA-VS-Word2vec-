yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA i dont know what that last person was eating but, this place was inexpensive and good. the bad thing was the service. i eat once a week and always manage to spend less than 20.

the bad service: i asked for a half taro and half mango smoothie drink to be mixed. 3 different people came over to tell me that "its no good."

 im like what do you mean "no good" im asking for it. then a fourth person came to my table to tell me "taro mango does not taste good." 

im like who are you to tell me what amuses my palate. so i asked for 1 mango smoothie and 1 taro. so i stood in the middle of the restaurant and got most peoples attention. i grabbed both the drinks in my hand and attempted to mix it and spoke out loud... 

" EVERY EMPLOYEE TOLD ME I COULDNT HAVE THIS MIXED BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME IT WOULDNT TASTE GOOD" 
after mixing it and tasting in front of a disturbed audience i said

"THIS IS THE BEST MUTHAFUKN DRANK I HAVE EVER TASTED. TARO MANGO MIX. MMMMM! DONT EVER TELL ME WHAT I CAN AND CANNOT MIX STUPID DUMASSES"

what an experience that was for me and everyone else in the restuarant...
