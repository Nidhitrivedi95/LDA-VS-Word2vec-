uVzcDI3s3oFb1wzDDar0mQ Had the original waffle with two scoops of ice cream ( green tea and vanilla) with a drizzle of condensed milk, blueberry and some skittles...i dont know why i picked skittles but dont do that its way too sweet and doesn't go with the entire desert at all! Just take what i took without the skittles..pick chocolate or anything else would be fine. I waited 20 minutes before getting my order. I was watching the girl do the waffles. I dont understand what takes her so long! The lady before me only ordered a plain waffle without ice cream and i was watching the girl making 5-6 waffles one after another after 10 minutes she kept making more waffles until the guy at the cash just turned around and gave a waffle to the poor lady who was just waiting for nothing... was not very efficient in managing time.  I finally got my waffle 20 minutes later.. it was good but not amazing and i felt a little ripped off because it is expansive for 9$ for what it is... wanted to try for fun but regretted the wait. i went in with no line up so imagine when there is one... you better be prepared or plan to wait a while.
