nMo0ozHO7cqsPaxw_7N6ow For Charlotte, it's the best dim sum restaurant in town. The food is fresh, very tasty, and it's a relatively authentic experience. If we're comparing to dim sum restaurants in other cities, it would only get 3 stars. The reason is because the food does not come on carts with heating elements. Truly authentic dim sum restaurants actually cook/steam the foods directly on the carts. So it mostly translates to the temperature of the food and crispiness of the fried items. But if you're in Charlotte and want some dim sum, this is as good as it gets and it's still a very good experience, just don't expect it to be as good as you might find elsewhere in the country.
