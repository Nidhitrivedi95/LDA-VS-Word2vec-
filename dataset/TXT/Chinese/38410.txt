AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Great overall.  
  My partner, my daughter, and I shared a smoked 'fish' appetizer.  Tofu based.  Amazing texture and flavor.  We ordered the Beef and Broccoli, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and the General Tso.  Both the 'chicken' dishes were incredible!  Haven't ever had such spot on vegan chicken.  We were impressed.  The Beef and Broccoli I wouldn't order again.  It was alright, the 'beef' was really soft and chewy.  I believe it was seitan based but I like mine slightly more firm.  
  Our service was friendly and polite.  Everything is 100% vegan unless you choose to add egg to certain dishes.  Feel like they could do without that option for vegan sanity haha.  Generous portions.  
  We will be back.
