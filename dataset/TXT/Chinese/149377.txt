sppmLnZKcbQ6cR2JIFL84g Ordered a VEGETABLE spring roll & fried rice. Got up to my room, took a bite, looked inside the roll and noticed a MEATY SUBSTANCE. Thank goodness I was sober enough to realize so I could spit out the gross pink goo before I swallowed. I've been vegetarian for over 10 years. It was horrible!!! Even if I ate meat it I wouldn't recommend whatever was inside that thing- it was gooey, pink and unrecognizable. Totally gross.
