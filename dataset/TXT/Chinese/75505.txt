fZadRslL_7WwgZfVD6DYnw We've been going here since I've been born, about 30 years. The family running the restaurant are incredibly friendly and feel like family. We've been there many times for lunch, dinner, and sometimes as a reception for special occasions. The food is fantastic and pretty authentic. They have terrific tea, thin noodles for wanton soup (which isn't too normal for this area), and a pretty mouth watering menu. They have a bar, and a decent selection of domestic bottles. Prices are pretty decent and portions are big!
