3hADadIy062NvzG2426vRA I'm so surprised that in the same restaurant,people speaking different language can get such different services. The Chinese waitress will ask every people if they want a more quiet seat except us, which makes me feel very uncomfortable. The way they 'served' us is just like throw us to the seat and ask what do you want. The most terrible thing Is that when we paid the bill with VISA card, they said they are gonna charging us for 2.5% card commission fee. Though I don't know a lot about the pos machines and card company, NO OTHER RESTAURANT DID THAT!!!! That is not only mean, but also unfair. 
That is my personal experience in this 'rainbow arch'. And it totally ruin my Edinburgh traveling day.     -_-#
