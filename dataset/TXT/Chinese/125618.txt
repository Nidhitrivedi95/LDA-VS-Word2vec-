Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w I love Asian food but there is definitely a lack of buffets with good food, that is clean, and has good service...so I usually stick to Brazilian buffets like Chima or Amor de Brazil.

I only come to Tin Tin for the unlimited crab legs because it is always stocked,  hot, and doesn't taste frost bitten. The other foods worth mentioning are the steam buns with duck and fried salted shrimp. Other than that, I don't really like the other items.

Also, I don't know what is is about the waitstaff here but they always look depressed.  Kinda hard to enjoy your meal with that face staring at you.

All in all, I'll always come back because the crab legs are on point! Roughly $25 is not all that bad for what you get.
