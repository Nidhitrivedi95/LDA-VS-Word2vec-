O7_rXHN_-cFp0TgiMaNulw we stopped by today evening ( Saturday) and came in at 7:40 pm had to wait 25 min. Seating is limited so if ypu are in a rush I suggest to avoid the prime Saturday night. The  hostess when she took our name for the waiting list told us 15 min or less.

once we finally sat down after a long wait, We were ready to order and the server was " Chelsea". She seemed friendly and when I asked for Hot & Sour soup she said its available although its not on the menu ( Not sure why ?).

I ordered Singapore Noodle, and this is where my biggest diappointment was.. This was our first visit to this restaurant. The srver did not ask or checked if we want to try any of their sauces.. I overheard the name of the sauces the other server recite them to the table next to us. When our server finally showed up to check on us, I asked her about the sauces she said yes they have then and if I want to try them ? 

why couldnt the server Chelsea  offer those sauces when the ,meal was served particularly when we never have been there before was perplxing.

That is the reason I asked her to subtly point  out that she forgot to offer the sauces which I could have tried it on my Singapore noodle which was dry...

Also nobody refilled our water even once.. Also our entrees were served when we we had just started our soups. Typically the etiquette is that you do not seve the main course until the soup/ appetizers are finished...

we felt rushed overall by the server and the service was lacking..

The only saving grace - Quality of the food which was above average
