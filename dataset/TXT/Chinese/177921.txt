wZvSsHFU0NdyQ03625kh6g As other reviews mention, this Capital Seafood is split in half.  The left side is Vietnamese food and the right side is Chinese.  I've eaten at both.  I like their pho.  The broth is flavorful and they toss in crispy fried onions on top.  It's good and they put a lot of white meat in their chicken pho.  And the Chinese food on the right is the same I've come to expect from the Capital Seafood locations in So Cal, even though other reviewers say otherwise.  I think it's exactly the same.  The food is really good, although greasy but Chinese food usually is greasy anyway.  I like house special fried rice, garlic eggplant and house-special chicken.  Both restaurants are clean and spacious and the service is pretty standard for an Asian place.
