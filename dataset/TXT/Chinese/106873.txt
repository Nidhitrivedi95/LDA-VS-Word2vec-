l4idpMNjLXY59NI9np-JOQ I like this place simply because it is oddly placed and very underrated. 
I also love the fact that they are open late, at least from what I remember! Until 2am, I believe.
My boyfriend and I used to frequent this place so much in the late night, that the the cook, who doesn't speak much English, actually recognized us the last time we were there and gave us a free ice cream dessert!! It was especially sweet of him to do that!

The food is always very good! I can't say if it is authentic or not, but the flavors are just right! I would definitely recommend the spicy eggplant, and the spinach and garlic. The fried rice and noodles are not bad, either!

Decent prices and decent service! They're alright with me!
