hnm3Gmoi3AdL_REsKupgOA This is a restaurant where it's all about the food. The menu may have a few spelling mistakes, some of the food isn't what you'd find on other restaurants menus and that's its appeal. They still do mainstream food but hey why not try something different?

The staff are very welcoming, food to table time is about 15 mins and service is good. The decor isn't amazing but as I say this restaurant is all about the food. Go now, you won't regret it!
