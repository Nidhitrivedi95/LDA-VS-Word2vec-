K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw I am going to be here every day they open.

I stumbled upon this place and I know it doesn't look like much from the outside - but the food is hands down amazing.

The parking lot is a battle zone where the objective is to get a parking spot without hitting people that honestly walk without looking both ways OR ramming into cars that back out without looking.  

The food here is 100% (emoji).  I had the laksa curry and char something.

The laksa curry + vermicelli is around $8 and fills you up for the rest of the day.  It has bean puffs, fish balls, and chicken.  There is no curry powder that clumps up and messes up the dish.  This is hands down my fave fave fave fave.  

The char noodles is similar to beef flat noodles at Chinese restaurants but has a less oily quality.  They mix it with egg noodle and the texture is golden.  My boyfriend destroyed this dish before I really had a chance to eat more than 2 bites.

The only down part is the waiting time - but just order ahead and by the time you get there it'll be ready :)

CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THEY OPEN FOR THIS WEEK.
