vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q I love me sum Dim sum! Haha, but seriously, all my Yelp followers know that I'm a big fan of Ping Pang Pong.  It's my Tuesday tradition, however, I tried for Monday this week and it was PACKED!  So, after reading a few Yelp reviews and the most recent thread on Dim Sum I set off for Chang's.  

Upon approaching the entrance I noticed how empty the parking lot was.  As I got to the door I noticed  a small sign from the Nevada Health District stating Chang's had been closed down due to health violations :(.  With my heart set on Dim Sum I took a friend recommendation of Cathay House.

Cathay House was busy, but managed to seat my party quickly.  The atmosphere was reminiscent of Ping Pang (minus slot machine noise).  The tea brought to the table wasn't to my liking.  The carts came buzzing by and we quickly grabbed:

Ha Gau (Shrimp Dumplings)
Crab Claws
Fried Shrimp Ball
Fried whole Shrimp
Baked Pork over Peanuts

I have to say that everything was good; highlights being the Crab Claws and Fried shrimp.  The Fried shrimp were almost twice as big as Ping Pang and the Crab Claws were bursting with flavor.  Overall, I still like Ping Pang more for the variety and overall quality.  If your on Spring Mountain and you have a taste for Dim Sum, give Cathay House a try.
