egxK8E9T6MWLxJyD_iCIVQ Walked out tonight....entered restaurant...3 employees looked at us and didn't say anything...we stood there long enough to where I thought we might have to seat ourselves....finally a guy said I'll be right with you....ok, I'm fine at this time because they are busy...the problem is when two separate people who came in after us for their take out orders. The guy and another employee started helping them. He again tells us just one minute and will be with us. He then starts making a drink for one of the tables... Somebody else walks in and the staff starts helping him with his takeout. Probably stood there for ten minutes and a total of 3 people and one table who came in after us were helped first. This is why we left and went to another restaurant. That was my first and last time there and I just moved in down the road (4 blocks). First impressions are everything.
