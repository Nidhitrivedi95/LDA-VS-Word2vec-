The owners little daughter was helping bring the food out, she was really fun.  We had the pork chop suey, cashew chicken(delicious white meat) and broccoli beef.  The veggies on the chop suey were fresh, nicely cut and tasty.  I'll be back for sure, as we dig these little mom and pop joints.  Love supporting the local economy.  I thanked the cooks/owners and they really seemed to appreciated it.
