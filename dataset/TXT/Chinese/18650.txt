I am from the east coast, been in Vegas for 3 years. We have a seriously different view of what Chinese food is. This place is really true to east coast style of chinese. 
Like when you order an egg roll, you actually get an egg roll, not a spring roll like everywhere else around here. 

Also the pad thai is better than at any thai place I've tried. The only downside is they charge like $5 for delivery.
