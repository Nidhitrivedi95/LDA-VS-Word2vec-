SmYGe2qXVsP8zXjhwJkNBw Atmosphere: located in a sketchy neighbourhood, the parking lot looks like it about to collapse.....the restaurant itself is upstairs next to a bowling alley 

Food: definitely quantity over quality. They do not stings on sauces, all pots come with plain broth, and from there you make your own soup base and sauce at the counter. There's a choice between beef ayce and seafood. Most if their ingredients are decent, out of 3 plates of beef we got 1 bad one. Does not come with drink, pitchers are 3.99

Overall: debatable if I'll be back, if anything it's because it's so cheap.
