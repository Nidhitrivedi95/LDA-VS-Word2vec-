I'll admit, it took me a few months to get my exact sauce-combination down, and I am disappointed that they do not have the "sriracha hot chili sauce" to put on top (you know the stuff....bright red chile sauce, green lid... has a rooster picture on it..) but I still love this place.

Other reviews are accurate. Staff is amazingly friendly, and they all seem to be family. The food is cooked fast, and you create it yourself to your liking. LOTS of meat choices: beef, pork, turkey, chicken, tofu, shrimp. Fresh veggies and most importantly: cilantro....... LOVE it. 

Side items are delish. Egg rolls and spring rolls for you vegetarians, 2 kinds of soup, a few other things...... but best of all are their fried pastry things. Basically they are really airy doughnut holes, fried and covered in sugar. My god. I would go there just for them. Also when you get your check, there's cute little tasty candies with it. Dinner for two is under $20.
