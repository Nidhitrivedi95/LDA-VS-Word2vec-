hPTx2Y5e4Czbr21XcbDN8g Don't get me wrong, their beef noodle is amazing! But it's the hard-to-find "smelly tofu" is what I come here for. Truth be told, its still not stinky enough. 

It's been awhile since I my last visit more than a year ago. I noticed that they removed the small size order for the smelly tofu from their menu, which doesn't make difference- since I always get the large.
