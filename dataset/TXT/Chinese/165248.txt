uytrX0s6etYPCcMVC07KJw My wife and I visited this restaurant recently, and we will never return. The place was empty, and a short-haired girl was sitting at a table in front. She was the hostess, but didn't have the ambition to get off her chair and seat us. We seated ourselves....then waited probably 5 minutes for this girl to ask for our drink wants. We both ordered coffee, and I take cream. She brought the coffees with some cream for me in a separate container. I poured the cream and it came out in chunks! Entirely spoiled! Our food was good, but the ambience, along with the attitude of the people working there had already convinced us that we would never return. The place wasn't clean by any means either. Do yourself a favor: make the short drive to Good China on Union Hills Rd. near 83rd Ave. Clean, very friendly staff, and great food!
