Q8MGRNuTnaoOG4xzReLpUg Very rarely am I as disappointed as I was tonight.  Poor customer service.  Long wait.  Utensils were thrown on table.  Out of 14 people, only 4 of us got glasses for water.  The food was over priced, low quality, and the servings were small.  Noodles were mushy.  Just disappointed across the board!  Will never go there again.
