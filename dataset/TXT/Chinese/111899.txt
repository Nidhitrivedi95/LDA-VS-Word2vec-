MBK1Ew_P30AD6hFpKHqX6w No no nooooo. My kids wanted to go to a Chinese buffet and since I had a coupon (7$ off buffet w/ another paid buffet) we decided to go. Needless to say, I wish I would've read the reviews on Yelp FIRST. I mean, I do any other time..guess I was just too busy. Well, I regret it! A $28.28 bill down the drain. Mind you- as embarrassed as I am to say--NO TIP. Food was: cold, old and just not very good. Desserts: hard (instead of soft cake) and stale, old fruit and poor selections. The waitress just stood there and stared at us the entire time. She would come over and clear our plates in a timely manner- but that was about the extent of her job. I'm actually surprised they are still open for business. I will never come here again. Nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone. Save your money and go else where! One work: YUCK!
