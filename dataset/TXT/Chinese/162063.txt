ujUEnwAAhfNOe_LMYEFJrw This is my local Chinese takeaway and I've tried a few different dishes from here. They are always packed full of flavour and you get a decent portion, including the meat and vegetables, so not just noodles and sauce for example. Some of their dishes have been a bit on the spicy side for me, although I am a bit of a wuss. Also, some of their dishes have massive chunks of onion and a lot of it, which takes over the flavour and isn't the most pleasant. However, on the whole, I've enjoyed most of my meals from here and is certainly a convenient option. They have an extensive menu and are open quite late. They're always busy, although I've found the service pretty quick if you go in and collect.
