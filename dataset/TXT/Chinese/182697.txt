xjlMlnxWqMd3FGODA_z1NA I freaking love this place! This by far has been my favorite Chinese American food I have favored! I have rated the food from an A to F ratings. My A list has been the Phad Thai Noodles and Kung Pao. The Phad Thai Noodles will fill you up quick! You probably won't be able to finish the whole thing in one seating. They are pretty hot, but the good hot. The egg and shrimp are popping. You can't really get overwhelmed with the mint leaves so that's good. The Kung Pao is just as spicy and the meat is real good.

  I have only one B dish which is the Sungapore Curry Noodles. The noodles just have a great pleasant taste to eat. You just enjoy the taste. My C list is the Phad Kee Meo and New York Style Chow Mein. The Phad has a similar taste to the Phad Thai but without all the spiciness just the flavor. Also the Phad has an up notch taste to those regular fake Chinese places. Every time I go in and make my order it is super fast! And if they take a little longer with your order it's either A they are busy, or they are making it from scratch and are busy so your order is going to be a little hot, but tastier. 

  At least that's how I've seen it. The Wontons are good also crispy. I've had there lunch specials. The rice doesn't feel that much like your chocking on it and the noodles are okay. The boba from here is good also. I think what makes this place soo good is that it has kept a lot of the same cooks from it's grand opening and has kept at least two of the original staff members. It's been four years since it's opened and it has been kicking ass for me since then. One day I wish to try out the restaurant next door to it.

  If you are around the area you should give this place a try. I will keep updating this reviews when I try new dishes from this place.
