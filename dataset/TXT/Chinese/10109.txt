1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I had a late lunch with my husband and 5-yr old son at Big Wong. We read a review in Seven magazine and had to try the crispy shrimp wontons. The wontons were exactly as described - light, crispy, and very flavorful. I had the special deep fried chicken over rice. Very good. My son had the special shrimp wonton soup and Mr. Picky-eater scarfed most of it down. We brought the leftovers home & he just finished off the last of it. My husband had the beef ramen and salt & pepper chicken wings. He proclaimed it all delicious. We split the fresh vegetables in oyster sauce and I have to say, they were perfectly steamed with just the right amount of oyster sauce, not swimming in it. Lastly, I topped it off with the almond pudding. Heavenly with a nice amount of lychees mixed in. 2 appetizers, 3 substantial main courses, 1 side dish enough for all three of us, and dessert came in right at $30. Anywhere else would have run us $50-$70.

The restaurant was small, but very clean and they keep the kitchen open to view, and it was very evident the owners take a lot of pride in keeping things clean and hygienic. The ladies restroom was a pleasant surprise. Very well appointed and very clean. Usually, restrooms in most restaurants can be a bit scary. I say if the owners put this much attention on cleanliness and quality in their restrooms, an area often overlooked by other eating establishments, then they must put even more emphasis on cleanliness in the kitchen and the quality of the food. In this case, I'm right. All through the meal, I heard the chef (owner?) directing the cooks with cautions on not to overcook this, oversteam that, etc... It is clear they take a lot of pride in their business and are committed to delivering quality at prices that are extremely easy on the wallet. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
