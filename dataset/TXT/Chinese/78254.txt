GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Im surprised this place is rated 3 stars. This will definitely be a returning spot for me when I visit Vegas. Dine tonight with family and it was great. Wait wasn't long. Our server Sergio was awesome. He was really detailed and attentive. He also make some delicious drinks. The house special martini (I think that's the name) with the foam salt was amazing. My sister and I order ceviche and it was bomb! The siu mai was perfect. My boyfriend order the steak and he loved it. Of course you can't forget about the chips and salsa.  This is definitely a restaurant to visit while in Vegas. Request for Sergio of course. Great service. Great food and drinks. Thanks Sergio for everything!
