hlDcfzRGfmSmL5LpYcRqKA China Wok is getting 1 star simply because of extremely poor service.  Some of my coworkers ordered lunch delivered, as they do many times a month.  One of the orders were missing so we called the restaurant.  Not only did they want to charge extra to bring the correct food, they asked for the incorrect order back!!  We will never order from this restaurant again.  I also plan to alert the several hundred employees that work in this building of the poor service.
