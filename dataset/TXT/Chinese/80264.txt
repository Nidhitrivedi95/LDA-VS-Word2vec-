gQ-VFMpfCpTQZBOzQiYQ6g I have been fortunate to find this place. My father is a physician, so i am very familiar with western medicine and all it's benefits. Eastern medicine is different and I am a believer!!! I can't say enough about Dr. Xiao, her knowledge of the human body, acupuncture, and Chinese medicine. I walk for a living, and I couldn't do my job without her care.
