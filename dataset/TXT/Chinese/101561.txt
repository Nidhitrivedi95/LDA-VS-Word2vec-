kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A I hate to give bad review. This time I have to do it. 

We ordered Mongolian pancake. It was too greasy. I should listen to all the reviews here. I learn my lesson. 
I ordered myself spicy noodle soup. Noodle itself is pretty good but the soup is too salty. Not spicy at all
My daughter got some rice and slice pork with mushroom. It's also too salty. 

We won't go back to this place.
