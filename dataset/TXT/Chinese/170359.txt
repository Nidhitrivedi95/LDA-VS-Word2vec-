VW33YWpe_zPGDEHN0cNQfQ didnt like this place much

went here for dinner with fam and idk the food was not that good... some tasted bland, some tasted too salty... 

we got chicken, some kind of veggies with mushrooms on top, and this beef dish with onions

pros: comes with complimentary soup, free wifi (caught some weak ass pokemon here maties yeeeHAWWWW), this service thing they provide where you press a certain button (waiter, bill, water, etc) and whatever you want comes.. i didn't try it out though but it's cool (similar to what korean restaurants have) 

cons: the mediocre food and the waiters cause damn they be rough as hell... im pretty for the short duration i was eating there, they broke up at  LEAST 5 plates ... like damn chill

safe to say, i won't be coming here again....

looks like the king was not powerful enough to impress me tsk tsk
