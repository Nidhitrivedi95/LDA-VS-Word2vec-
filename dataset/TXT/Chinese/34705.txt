aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg LAY HO MAHHHH. Okay so i may be THE most white washed ABC, "american born chinese", but I know good Chinese food when I taste it.  I've been to Hong Kong and had the best won ton noodles ever.. Nothing will ever compare, but I will say Asian BBQ & Noodles produces a very delicious product in fact it rivals the best i've tasted in Hawaii.

So, after 2 filling days of pigging out, my friend and I decided to cut back on the binge eating a bit.  Since it was a bit nippy out, we ventured for won ton noodles and roast pork.  We sat down and instantly I knew it was gonna be a winner.  Everyone around us was speaking cantonese. NOT A WORD OF ENGLISH. NOT ONE!

We looked at the menu, thank goodness it was in english and ordered 2 won ton thin noodles and an order of roast pork.

Very very very good noodles and amazing won ton. I haven't had similar quality won tons since my trip to Hong Kong last year.  Roast pork is crazy crispy.  Not just crispy, CRAZY CRISPY.  You won't chip a tooth, but you will definitely feel the crunch. BEST ROAST PORK I have had in a long time.

The restaurant was VERY clean, the wait staff struggles with english at times but definitely know enough to take your order, and the best part of all our lunch was $20 TIP INCLUDED..

My friend said the other dishes are awesome as well.  If you have a hankering for Cantonese chinese food and are on a budget, this is definitely the spot for you.. You know what they say, "when in vegas, do as the CHINESE do." :)
