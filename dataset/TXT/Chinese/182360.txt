Xj4LLkA6pK9j-F1_W-cLxg I have been here many times and i say this place is an excellent place to get a good relaxing massage. Staff is very friendly, and so are the massuses. 

I still cannot give this place more than 3 stars , as the downside of this place are the hot towels they use for cleaning up the body after the body massage. They are usually never clean and feel still feel oiley from the previous use. I stopped taking a facial treatment here, as and when i realized they use the same hot towels on the face too. Yaaakk!! .. 

Bottom line .. my recommendation : If its just the massage you are going in for, get it .. go home and make sure you have a shower to clean up.
