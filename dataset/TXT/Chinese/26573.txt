7U23rwCmVWasFQ0cHRMYVw Had to do quick pick up just for myself as I had seen this place sometime ago and I was in the area, decided to give it a try.

Ordered a Spicy Mixed Vegetables and asked to make it extra spicy and my usual request everywhere - less or no oil.

The ordering was quick and there were just two customers ahead of me and perhaps they had a larger order.

One can see the chef making the dish and saw that he does not clean te wok between dishes. The making was so quick that I could not intervene. Being a vegetarian I prefer that they clean the wok. I am hoping that the dish made prior was all vegetarian as well. The dish did not taste of cross contamination, but who knows?

The dish itself was good. The quantity when poured in the plastic container was heap full and the cashier could hardly close it. The gravy had some sweet, sour and spice in it. The extra spicy request was fulfilled with extra dry red chillies. Not ideal as I believe one should not eat whole red chillies for spicy flavour.

Would go back again to give it another try.
