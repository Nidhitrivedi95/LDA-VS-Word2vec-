UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w What an awesome deal! It might not be as aesthetically visually pleasing compared to Caesars, Mirage, Encore, MGM, Palm & the rest of the 'popular trendy' hotels but by goodness, foods provided are still quality & a wide assortment! And COST EFFICIENT! FYI: I consider myself a buffet snob
