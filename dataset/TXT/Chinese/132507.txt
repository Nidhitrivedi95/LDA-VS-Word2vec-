pofDmHoIsdvPcSKzb2iMag Tried this place this morning and I must say their food was pretty tasty and I would come again. 
I was initially skeptical seeing it only had a 2.5 avg rating but to my surprise it was a lot better than expected.  I am giving this place 3 stars because their elevator was broken and we had to walk these narrow stairs 3+ levels up.  Also, because we sat "inside" and not "outside/aisle" (not in another room as I thought that was what she meant when the hostess asked if inside was ok) and as a result it was kind of hard to order our dim sum from the pushing carts.  Some items were already sold out by the time we got up and walked up to the carts to get them ourselves. 
The one dish that stood the most out for me today was their veggies dish.
