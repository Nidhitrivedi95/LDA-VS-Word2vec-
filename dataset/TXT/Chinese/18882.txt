5GOrW-PkisP0eXlSxy4AFg Very typical Chinese restaurant - delivery is quick! It's close to us and we know what we are getting every time. There is an older lady that will not take any sass, all business. It's kind of comical. Like answering the phone with, "Hold on." Or telling my BF, "Not yours!" while he grabs a to go bag in front of him. 

Our go to's are hot and sour soup, General Tso's shrimp, walnut shrimp, pork cha siu. Is it the best? No but it's good, bad Chinese food when you just want to watch a movie and order in.
