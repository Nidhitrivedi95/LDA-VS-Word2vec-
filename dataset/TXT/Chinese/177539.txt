wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA Walking into the restaurant we were greeted by the server with, "Do you have reservations?" for a restaurant that was 20% full. After a 3 minute wait, we were sat without menus. The server dropped off waters without offering us menus or taking our drink order. Luckily, I took the menu with me that I was looking at while waiting. 5 minutes passes and she and the other server proceeded to take all the other tables orders. We were not acknowledged once. 10 minutes passed and we had ample time to choose what we wanted, at this point, we were waiting for our server to take our order. They passed us many times but still did not come to our table. We waited a total of 20 minutes. 

I am giving a one-star rating to this place for lack of service and not having the opportunity to taste the food. Their food is priced high for the typical small portioned Asian tapas so you would expect decent service, especially from a place that is competing with other high end restaurants. 

We were so turned off by the service, waiting for them or flagging them down just to order didn't seem appealing enough to stay. 

In the end, we walked out of the restaurant. Disappointed.
