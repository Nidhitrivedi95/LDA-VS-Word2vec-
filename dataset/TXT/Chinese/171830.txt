VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Tonight was our first time trying Flo's. We arrived during happy hour so appetizers were half price and we ordered the crab puffs. I had the Kung "Pow" chicken and my husband had the orange chicken. We also had the chocolate won tons for dessert. I can't complain about the food. It was good. It was a large portion for the price and it was hot food. It was fine but unremakable. Didn't blow me away. What DID blow me away was the service. It was outstanding. Our bus boy was so great I gave him a tip. We were well taken care of and I would go back.
