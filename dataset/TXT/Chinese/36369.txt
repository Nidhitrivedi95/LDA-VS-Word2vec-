Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg So I'm a sushi monster. Coming here you would think they would have more choices but they don't. I was more confused of their lack of options. My friend and I only sat at the bar just to look at the menu. The seating with nice and dark for romantic evenings. We took our sushi to go. The sushi was good could have been way better. Compared to other places I've been, I give it a 2.5
