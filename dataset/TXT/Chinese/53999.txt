cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Friend brought take out for a girls night in (included the hubby) the pork dumplings and crispy wontons were so great. 
We also had sesame chicken, which started out great but as you kept eating, the more saltier it got. 
The red curry was  not the best but edible. 
I would definitely get take out again from here!
