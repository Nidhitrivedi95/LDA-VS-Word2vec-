Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA This restaurant is great. The food is always cooked as you order. Ingredients are fresh. Excellent chef and owner. My tips here are that when they warn you about ordering on the heat index scale of 1-10 with 10 being hottest, take them seriously. A friend that likes really hot food got a 7 and said next time to remind them not to go over 6. Also free refills on iced tea.
