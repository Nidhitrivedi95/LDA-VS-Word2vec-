RGg86O5SmjhiVglYYpWkEQ This review is based on Dim Sum experience at Full House Chinese Cuisine.

$2.08 each for all the dim sum items on the ordering sheet all day!!! Great value!

The wait staffs though were really indifference.... one of those that pretend they don't see you and most of them just group themselves chatting away at the back of the restaurant.

The dim sums though were meh. The Chicken with Sticky Rice wrapped in lotus leaf was not even heated all the way through. 

I definitely not recommend coming to Full House if you want a decent dim sum experience!
