jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg Had dinner here last night with my swol-mate after an intense gym sesh. The food was pretty good, we ordered the meat sample small (good for two people), fish mau soup with grab meat, honey walnut shrimp, seafood hot pot and kung pao chicken (was ok).

Would definitely go again to try the rest of the menu.
