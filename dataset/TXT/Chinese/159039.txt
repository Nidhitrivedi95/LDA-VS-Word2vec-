u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ My go-to place for Chinese food here in Las Vegas. Used to be Food Express on Decatur but since the chefs all moved here, well, you get it.

We come here almost once a week since my mom loves the garlic salt and pepper (Bei Fung Tong) crab not to be mistaken for the salt and pepper crab (which is also good). The ginger and scallions lobster is good too! As of course is the fresh steamed fish with soy sauce.

If you like fish, for less than approximately 1/7 of the price of the fresh (swimming) fish, order the sea bass tofu clay pot. The fish is lightly fried and stewed in clay pot. This is my favorite dish. My other new discovery thanks to my less adventurous nephew is the fried chicken. Mmmm...fried chicken.

They offer a lot of specials known only to locals, like cheaper lobster between 3-5pm and late night happy hour on food. You also get a free steamed chicken if you order the crab and have more than 4 people eating.
