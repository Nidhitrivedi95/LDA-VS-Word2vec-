v7bSnWkzUgJxc1jt75oOtA We ran away from the insane lineup at Rol San to wander down Dundas in search of a little Sunday dim sum. When I stepped up to the door of Rol Jul, I saw a single dimly lit table of people in the back. My spidey-sense tingled and we beat a hasty retreat. If there's one thing we know, don't eat in an empty restaurant when the others around it are at peak!! My friend remembered HK Harbour "from 20 years ago" so we stepped 2 door to the right to give it a try. It was bustling but not packed (2 good signs bc my friend's feet hurt), so we were seated right away. I did like that it was served from carts, not a la carte like Rol San where you can't see what you're getting. As each carts rolled by, the ladies told us what was on offer and we'd take or not take. I liked that the ladies gave us a brief smile. Once, we ran low on napkins and a manager dropped off more without us asking. You know there's low expectations of this type of restaurant when this impressed both my friend and I!
BTW, is my palate aging or do all the egg custard buns have a coconut flavor lately? Weird!

The food was decent, prices were good, and I'd recommend it just because we got seated right away. Sum of them you lose but dim sum, you win!
