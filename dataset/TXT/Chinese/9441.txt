1rbb8ntTOpSolQv60CGcsQ Ming's has been there for roughly 20 years...and now I remember why. The food was delicious. I ordered 2 separate meals (lo mein and mongolian beef) expecting to eat one the next day, but there wasn't enough left; I couldn't stop eating. Delivery took 50 minutes but the polite lady who answered the phone let me know it would take that long and it was absolutely worth waiting for.
