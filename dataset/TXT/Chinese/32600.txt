a0Jm-rlHOKk_1fm4hzxskg Food was okay.  I'm Asian and I am not discriminating when I say as most Asian restaurants, the service is the biggest drawback.  There's a bar at the entrance, but good luck finding a bartender who will serve you.  Beverages for kids are limited - no lemonade or fruit punch.  Will not make it a point to return.
