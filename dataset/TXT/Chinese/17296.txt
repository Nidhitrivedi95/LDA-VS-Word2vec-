First, I walked in and all the staff was eating and I seemed to have interrupted their family meal... sorry I wanted to buy some food. I was however greeted immediately by the rudest little lady. Instead of being warm and welcoming it seemed like she just wanted to get me out of there. She wasn't very helpful in fact I asked her if I can substitute fried rice for the white rice but she said that wasn't allowed?! That was the most ridiculous thing anyone anywhere has ever told me--- instead she gave me a meal and then gave me another portion of just  fried rice which I then came to realize was done to charge me double! I wouldn't have cared if she would have charged me extra but she had an attitude and game me double the food at double the price. It wasn't a crazy ridiculous price but just to compare... in NYC I can get replace my white rice for fried rice and for the same meal I'd pay 8 bucks at any time of the day... if you want to be greeted as if you intruded on someone's family because you wanted to pay for your own go there... thenfoods ok but nothing like NYC Chinese food...
