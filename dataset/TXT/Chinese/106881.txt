L50jcbfqPhqXuEcM5GQsUg for me, this place only gets a 3/5 because of couple of reasons.

1. service of the waitress was good.  The girl spoke perfect english and not the typical chinese style bad service i would normally expect.
2. the herbal coconut soup that was surprisingly sweet and delicious.

other than those two points.. the rest of my meal was very mediocre.  
dont expect a fancy place.  It mainly focuses on herbal soups.  i came with my family and tried the food.  Portions are small, food was mediocre and presentation is almost non existing.  

i hope they are able to find their niche customer... especially with winter around the corner.
