VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Dear Flo, your sure know how to make a girl scarf her dinner! It's all because of your delicious Chinese cuisine that I just can't help but pile on my plate! How it took me this long to visit Flo's, I will never know. However, now that I've had a bite...err plateful of food, I will frequent this restaurant over and over again. 

Let me start with the atmosphere. This is North Scottsdale suburbs at its finest. You'll find a lot of families here eating, but there's also a bar with plenty of TVs that make it perfect for an Adult's Night Out as well. This is not a dive. No, this restaurant is decorated with trendy Asian decor. The staff is incredibly friendly as well. We went on a Thursday night in the middle of the summer, so I'm sure that can attest to the fact that we were able to sit down without a wait at 8:00 PM at night, but there's plenty of seating so I'm sure even a small wait doesn't last long. 

Now on to the blissful food. Two words: Katsu Chicken. I could eat the entire plate myself but I did share. It's breaded chicken that's so tender, you don't need a knife to cut it. The breaded chicken is bathed in a sweet Teriyaki sauce and sits upon a heap of egg fried rice. It's delightfully delicious upon every bite. So much so that I went back to seconds (and thirds). Secondly, the Sweet and Sour chicken. It's pretty much your standard Sweet & Sour chicken but it's good, tender and worth a second helping as well! Their lettuce wraps were juicy and a great starter. We didn't get dessert, but I noticed chocolate won tons and banana spring rolls which sounded pretty sensational as well! 

This is solid Asian dining and worth the visit if you're in the area (or even if you're not!)
