fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA Agreed, perhaps the best dumpling house in Toronto. It's centrally located in Chinatown, just north of Spadina and Dundas.There's a variety of dumplings but we just got the pan fried and steamed pork and chives. The venue was large and nicely decorated with traditional Chinese themed paraphernalia. We were seated in about 10 minutes and service was overall a bit slow, but they were busy. Super cheap for us to eat here. I think the damage was about $25 with tax and tip. Come here for scrumptious dumplings. Pro tip: This place is best for lunch or dinner.
