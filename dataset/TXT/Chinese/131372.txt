pIo-HDaY6CBRlsJr8Id3Ig Ordered three types of shrimp dumplings.  None of them special. One type had six pieces, one four and the other two, but cut into four pieces.  The type with six pieces was cold.  
Ordered crispy beef, because others said good, beef chow fun and salt and pepper shrimp.  Crispy beef had no taste; if I tasted it with my eyes closed, I never would have known it was beef, but it was crispy. Salt and pepper shrimp were peeled shrimp (no head) covered with bread crumbs.  Beef chow fun was the best of all the dishes, but certainly not worth the trip.
Room was pretty and casino didn't smell of smoke. Really wanted to like food, but I just couldn't. Very sorry.
