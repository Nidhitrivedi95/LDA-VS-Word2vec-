DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg I have tried this location twice now and will for sure be back. You can place your order online and it is very user friendly. I wanted to make changes to what I was ordering and there was a option to customize it so I didn't have to worry about phoning it in or ordering in person I was just able to easily and accurately place my order online. 

I started with a "Pork Egg Roll". These were addicting like candy. Great flavor and decent size for $2.00. I had the "Chicken Lettuce Wraps" for my meal. The chicken has such good flavor. The lettuce is fresh and crisp. This is one I might have a hard time not ordering each time. My man had the "Lo Mein With Spicy Beef". I sampled some of the noodles and was hooked. I had to steal a few more bites. The noodles weren't dry and had so much flavor. 

They have a gluten free menu.

If you don't want to get your food to go they have a dining area.

They cater.

Since signing up on the website to order online they have sent me a couple good coupons good on my next visit.
