vede55OuMkwUNd4wnr8GqA This was my first time at this location and I was very surprised at the attitude of the staff. 
Mid meal, my friend and I went put for a cigarette and told the ladies at the front. It was cool out (we were in summer dresses) and went to the car. The manager ran out with a few employees yelling that we are leaving and we didnt pay. We told them that we will be back after our smoke and we havent had dessert yet. They "let" us go but left an employee in the parking lot watching my car. When we came in the managers and a bunch of staff members were standing around waiting for us. 
We had out dessert and coffee to unpleasant glances from all the staff members. 
This was never an issue at any other location. I dont see why they made us feel like criminals when we did tell them that we are going out and coming right back. 
I don't see why they thought we drove to Newmarket to dine and dash on a cheap buffet... 
There fish in the salmon sushi rolls tasted old and salty. 
The cold crab legs were not replaced until they were all eaten. Ive never seen that happen before in a mandarin. The staff seemed to spend more time maintaining the dining tables that the actual buffet. 
Really crap experience. 
Definitely not going back to this location.
