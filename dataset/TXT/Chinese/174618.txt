I really like the hong kong milk tea.  The taste of their tea comes closest to Hong Kong.  There is a science to making perfect hong kong milk tea - a perfect blend, the right amount of evaporated milk and the perfect temperature.  Most restaurants across North America use cheap Lipton leaves and give too little milk.  Some restaurant owners from mainland China use condensed milk in the tea, and that's a no-no.  After trying tea from Vancouver, San Francisco, LA, NY and others in the GTA, I have to say Lucullus's tea is very good.
