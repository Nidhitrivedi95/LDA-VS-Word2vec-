6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ What a gem inside the Hard Rock Casino!

Food: 5 stars (Must try the ribs, miso sea bass, Mongolian beef tenderloin, and Thai basil salmon! 

Everything is cooked to perfection. I love how the sauces are so unique and rich - I always make time to eat here every time I visit Vegas!)

Service: 5 stars (My party is always well taken care of...A little smile goes a long way. :))

Ambiance: 5 stars (LOVE the decor! Modern chic and super cool.)

Can't wait to go back! Mm mmm! :P
