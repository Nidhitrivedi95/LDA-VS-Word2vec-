I don't like fried food. Got kung pow chicken, which is fried, but the menu description doesn't say that. So salty it's almost inedible. The snap peas are good - all 8 of them. The menu does indicate this is spicy, but it's not at all. Hey, Pei Wei - people who don't like spicy won't be ordering this. People that do will, so live by your little chili indicator.
