_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg We thought we'd give this place one more try after they had a chance to get on their feet after their disaster of a grand opening.  It seems like they've paid attention to the reviews (or complaints by customers) and have improved a bit.  A lot of the old problems have been addressed. The place was much cleaner and I didn't see any kids running around.  The food had more variation (not every dish contained bell peppers) but it still wasn't that great.  The sushi is much better than last time, but mediocre at best.  I'm really happy that they've added to the Mongolian grill.  They've added garlic, chilies, and a choice of several sauces now.  

Overall, much better than round one, but I probably won't be back.

Still visit here occasionally because it sucks the least out of all the other local Chinese buffets and we're usually too poor to go to Pacific.
