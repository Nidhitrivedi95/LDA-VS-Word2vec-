9SHoWGXsGOCa5hOjBOzPtg Ordered delivery and it was bad.  The food was too salty and too garlicky, it was so bad that I had to rinse all the protein and veggies in some hot water to wash away the saltiness and the ton of garlic on it.  
The rice that I received was hard and I couldn't even eat it.  Such a huge disappointment and waste of money.
