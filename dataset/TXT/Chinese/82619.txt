HAqFrpN8ukzFZuSgTvLijw Faley's is the best Hakka Chinese food I've ever had. "Hakka" is basically Chinese food with a strong Indian influence, yielding spicy, bold flavours. Nowhere are they more bold than in the "Chili Chicken (Dry)" with Fried Rice. It's probably my favourite dish in the entire city of Toronto. 

I give this place 4 stars because the service is hit or miss. As someone who's been a customer for the past 10 years, I've had a wide range of experiences. Portions have also slowly reduced over the years. I still think that it's a pretty good value for money though.

A lot of restaurants have opened in this same plaza advertising "hakka" chinese food (including a chain called Salt and Pepper). I've tried them all and none of them compare.
