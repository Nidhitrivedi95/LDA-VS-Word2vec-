qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA Came here based on hearing loosely about this place. I know with ayce u forgo some quality for quantity but my biggest issue is that my son had a peanut reaction eating here a we ate nothing with satay or any derivative of peanut sauce and every dish we double checked to make sure there were no peanuts which the staff assured us of.  So suggests that the kitchen may not be kept as clean as it should be.  I get that u take risks with 'coming into contact with peanuts' but response from restaurant was poor.  On top of that my husband also got food poisoning - he ate only sashimi so again kitchen issues comes to mind!!  So all in all, not sure if it was a bad day for the restaurant but we won't be coming back here.  iPad ordering is nothing special and decor is ok but nothing says 'I won't come back here' like concerns over food prep and storage.
