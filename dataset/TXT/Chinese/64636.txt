E9aC5bLfXdQVZ5csvLuLJg I come here when I miss my moms home cooking. We had a rocky start at first with our first waitress but after talking to the owner we cleared any bad tension and now I come here all the time and love it. Get the fried chicken but prepare to wait a while because they made it fresh. Prices are really cheap. Their boba is fresh and doesn't have any artificial powders in it either. I wish they had stinky tofu but I always get the minced pork over rice noodle soup.
