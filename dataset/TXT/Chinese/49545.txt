CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! If I could give this spot ZERO stars I would. My cousins and I only came to this spot because we were meeting up all the oldies in our family who decided to try this place out of convenience & of course they probably didn't read any reviews or was not recommended to try it either. 

CONS:
- everything I tried was nasty! 
- even the presentation of the food was ugly ESPECIALLY for a place that is $$ 
- the food is made for people who don't like flavor OR who don't know what the food is SUPPOSED to taste like. My bf ordered the shrimp won ton soup and it literally tasted like water. I ordered the roti which usually gets me excited because not a lot of places serve it but the curry it came with was NASTY & trust I've had Malaysian curry before. My cousin ordered the chicken curry rice dish and even that was nasty. I ordered the coconut curry noodle soup that I've ordered at other places before and again NASTY! I recommend asking for the shrimp paste on the side, just the smell of it ruined it for me. They put way too much of it in my soup it didn't even taste like curry anymore. The pad thai was made with the wide rice noodles and NO flavor. The sesame chicken (I think) reminded me of when my dad tried to make my sister & I sweet and sour chicken with ketchup from some cookbook he had YEARS ago! 
- this spot is a perfect example of why Asian fusions are BAD! 
- the service was HORRIBLE it took forever to get our food, forever to get the check, forever to get our money/cards back... & everything else UGH! 

PROS: 
- the only thing that came out decent looking was the duck rice plate my cousin ordered & he said it wasn't bad 

I would NOT recommend this spot to anyone and I am definitely NOT coming back! Sooooo mad I wasted my money here!
