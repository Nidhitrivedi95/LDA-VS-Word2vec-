61eXtTmhDepujO7_IdA9-w If you love cheap eats, you will love this place. If you wanna go somewhere fancy smanshy and expect a more formal atmosphere this is not the place for you. Caribbean Heat is run by some very down to earth and funny people.

I came by here after work one evening with my aunt. We had shrimp wanton soup, chicken chow mein and spicy shrimp. The first surprise was the portion sizes. There was enough food to easily feed 3 people. You know when you go to a restaurant and order a shrimp dish and you can literally count how many shrimps there are? Well you won't be doing this here. The spicy shrimp weren't actually spicy- more like plump deep fried shrimps, the shrimp wanton soup was large enough for two and had a slight  taste of seasame oil,  the chicken chow mein was just really good chowmein topped with chicken that was moist ont he inside and crispy on the outside. 


I may be a bit bias because I love Caribbean Chinese food, it is my favourite kind of chinese food. So if you are a fan as well this place is definitely worth checking out. They make amazing hot sauce as well for all my lovers of heat.
