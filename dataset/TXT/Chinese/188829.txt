yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I am so disgusted ...  I am pretty sure that they have changed management because the old manager would never have let this happen or treated his customers thus. I would give this place 0 stars but it will not let me.  I have been coming here for at least 10 years and sometimes 3xs a week and I can't tell tell you how grossed out I am.  

Let's start off with the dirty sticky tables and dirty silverware, which had food stuck on it.  That should have been my cue to get up and go somewhere else.  First off I ordered the special fried egg rolls and they tasted rancid and cold, so they remade it and they tasted like the old ones were thrown back into the fryer and served back to us. Then I took a bite of the chicken teriyaki that I ordered for my 3 year old son and it tasted slimy and cold in the middle, I took apart 5 or 6 pieces and they were all clear and pink in the middle, so I ate RAW chicken .  I told the waitress and then her manager approached the table and when I told him that the chicken was raw his response was "you don't know what you talk about chicken is pink" at this point I didn't feel like arguing with anyone so I paid for my 3 young coconuts and my Thai boba totaling in $22.49 and left (yes I left the poor waitress her 20% tip bc it's not her fault that they hired cooks that do not know that chicken needs to have an internal temp of 165 degrees) 

I would skip this filth ridden place and I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up in dirty dinning soon.
