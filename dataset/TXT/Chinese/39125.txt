AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw Came here for the 1st time after the restaurant has moved from their Market Village location. Glad to say this was a wise business decision. Venue wise, they took over the Burger King's building and it looks so much cleaner, more spacious and it isn't run down at all. So venue for me is good.

As for the food, can't say much for HK Style cafe food. I ordered a "Twins" combo meal and I was full. My friends and I pretty much ordered the same thing off their menu. So this place doesn't win you on like the high quality cooking skill but rather they win you on quantity and speed. Must try their wings though, they look amazing.
