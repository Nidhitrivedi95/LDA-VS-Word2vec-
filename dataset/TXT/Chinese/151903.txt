T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ Imma go ahead and just give this place five stars. I didn't get bad service like others have stated. I mean, they cleaned our tables for us and took our plates promptly. That's all that matters. 

This place is exactly like Buffet @ Asia. The food and quality of it, and the price. BUTTTTT Hibachi Grill has crab legs, dimsum AND RAW OYSTERS!

So, if you is hangry, go here. Worth it, in my opinion.
