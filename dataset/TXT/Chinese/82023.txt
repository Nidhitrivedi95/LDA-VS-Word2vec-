H2RgkjPs3W-CxbyygCJJew I love the food and prices at this joint. The food is always fresh and the service is fast. To top it off, prices are so inexpensive. Even though I'm not crazy about the decor, who cares. As long as I'm fed good, fresh, and inexpensive food, it's all good! I'm happy and my pocket is happy too :-). It's definitely a 'must go' place.
