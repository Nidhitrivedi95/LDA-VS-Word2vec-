TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ Pretty good food for the price. We did the family dinner for 10.95 which serves 2 people.  We got 4 of those deals with drinks our family of 6 ate for 60.00. That's a deal for our family with 4 teenagers 3 of those teenagers being boys.  Although I have to say their little sister ate more than the boys did.  My husband actually announced he was full as we got into the car, that's amazing. We did come home with a box of food as well.  Flavorful and the service is great.  Free refills on the drinks.
