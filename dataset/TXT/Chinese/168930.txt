Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Terri came back for her bday and wanted to eat here!  There was a bunch of us that came here and two in our group ordered some huge fish!  I should have ordered the fish, it looked delish!  I ordered the pineapple fried rice which tasted good but something I could have made at home.  I tried Ben-terns noodles which wasn't for me either.  

The appetizers were great!  I really enjoyed the ravioli!  I would need to come back here again to try something more unique other than the rice I had but the dessert was yummy.  Both the fried ice cream and mango/rice!  

Until I come back, I would still say this place is worth a try because it's a hit or miss on the food you have.  However, the service was great and staff was friendly.  

Hmm:
I think the kitchen was bigger than the dining area but I could be wrong.
