Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg My husband and I ate here while we waited for a show. the hostess we had was very friendly and we were seated right away. Our waiter was prompt and very friendly and helped us with some menu questions we had. I personally enjoyed the decor and thought it was a very peaceful dining experience. The food came in fairly quickly and it was all tasty, but not necessarily mind blowing.
