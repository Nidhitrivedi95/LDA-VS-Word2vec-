We started with some great cocktails: the Chinese Mule (nice and gingery) and the strawberry martini (wonderfully fruity without being too sweet).

Then we had the crispy duck salad, roasted Chilean sea bass with honey, and spicy prawns.  All those dishes were superb.

Finally, we finished with the black sesame and chocolate dumplings in Yuzu.  An unusual flavor combination that really hit the spot.

This is a high end Asian restaurant.  The decor and ambiance are really nice.  Service was top notch as well.

I cannot wait to come back!
