My buddy always has the fried squid on rice and I usually mix it around. This time I had the seafood noodles.

They serve it up fast and prices are about $6. be careful as some specials include a drink and soup and some do not depending on which menu you order from. hey seem to have 4 menus so look at the photo and tell the pretty girl which one you want. The specials come with the drink/soup but are more basic items like beef chow mein.

This is cheaper than McD's and may have less salt, fat and sugar than the fast food joints.

if you can get there before 1145am then you beat the other coworkers looking for a chinese fix, or take a later lunch. No fun 15 deep in a line and there are 4 EMS guys, and 3 cops in front of you.
