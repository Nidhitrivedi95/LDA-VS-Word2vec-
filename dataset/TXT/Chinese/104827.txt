kqM_bA4eEAnIMekmyWB5WA I stumbled upon this place when I was walking through Chinatown. I noticed it had a sign for ice cream rolls and it piqued my curiosity because I had always wanted to try the popular thai dessert at places such as Arctic Bites but never had a chance to. We decided to get two order of ice cream rolls, which was matcha and mango.

The person chopped up mango before adding the ice cream mixture and made our ice cream. He definitely knew what he was doing. He rolled up the ice cream perfectly and topped it with our choice of toppings.

The matcha ice cream rolls was made from a pre-made mixture but it tasted so creamy with a subtle but delicious hint of matcha flavour.

Compared to other restaurants, we choose our own toppings (up to 5 allowed). They have over 20 such as fruits, sprinkles, tapioca, popping boba, oreos, waffle crackers, pocky, marshmallows and sprinkles. 

The service was really friendly and quick. For a creation such as this that only cost 5.99 which I feel is really worth it compared to other places because we get to customize our order, it's definitely a place to try out the next time you're in chinatown!
