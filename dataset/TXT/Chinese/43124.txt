beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Decent hot pot place but not worth coming back. 

I was drawn to this place on Yelp from seeing the rotating belt and it's great that you can make a reservation on Yelp too!

What impressed me was the good selection of lamb and the good service.

Everything else was mediocre. The soup base (original) is similar to the little sheep Mongolian hot pot soup. It was good but nothing spectacular. 
I was disappointed at the beef rib eye which was super dry. 

Also annoyed how they only put one small pot in the middle of a booth meant to sit 6 people. It was kinda hard to reach the pot if you are sitting on the edge. 

I guess I just feel there are more comfortable and tasty hot pot I've tried before.
