yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Yay! Another decent Vietnamese restaurant.  Best part of this one is it's super affordable and open 24 hours!  I will say they are SO busy that sometimes the service can be slow but the prices are great and the food is really decent.  There are some small inconsistencies like - the first time I had the duck it was yummy.  The second time it was "ok" so you kinda gotta be careful of that.  But I always have the crab rangoon and it's delish.  As well as the Singapore noodles, seafood plate and beef pho soup.  I definitely recommend this place especially late at night :)
