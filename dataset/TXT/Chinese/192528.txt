Z4MvEVylnZPW_vddQc2Ihg Warning, this review might be a bit bias, I have a soft spot for mongolian BBQ as my parents owned a Mongolian BBQ restaurant growing up and I went here with my childhood bff who spent many meals w me at my parents place. 

I think I must of had 4 or 5 helpings! It's all you can eat which i usually hate but this time i totally pigged out! I didn't bother w the other buffet item except the sesame pastry, a classic w Mongolian BBQ. 

The funny thing about Mongolian BBQ is if u don't like it, you got no one to blame but yourself! You pick your own ingredients, make your own sauces, and they cook it on a big grill. 

They have a great selection of vegetables, meat, tofu and condiments. I particularly like the tofu because they freeze it first which is the traditional way to serve tofu for hot pot because it absorbs more sauce and has a great texture.

They do have a variety of pre made sauces so you don't have to do it all yourself. And if u don't like it you can just try again.

The location is clean, and well ventilated so your not gonna be too smelly. Ok, you'll be a little smelly but it only makes you want to go back again. :)
