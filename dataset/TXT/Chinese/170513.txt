Service wasn't spot on as it took a bit of time to get seated even when at this early time not all the tables were filled. Also took some time to get the attention of the service staff to get orders in. In the end the standout here is the dim sum. A large variety of various dim sum platters. Some you'll only find as specialty items in Asia and not found in the states. Large portions as well for a dimsum plate so you get value for your buck. Nicely flavored shrimp dumplings and chinese meatballs. They had a great tofu dessert. Served hot in a bowl with sugar syrup. Delicious shrimp and beef churn fun. Freshly baked egg tarts that were still hot and flakey. Their beef chow fun was also very good with lots of ingredients and can serve a large group. If in Vegas and hankering for some dim sum i would definitely come here. Would be 4 stars on food alone if not for the service.
