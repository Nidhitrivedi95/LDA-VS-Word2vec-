JYtGcfc3iFvwj5Zi4oQg7Q This place is so good that I'm incredibly sad I don't live in Vegas! I haven't eaten chicken very much in my life, nor do I remember what it tastes like, but I swear the Vegan "chicken" dishes were the best I've ever had! My friend said his dish [also chicken] tasted like the real thing! The "chicken" is made out of Seitan [my favorite] and is cooked quite well!
