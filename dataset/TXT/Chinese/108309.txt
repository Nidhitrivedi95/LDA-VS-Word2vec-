liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA Wow, I can't believe how bad the food was here. 

Tried to come here late night at 2:45 am, but they turned us away cuz they closed at 3 am.

Fine. 

So, we went back a day later to nurse out bangin hangovers. I was so excited to try this place, but what a mother effin letdown.

*shakes head*

Ordered the steamed pork dumplings (xiao long bao), steamed shrimp dumplings, noodle soup with pork and pickled veggies (Taiwanese staple), and filet mignon pho tai.

Har gow- eh, it was decent. 4 pieces. typical dim sum fare.

Steamed pork dumplings- omg, what a disgrace to even call this that name. I had 1 piece and was thoroughly offended. He had a piece and made the funniest this-is-gross face. We left the last piece untouched. 

My noodle soup with pork and picked veggies was so bland and tasteless that I just couldnt eat it after a few bites. Instead I ordered beef noodle soup. 

Beef noodle soup came to the table 5 min later. Holy shit. It was freakin spicy as hell! I thought I was gonna die. They had added 10 red peppers in there. Not kidding. My mouth, throat, tummy, and ass was on fire. I'm really ticked off that they didn't indicate the spicy factor on the menu. It took me at least 30 min or more to get through half the dish.

My DC had the pho tai and said it was awesome. I only had some broth, so I can't comment on it. 

Anyways, this place is not recommended. The bill was about $81, which included a thai iced tea, vietnamese iced coffee and hot tea. Hells no. Never again.
