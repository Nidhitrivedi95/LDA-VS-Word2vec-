B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA We are here from LA, where it's hard to find good, Americanized Chinese food. Well, we are glad that we came upon this gem in Vegas! The honeydew Bobo tea was delicious. The egg drop soup had peas and carrots, which was different, but good. My husband loved his Mongolian chicken and hot and sour soup. My chicken and broccoli needed to be spiced up a bit, but overall it was good. We are definitely going back when we return to Vegas!
