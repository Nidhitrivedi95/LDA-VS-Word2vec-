FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ Of all the dim sum places that I have gone to (I'm from the states), I would have to say this place is just OK. If anything it was mediocre. The service was terrible especially going in a big party of 19. We would constantly have to flag them down because we didn't have napkins, not enough dining ware, and we had to ask for sauces. Normally everything is already set on the table before I order or after but I'm assuming it was so busy that they forget everything. Eliminating pushing the carts and ordering as you go instead doesn't work well with big parties. The food does come out warm but takes way too long. 
I wouldn't come back with my family, we would probably try to find another place the next time we come to Canada.
