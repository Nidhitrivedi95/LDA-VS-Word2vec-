U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ We used love eating here.  But, unfortunately, as they have become busier the quality of food has gone down.  The service is still good but we sometimes have to wait.  We wouldn't mind if the food was as excellent as when it started.  The meat seems chewy like it was prepared in advance and then just heated up.  The only exception is the Pho, still great although I have had occasion to find plastic wrapper pieces in my bowl.
