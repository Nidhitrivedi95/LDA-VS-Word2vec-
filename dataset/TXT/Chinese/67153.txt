ElqLoKM__uU7DcYzRnMpNw The crispy ginger chicken is the best Chinese dish I have ever had!  Similar to generals chicken- but with a lot more flavor! The decor is bright and clean, and servers are friendly.  It is not a 5 star restaurant, but it is when comparing to other Chinese restaurants in Cleveland.
