JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA Visited YC's for lunch yesterday.  It had been years since I had been there and yes they have raised their prices but who hasn't.  It is still a good value with all that is included.  The staff was very, very helpful and the facility was very clean.  I had a delicious and healthy lunch.  I will definitely return more often.
