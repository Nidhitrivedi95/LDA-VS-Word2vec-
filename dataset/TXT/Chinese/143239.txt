Served by dim sum carts on this late Saturday morning before the rush, we finish our week's stay in the Valley of the Sun. From the quality of the tea to the quality of the dim sum, it was a fitting meal before our long drive home.  An opportunity to use my Cantonese with the gregarious wait staff. Ironically our first meal on Sunday and our departing meal are both our most memorable and best meals. 

The dim sum is at least twice as good anywhere in Las Vegas. Not to forget, the price of our dim sum meal including tea charge was less than $24.  I remember spending twice that in Las Vegas with most disappointing results.
