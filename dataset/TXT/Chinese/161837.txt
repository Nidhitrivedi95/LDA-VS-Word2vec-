uhX3mfuapCkWqFJkPjrMZA Service is the only reason I can see to complain. Wednesday night only to servers.. but almost full house. 

The food was good, kebobs not too spicy, good amount of meat on the kebobs. The cold noodle I had was not salty and missing kimchi but had spicy paste, better than Yang's bbq's cools noodle. 

The stewed beef noodle is $7.99, maybe like 6-8 small pieces of beef, huge bowl. Like congee queens superbowl congee sized. Enough to fill two, with fresh tomatoes and Bok Choy. Hand pulled noodle??? Anyhow very tasty and good flavour in the broth, it's like a order of the stewed beef soup but with noodles at no additional charge. :)
