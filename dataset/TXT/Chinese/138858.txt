QS7_BPmaBNvznOMhcVBemg Well, I disregarded the negative reviews and came here because of convenience. Unfortunately it lived up to the negatives and then some. First server took appetizer order. After a long wait another server came up to take dinner order as if original server had never come. We said we had already ordered appetizer and she said it would come. Dinner came instead by yet another server. Then we asked about appetizer and it finally came stone cold. Dinner was not hot but edible. Rice side was only half full so I asked for more rice since it was so sparse. He brought a bowl that was full, but then charged $6 for it even tho he never mentioned an additional charge. Finally the appetizer came (hot) after dinner well underway. No manager ever came to check on us after sending the food back either. 
Service in the hotel has been fantastic but the restaurant does not follow the same customer service model. It is too bad because this restaurant was a low point in an otherwise very nice stay at the Westgate.
