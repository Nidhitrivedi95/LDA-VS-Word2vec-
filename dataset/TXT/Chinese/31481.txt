9qGnuoT91dg8WtVGVMbWAQ Been eating at Good China for over 20 years now. It started from 67th ave & Thomas then 91st ave & Olive, now this location. Always enjoy their food & they're prepared fresh every day. Spring egg rolled are made fresh not bought like most establishments & lettuce wraps are a must.
