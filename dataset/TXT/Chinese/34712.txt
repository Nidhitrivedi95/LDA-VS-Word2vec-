aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg Best duck in Vegas! We love coming here for delicious, authentic Chinese food. The only downfall is they're closed on the randomest day - Friday. They're also cash only so remember that before you go. 

All dishes are made fresh daily. They throw everything out that isn't eaten at the end of the night. 

There's so many yummy dishes here!! We always get the following: 

1. Roast Duck: BEST DUCK IN VEGAS!!! They run out of the duck quickly on busy days. The skin is crispy and fatty, the middle is juicy, tender and tasty! It's so good. You can eat it by itself or dip it in the sauce it comes with. You can get a whole duck to take home as well. 
2. Pork Belly: I've only had bad pork belly here once. Every other time it was tasty and on point. 
3. Combination fried rice: can't go wrong w/ any of the fried rice dishes here. 
4. Snow pea leaves vegetable
5. Steamed chicken 

Everything is fairly cheap here. You can easily enjoy a hearty meal for $15 or less depending on what you order. Of course, all larger dishes are big enough to share family style. 

The service is always good when I go w/ my mom or husband (both speak fluent Vietnamese or Cantonese). However, when it's just me there was a bit of a language barrier so they had a hard time understanding some of the questions I had about the dishes. I recommend reading the menu and naming the numbered item you want. The Food always comes out hot and fresh. 

The place gets busy for lunch and dinner. You'll be seated faster w/ a smaller group (2 people). Anything larger may mean you have to wait a bit. 

Overall, I love this place! Highly recommend if you want fast, yummy, authentic Chinese food  

Happy Dining, 

JT
