ABlNn6tyCTfjiKteYnp53g Wow. What can I say. Came in right at dinner time (6:30) and all the food was stale. I asked if they could make the food fresh and they tried to tell me that the food was fresh or that there was enough to fill the order and there clearly wasn't. The string bean chicken had been sitting for at least an hour (the green beans were super old). They have a new manager and he needs to be supervised. This place is run really poorly.
