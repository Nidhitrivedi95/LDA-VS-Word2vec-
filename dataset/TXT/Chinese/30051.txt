5 stars
1.  The preserved egg and pork porridge.  So amazing and perfectly salty and thick.  Love the meat and the flavorful eggs.  This is my favorite dish there.

2.  On the appetizer list they have a fried rice cake with egg that is really good.  Dip it in hot sauce and enjoy!

3.  Their red bean drink with grass jelly and ice cream.  Perfect way to end the meal.  Its big so share with friends

4 stars
1.  Wonton noodle soup.  Hits the spot but I've had had better
2.  Ton Yum fried rice - I like it but it tastes more like tomato friend rice.  I like sweet.  My friends were expecting this to be spicy though.  Also squid was a little slimy
3.  Clay pot spare ribs - also very sweet but good.  The one complaint is that there wasn't enough meat on the bones. 
4.  Their rice cake and ramen with beef dish.  I like it but tis sweet..so don't order if you like savory
5.  veggies - standard I guess

1.  Singapore noodles - good but wayyyy tooo salty.  Maybe it was just our batch

1 star
1.  Their beef with flat noodles.  This is such a staple in restaurants but they messed it up big time.  The noodles were slimy and the dish tasted like ALMOND flavoring.  SUch weird flavor.  Our whole table agreed.  Needed to put a lot of hotsauce and vinegar and soy sauce to mask the flavor.  When I asked the waitress about it she didn't know why it would taste like almonds.
