q_c2ZvPJJxYEFPoWMKY2vQ I absolutely needed to write a review about this restaurant as it was, by far, one of the best Japanese restaurants in Montreal. My standards for Japanese food elevated in the past month as I just came back from Japan. The taste, texture, and presentation really took me back Kyoto where I ate the best sashimi.

The decor had a modern elegant flow to it, from the hardwood floors, the mouldings on the walls, to the light fixtures, and out to the terrace. And that terrace!!! B-E-A-utiful. Be sure to make reservation to get a spot outside. 

The service was on point, nothing bad to say. We were seated quickly, our waiter took our orders as soon as we put down the menus and filled water glasses as they reached near the end. 

The price can add up very quickly but it's really worth every hard earned dollars.

I highly recommend for a special night out. Enjoy!!!
