pNp1FK8JqW8ZMA26YJGXYA Red House is THE BEST CHINESE FOOD in Scottsdale and Arizona! None compare to Red House. We love them! They are consistantly good through the many years we've been taking food out at least once a week. They also deliver. You can add 'extras' to your orders to customize (like extra chicken, pork, beef or whatever for $1 or $2 if you'd like.   
The vegetables in all the dishes we've ordered are FRESH, crunchy and so flavorful there's no wondering what it is. Wonderful egg drop soup, awesome homemade crunchy fried noodles that come with many dishes or you can buy a small bags for 50 cents.  
 The shredded pork dishes are especially delicious, 
I think anyone will be very happy with whatever they order. All of the cooks (chefs)  are Chinese and the help at the counter are friendly also. It's very Authentic, as this is American-Chinese style food.
