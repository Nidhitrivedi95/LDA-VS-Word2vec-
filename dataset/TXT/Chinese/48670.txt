C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ My grandson and I went there for dinner it was great!
Plenty of options for both of us.
Aaron loved the Mongolian noodles cooked to order they were perfect.The crab they serve is delicious as was the fresh sushi made in house.There is also a yummy salad bar for me and plenty desserts to choose from for Aaron.The owner Cindy came to our table to personally check that we were enjoying everything--WE WERE!!
Two big thumbs up for Cindy and Buffet@Asia 
We will come back soon.
