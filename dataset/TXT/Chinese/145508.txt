S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ Vietnamese Sandwiches. This place was rocking Yelp with Sandwich reviews and I decided to give it a shot. Now mind you I love Vietnamese Sandwiches and having spent a lot of time in Saigon over the last 5 years I am seriously spoiled as the street food in VN is amazing. I was pleased with what I found here.

I did the beef (which isn't really in Vietnam as cows are rare), and the pork which is really common. I like them both but they were not quite the same style as the street food in Saigon. It was tasty and they spiced it up a little bit for me but I would prefer hotter. I will be going back tonight in fact and trying a couple more different kinds. Its a good place to do takeout.
