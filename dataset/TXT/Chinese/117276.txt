NdpvGGF4cLrdnA6ydSZz3g Went there today around 7pm, it was Saturday so they were definitely busy. Got seated around 8:15pm. Both food and service were alright. But one thing to keep in mind is that they DON'T take credit card, even though it said that it does on yelp. Also, you get ice-cream after the meal but only one. I was told by the waiter that they charge for extra ice-cream. Which I find a little ridiculous considering the fact that it wasn't stated on the menu, also for the price of 30$/person I think the ice-cream could have been unlimited. But on that note, probably one of the best green-tea ice-cream I've ever had!
