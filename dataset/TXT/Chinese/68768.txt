I came here with my fiancé and his BIL who was in town on business. Since the BIL is a vegetarian it can be challenging to find places that we'll all enjoy eating. I remembered that I had bookmarked this location and everyone was in agreement. It's a buffet style make your own dish place so you can choose what type of meat,  veggies,  sauces and either rice or noodles that you want. The key to success here is creating a sauce you like. If you want seafood ask for it,  they keep it in the back ;)
