X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Came here last night with some new acquaintance friends.  We were on the guest list and still waited for about 45 minutes.  Once you get in it is like a haunted ride inside where I feel someone will scare me from nowhere.  The music was nice and loud and makes one want to dance.  Only problem is that it's packed and no room to actually dance.  Lots of people standing around and lots of people already crammed on the small dance floor.  We came here to listen to some testa guy dj. I don't know him as I somewhat live in a cave.  I left early as I got bored and couldn't breathe in there.  Mind you I'm not in my 20's anymore so I think it would be fun for people in there 20's.  I would not recommend this place unless you like being smashed against the wall by bodies.
