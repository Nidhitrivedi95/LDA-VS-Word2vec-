X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg It's a global chain, that said they have some winner like the duck salad. Every location is very sexy. You can go neat in jeans. It's hip and the cocktails are AMAZING. Drama on the drinks best enjoyed at the bar but it's dependable but not perfect. Hakka noodles woefully over cooked but still tasty in Vegas. Been to London and Vegas locations.
