-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ Don't judge a book by it's cover. Place doesn't look like much but you'll love it. Never disappoints! Love the jackpot roll & yummy bbq chicken combo! So good. Also worth trying is the honey walnut shrimp & the teriyaki bowls, veggies are fresh & crunchy. Brown rice is a nice alternative option as well. Love this place. Think I'm gonna go there now. LOL.
