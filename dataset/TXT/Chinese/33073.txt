The service was not great.  Took a while to even get waters and our server acted as though she could not be bothered to even look at us to take our order.  

The food selection was not that great either.  The food was diner style.  Items like traditional breakfast, cheese burger and chicken fried steak.  I ordered the cheese burger and I am so sad that I did.  The bun was so stale and the burger was like something that had been pulled from a freezer and thrown on the griddle.  it had no seasoning at all and the cheese was very waxy looking.  The fries were cold and stale. My co-workers' food did not look that appetizing either.  

Another thing that bothered me was that it was located right in the middle of the smoky casino.  The ventilation was poor and the restaurant smelled like smoke and was not appetizing.  It did not look well kept or clean.  

So, basically...do not go here.
