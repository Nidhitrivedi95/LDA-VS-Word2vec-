FIs33y1BVzzcfrDDHh8O5g I love eating at this place! It is definitely one of the best Thai places in Henderson. I always eat their Pad Thai, yellow curry, and even their Fried Catfish with red curry sauce. One time when I ate there, I was craving for Panang curry with catfish, which was a dish I only ate when I was back in California, and asked them if they would make it. They did, and it tasted just as good as the one back home! I have eaten at many Thai restaurants in the area (even the new one on Eastern/Richmar plaza), but this is the best. I always take friends and family here to eat when they're craving for Thai food. They are very generous with their portions, and even give you jello or mixed fruits at the end for dessert (and free of charge). I love eating here!

*Update: 5/31: I just found out that they do lunch specials for $5.95, and even on WEEKENDS! Gotta give them 5 stars now!
