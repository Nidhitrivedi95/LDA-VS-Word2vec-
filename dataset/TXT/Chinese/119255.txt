Nsi49BE_XsjJ0oOXwhH8hA The first time I ever ate here someone had thrown up their food on the side of the entrance. It was so much vomit it looked like two people did it. No lie!  
I couldn't believe that it wasn't a priority for them to clean up since it was a HUGE customer deterrent to say the least. After leaving the mediocre tasting Buffett, and seeing puke I never returned. Maybe other locations are better.
