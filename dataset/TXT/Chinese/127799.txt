pdy6EAcJvZks1hKogxOj6Q Consistently good food! I've been going there for years off and on trying new places that might have an interesting dish,however I always find myself going back to this little gem. The standards for me are roast pork fried rice, lo mein, soups wonton egg drop or hot and sour the egg rolls are good. Their orange chicken and honey garlic chicken are a family favorite. Actually we've never had a bad dish from here. I am originally from NY and very picky about chinese food this place brings me close to home.
