n72smZw1iVORdnjGfFT0FQ I frequently visit this place!

Why?
Flexible late hours, wide selection of food, real HK style food and drinks.  

My family got to know one of the servers who's worked there for over 15 years, Mark, that always recommends excellent dishes for us everytime.

They open until 2-3am depending on the day of the week.

We've tried many things on the menu, and they're always made well on a consistent basis.  If you come earliar in the night before 9pm, you'll be able to order BBQ meat (duck, pork, etc.)
