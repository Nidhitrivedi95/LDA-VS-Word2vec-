PgaHjsWV3whvHF1CHU1rZg This place had amazing food! We ordered two dishes and got so much food that it was amazing! The food tasted extremely authentic and since I have been to China that means a lot to me!! The staff is extremely nice and helpful. They have just started to use a new computer system so the service was lagging a little bit but the wait for a table was only 15 minutes and it did not take long to get our food at all. The atmosphere  is great for such a small restaurant. I would recommend this hidden cleveland gem to anyone.
