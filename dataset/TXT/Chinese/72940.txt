Fhjzzo7ranqqgEdbiPD50Q Randomly stumbled upon this restaurant when I was going to Big Lots. The location can make it look scary lol but I promise once you go in it isn't so bad. I ordered to Teriyaki Chicken and it was really good. The sauce wasn't too sweet like some other places. The lady that work's there is really nice as well. The prices were also very reasonable. I liked that their lunch menu is bigger than most places. I will definitely be going back soon.
