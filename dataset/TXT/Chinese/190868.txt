YpnvKqeVD7dqZ9Mr0SGw6A Always consistent food. Although my chicken Mongolian was lacking in chicken.. Way too many mushrooms. I ordered it to go, and sat too eat a bit, and I had no napkin or fork. I would have been really upset when I got back to work with them missing from my bag. It I'd to go, isn't that a normal thing to add?
