SdUBFhIzwpN5IZfcr9jc-g I come to Toronto about 4 to 6 times a year and every trip I will go out of my way to come to this place just for their Xiao Long Bao's!!! By far the best I have had outside of china.
Owners now me by now and that I come from out of town. Even their spice is to die for. Chive pie is amazing along with all the other dumplings. Thank god we don't have a place like this as I would be part of the furniture. 
This place is truly a hole in the wall. It's in a mall. But everything is freshly done.
