RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg Ok, so this place rated at least 4 stars for a long, long time.  My family and I loved going here for the great sushi and friendly service.  The last two times though we couldn't help but notice that the place has become dirty.  There was dust piled up at least a quarter inch thick on several of the areas around the tables, the walls had flecks of dried food stains, the plates were dirty, and on both visits the bathrooms were DEPLORABLE.  This went from being one of our favorite spots to a place we don't go to anymore.  Clean it up, Ta Ta, and we will give you another shot!

Ta Ta you fixed it!  Cleaned up and came correct!  We have been back and appreciate the improvements!
