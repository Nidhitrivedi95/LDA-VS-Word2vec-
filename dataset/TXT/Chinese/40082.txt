aY-lZvoTHAFl9k6dcfcAxQ The lunch menu is simple and a good value.  Any meal is $7, choose an entre, comes with soup, spring role and choice of rice.  

Pros: we all had chicken meals, meat quality and taste were good (some Chinese places have poor quality meats, not Chens).  Our server Jackie had a sharp wit, took good care of us, made us laugh.  Taught us a new trick with the chopstick wrapper.

Cons: no decorations, and music selection a bit too pop for a good Chinese meal.

Overall impression: Chens offers good food at a very good price, but the ambiance could be better.

Sister's View: "charming and filling."
Other sister's view: "I feel like we're in a garage listening to the wrong radio station."
