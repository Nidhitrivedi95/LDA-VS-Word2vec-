sYDc1TENwCKLHvprBa5rLw I'm so bummed after reading such great reviews. Delivery took 40 minutes, but was estimated at 45-60. The food was sub par at best. I had an unidentified meat in my wontons, no breading on my Kung Pao chicken, and a flavorless fried rice, with no eggs! There was so much filler in my chicken too, I definitely won't return. Half my entree was squash! Maybe it's different on the east coast, but I don't recommend the food or delivery since you have a minimum of $15 and a delivery fee!
