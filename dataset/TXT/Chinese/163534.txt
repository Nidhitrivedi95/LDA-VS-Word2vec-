URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg My husband and another friend went for an early dinner on a Sunday. We were there by 5pm and the place was already hopping! When you order the dinner for 2+, you get a delicious chilled chicken salad, a choice of soup & some of the best crab puffs in town. My friend and I enjoyed the Chicken w/ Snow Peas & Walnut Shrimp. No complaints! Hot, fresh and plenty to take home for lunch at work the next day. My husband enjoyed the Sweet & Sour Chicken. Big pieces of moist, white chicken. We drove from 1-17 and the Carefree Hwy to check this place out. Well worth the trip!
