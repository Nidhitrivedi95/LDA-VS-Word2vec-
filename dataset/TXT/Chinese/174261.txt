wcFscp4-QH0PJeIW1EOQEQ Sushi here is cheaper than most places and it's pretty decent too. (By the way, sushi for dine-in is 50% off right now) 

Service is okay, I usually only see one waitress though since it's not too busy. They could also work on cleaning up the dining area a bit.

Overall, it's average like other Chinese restaurants in the area. It just has a bonus of sushi/tempura.
