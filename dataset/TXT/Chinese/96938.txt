joMyW9KcBEsHJxQuAMulaQ A limited selection of games compared to Snakes and Lattes, but I do like that this is a little less crowded. Service is good, although a little strange when we entered and as a party of 6 requested to be seated at the tables, but the server mentioned that we needed to sit at the couches in case it gets busy later. Pardon me ma'am, but it is 7pm on a Monday night and you only have one other table taken up...ain't nobody showin up now to start a party.

Decent food options as well I must say, so all in all they are just OK. I would still go back to Snakes and Lattes however for a games night experience.
