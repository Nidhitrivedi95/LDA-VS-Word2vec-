hlDcfzRGfmSmL5LpYcRqKA My husband and I tried this place for the first time. I ordered the beef and broccoli and it was amazing! My husband ordered the orange chicken and he ate it all (that in itself was amazing). 
We also ordered the jalapeño shrimp and we both really enjoyed it! 
I would definitely recommend china wok and I would definitely go back!!
