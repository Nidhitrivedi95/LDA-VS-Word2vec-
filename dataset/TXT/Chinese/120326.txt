O0zyXuEw_aojAK5ILW6WJA I came here for dinner and I was craving dumplings for a while. I read the reviews on YELP beforehand and most of them were good so we decided to give this restaurant a try. It wasn't busy when we arrived and it's a small restaurant. There's a wide selection of items on their menu and quite extensive. The specialty here is of course dumplings so we ordered the pork and leek steamed dumplings, pan fried pork and shrimp dumplings, Shanghai rice cake and green onion pancake. For the dumplings, pretty good price as you get 12 dumplings for pan fried for $7 and 15 for steamed dumplings at $7. The Pan Fried ones were a bit greasy but still good but my favorite were definitely the steamed ones. The green onion pancake was okay but I've had better and same with the rice cakes. The chef and staff are friendly and nice. I also ordered a bottle of Canadian and it was only $3. Talk about cheap domestic beer!! I definitely love the cheap prices here and it's worth the dumpling craving if you have one. Our total bill for these dishes for 2 people was satisfying at $30. Definitely worth checking this restaurant out if you want dumplings.
