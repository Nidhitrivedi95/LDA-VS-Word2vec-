fgm7DKVy1wuod6FTPvZqRw 7:30 p.m. - I made my order at 5:30. Chicken fried rice, cream cheese puffs, and a sprite. Easy. 1.5 hours later, I called to see where my order was, and a young lady asked my name, took a second, and told me "IT IS ON IT'S WAY!"
Great.
30 minutes go by, nothing.
I call again, she asks for my name, I hear "It's on it's way" in the background, then silence, then "we never received your order"

WHAT?! Then why did you tell me it was on the way? I could have made my order at 7 when I called and gotten the food by now. Nope. They wanted to lie to keep me happy.

I am pregnant and on a medication where I cannot eat after 8 pm. 

7:40 - Got my meal
The chicken is all dark meat., and for a "large" it's not that much. Theres practically nofilling in the cream cheese puffs and my sprite was a fountain drink in a Styrofoam cup. Not trhilled.  Empire Asian Bistro was better. I'm from New York, I know good Chinese food.
