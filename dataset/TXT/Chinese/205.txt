-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was here.  We ordered the shrimp summer rolls as appetizers, pork Mon nurong and (beef) Bo kho stew.  The peanut sauce with the rolls were very tasty. I enjoyed my stew very much (awesome addition of carrots) and my husband loved the grilled flavor of the pork.

The price for being downtown and service were great as well. Even though the service was slow due to the numerous people here pre-game, the staff were very courteous.

My only complaint may be that the spring rolls were filled with too many noodles and the lettuce wasn't as fresh.  If fresh basil or romaine were used, it may make these stand out more.  However, it was great to eat here.
