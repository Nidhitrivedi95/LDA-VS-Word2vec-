O_Yi95nUeeqSudiMlUfttQ Food was alright, but the staff are simply impossible. Waitress that waited our table screamed at patrons when they said that they receive what they ordered. She then followed by yelling some more and telling them to never come back. Same waitress took it upon herself to dictate the amount I would tip her and wrote it on the receipt. Th cashier put that amount in the cash register, at which point I said that it is not the amount I choose to tip. Very bad experience. Don't go there.
