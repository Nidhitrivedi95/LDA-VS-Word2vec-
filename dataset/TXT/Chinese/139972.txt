R-9gUTN8BJIDqGgzXEmq3Q We don't go there anymore. They had a nice lunch special and there were just a few things to order on that menu for a reasonable price. We only went there for dinner once because the same thing as the lunch menu seemed to cost about twice as much.
We really just got tired of the waitress who was trying to be friendly, maybe thinking it would get her more tips, but she was so incredibly annoying, "You haven't been here in a long time, why? What have you been doing" blah blah blah every time in our faces every 2 minutes, interrupting our conversations and sticking her nose in our business constantly while we were just trying to choke down a $5 plate of Fragrent Chicken.
The food was okay, the prices were okay (for lunch, not dinner). But really, if someone is sitting there trying to read for a few moments at lunch time, do you really have to bug them constantly? 
Lee's Garden took over after a much better Thai restaurant failed. The Thai restaurant was wonderful, the food was the best thing that ever happened to Sauk City, but I guess the locals didn't appreciate curries and asian eggplant. What a shame, it was exquisite. Lee's Garden is like many other american chinese restaurants, a business run by non-cooks who follow the predictable pattern.
