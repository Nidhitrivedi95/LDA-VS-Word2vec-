T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw Horrible, tasteless, bland, overpriced Chinese food. Both times I ate at this PF Chang's were terrible. Good thing both times were free or else I would be even more pissed. Also, need to do something about their slow service. I had ordered online for a pick-up several hours in advance. I still had to wait 15-20 minutes. 

You think they would at least make one of their signature dishes palatable. Wrong! Their chicken lettuce wraps was one of the worst meals I've had in Vegas!
