eMTE-wqpk_YWaV3mf7Ii3A I came here for a school reunion with a guest list of 12 people.

Upon arriving we only had four people and the host told us that we were not allowed to sit at our table until at least half of our party has arrived.  The waiting area is very small and cramped so we decided to wait outside.

This is not my first time at a spring rolls, I have been to a spring rolls the first time it opened in Toronto but I didn't have a great experience but maybe things have changed.

Going through the menu I realized they have a variety of Vietnamese Thai and Japanese food.   Not quite sure if this is a good or bad thing.

I ended up ordering the famous pad Thai with chicken.   It was hard to judge whether it took longer than usual for the food to come because of our large party size, but the food arrived a bit longer than i would have expected.    The waiter also kept on forgetting our drinks.

When my pad Thai arrived I noticed off the bat that the color was not authentic.   The chicken didn't have much flavor and I felt like everything tasted like ketchup.   Though I finished the whole plate because I was hungry but I really wasn't sure what I was eating.

The environment is set up kind of weirdly. There are weird open spaces and this weird light decoration in the middle.  The acoustics are designed poorly because it was really loud in there and hard to talk to even the person next to me.

I don't think I will be coming back here again anytime soon.
