Av5toUG7wweXfiX6FW4F0A I have never wrote a yelp review however,I felt it very necessary after coming to Pepper Cafe. Albert the owner is personable, friendly, inviting and all other warm and fuzzy adjectives one can think of. There aren't many places in Gilbert where you can get solid Pho which is why I am so thrilled I found this place. The Pho Thai and the Vietnamese spring rolls are awesome! The broth in the pho is tasty, homemade and hot.  It's clean, simple but the food is legit and the service is even better. We will be back. Again and Again!
