mDUQCaoZTNsouuxJ2KlAoQ I saw their advertisement recently on tv.  I've told myself many times that I wouldn't do a buffet style dinner ever again since I try to avoid the sin of gluttony.  But on a lazy Monday night, I decided to give it a try.  Yes, I know I'm a sinner.  Anyway, it was a cold night but there's plenty of parking.  That's a plus on the convenience side. The decor was nice and ambiance quite relaxing.  I don't know why other yelpers were complaining about slow service.   The service was fine.  I admit the food wasn't incredibly amazing to the point that I would dream about it later.  However, the sashimi salmon that I ordered was fresh and nicely cut.  I pretty much tried a little bit of everything on the menu.  Some of the dishes were a bit too sweet for me.  However, overall it was a positive dinning experience.  I think I gained 5 lbs from that dinner alone!  Time to hit the gym.
