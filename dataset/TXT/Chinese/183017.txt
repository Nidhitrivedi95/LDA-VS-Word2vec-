Xl70366GI5Qao-ORQYCofA Came to Las Vegas on vacation with the fam and wanted to eat the best of the everything out here. My husband and I look for restaurants with 4/5 stars that where $ to $$ at price point range and everything that had 4/5 were closed on Sunday. China One was in the area and open so we checked it out. First thing I noticed was no apparent smell of delicious cooking food ingulfing the surrounding parking area or worse nothing inside the restaurant either never the less we stayed ordered bbq pork it was smothered in sauce and looked little appetizing, but to my surprise it was tasty i gave it a 3.5. We also ordered Orange chicken which was also tasty i gave it a 4. We ordered house special chow mein and house fried rice they both were a 3.5 tasty but could use a bit more flavor. You would have to smother it in sweet and sour sauce, soy sauce, hot mustard which they don't have, or chilli sauce  It was edible and did the job for the moment but it's a pass only visit if others are closed.
