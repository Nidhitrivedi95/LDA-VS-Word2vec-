oAngC9V69vyzBVYwKEJQaw First review but I had to. This is now going to be my new to go to Chinese food restaurant for delivery. My fiance's teriyaki bowl was good. The food arrived hot and was packed well. I had the combination appetizer and orange chicken with rice. The deliver was as expected during the dinner rush. I loved the food and would recommend to anyone living in Henderson.
