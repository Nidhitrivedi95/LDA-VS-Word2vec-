cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg I ordered for carry out. When I opened it up it looked awful. It looked like no other Chinese food Ive ever had. I ordered sweet and sour pork but it was cold, pressed chewy chicken that was flat and rubbery. I ordered pot stickers and they were disgusting, rubbery, and burned on the bottom. The filling just plopped right out of them. I also ordered chow mein and fried rice. The rice was white in color with no flavor. The chow mein was cold and gross. When I walked in, the patrons eating were Asian. I figured this is a very good sign. But it truly was below sub par food. I really wish I could get my $32 back. Very disappointing!!!!!
