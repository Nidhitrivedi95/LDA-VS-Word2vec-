WqXrmUVy5Ay3Scn4GPM9Ug Friendly staff, and good food. They can discuss and pair beer quite well. Atmosphere was fine, if a little sterile for my taste. Food was very nice and, I would say, gourmet pub food. 

Nothing spectacular, but a great place to grab a beer and good interesting food, especially for the bangers and mash aficionado. It seems different local sausages are sourced weekly or more. Portions are smallish, but I am largish.
