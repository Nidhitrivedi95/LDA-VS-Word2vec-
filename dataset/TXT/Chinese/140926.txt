RAKSBqeNb-p_ZABwAWH_jA I have been here a few times since my first visit.  Their vegetable egg rolls are really good.  It's hard to find a good veggie egg roll and I was pretty impressed with the ones here.  The lo mein, which I always get everywhere has not been the best the past 2 visits.  I get it plain with no vegetable or anything...just plain lo mein...and even at lunch it's at least $8.  I asked for extra sauce on it  and they said it would be an extra $2. Really? Not worth it.  They are NOODLES....plain noodles.  Ridiculous to charge so much in my opinion. When the lo mein comes out without the extra sauce (which I did not feel like paying extra for) it was extremely dry. I haven't been 100% satisfied my last 2 trips.
