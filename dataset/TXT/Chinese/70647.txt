f9ERQpAPOAMv5Ay0kyD3Yw I come to this place often, the foods are really good. The only problem that I am having is that there is this skinny tall busboy or server always with a kind of a beanie on he is never friendly and when he deliver food to us he just kinda slam it on the table. The other night I was there and I heard he got into an argument with the owner as the owner was asking him to do something and he refused. He was yelling and being very rude. Overall I will definitely come back to dine in.
