POiWEckMIOqX7TgBxXgCzw Amazing food, great value, world class service by very friendly people. The food is always good, spicy when you want it, and always at the level you tell them. My generals chicken almost had me crying just the way I like it. Also the manager and I got to talk abour how messed up the white privileged world is and how much it can suck to be a person of color in the states, especially as immigrants.
