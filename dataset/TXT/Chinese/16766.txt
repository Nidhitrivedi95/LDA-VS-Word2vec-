4egAyQgylMPJgngmNGCloA this place is actually freaking good . had dinner here with my family and i'm pleased to say that this small family joint was legit. the service was incredible , the food is worth the money . we got the dinner (B) combo and it feed the 6 of us for only 60$ . we also added another dish to the order . the bill came up to 78$ but still had to bring food home ! please keep in mind that this place is very small and only has about 4 tables. 

but overall the highlight part of this dinner was the "water" yes hear me out . the water here was actually refreshen ! usually chinese/congee joints would give you those lukewarm lemon dirty looking water ! well not here ! when we asked for water they did not disappoint !!! 

highly recommended ! will be back !
