jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg All I can say is WOW!! Well maybe I can say more than that, AUTHENTIC, FRESH, FRIENDLY, DELICOUS. They brought out our seafood alive prior to cooking so that we knew that our meal was fresh. EAT HERE!! It is only minutes from the strip. The staff at these off srtip places are so greatful to have you there they make the experience one of a kind with their attentiveness. SUCH AMAZING CHINESE FOOD!!
