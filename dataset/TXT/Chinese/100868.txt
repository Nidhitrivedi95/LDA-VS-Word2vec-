K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw I travel all the way from downtown for them!  We've been going ever since they opened.  The wait is always between 30min-2hours, but he tells us so and we always pre-order via telephone.  We know the drill.  He's always so polite and you see him talking with all the "aunties".

We get the same thing every time:
Char Kwey Teow  - mixed noodles, spicy, better than anything we ever got in Malaysia
Curry Laksa - mixed noodles, spicy, best of Toronto (but I'm sorry I like Yee Fung's in Malaysia more)
Chicken Satay -  awesome...if you can get it.
Kuih - always sold out by noon.

Char Kwey Teow....mmm...I want some just thinking of it.

The demand is definitely outpacing supply now though.  There are times we can call for an hour nonstop and not have the phone picked up because they are just that busy.  The wait gets a little longer and the lines get a little bigger each year.  I hope they can share the family recipe with and hire one more chef.
