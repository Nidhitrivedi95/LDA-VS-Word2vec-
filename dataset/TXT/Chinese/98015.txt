JQWIZ8MT-VGZzO5W5XCB5Q We went here this week as part of our Monday night dinner club from work. I ordered the Basil Chicken, and it was pretty good, as was the Veggie Egg Roll I got for a side. Others, however, were disappointed in more traditional Americanized Chinese fare, including Mixed Lo Mein.

We didn't ask for the traditional Cantonese menu, so I would like to try something from there when I go back. Overall, I enjoyed my food, but it wasn't anything spectacular. I liked the dining area and the service.

The price is relatively good, in the $10-$15 range you would expect. Not a bad place to eat out for a casual dinner, but it's not somewhere you need to frequent for Charlotte Chinese.
