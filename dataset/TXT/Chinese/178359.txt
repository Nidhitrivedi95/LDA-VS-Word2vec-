X3ixtoD0xjiVtxROlU_2wg I was uncomfortable at first before coming here because it was my first time getting a massage, but I felt completely relaxed as I was getting one. I liked how you could choose your level of pressure and what spots you wanted the therapist to focus on. I also really liked the closed off rooms and hot stones!! Although it's a bit pricey, I think it's an amazing place!
