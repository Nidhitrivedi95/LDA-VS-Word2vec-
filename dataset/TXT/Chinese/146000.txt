S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A We like this place.  The noodles are always fresh (they make them, and you can watch them!), and the food always tasty.  The quality of the service depends on how busy they are and which server you get.  If they're busy the service is spotty even with the better server.  This visit we got the server who doesn't seem to want to be there.  She's mostly indifferent but if you ask for stuff she will bring it.

The food is good.  Some of the best noodles anywhere.  We will keep coming back as long as that is true.
