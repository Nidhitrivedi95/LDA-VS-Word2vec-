xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I really don't know what is going on with this place. 3 years ago it used to be a favorite of mine. While their crab rangoon and smoothies are still fantastic, their food is downright disgusting. Their meat is completely bizarre. It is shaped like confetti and contains NO MOISTURE whatsoever. Totally dry and almost uneatable. I wish that they would get their act together because this place used to be a great spot in Oakland. 

ALSO if you are eating at this place during the winter months, make sure to request a table in the back past the cash register. If you are seated anywhere in the front area, you will get a large gust of cold air every time someone opens the door, which is frequent.
