3PhF188adiC8ZutKRP9gyQ When I'm craving Soy Bean Pudding...this is the place!

My girlfriend being Bulgarian is picky and she loves the fresh soy bean pudding made from scratch (allow 10 mins).  She loves reading the menu cause it never makes sense with straight Chinese to English translation.  It's always cute to share their bamboo container.  Usually $4.30 for a bowl of soy bean pudding but the fresh soy bean pudding for two person is $8.00 (Deal). They do have a 4 person bamboo container.  Their herbal tea is always good.  They have free WiFi and open late.

Best part, it's close to me. Markham isn't far from Richmond Hill but it's also off Highway 7.
