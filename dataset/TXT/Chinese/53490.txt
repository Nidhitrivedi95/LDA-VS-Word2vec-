cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg I primarily come here for the Xiao Long Bao, which is probably their best dish here. The beef pie and pan-fried dumplings were good, but overly greasy. The bean curd was overly salty. 

Not the cleanest, but expected for a hole in the wall type of place. Decent, fast service.
