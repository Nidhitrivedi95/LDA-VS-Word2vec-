15 Word Review: "A fun experience with good food made better by leaving your jacket in your car!"

Generally when you start walking towards a restaurant and realize you can't see inside because of the steam from the food inside, it should be a good indicator to go inside with as few items of clothing as possible unless you enjoy doing laundry! 

However regardless of this fact, Rolling Pot is a great hot pot (or Shabu Shabu, whichever you prefer) place and if you've never been it's a fun experience!

1) You start out by ordering your broth in which your food will be cooked in
2) Order up all the items you want (raw meats - pork, lamb, beef, shrimp, veggies, greens, etc, etc)
3) Walk up to the "Make-Your-Own-Sauce" counter and mix as many possible types of sauces as you can and pray it turns out for the better
4) DUMP EVERYTHING IN!!!
5) Consume with your specialty sauce and enjoy!!

Good thing was the food tasted really good but I would've preferred if this place was cleaner. They served us water with murky glasses (others with raw beef chunks on them) and a lot of the place looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages!

And I'm taking another 0.5 star off for the rather slow and off service. Given the place was full and it's an AYCE (all-you-can-eat) place so the servers are running around but I was hoping they would be a bit more attentive.

All in all though, Rolling Pot provided a group of us Yelpers with a good time and good food so I can't complain! And I'm sure I'll be back here again soon!
