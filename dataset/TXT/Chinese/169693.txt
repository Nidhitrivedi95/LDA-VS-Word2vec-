You obviously can't compare it to the huge selection of board and card games at Snakes & Lattes but games at Utopia are still decent to play. This cafe also has mahjong, poker and darts to play, which makes up a bit for the difference in game selection.

House rules requiring every guest purchasing food or drinks every few hours are very reasonable considering that they make money off that to stay open. It feels almost as if their business exists because they simply want people to have fun and not because they're trying to make a lot of money.

By the way, please don't order the rose carnation aloe tea from the flower hot tea section. That drink was just so bitter even with the sugar syrup. The honey tangerine tea, on the other hand, was excellent.
