jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow I went here two days ago with my sister and we had a good first experience service was good almost all the food we tried was good tried 13 different Chinese dishes and only one of them was just okay I'll definitely be going here again probably the best Chinese buffet I've had so far up here
