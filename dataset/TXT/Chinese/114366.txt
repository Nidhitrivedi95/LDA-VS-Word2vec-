MWJg4LxOm9c7VGi1KrL5Ug So this is my local Chinese takeout spot. I'm trying to compare this place to Swatow or other notable downtown joints, but for the area, this place is great. Price is right, lots of spicy Szechwan if you want and a good selection.  The only reason I wouldn't give it 5/5, is that the place inside looks weird. I wish the owners would change the interior and get rid of the strange jewelry display, bracelets and even the odd clothing for sale. Do not eat in. Get it to go, and enjoy a great meal at home. Word to wise, pick the family meal. Dinner for 4 is really big. Enough for 5 or 6. Dinner for 6 can easily feed 8-9 and still have leftovers.
