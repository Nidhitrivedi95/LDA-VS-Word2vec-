HTAAMVDZ4P0VX5F9euJBoA If I want great, authentic Chinese food then this is where I will go. If i want to try something adventurous this is where I go. They have great lunch specials that are on the menue, your usual American stuff, orange chicken, some fish dishes, some teriaka stuff. If you want to try something fun then you can ask the waiter to translate some of the specials that are posted on the wall in Chinese. I have never had something I did not like from here. Top marks for service, flavor and adventure.
