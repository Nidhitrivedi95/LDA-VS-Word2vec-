OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw In the past, I've practically always gone to Orchid's Garden for dim sum, but their service lacks. They're not approachable, but over here at Chang's, it's a lot better.

I haven't been here that much and I haven't been back here in awhile (haven't been eating dim sum) but I came today with a friend. I like their choice of foods, more than I did the last time. Either they didn't have it then or I never noticed it or something.

I didn't have to really wait when I asked for anything this water. They were also really busy so they didn't really check up on us or anything of the like. I got all the food I wanted to eat pretty much. Next visit, I'll update and see if anything changes :). For now, 4 stars!
