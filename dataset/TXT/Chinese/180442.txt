X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Never going back to this place! I bought tickets and still waited in line for over 2 hours. If I had known I was going to wait on line for that long I wouldn't have worn heels, because by the time I got inside I was miserable. It was super crowded and impossible to move around, mind you it was a Wednesday. I sat down, where I saw others sitting and the bouncer came over to tell me to get off. After a few hours I took off my shoes, and the bouncer came over and told me I could have them off as long as I wasn't going to be walking around, I told him I wasn't going anywhere and he said okay and walked away. 10 min later, another security guy came over, grabbed my arm and said "put your shoes on right now!", I explained to him the other guy said it was okay and he said "I'm his boss, you have exactly ONE minute to put your shoes on, I'M COUNTING" Super rude, he didn't have to talk to me like that, I then grabbed all 7 of my friends and we left. I've lived in Vegas before, been to almost all the nightclubs, and have NEVER been treated this way before. Just a heads up.
