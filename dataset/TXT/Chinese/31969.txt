No one knew any answers, they kept having to go to 1 lady to ask. Anyways we took our order home and it was literally inedible. My son and grandson ordered the orange chicken. We've never seen greasier food. The fried rice was so bland and tasteless. I ordered the hot and sour soup and it did not have a pinch of spice not even salt. It was water and starch with some tufo and other stuff. I also ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce and it was disgusting. The egg white was saw and the starch was uncooked. I ate the eggroll and spiced up the soup but I wish I didn't. Oh my stomach didn't like it at all. We all had bad stomachs all night. NEVER AGAIN.
