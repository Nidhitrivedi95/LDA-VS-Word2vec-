VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q Upgrading my rating on this establishment to 3. Tried alternate broth this time - Ginger and pepper fish soup. It's definitely a marked improvement over the original broth which was bland. The soup has stronger kick without being overwhelming. 

One important tips when visiting this establishment: Don't overwhelm your soup with toppings. Two toppings are sufficient and preferably either the fish puff and fish fillet that way the broth and the fish works together (instead of having fish soup mixed with beef).

Overall an OK place to have quick in and out dinner.
