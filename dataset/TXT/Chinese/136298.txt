QG56Fy7JQ_9XgAwtj7fhjw I went there on a saturday night with 2 other friends. We had the Szechuan cold dish Fuqifeipian (lungs), the pan grilled beef, and a spicy chicken dish.
The service was efficient, and our dishes arrived quickly. 
The dishes were all really spicy, but good. Really enjoyed eating there, would return.
