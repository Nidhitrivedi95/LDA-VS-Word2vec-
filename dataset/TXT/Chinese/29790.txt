966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA Ok, I really feel like this could be a 4 star spot, but I had some service issues and food disappointments.

Let's start off with the negatives and "meh's" :

Ordered the Curry Duck :

Yeah, that's Roasted Duck...not Curry Duck lol.  When I brought it to the servers attention, he laughed and said it was not curry...obviously.  No offer to replace the dish or fix the misunderstanding...

And this duck was super lean...not too much meat on those bones, and the little that was there felt overcooked.  The meat didn't have too much juices on those bones, and the skin was so crispy that I couldn't enjoy it and ate around it.

Pork short ribs Stir-Fried with Bitter Melon :

My first time eating bitter melon...it's bitter LOL. The pork ribs were good but tiny.  I'm not holding the bitter melon against the dish, because it is probably made well for what it is...just for the people that aren't familiar with it like me, be prepared to most likely not enjoy it.

Wonton with Egg Noodles and BBQ Pork :

It wasn't bad...wasn't great.  Just meh to me.  

French Style Beef Cubes with Black Pepper Sauce & Tomato Rice :

This was not bad...I didn't find it very tender, but good taste!  I thought the beef was a little chewy, but it's not a bad choice overall with the tomato rice.

The goods :

Salt and Pepper Shrimp :

This was the tapas portion, which is a good value at only $5...less than $1 a shrimp.  I have definitely had better elsewhere, but this was good bang for your buck variety, and since I was the only one eating them, I didn't feel like I had to splurge on a $12-13 platter of them.

Rib Eye Bao Burgers :

Probably my second favorite dish here!  Some may find the marinade too sweet overall, but I enjoyed it, and the bao themselves were super fluffy and soft.

Hong Kong Style Mango Crepe :

Great taste here...large chunks of mango inside!  I would recommend it, but liked this better :

Thai Iced Tea Float :

This was great!  Dessert in a glass :)

And best for last....Salt and Pepper Fried Calamari! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wendys-noodle-cafe-las-vegas?select=AomUQn8DvGqHZHpqc4UTrg

This was great...my highlight of the night. Very juicy insides and plenty of flavor.  This will be a must order if/when we come back for more.


I will give them another try...hope I can bump the review.  But there was a lot of "meh" and "I've had better" that distracted me from fully enjoying the experience here...the misunderstanding on the order and how they handled the problem was the icing on the cake.
