jKxES7iLV63H_PfyGVGIDw I think this is my favorite Chinese/Taiwanese eatery in Campustown. I first thought it was a slower but higher quality and price restaurant but I was wrong (in a good way)! First, the food quality is indeed good. I chose the Mongolian beef with broccoli and the chicken with snow peas. The sauce was good (not too thick or not too soupy) and the broccoli was crisp and not too cooked. The chicken with snow peas was really a pleasant treat as well. The veggies rivaled the taste of the chicken (always a good sign). The food came out surprisingly quick and the price was almost as low as the lesser quality places nearby. I regret I did not take advantage of Lai Lai Wok more often while I was in grad school. The food was better but it is kind of far away from campus as well but I think the food is worth it for sure!
