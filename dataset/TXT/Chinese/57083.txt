I ordered delivery on a Friday in the 11p hour (they close at 12a on weekends). Very friendly transaction. I ordered my favorites; Chicken Satay, Crispy Veggie Rolls, and Red Curry Chicken. Food arrived hot, within the 20-30 minutes as promised. Food was delicious and safe to say the best meal I've had delivered in the three weeks I've been out here. This will definitely be my go-to Thai restaurant. Next time I'll be ordering another favorite -- Spicy Basil Leaf Chicken (aka Chicken Kra Prow) and I'm confident it will not disappoint. I even failed to mention I like my food extra spicy and there ended up being extra chili paste/sauce included in the delivery bag. Well worth the price!
