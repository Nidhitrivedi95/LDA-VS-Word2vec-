Excellent value, all dishes cooked the way they're meant to be, and it comes with complimentary soup to start, and a free traditional dessert. These types of restaurants used to be plentiful everywhere in Scarborough, but they've been gradually disappearing. There's always a long line up and this place is always busy.
