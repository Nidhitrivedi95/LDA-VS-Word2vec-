I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Honest review! Went in to get some passion fruit tea with Boba. Took a sip from it. Man oh mannnnnn. That drank taste sooo water down. I'm not playing with yall! Like I have tried passion fruit tea from so many boba shop. But gosh, this was the worst. Sorry not sorry peoples! Like Idk if the employees didn't know how to make it or they were obviously lazy. Especially the guy who made it. The time I order my drank, he looked so bored working. So guessing he was lazy & probably gave me water passion fruit tea. Smh. Plus the boba wasn't even cooked all the way. If your gonna sell boba at snoh. Please know how to make boba & tea because it taste gross. Waste of my $3 something bucks. Just being honest! Dont get butt hurt, just a review. Thanks
