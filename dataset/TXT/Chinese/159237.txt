u3q_fVU-qxgoGWLPVy4nMw I wanted to try a new place with my boyfriend and this place was right across Vaughan mills. There was lots of tables, super clean and the people were super nice and attentive. I do recommend their peppered chicken wings! It was delicious and maybe would be better if they had more chilli peppers but that's my preference. Their chilli chicken was gooood too!
