R4EhR8xhONLFqqI6ZnzNWw I use yelp all the time to find restaurants but have never posted before. My experience at dumpling restaurant was so bad that I finally signed up to share what happened. 

First off, entering the restaurant, the manager is at the counter on the phone, and doesn't even look up to acknowledge the guests as they enter. 

Our server was typical for this type of establishment, so no issue there. 

We ordered 5 items for our family, 2 of which were actually decent. But 1 item was so off putting that the rest didn't really matter, and here's why. We ordered the pork and pickled Cabbage dumpling and was appalled after just 1 bite. It was foul. It left a garbage taste lingering in our mouths that we couldn't get rid of (imagine the smell of stinky tofu, but in your mouth). We waved down the waitress to let her know and she said that's how pickled Cabbage tastes like and walked away... Really? The many other dumpling houses in scarborough/Markham certainly don't taste like garbage or over fermentation. 

I'd like to extend an offer to this waitress and the owner to try the 2 other dumpling houses just beside them and tell me that, that's how pickled Cabbage is supposed to taste like. 

IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO TASTE OR SMELL LIKE GARBAGE! 

After taking that 1 bite, we just lost our appetites and asked for the bill. When the waitress came to our table to collect our money, she didn't even bother saying anything to us about the 13.5 out of 14 pcs of dumplings left untouched at our table. 

There are literally 5 dumpling houses within 5 minutes of this property. Do yourself a favour and venture into one of those.
