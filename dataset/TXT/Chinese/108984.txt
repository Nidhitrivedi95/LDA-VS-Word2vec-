LKuzbx5Yt3yqiokUFdjVhg I love Korean food and this is the only one on this side of town in Charlotte but they are too dang expensive.. Their Korean pancake cost as much as an entree.. G Mart Korean restaurant is much better as far as taste and you get bigger portions. This will do when I can't make it to the other side
