qm7diuwiwwCWdL5V9s9hsA Amazing food at this restaurant and definitely a unique experience. Quality meats, awesome seasoning and extremely flavorful hot pots. My favorites include: spicy lamb, spicy beef, Taiwanese hot pot and a yogurt drink (or two)! I don't review very often, but small businesses that are original and prioritize high quality food is well worth the money and I would highly recommend giving this place a try.
