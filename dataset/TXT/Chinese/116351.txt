n72smZw1iVORdnjGfFT0FQ This place is the ultimate last resort location for food.
They are always open and always seem busy.
They also make all kinds of food, from bakery to sushi, to BBQ.
However though they do everything, they are not particularly good at anything. You would only come here if there were no other options. Usually late night meals. The food may not always be at its best here; but I am more than happy that they have been around for such a long time, satisfying my many late night cravings through my tennage years
