8keN8Z2sylAEXgMCJMQpDg We loved this place! Cute, small place with a few tables...most people there came for take-out. Loved watching the kitchen work...and man-oh-man they were busy! Saw lots of bowls of fresh veggies. 

We had egg rolls, Rangoon's, cashew chicken and pork in garlic sauce. Service is as quick and the food was fantastic! Fresh and great flavors.

Egg rolls were not greasy and there were pieces of pork in it. Rangoon's had a slight sweet taste and were light and flavorful. Loved the sauce on the cashew chicken which also had zucchini, carrots, snow peas and a ton of big fresh mushrooms! Garlic pork was a tad spicy in a good way and again had lots of fresh broccoli, baby corn, onion, etc.

We will be making this place a regular!!!
