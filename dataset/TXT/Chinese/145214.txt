ryCpLx4jaTkkkaGXg5jvBQ I ordered from here the other day and got the Bourbon Chicken..... it was so dry!!!!!! there was little to no sauce on the chicken and WAYYYY to many onions. The egg roll was so soggy and the fried rice was so dry I had to put a load of soy sauce on it just to make it somewhat edible. I will never order from this place again....DISGUSTING!!!!
