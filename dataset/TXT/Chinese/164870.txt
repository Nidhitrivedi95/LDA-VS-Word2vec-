UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w I went on a Friday when they had their seafood dinner buffet.
Originally, it cost $17.99 and when I checked the Gold Coast Hotel website, if you join their club card, they knock off $1.
Whoo hoo, I thought (thinking that's an extra $1 I could give to the waithelp for standing in line for 5 minutes to sign up for their free card).
Come to find out when I went to the buffet cashier, depending on what level you're at (Emerald, Sapphire, Ruby in descending order), they have different discounts.
Coming directly from the club card desk, I assume I'm a Ruby but they gave me 2 for 1 discount coming to under $10 for just me.

The buffet line had your standby non-gourment items (fried chicken, popcorn shrimp, prime rib, etc), but what I ended up doing is getting 3 mound-full dishes of snow crab, shrimp cocktail, manila clams, and oysters rockerfeller.

The dessert selection was plentiful but as others have mentioned, don't expect Bellagio quality items for sure.

But for $10 for a seafood buffet, my tummy was happy ;-)!!
