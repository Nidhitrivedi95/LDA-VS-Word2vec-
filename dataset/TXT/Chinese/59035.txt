dHTGzM4_3kKEiQvab9mi9A It's hard to find a real authentic chinese restaurant, let alone one that delivers. This place is great!! Reminds me of my grandpa's cooking. The prices are fair, for the amount of food that they give you. My order took 45 minutes to get made and delivered but I'm not complaining! This is my new favorite place for chinese food.
