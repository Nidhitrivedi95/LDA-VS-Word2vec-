-XH3-e3jDVdjHJq7GfNY7w Asian Taste: A home away from home. It is the go to place when I feel homesick and want some Vietnamese food. 

I just visited this place in the fall of '14 and I have to say, the atmosphere has improved from last year. Gone is the mainstream American music and in its place is Vietnamese music. They added a few cosmetic items to give the place a more Vietnamese vibe and even a couple fish tanks. Now on to the food.

The menu has improved from last year and the variety beats anything other oriental store offers for Vietnamese cuisine. I personally enjoy the bun thit nuong. 

As a kid from the suburbs, I've been to Argyle in Chicago and had the experience there. In particular the banh mi is a different experience, flavor and texture wise, from a place like Nhu Lan or Ba Le, but I enjoy the banh mi here. It is also authentic. 

If I were to compare their pho and bun bo hue to my parents, then they would be in serious trouble. Of course, nothing beats a meal from you parents right? I've ate at a couple places on campus that served Vietnamese food and although they were in some aspects tastier, they lacked the authenticity that Asian Taste has. The soups Asian Taste has may seem little bland to other stores, they provide all the condiments that should be included in the dish. Frankly if I were to score the soups then it would be a 4/5.

I think this store will to continue to grow and improve and I do believe that this will continue to be my home away from home.
