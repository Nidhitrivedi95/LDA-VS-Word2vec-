iyoym9B8gU_YPXSb3m31LA This restaurant is terrible - one star is too many.  We went and tried the shrimp/crab rolls, the chicken lettuce wraps, the plum wine, and the surf and turf roll.  The plum wine was good and the surf and turf roll was also okay.  The shrimp/crab rolls and chicken lettuce wraps were a hodgepodge of flavors (not a good fusion at all!).

Also, everything was very sweet and served quite cold (we sent back the lettuce wraps - and they were better hot).  What will take your breath away is the price (our meal was $80!).  High prices for fantastic food is okay.  But high prices for terrible, sweet, cold food is annoying.  The rest of our trip, we kept commenting that anything would be better than Fusia (e.g., China Panda, Fatburger, even McDonald's) and would have given us another $70 to gamble with!  If you want good Asian food, try Tao, Sensi, or even P.F. Chang.
