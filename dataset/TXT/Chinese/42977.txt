beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Came here with my friend on a Monday night to try this conveyor belt hot pot themed restaurant. The inside is nice. They decorated it for the Halloween theme right now. There's bar seating and table seating with a conveyor belt of raw ingredients floating by for your hot pot. There's also a sauce bar off to the side where you can build you own savory dipping sauce. 

When we sat to order the waitress explained how this restaurant works. Its individual pots per person. You get to pick the broth and spicy level. Each broth is 3.99 to 6.99 depending on type and spicy level. Next you order all big items, meats, veggies and hand made meatballs from her. The items on the conveyor belt are smaller items like mushroom, bean curd, tofu, raw fish, veggies etc. So for the two of us we got the meat combo, veggie combo, and on her recommendation, the small portion of the shrimp paste. From the conveyor we got the beancurd, quail eggs and fishball with roe inside. My friend also got the mango juice and a bowl of rice. The flavors of the broths were good. Very flavorful. They are also very generous for refilling it. I thought the ingredients were fresh and delicious. Meat was good, veggies were good. 

The reason why I give this three stars is for the price. For the two of us it was 80 bucks total. That's a whopping bill for hot pot. You might as well go to an all you can eat hot pot restaurant for less than 30 bucks a person. They charge you for everything.. Broth, rice. Don't think I'll have the urge to try this again.
