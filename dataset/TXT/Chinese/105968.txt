ky5L-EfUwU9chSPcIeXM5w Maybe I was just hungry, but I didn't think I would actually give a fast food (seating available) Chinese restaurant four stars. We ordered the sesame chicken and chicken lo mein. They gave us generous portions and it wasn't salty. If the decor was nicer, it would've made for a more memorable experience. Still, in this parking lot of restaurants (there are a few others), I would chose this place over the others.
