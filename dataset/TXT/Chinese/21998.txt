6bYgKI5JaQmS2xDoofS6cQ Great place, the couple that works there is super friendly. The only thing that disappoints me about this place is the fact that they ONLY take CASH as a form of payment. No credit cards or debit cards. But the fish n chips are on point, the bulgogi is out of this world and the short ribs are something special.
