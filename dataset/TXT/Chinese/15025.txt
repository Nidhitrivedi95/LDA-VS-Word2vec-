3nzK3K-Dfo1L6mpB8FTKkw The WORST airport food ever. Girlfriend got the Mongolian Beef. I got the Beef fried rice. They truly stretched the definition of BEEF. Both our dishes looked questionable. I gave up on mine less than halfway through. My girl had some of mine...flight attendant on the plane walked by and asked her "is that beef?" No joke.

Unfortunately, my girl threw up as soon as we got home to Vegas. If you make the flight from Phoenix to Vegas...WAIT till you get back to Vegas to get some grub.
