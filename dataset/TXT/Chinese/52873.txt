Cl-xl1vTUwHeaGgBxzdTRA Here for lunch and I can't believe how fast the service is and how good the food is!  I had cashew chicken and it was super hot, fresh and tasted great. Lots of cashews and the veggies were still crunchy. They brought me a huge plate of cashew chicken, fried rice, cup of soup and a egg roll all for $7.95. That is cheaper than going to a fast food place and the atmosphere is nice. First time here but will be back for sure.
