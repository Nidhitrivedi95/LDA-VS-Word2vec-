GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg Much like the other conveyor belt sushi restaurant Teharu, Seksun offers various rolls at rock bottom prices (If you know what to get). Prices range from $1 (Typically very basic California-style rolls) to $3 on the belt, although they do have a full menu that you can order other rolls and items from. The menu items are also fairly reasonable as well ($1 miso soup, $3 vegetable tempura). The items on the belt when we went were either rolls (3 pieces per plate) or some type of salad (Seaweed, octopus, or squid).

It was pretty dead when we went here on a weekend night to have dinner, with one or two other tables of people eating here. Most of the rolls on the belt were the most expensive $3 kind, with a few scattered $1 plates. The quality was OK, nothing too special, you basically get what you pay for. The rice in some of the rolls was a little mushy, but the flavors were decent. 

We did end up ordering some miso soup and vegetable tempura from the menu. The miso was alright, and the vegetable tempura consisted of slices of sweet potato, zucchini, white potato, and onion. 

Service was decent, and very friendly. Drinks were refilled as needed.

They are very eager to please here, and I'd say service is better and friendlier than the service at Teharu. Overall, a good alternative to the other conveyor belt sushi places if you are in this area of Chandler.
