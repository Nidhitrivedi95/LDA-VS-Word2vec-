_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Absolutely love this place

Price: family style dinner will run a few hundreds but it is for seafood so actually the price is pretty good

Service: best Asian service I have ever received. Lets be honest Asians restaurant is notorious for poor service. But this place is wicked awesome. Eating in the service is prompt and fantastic. They offered us free drinks once cause they had to switch our tables so that we wont be cold near the door. Another time I got takeout lobsters for sisters bday and the manager helped me carry the food to my car. I thought I was in a white restaurant like Scarmouche...was so surprised Asians service is stepping it up.

Food: why must they make me fat?! Soooo fuckin' good. Delicious. My all time favorite is the lobsters w fried garlic...drools. Their other dishes are really tasty too ie: soups, fried rice etc. Would come back for more definitely

Atmosphere: tables are so close together making it a bit uncomfortable.

Absolutely recommends this place.
