Here you'll find Bubble Tease, Freshii, California Sandwiches, Wild Wing, Marble Slab Creamery, Villa Madina, Tutti Fruiti, Tandori, and Pho Mi 99. Aside from being clean and new, this place does stand out above most Mississauga Pho places. 

The restaurant is clean and well kept.  It is new but it seems the staff does take time to keep it well maintained.  It's not luxury dining but it is bright and open.  The tables are spaced out so you're not sitting on your neighbour's lap.

 As with most Pho place, it's affordable and quick.  The difference between this place and others is the filling. This place actually has more than just mung bean and rice noodles... it actually have a decent amount of sliced beef!  The beef is not low quality or awful pieces of fat.  Their pho soup isn't not overly oily or salty which is refreshing.  My colleague had the grilled chicken on rice. He said it was tasty but the chicken was slightly on the dry and chewier side.  He doused it with hoisen sauce and it helped it.  The service is the usual for most Asian places. It's efficient and functional.  

Overall, it's one of the better places for pho in Mississauga.  It maybe best to the pho soup unless you like your meat on the drier or chewier side.
