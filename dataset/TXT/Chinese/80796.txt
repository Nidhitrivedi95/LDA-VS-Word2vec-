Gv2F-f0mUYhCCUKOshpj3A The food is good but the service is just horrible. Been here three times and each time they seem to mess up our orders. The waitress never apologizes for their mistakes and walks away with a dirty look(rolling her eyes). I do not like attitude with my meal especially paying around $80. It's really not that hard to add more vegetables to our dishes if you are going to charge us extra for it. I would not recommend this place unless you take it to go, but honesty I doubt I'll be back.
