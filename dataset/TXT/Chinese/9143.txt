1PMwRG0uWGxk2hIVEQj62A Went for Dim Sum with the SO, 2pm, so we missed the before 11am price. It was ok. I personally was not too impressed. Where as some dishes were tasty for certain, you don't get the outrageously beautiful presentation of the Crown restaurants, and the pricing is similar. 

Service was good, tea was hot but $45 for Dim Sum is just too much, especially considering I liked the dumplings at Asian Legend 
(of all places) better. I was thinking about them as I was eating the Spring Villa version. The crispy octopus here was really the stand out, and maybe the har-gow which was also really good. 

A-ok. I would return for the discount price.
