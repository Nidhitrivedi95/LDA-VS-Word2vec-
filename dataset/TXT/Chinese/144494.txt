RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ WOW!!!  This place is great.  I went with a Taiwanese friend of mine and I smartly let him order for me.  He ordered what he termed "standard" fare but to me it was new and absolutely delicious.  I even tried the "stinky" tofu.  The smell was odd but once you got past it, the tofu was tasty and had a nice kick.  He ordered for me some braised pork with rice dish and OMG, it was like butter.  So tasty.  Large portions too.  Bubble tea was great also.  Again, tried something different (taro?) and wasn't disappointed.  You know the place is excellent because the place was packed and there were Chinese families waiting patiently to get in.
