a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg When I'm in Vegas I can't resist the urge to sit at the counter at Binion's.  It's old Las Vegas at it's best.

A little dirty-yes, seedy even-yes, amazing-hell yes. 

A cheap burger, an old school counter, it doesn't get better. The people are always friendly (Especially Michelle behind the counter) and the regulars (Chin and Louis I'm loooking at you) are quick to make conversation. You must sit at the counter, after one visit you'll already be feeling like a regular.
