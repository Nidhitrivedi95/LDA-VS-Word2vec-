7wgKazvblPECOzBrd6N50Q I would give ZERO star for the worst restaurant if I can. Small portion 4 dishes were not enough for two girls and one boy. Ordered spice fish and got sweet sour one. The porridge was extremely over cooked and had the burning taste. The worst thing was that when we were paying for our bill, the staff automatically chose the percentages of tips for us and pushed us to push ok button to finish the purchase. We were NOT planning to give TWENTY PERCENT for this awful food. NEVER GO BACK and NEVER RECOMMEND!
