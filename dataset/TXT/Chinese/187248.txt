yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Came here for lunch starving. Saw the pho Kim long line driving on the street (teehee, yeahs im corny af) and thought "okay it has to be good with a pho Kim long ass line like that." Got seated after about 10 minutes, lucky we beat the crowd. The line got even longer after we were seated
 We had the pho combination, it sounds like pho Dat bietch. Jk jk 2 orders of pho dac biet and some bbq pork rice dish my girl ordered. No opinion on her food because I was like why dah pho u order rice at a pho joint, what dah pho?!?, pho Dat bietch.........aaaah love yelp, see how long before they delete this. I enjoyed my pho, home girl said they felt it was salty. I was like mang u salty u ordered that hard rice bbq Moar pork dish and eating more of our "salty" pho and giving me half her pho Kim hard rice bbq pork dish. Luckily I'm a bland food F-ing eating machine, so I ate that hard rice and pork. Would go here again only if there is a short wait.
