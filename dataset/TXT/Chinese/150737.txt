Sw-OqRcaKL8pG5sqIa9p4w So here I am waiting for my food and the guy cooking my food decides to clean his nose while cooking... decided not eat here and left.
Last time I came here they dropped a fork on the floor, picked it up and continue cooking with it. 
I figure I'll give them the 5 second rule and one more chance. But today did it. No more General Thai. I wonder what goes a the back 
Don't eat here!!!
