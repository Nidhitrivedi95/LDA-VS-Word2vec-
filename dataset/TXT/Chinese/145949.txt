We had our food coming out in less than 10 minutes (o-o).  It was also a lot of fun to watch them make the noodles through the big picture windows.  The portions are VERY large - definitely enough for left-overs - and the prices are very reasonable.  The food is good, but not necessarily special or memorable.  The appetizer menu is nicely diverse, but as far as main dishes go it is essentially a choose your meat and sauce kind of gig.  For my tastes it may have been a bit too salty, but hey some people are in to that sort of thing.  Health wise the food is probably 80% carbs (I mean the restaurant name has noodle in it so no surprise there right), 19% meat, and maybe 1% veg.  They do have a gluten-free option of rice noodles FYI. 

TLDR: If you are looking to fill up the tank quick and cheap then give this place a try.  If you are looking for something more healthy or tasty then maybe keep driving ;-)
