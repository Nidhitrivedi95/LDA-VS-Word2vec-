dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ We wanted to get rid of all the late night alcohol taste now so we can start fresh and drink some more later =). What can cleanse your palate better than a steamy bowl of spicy tom yum soup? Our Thai friend told us about this place and we were surprised how good the food was. My second time eating here and the business name still throws me off. Pretty authentic Thai dishes, which reminds me of a few spots in Thai Town, Krung Tedd and Hollywood Thai. 

The waiter let us know up front that it's easier for them to add additional spicy than to remove it. We understand dude, haha, we can handle it.

Favorite:
