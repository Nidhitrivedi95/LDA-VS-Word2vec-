f-ookZOX4pBNldaOHMkJ4A Hong Shin is Hong Great!

I just got finished stuffing face with a tasty lil' order of Wonton Soup, Singapore Noodles, Chicken Balls, Crispy Beef and Supreme Fried Rice. Let me tell you something my face is most certainly "stuffed"!

This is just some damn good Chinese takeout and when my fortune cookie told me to "Give us a great review on Yelp!"**. Well I just couldn't resist giving them the highest honour one can bestow upon a Chinese delivery restaurant, 3 stars.

They're large delivery area isn't hurting either.

3 out of 5 stars for the dinner.
1 out  of 5 stars to Just Eat as their app has been going downhill faster than my stock portfolio!

**My fortune cookie did not say this. It said "You are capable of great things"
