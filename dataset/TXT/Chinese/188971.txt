yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I wanted something clean and broth. It's one of the only few places open early on Sunday. It was full too. I had the pho ga and the broth was a little light. The chicken was also tasteless. I didn't think it was too good. The only good thing about it was, it was a lot of noodles and the bowls are big.  But then again, it's a little pricier. They also have a wide variety of different Asian foods, Chinese, Thai, etc.
