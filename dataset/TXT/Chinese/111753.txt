maGqjGXYPzal3YydKu8wjQ I'm still checking out the area around my job looking for fast lunch time eats, and this time I was craving noodles, chicken & pineapple, yes I know it's a strange craving, but it's one I knew Panda could satisfy! 
Coworker and I got there at high noon on a Friday and there wasn't a line in site, guess we are ahead of the lunch rush, which was fine by me.

I ordered a 2 item combo with chow mein , firecracker chicken breast & sweet fire chicken breast. I have to say the sweet fire chicken breast is my all-time favorite; I have tried many times at home to recreate that flavor! Just delish! 

I have to say that customer service was nice and friendly, and if you don't want to get out of your car, they have a drive thru too!

I still have many places to try out for a fast lunch time eat, but I know when I have a craving for sweet fire chicken Panda is right there for me to run to!
