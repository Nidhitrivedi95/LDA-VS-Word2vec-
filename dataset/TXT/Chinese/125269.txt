OX0T9dWI8b7meu-ljTo22A Since this was the only restaurant open late in the vicinity that wasn't fast food but that would accept an order for a hamburger over the phone to be picked up (plus not a major pain for parking), it rates a 5 star. The hamburger was delivered and devoured without complaints, so the food must have been good. 

Interesting exterior. I definitely should have taken a picture, but it was dark out and I figured that the effect would be lost.

If you need a reasonably priced hamburger and fries that isn't fast food, this is the place. Call ahead.
