Came here on a double date for Valentine's Day. I understand it's a busy night but when and where is it okay to have to wait 40 minutes between appetizers and main course? And also a 20 minute wait for ALL 4 cups of water to be refilled? And I really can't even tell you who our waiter actually was. Mind you, we informed the maitre d we are pressed for time as my brother in law had to be at work. Well, we just had to leave for work at the main course still isn't here.

So thank you, staff at Mr. Chow Las Vegas, for ruining our Valentine's dinner. What a way to spend a night out with your husband after he's been away for 2 weeks working.

Spend your money elsewhere....or at least wait until they get their act together.
