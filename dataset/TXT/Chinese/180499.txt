X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg The worst customer service and very rude securities I have ever experienced! My friend had a table there, but we came in later and he had to leave, he told the server we will be staying at the table. 5 minutes later server brought like two random gils to our table, got them drinks from the table, than like 5 minutes later he started taking away everything what was left on the table (alcohol, juice, fruits)  without even asking us. He asked us to get out from the table because they need to clean up, and next thing I see, he brought different crowd to our table! So basically kicked us out!!! Wtf? Seriously? My friend paid for everything and let server know we gonna stay.
Really unprofessional and rude, never going back again!
