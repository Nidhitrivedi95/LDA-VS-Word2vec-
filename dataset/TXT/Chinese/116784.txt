NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og Loved this place, cooking style similar to east coast Chinese food. Larger menu than most places. Found out today they no longer deliver to our side of town. Too bad, they made a lot off of us when we entertained guests. The Singapore rice noodle (dry, not wet, as it should be) and egg foo young (liked how they prepared it compared to other places) are really good AND you can order a whole roasted duck to be delivered to your house. Without the bones. That's a big deal. It was my fave, I'm very sad.
