Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Ordered a mongolian beef over steamed rice, and hong kong style chow mein... The mongolian was pretty good as recommended by the waitress... The noodle is ok, but not my favorite... One thing is the rice, its kinda dry... I wish they could fix that... The cocktail is pretty good also.... I had the sumo martini... The environment is nice, location is next to jabbawockeez show very convenient cuz we have the show right after the dinner... All the waiters & waitresses are very nice.... I would definitely come back for some other foods...
