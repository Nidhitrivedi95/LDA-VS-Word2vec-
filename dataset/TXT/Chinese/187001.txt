yeOsE6Hnl_EiLJw2L5NXLA You get what you pay for. When I'm in need of a quick fix for some greasy Chinese, this is the place I hit up. They have standard dishes,  but they are slightly greasy relative to other places. For the price though you can't go wrong. You'll need to drink lots of water or tea with it as I think they're a bit heavy handed in the MSG department,  but thay may be my own personal experience. As I said, you get what you pay for and it's a good quick fix for some Chinese food.
