dqeUvrlMxTAk0VL2n1ukaw My wife and I have made this our weekly go-to place for dinner. We've tried almost everything and have not been disappointed. I absolutely LOVE their General Tso chicken wings. Absolutely perfect. 
Aside from the food, what keeps us coming back is the staff. They are very attentive and friendly. It's a family ran restaurant and they go out of their way to make sure you well taken care of. 
It's apparent that their client base is mostly repeat customers since they seem to know almost everyone that walks through their doors. That says a lot about their food and their service. This place is the real deal.
