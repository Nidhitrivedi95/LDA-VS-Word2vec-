dKOrxsz6ygqa-AatwzpKyQ Was here for dinner. The food was just ok. Most of the items ordered wasn't my favourite but I tried to eat it nevertheless. I only liked the "shark's fin" soup (in a nice bowl w/ candle warming it on the bottom) and sticky rice best. The E-fu noodles were dry, the custom chicken dish was too salty (I could pour a lot of soya sauce in a dish too). The fish was nice but it was pricy. Lobster was too gingery. Not a fan of the large veggies w/ the abalone and chicken. 

Casa Deluz can apparently have 80 tables (800-850). Great for large Chinese weddings if you want a more modern Chinese venue. It was nice and bright inside. But I find it was overly blinged up that it looked almost tacky. 

Service was excellent but we were with people who knew the manager and a popular chef so they were extra attentive.
