VDdX2TGa9hNHwjzrnVSC_A This a Chinese tea room at an awesome location. You walk in and it smells so good. The decor is classical Chinese and is meant to be peaceful and zen. Complete with a little running water fountain in the corner (that will make you want to pee). 

We were sat down at a table and given an extensive tea menu, and a vegetarian snack menu. But as we had just eaten previously we didn't order any food. 

I got the Yun Wu (which I later purchased more of to have at home, and boyfriend had a light green tea.

The tea is served on a wooden tray into which excess tea is poured when the server pours your tea. The tea is presented in beautiful porcelain dishes, and everything is explained to you by your knowledgeable server. 

The tea is phenomenal, fantastic quality and definitely would go back again.
