3ijLguDlxXRDSPHSVrikPQ I've been coming to He He Long for years now.  I do all my grocery shopping at the supermarket next door and always pop by here to get my Chinese BBQ fix.

Pros:
Some of the best BBQ pork in town
friendly staff

Cons:
Prices are high compared to other Chinese BBQ places

As I said, I do most of my grocery shopping next door so I'm here on average about once a week.  He He Long has some of the best BBQ pork in the city.  As always, if you know what you're doing, you always ask for half and half. It's always very good every time I get some.  I'm also a fan of the steamed free range chicken.  The roast pork and BBQ duck are also above average.  I recommend though as i do to all my friends, try the BBQ pork, you won't regret it.

The staff here are very friendly.  They're English isn't the best but they try their best even if you don't speak Chinese.  As a regular, they know me and always strike up conversation with me.  The lady at the front is very polite.  

There is only one thing that keeps this place from being 5 star for me, price.  They charge $9.50 a pound for BBQ pork.  That is by far the most expensive I've also seen in the city.  Don't get me wrong, it is worth every cent, but it's very pricey compared to other Chinese BBQ places.  They have a monopoly here because there's no other Chinese BBQ place even remotely near by.  Still, like I said, it's worth every cent.  Just wish it didn't hit my wallet so hard every time.

If you live in the Finch and Leslie area or anywhere near by, this is the place to go to get your Chinese BBQ fix.  Try the BBQ pork, you won't be disappointed.  Oh yes, like most Chinese establishments, bring cash.  They do not accept any other form of payment.
