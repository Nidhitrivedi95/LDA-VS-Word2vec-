dHTGzM4_3kKEiQvab9mi9A This place is good but of course not the best I have ever tried nor the cheapest.. extremely high priced. On the inside of this place it's nice and tidy. When I called and placed my order over the phone for take out the person I talked to upped the price of everything by an extra $5-$8 which of course I corrected. The numbers were re-run and sure enough. Smh... but over all it's ok. I have been here 2 times so far..
