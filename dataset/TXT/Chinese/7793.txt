0YYZWMEWePG06FpJGbSu7Q It is hard to find a clinic in the Phoenix area that practices the art of Traditional Chinese Medicine to the extent that Cypress Pavilion does. Along with the more commonly known treatments such as acupuncture, some of the treatments, such as "gua sha," are ones that I have not seen since my Mom did it at home when I was young. The knowledge of its staff is extensive and the quality of service is superb. Of course, the clinic itself is marvelous! It is so peaceful and so conducive to the healing powers of the treatments.
