MVBCWXTDtU8C1Qh5mMNSKA Came here for dim sum. Quality is poor compared to the many high end dim sum restaurants in the area. The only good thing is that as a result you can always get a table, even during early dim sum. 

Early dim sum<U+200B> (before 11am) is $3.10 / dish.  Most items are of average quality. I'd be very disappointed if I had to pay full price. The restaurant is also understaffed so service is on the slow side. 

I can only recommend coming here if you have a large group with kids and don't want to sit through the hour wait required at the good neighboring dim sum restaurants (Dragon Boat, Shangri-La, Skyview, etc). 

There is plenty of parking as this is a shared lot with other businesses
