rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g About a week ago I had the pleasure of ordering pick up from this establishment! I read the reviews on Yelp so I had several ideas on what was recommended by others to have. Some reviews weren't great but we all have an off night! I have to say my expectations weren't too high considering some of reviews. I was very happily surprised by the quality of the food, portions and overall the flavor of the food! When I ordered over the phone they were polite and helpful even though they were closing in 45 minutes when I ordered. When I picked up my order it was ready and still nice hot!! Once home I was impressed with the flavor of the sauces, amount of meat in the portions and freshness of the veggies! Great job guys!! We will be ordering for pick up again!
