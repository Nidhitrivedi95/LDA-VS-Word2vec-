YWrrjZ7KdYwN_pUNbLfTCw The lunch and combo platters are pretty good.  However, their standalone dishes aren't as good. Ordered the lobster with shrimp and minced pork. There was no pork and the lobster sauce is a watery no flavour substance. Also ordered the Cantonese chow mien. Asked them if it was crispy chow mien with sauce on top, they said yea, but it was soggy and it was not good. Definitely not worth 9.95. I've had better in scarbz for 5 bucks which was a similar non crispy chow mien. Their saving grace is their fried rice. Both chicken and beef fried rice have plenty of meat and tastes pretty good.  They have meat dishes but it's mostly veggies than meat. It's good to have tons of veggies if your trying to be "healthy", but then again, why order Chinese food if your goal is to be healthy?  Given, the veggies are super fresh, but If you want only meat, it is an extra two dollars.  Better to stick with the lunch special and combination platters, they are 5.25 and 7.95, respectively.  Those are pretty good deals, given the tasty fried rice, lots of meat (if you get sweet and sour pork or similar meat only dishes, an egg roll in huge quantities.
