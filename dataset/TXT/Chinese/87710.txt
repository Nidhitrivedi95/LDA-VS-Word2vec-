hwe7f0QthkND-H4Ekg37qw I have been coming here since I was a child. And honestly, when I was little, I was not a huge fan of their food. My parents would get the general tsos bean curd which was very hard and shaped like a ball. One day recently, I had missed it for some reason, and ordered the general tsos bean curd for dinner. What I recieved was a big surprise! It was one of the absolute most delicious general tsos tofu dishes I have ever had, and a far cry from the hard balls they served before. They must have gotten a new chef or something, but the place is spectacular now.
