trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ One of the best sea food restaurants that I've been in Toronto! Everything was so fresh and the price was very good.
We started by some oyster and calamari which was very tasty. Then we had muscles, whole fish and fish and chips and they were all very good/
Definitely will go back there.
