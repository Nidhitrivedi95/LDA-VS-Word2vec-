l5NUIeAo6Fk-Vx4nm3Xqfg Best Chinese food in Las Vegas. I've been going here for over 7 years. The staff is so nice & and I love that every time I call for delivery they said 45 min and they are at my house within 15 min. I've been going here for so long and never once has the food or the service been nothing but great.
