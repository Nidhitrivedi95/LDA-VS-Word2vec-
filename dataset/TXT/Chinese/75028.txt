fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg I have mix feelings about this place. Three of us had lunch there. Between the three of us half of the food we order was not good and the other half was fair-good. I would think if your in such a great location in the Downtown Summerlin Mall everything coming out of the kitchen should be excellent! The staff was friendly and the service was fast but, the they could learn some tips from Spring Mountain Road restaurants. I think there is potential for improvement.
