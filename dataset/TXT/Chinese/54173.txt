Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg Move over Congee Wong... The Queen has arrived... And they've expanded - more than doubled their original capacity!

Dined at this Congee Queen a few times since it opened, also did a few delivery and take away orders. They serve typical Shanghai dishes just like Congee Wong. Their food is consistently good, space is nicely decorated and service is fast. 

Recently, my friend and I went in for a late lunch on a Saturday and we got a seat right away. I was glad to see that they have expanded, taking over the old Lick's Burgers.
We went for our usual:
- Preserved egg congee
I always order this anywhere it's served... Congee Queen makes them very well, no need to add seasoning.
- Pork chop noodle in soup
Tons of pork chop, broth is a little salty
- Chili turnip
The cubes are a little too big, but still very flavourful and loaded with shrimp
- Squid tentacles
So good! Cooked and seasoned perfectly.

Also got the Mango salad with tiger shrimp for take away. It's soo YUMM! Good balance of sweet, sour and salty flavour. And the shrimps are shelled and huge!

Since they expanded and we got in at off hours (2:00pm) we were able to enjoy our booth to chat until 6:00pm without being rushed... That's unheard of at any Asian restaurant.
Parking is also easy to find, there's tons at the front and back of the plaza (another thing that's unheard of at any Asian restaurant).
