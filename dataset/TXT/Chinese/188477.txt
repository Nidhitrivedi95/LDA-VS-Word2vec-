yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA They have these tofu nuggets that are just delicious. Even if you don't like tofu. I always order the spring rolls I just think they're a nice light appetizer. 

Obviously it's a Pho place, so let's get down to the Pho. I love it here. The broth is incredible, I kind of drown it in siracha and duck sauce but before I do that the taste is great. 

I love that they offer a vegan pho it means I can drag my roommate here and she will have something to eat.
