CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw The service is great (I was at the counter). The location is good, if you're staying in SLS or nearby. I've read reviews by folks that love the food, but my first experience here, I had the kimchi noodle soup. Waaaaayyyyy too salty. Needs more kimchi, less salt (even owning to José Andés influence). The salt masks or drowns out any other sort of flavor the dish may have had.
