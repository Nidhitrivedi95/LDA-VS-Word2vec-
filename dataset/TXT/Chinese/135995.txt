QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA I AM AN IDIOT
I've spent years bitching about the lack of even a DECENT chinese place near our house (Baja Arcadia). I kept looking to Scottsdale for somewhere to eat. We've got just about everything else, from real-deal taco shacks, to excellent Pho, to fine dining. But no real Chinese food. I was looking the wrong way. Up til recently, I would drive all the way to Wong's Place in Tempe just for the real stuff.


THE CHINESE CULTURAL CENTER
I shop regularly at what used to be Ranch99, that oasis in the desert that makes you feel like you've been transported to the Hell that is Riverside CA. I've tried numerous restaurants in the mall over the years and always been disappointed. The one I never managed to try is the Szechwan Palace. I expected it to be just another Gringonese disaster. Man was I wrong. We eat out maybe once or twice a week, and we've hit this place at least once a week since we found it a few months ago.


SZECHWAN PALACE
I love you, Palace. Dan Dan Noodles. Spice. Yu Xiang dishes. We've been when it's packed full of high maintenance Chinese businessmen and when we're one of 4 tables in the place. Every time, the tiny kitchen and the wonderful servers keep their smiles in place and just give you that little shake of the head that says: "Solly, it clazy tonight!" Even though this place pleases real Chinese food lovers, there's plenty of stuff to keep my Jewish mother-in-law happy too ("happy" is a relative term).


THINGS I LOVE
  - Wan Fu: the worst white wine in the world (that I love)
  - Dan Dan Noodles with extra hot chile
  - Yu Xiang Shrimp
  - Mongolian Beef with real beef, not that over-marinated rubbery crap
  - Fresh veggies that still have some color and snap to them
  - Incredibly spicy Water-boiled dishes
  - Any of their soups

Wong's thick-skinned pot stickers are still the best, but everything else at the Palace rules.


BOTTOM LINE
It's hard for me to imagine a bad review being credible unless some key person was missing or they were ridiculously understaffed and got slammed. We've been there for one of those nights though, and it was still very good, once we eventually got served. As others have said: get the real menu as you walk in. Otherwise, you'll get the Panda Express version. You'll also have to grab chopsticks. Other than that, just enjoy!
