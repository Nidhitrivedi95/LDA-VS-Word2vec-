Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg Probably one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Markham. The staff are fast and efficient, and are more focused on getting the job done rather than providing a super warm and friendly atmosphere (especially true during the weekends). Food is very good and satisfying. I'd recommend getting the Crispy Tiger Shrimp and Mango Salad Tossed with Custard Sauce. It's one of my favourite dishes. Also has very good General Tao Chicken. The food comes out pretty fast despite the busyness, and the staff are all very respectful. Only thing is that if you go on the weekends, you'll be met with a waiting time of up to a half hour. You'll be given a number, which they will call out when it is your turn to be seated, so be sure to listen for it. Otherwise, it's a place I'd recommend going to for good Chinese food.
