ix10sks4hVvv-3Jb6sKjvw Been going here since 1986. The menu hasn't changed. No it's not gourmet Chinese food BUT..... I still crave the taste of the food from this place after all these years. Great price as well. There's just something about it that keeps me wanting more. I have paid $12.99 at other places and still would prefer the food at Autumn Moon over anywhere else.... Love it!!!!
