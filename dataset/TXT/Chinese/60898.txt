The reason why I took off a star is the portion size are a little on the small side. Between the 7 of us, we ordered about 5 different dishes with extra rice and usually at most places, it's enough but not here.

The pad thai, green curry, and papaya salad were delicious. I was satisfied with the taste of the food. My taste buds were giving me high fives. I believe this is primarily a Thai restaurant so get Thai dishes and NOT the Chinese. One of the stir-fry dishes we ordered was meh.
