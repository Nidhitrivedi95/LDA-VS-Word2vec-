LbeJgPgKKHw5qH0f02NHEQ This was a nice restaurant that was very clean. I was greeted and sat in a very timely fashion. I was there around 11:30am which is lunch hour, and the service was very quick. We ordered from the menu and the food was out at our table in 10 minutes. The food was good, but the portions of chicken were smaller than normal, with a huge portion of rice. The egg rolls here are cooked excellently and very crispy. I would give the egg roll a 10 out of 10. I would definitely go back and have lunch again!
