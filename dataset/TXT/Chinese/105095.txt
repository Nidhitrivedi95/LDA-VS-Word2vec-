KUqInLEY1y7SkyZyDoGn0Q The is the default dim sum place when I come home for a visit. It's close by, the service is fast, it's never crazy busy when you go early in the morning, and the food is yum. 

Pay your bill by 11:30, and all SML dishes are $2.75! Some of the better dishes include the deep fried shrimp dumplings with soup, and the beef short ribs (my two staples when I go). 

Plus, the place is pretty nice inside. The spot has changed hands so many times over the years so I'm happy there's a staple now in that mall for dim sum. Parking is definitely a pain though, since space is limited and the lots are poorly laid out. :\
