1ag6jjxNwabkGnoFcNRNEg It has been a while since I visited this location. It was close to the school so I frequented whilst I went. I remembered enjoying it a lot so I returned with some family who I thought might enjoy the place. When I arrived I saw the name was different so I assumed it was a different place. Upon closer expectation it looked like it had just been a renaming. The place was pretty empty when we arrived so we ordered pretty quickly. The place looks pretty much the same from the last time I visited. There are many more items on the meñu now, mostly chinese dishes. I don't like Sushi but my family does so they ordered some. Last time I visited my friend said their sushi was pretty enjoyable. This time around my family was not very impressed and said it was not worth the money they charged. I personally ordered and tried the Combination Chow mein, Honey Walnut Shrimp, spring rolls and Thai Iced Tea. It was all pretty okay too me. The chow mein was a little extra greasy. The shrimp was kind of citrus like but it was very enjoyable. Spring rolls were not my favorite but still good. The tea was not as great as i remember and they drowned it out with lots of ice, so it was gone very quickly. The place reminded me of China A Go Go and I imagine maybe they are following their success. Service was not very good. Besides a loss in translation, they did not seem to want us eating in the restaurant. Despite the many tables and chair, it is mainly not a dine-in location. It's focus now is mainly to go, which is different from the last time I visited. They also had a security guard. While we ate the guard and some of the workers watched a basketball game and cheered often and loudly. This made our visit very unpleasant. Despite all of this I may visit again to try their ramen and give another review. Until next time!
