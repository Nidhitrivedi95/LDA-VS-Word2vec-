BJ9GwNMo8vIgSuKc6B_mOw We decided to try this place based on its attractive ambiance from the outside. While the place looked busy and popular, we were disappointed with the tiny portions. The loud and noisy environment prevented any meaningful conversation and the mediocre service did not help. Not the best experience for a first time customer.
