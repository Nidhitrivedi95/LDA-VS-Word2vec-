tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw What happened to this place?? They used to have great food, decent service and seemingly good management. But it seems like they have slipped in quality and service, and they appear confused and poorly managed these days. I was there two weeks ago, and the service was atrocious and food was mediocre compared to what I recall it was in the past. Believing it may have been an isolated bad experience, I just ordered a lot of food for pick up this evening, and upon arrival, I discovered that they completely forgot to submit the order. They did not apologize nor did they offer anything to make up for their mistake and the inconvenience. Therefore, we are crossing PF Chang's off of our list permanently as there are too many good dining choices out there that eclipse this fallen, mediocre establishment. Sad!
