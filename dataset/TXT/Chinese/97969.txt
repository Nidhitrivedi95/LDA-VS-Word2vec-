JQWIZ8MT-VGZzO5W5XCB5Q We live in Plaza Midwood, and we can get food delivered from there.  The person who took our order and the delivery driver were both very attentive and courteous.  

The food was really great - hot (temperature), perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and yummy.    The portions were large, which means a lot of leftovers.  We will definitely order from them again.
