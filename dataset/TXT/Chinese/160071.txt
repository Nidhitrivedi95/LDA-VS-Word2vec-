U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q My husband and I ate here dec 18 2010. And we ordered chow fun and some kind of noodle soup. Chow fun was $16 and the soup was $18. The service was bad. Not very friendly servers and also the manager staring on us while we were eating. I don't know why he was doing that. Anyway my husband said it was a waste of money paying $45 worth of food we paid. The food was not really good. And will not eat here again. We do not recommend this restaurant at all.
