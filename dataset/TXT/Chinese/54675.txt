ctTiEiUTY_FvnZ0ovBeZWQ Went on Black Friday and beat the lunch hour rush by going just before noon! Definitely great value, with lunches being either $7 or $8 after taxes, cash-only and a small seating area. 

Service: Line went pretty quick, with 3 people serving food and a cashier, portions may vary depending on which server you get. Looks like a family-run business, friendly people.

Food: Bibimbap was decent and a good portion size, and the gochujang was flavorful. Only wish the food was a bit more warm, but obviously it's not fair to compare it against one served in a stone bowl at a restaurant. Fried eggs were pre-made and a bit cold. DIY sauce bar for condiments (sriracha, gochujang, etc.). Glass noodles tasted good, and good variety of veggie included in the dish.

Overall: Great value for take-out lunch, would definitely recommend when craving Korean food.
