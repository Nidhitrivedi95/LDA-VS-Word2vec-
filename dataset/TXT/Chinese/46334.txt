BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I was looking forward to an all-dumpling dinner at Mother's, but sadly left unsatisfied. 

My table started with a delicious beef noodle soup, in which the meat was uncharacteristically tender. I had two bowls, and wished I'd ordered more noodles.

I followed the soup with a beef and onion pancake, thanks to recommendations here on Yelp. It was fine... and that's about all I can say. Like most of the food at Mother's, it didn't stand out.

We also ordered pork and vegetable steamed buns, pork, shrimp and melon dumplings, and a third dumpling in whole wheat. I ate here last night and I can't remember our order, that's how dull the food was! I tried one of each (and couldn't finish my bun), then went back to the noodles. It seems like the vegetables and herbs are given too much of the heavy lifting, flavour-wise.

The portions may be generous (particularly the gigantic steamed buns), but my friends and I were unable to finish due to a lack of enthusiasm.
