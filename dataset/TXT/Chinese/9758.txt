THE FOOD ISN'T WORTH THE TRIP OR THE EMBARRASSMENT I WAS SUBJECTED TO.

This place only serves DUMPLINGS. Wish I had seen that info in the reviews. But I like dumplings so it I wasn't overly disappointed. The food was ok, nothing to travel for (which I did by yelp referrals). 

I traveled from US and had not exchange to Canadian money yet, charged with credit card at end of meal and the guy demanded his tip right there. I declined because it was so rude and abrupt. The service is non existent. However I decided to leave a couple of US dollars on the table before leaving anyhow, after I'd clean and stacked dishes for them leaving them nothing to clear off. 

But as I was walking to go the waiter demanded I leave at least 10% tip. Wouldn't let me go. I said I have no more cash. He didn't want to hear it insisting I give tip. I would have revised the CC amount to have him release me, but I had to run another CC transaction for the tip he demanded. 

I was so mortified at the spectacle that I did it just to leave. In hindsight I shouldn't have left anything and just walked out.
