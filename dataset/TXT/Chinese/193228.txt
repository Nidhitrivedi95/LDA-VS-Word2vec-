ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Not going to lie, this is one of the best ramen places (if not thee best) I've ever been to. After just moving from Los Angeles to the Phoenix area...I was so impressed with the ambiance of this restaurant. They have delicious drinks and an excellent lunch offering, but what really sold me was just how good the dang ramen was. I found myself craving it and wanting to come back the rest of this week. Be sure to try it out if your hanging out in Downtown Phoenix, and from what I heard...there will be a new location in Gilbert very soon! The hostess/waitress was also super helpful, attentive, and sweet. I ordered the Sour Times cocktail and it was like drinking a berry garden of goodness! You won't regret it!
