WF0I9AwErfaqkPPXM98ywQ Much nicer decor than any other location but average quality food and service. They have stepped it up and tried to go all premium at this location. If you haven't  noticed the price has seem to gone up or seems more expensive than most Chinese bakery. The food quality is just average nothing too special but consistent with their other location.

The service.... ordered their rice combo a little after the lunch rush, it was the steam chicken and mushroom rice. They said it would take 15min which was fine, but that 15min soon turned into 5 more minutes... when asked again same thing, so that 15min soon became 20, 25, and eventually 30min... seriously I can make my own in 20min or less. When I got the dish there were barely any chicken or mushroom, which makes me wonder why 30min.... I ended up making the same dish 2 days later at home with much more ingredients!

 I guess the location is new and needs someone to manage the kitchen better.
