SEURrw7032BR15PKZ_aleA Not too shabby. 

Made a reservation about a 1.5 weeks in advance and I was surprised I was on the list. We got our table in about 15 mins of waiting. I don't really understand their queuing system, but i think we were just put in priority bc we made a reservation. 

Food choices, are your basics. Har Gow, congee, rice noodle rolls, turnip cake etc. Prices range from $2.70-3 depends on size. If you order before 11:30 on Saturday, it's $2.50. I think this is why I made a res. for 11am, and we didn't seat until closer to 11:20. After looking at the menu, I made out the chinese at the bottom and I was like omg!! 
We were on the border line of this cut off, and i don't think she gave us this deal. 

Stuff didn't taste terrible, except some got cold quickly, but nothing I would run home and call about. I've had better for simliar price. 

There are three things on the dim sum menu with no translation. I have learnt that if in doubt, do not order it. We were looking for some vegetarian dishes and I read the first two words of  a 4 part phrase (Gow Choy, nine vegetable, garlic chives). I thought it was a dumpling. UHHH, I ended up with blood cubes, with the chives on top. Fail. And I've learnt my lesson. 

Service was okay. Not especially fast, but they were busy. Our dessert arrived first, but good thing it was supposed to be served room temperature. 

Wouldn't come out of my way for here, but if in the area, an okay choice.
