8MXjK1lhVRhU3yGCUv9qsA Okay so this place is dope and fresh as hell. 

The first time I ate here it was because I was ravenous and nothing else was open. It is fucking AMAZING. Incredibly innovative, unique, thoughtful food that tastes fabulous. Amazing mix of textures and flavours, and unique dishes I've never seen done anywhere else. (Love the tofu sushi, holy shit.) The veg baos are fucking riduciulous w/ enoki mushroom and tofu. Bao is fluffy and melts in your mouth. RIDICUOLUS!! Cheap and amazing, like I can't even write how mind blowingly excellent this place is! 

Also amazing was the eggplant tapas dish... damn, girl. Damn. 

Drag your ass here! You won't regret it!
