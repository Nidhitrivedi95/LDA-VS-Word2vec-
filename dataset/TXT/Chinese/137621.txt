NEW WEST SIDE LOCATION (TROP & HUALAPAI)
I have gone to the location over on Valle Verde for years and have loved this place. It's a great VERY FAST Chinese Food restaurant that serves very good food. Plus they deliver! And now they have one by my new home on the west side! Woo-hoo!

There is a large menu with lots of combinations but I've found that you can pretty much MAKE UP WHATEVER YOU WANT. For example, instead of the CHICKEN AND EGGPLANT or TOFU AND EGGPLANT I just get CHINESE VEGETABLES AND EGGPLANT. It is by far my favorite dish of theirs. 

Just today I had the chicken and eggplant and it was very good. My girlfriend had the tofu and eggplant and it was so hot that I almost got done eating before hers was cool enough to eat. This would be great for a delivery dish, as it would hold it's heat for a long time. Oh, and I think the lady who brought us our meals winked at me!

You can get HALF ORDERS (Most Whole Orders are $9, half orders are $6).

Most lunches come with a combo setup including EGG DROP SOUP.
