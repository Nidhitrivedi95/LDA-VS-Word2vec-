_Ss4d4dYzehTmWJGpkqL7w Reliable, not overly cornstarched cantonese food which is getting harder to find on spadina. They also have daily soup, and a selection of braised stone pot rice items with fish, lamb, Chinese sausage. I have gotten takeout and eaten in the restaurant and both were a-ok. The only downside is that it doesn't have appetizer platters and if you're feeling like barbecue pork or duck then you'll at least have to order a half of one, and a full serving of jellyfish.
