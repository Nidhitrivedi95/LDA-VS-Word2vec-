0PM5oFKO29sZmL5efmHxug Okay dumplings, nothing special.  They also weirdly happen to serve some Korean food on the menu, and maybe it's because I'm picky but there's something about Korean food cooked by Chinese people that doesn't taste quite the same.  Doesn't have that kick to it (whether the dish is spicy or not). Their gamjatang (pork bone soup) was surprisingly decent despite my initial reservations though even the most typical gamjatang at normal Korean restaurants does taste better.  

Was kind of disappointed and surprised that they didn't have my favourite type of dumplings, "Siulongbao/Xiaolongbao" (Shanghai soup dumplings), despite it being aptly named a "Dumpling House".
