I did not have too much expectation for King Huang Restaurant, especially during lunch special. Most of the items on the menu from $5.99. But I got to pick what kind of tea I drink, I have this huge bowl of complimentary soup of the day!

Beef Noodle ($6.99) was decent in portion. Nothing too amazing but quite good. 

I would not hesitate coming back again to King Huang for lunch or even dinner if I want to have some cheap eat.

Service also fast and efficient. 

And if you want to have a taste of wok hay, the essence of Cantonese cooking, you might want to give King Huang a try.
