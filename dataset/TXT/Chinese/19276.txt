5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g Every time I'm in Vegas, I must stop by noodle pot for the beef noodle soup. I think this is my favorite beef noodle soup in the United States. The broth isn't too oily, the meat is super tender and flavorful (melts in your mouth almost), and the broth tastes like it's been simmering for days. Their dumplings are pretty delicious as well. See you again next time I'm in Vegas, noodle pot!
