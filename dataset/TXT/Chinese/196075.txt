zkU-WMio8g6dpRJ2Y2xqvQ I was drawn to this restaurant because I thought the pictures of the food looked so pretty online! I came here on a random weekday morning for the early bird deal. We were instantly...ignored. We stood there for a while and the hostess didn't even greet us. I'm not pleased with this restaurant already. 

We ordered a bunch of food and everything tasted average. Nothing in particular stood out except for the shrimp rice roll. Most dim sum restaurants give you 3 rice roll but here they only give you 2. This isn't a particularly cheap restaurant so I thought that it's quite ridiculous that they would do that.

I wouldn't come back here. For the price point, quality and service, I would rather go somewhere else. A good place to go to is Royale Fine Dining Banquet. The prices are the same, I think, and the service is so much better. I think the dishes are more unique there as well.
