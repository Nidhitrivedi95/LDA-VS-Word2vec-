SNkkuchbVtUzCwyENcai_g One of my favorite places for lunch close to my work. I always order their special lunch menu which has a few choices at $5.95, probably the cheapest Korean food I found ever. Sometimes it can get quite busy at lunch, but the waitress (I see her every time) is always rushing and has a really good attitude. The food is your average Korean restaurant but what makes it a 4-star is the price and location. 

I also tried the Red Dragon Roll, which came with 10 pieces (? - maybe 8) and it was quite good! Would highly recommend this place if you are in the area looking for a good and cheap lunch :).
