rXVLgV4Og3l98OTy6N2dJw Definitely better than average wontons and noodles, but their menu variety is lacking and after a few times I stop wanting to come since it's the same thing over and over.  Restaurant is quite small but I've not had to wait to eat here since the turnover time is quite quick.  

I eat small portions, so the meal size is definitely enough for me, but I imagine typically one might want to add noodles to get full.  Note that add noodle option is +$2.
