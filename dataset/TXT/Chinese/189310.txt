yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA We order the ca to canh chua and it wasn't all that. The chicken porridge was crap as they used frozen chicken breast and not the free range kind. It was late so we thought to give this place a try and boy what a friggin mistake. We should have gone to Bubba Gump!!!!. Oh well our lost and their gain. Also what with the 15% to 20% tips on the check. You are viet restaurant and we tip you however we feel like.
