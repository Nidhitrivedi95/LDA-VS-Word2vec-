lQMZ2Rd0jGf1ZpekZpr1MA Ordered from here yesterday and I was not happy. I ordered the pepper steak with onion and it was not good! They packed the carton with so much steamed rice that there wasn't and gravy/sauce, it had more undone (crunchy af) peppers and onions than meat and it was bland as heck! I just took a few bites and trashed that garbage. I also ordered fried chicken which I didn't eat but HB said it was okay. I had this place before and it wasn't good but I tried to give it another try.. Never again I'll stick with China Mountain this place sucks.
