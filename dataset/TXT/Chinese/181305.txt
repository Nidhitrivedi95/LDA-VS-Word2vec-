xdfGzrJ1mx3mBx6m14Ebhw Haven't been very much the last few years - it's pretty good but wouldn't go out of my way for it - used to stop in a couple of times a month between 2002-08 when I was in the area at night more often.  I give them the 4th star strictly for being open late  and service being good even on very long & busy nights, otherwise would be a 3. 

The safe bets are the noodle soups - Wonton, Tendon, Brisket, or anything with BBQ or Duck in it - slightly on the salty side at times but not to the point of unpleasantness.  I most often go with the Tendon & Noodle.  Rice dishes with BBQ Pork are satisfying, as are Duck or SoySauce Chicken although sometimes the birds are small & a little "boney". Singapore Noodles & Blackbean Chicken is OK & good size for the price.

It's a good value considering hours, price & convenience - I can usually find parking on the sidestreet immediately to the west. They're fairly clean considering the traffic  - when you ask for exta bowl or plate it's always perfectly washed & rinsed (that's a good way to judge a places cleaning diligence...).  The downsides are somewhat uncomfortable seating (booths are tough fit for a bigger person...) The Washrooms are OK by Chinatown standards but they're in the basement and the stairs are extremely steep with tall steps so it could definitely be a problem for anyone with mobility issues or who's been drinking too much.
