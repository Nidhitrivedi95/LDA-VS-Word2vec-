YjlCXwWr9xx6TnHmTFCKGQ Absolutely the BEST dining experience in a long time! The decor is beautiful, the staff were all friendly - our waiter Dominic was fantastic! He explained the dishes we had questions about, made recommendations, kept our glasses full and helped us relax and enjoy the evening. The food was perfect- we had Crab wontons & egg rolls for appetizers then Sesame Chicken, Lemon Chicken breasts with cold broccolini salad on top and Lemon Pepper Shrimp. All were large portions with enough to take home for next day's lunch. My Lemon Pepper Shrimp was SO flavorful that I will order it again!
