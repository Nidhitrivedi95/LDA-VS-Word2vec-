S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A Went last night (6/13/11).  We also had the Groupon, and were anxious to try the place.  We were NOT disappointed!

My wife had the Fried Noodles with Chicken, and I had the Fried Noodles with Beef in Spicy XO sauce.  Enormous portions, and soooooo tasty.  Noodles were excellent, beef was super tender, and seasoning was just about perfect.

Highly recommended, and we'll be returning soon.
