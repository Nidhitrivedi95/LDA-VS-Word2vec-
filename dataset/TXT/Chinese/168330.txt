VOsvscZOFYzcsdbmAlVkiA This restaurant had a great cosy feel to it; it's quite small with only a few tables, but the food here really packs a punch! I had their pulled pork Bao, and it was amazing! The staff was nice, and allowed me to take several pictures of the restaurant. The food was made on the spot and the service was quick. Definitely recommend!
