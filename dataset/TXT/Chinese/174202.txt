wC-wLFVCIjXArsrMuUJdYQ I ordered from here out of desperation for delivery.  I ordered Pot Stickers (the only good thing) Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken.  The beef had large veins of grizzle running down almost every bite.  The breaded chicken was so tough I couldn't finish it.  It was as if they took some frozen, breaded chicken out of a freezer from months of sitting and microwaved it on high until it was over cooked.  I am writing this at 4:24 am because I can't sleep due to the queasiness in my stomach that has lasted roughly 8 hours.  Being a slave to the limited delivery in the Charlotte region certainly takes it's toll.
