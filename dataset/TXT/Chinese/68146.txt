EQZPTDAy-lWijb0i8JpHNw Delicious steamed dumplings and very fast service. When we arrived there was a bit of a wait but it was well worth it.  The only reason why I rated thus 4 out of 5 was due to the fact that they only had some of the options on the menu.  If you're in Montreal and craving dumplings definitely give them a try.
