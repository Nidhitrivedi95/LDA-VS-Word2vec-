e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg Solid special dishes and service. Traditional dishes were not special here but that's not really what you're here for!

We ordered BBQ pork buns, little dragon buns(lamb), octopus and general Sanders chicken. Absolutely loved the octopus, the buns were unique but not blown away. The general Sanders chicken was well cooked but try something else if you're here for the first time (just fried chicken).
