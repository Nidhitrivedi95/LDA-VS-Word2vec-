wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw I love the handmade noodles in their hot and spicy beef noodle soup. The broth is delicious too, albeit a bit salty, don't really mind it though I still love it. The beef brisket was a bit tough but the handmade noodles and broth made up for it!

Service is a bit slow, can be better. I'll definitely keep coming back for the beef noodle soup though :)
