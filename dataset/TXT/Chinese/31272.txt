There's basically two major things to be aware of - (1) you'll frequently see items placed in bins marked with a label for a different food...look before you leap!  Trust your eyes and common sense, not necessarily what the signs tell you!  (2) If you're anxiously awaiting the dessert, stick to the dessert table and avoid the softserve ice cream machine as it can be very scary and unsettling.  If you're saving ice cream for last, it can make a not so nice final impression before you leave!  

The staff (despite their tendency to yell loud Chinese across the window separating the kitchen from the dining room) is generally very friendly and attentive.  Dishes are frequently replenished.  Even though you can generally have an idea what to expect after you've visited enough times, there's still the occasional pleasant surprise - on my last visit they had some different cakes I hadn't seen them offer before.  Some of my favorite items here are the orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, butter potatoes, shrimp, and especially the hot and sour soup.  Their most inconsistent dish are the crab puffs - sometimes bordering on perfection, other times rather sad.
