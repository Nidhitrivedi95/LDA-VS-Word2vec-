Me: "FAT CHOY!" 
Wifey: "Bless you!"

I wanted to come here for the one thing that I keep hearing from my Yelp peeps. The Fat Choy Burger! This wonderful creation is made up of half a pound of angus beef, short rib, bacon, fried egg, cheddar cheese, and a fried tomato. 

Not only did we get the Fat Choy Burger, but we also were intrigued by the choices of Bao Sliders that were on the menu. We got the any 3 plus a drink for 10 bucks deal. We picked the pork belly, peking duck, and for a limited time only, soft shell crab!

Service was awesome. Our server was constantly checking up on us. 

As a bonus, Fluff Ice was there as a temporary pop up to see how people will react with the Fat Choy collaboration. We ordered a medium halo halo and a chocolate crunch. Just the sheer silence of my kids told me that they approve of the fluff ice!

5 stars for all of the above mentioned. Minus one star for the glaring issue they need to address. THE FREAKIN SECOND HAND SMOKE COMING IN FROM THE CASINO! If I was asthmatic, I would not be able to eat here, which is a shame, because the food is that good!

So everything was awesome except for the fear of getting lung cancer.
