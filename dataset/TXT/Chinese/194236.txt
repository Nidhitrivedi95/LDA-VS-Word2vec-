zEd3Ex_k3vHiBbBPWRrO7Q Let me start by saying the food is always great. I always order the same thing for me veggie mix and steamed rice. This particular visit It was a to go order , food for the husband and me. I got to the cashier I paid . I got my receipt i didn't look at it, my fault. Once I got home i thought to myself it seemed a little bit more expensive than usual. I noticed my veggie mix was charged as an entree which is more expensive. I decided to give them a call , i explained to the lady i was charged wrong and she decided to argue and say the veggie mix was not a side!!  All i wanted was an okay bring your receipt next time and we can take care of it but no. So at this point i am like really?? I don't live too far so i went back ask to speak to the manager and showed him my receipt. He noticed i was in fact charged wrong, he end it up giving me my money back for my food. Which he didn't have to , i didn't care if he just gave me the difference . He made the experience much better once again thank goodness for people who know what they are doing.
