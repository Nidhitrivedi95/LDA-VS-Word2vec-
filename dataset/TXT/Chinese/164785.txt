UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w Nothing over the top. The food was okay. Decent selection. Food was hot. Waitress was nice,  keeping us filled with oj and coffee.  Fruit, bacon, creeps, omelets to order, mexican items, sausage links,  egg choices, waffles, pancakes, french toast, cream of wheat, cereals.  For the price you can't beat it!
