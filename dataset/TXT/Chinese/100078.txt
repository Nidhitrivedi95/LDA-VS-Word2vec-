JYCL0ThG7Xw5KDfyVDgb7A We visited this location after craving spicy chinese hotpot but not wanting to pay the price. Papa Spicy specialized in "BBQ/Hotpot fish". Essentially, a whole fish is either grilled or fried and then put into a hotpot where it bathes in a soup broth (there are 6 choices carrying from spicy to not spicy). You can then select what you want to add as toppings from a list at a fee of $2 for vegetables and $4 for meat (the toppings are the regular hotpot choices). The dish then comes in a large tray on a burner with the fish and the toppings bathing in the soup base. 

We went for the $20.99 fish (mainly because neither of us knew our fishes...)and added fresh tofu, cabbage, vermicelli and beef. Together, with two bowls of rice, it came to a total of $47 including tax and tips. 

The food while it satisfied our cravings for hotpot, was in my opinion a bit too much on the oily side. Everything was covered with a thin film of red chilli oil. The fish also came cold ... Which was indicative of it being prepared ahead of time and frozen/defrosted? Toppings were not the most generous but not too bad either. 

Overall, not a bad experience but I don't think I would come back on a regular basis

They take cash only and charge a mandatory 10% tip.
