fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw I personally like the idea of FAME. 

The smaller restaurants inside deserve seperate ratings as far as service and food. I came by The Linq a few days ago and they an event going on outside. It was a lot like First Friday that is hosted in the Art District. 

I even bought a peice by Jef Logan. 

It is still pretty new and I feel they could do more to promote the venues.
