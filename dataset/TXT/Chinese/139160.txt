QUH62pA1CN0LiuIF1pPJnQ I'm a lo-mein and hot-and-sour soup guy. Tried both and loved them. With the lo-mein, the only thing I would change would be to cut the pork in strips rather than serve in whole chunks. Goes further in the dish and texturally feels better. Besides that, add a little louder music in the dining room, it was fairly quiet.

Great staff, great food. Will definitely be back.
