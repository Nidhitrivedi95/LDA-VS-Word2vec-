Another Chinese-Japanese restaurant, a strange combination which seems popular in Charlotte for some reason, really don't know why. Three of us had lunch there a while back. First impression decor is dramatic, and service was prompt but that's the end of the good news. 

As for the sushi the only fish they have is salmon and tuna or yellowtail, typical for Charlotte really. Honestly due to the lack of variety I've given up on Sushi restaurants these days. Instead I buy quality sushi grade yellowtail and Scottish salmon by the pound -the fish store up the street - we have everything we need, wasabi, soya, sesame etc to pig out on sashimi at home. :)

For lunch we ordered Gyoza and 3 items from the Chinese menu, one of them was a shrimp dish, the other two I can't remember because the cooking was generic and there was nothing memorable about it ...other than it was bland. Well at least it wasn't bad.

Nice place, average food. Matthews is a foodies hell.
