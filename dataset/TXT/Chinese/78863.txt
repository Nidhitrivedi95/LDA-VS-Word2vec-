GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog We had an excellent experience at China Poblano.

The food was a 4.5/5. We started with the lotus chips, which were delicious but slightly oversalted. We then got the tableside guacamole which we both thought was some of the best guacamole we've ever had since we were able to customize it to our liking. The refried bean taco and the mushroom taco were both excellent. Our last dinner item was the 20 vegetable fried rice. It was great, but not life changing or in any way better than most old school fried rice. 

What really made our meal was the service. Our waitress, Kimberly, was not only kind and prompt despite the restaurant being busy, but she was paying excellent attention. After she took our order and realized that we ordered all vegetarian items, she came back to ask if the oyster sauce and eggs in the fried rice were okay and offered to omit them if needed. Then, when she made our tableside guac and we asked for the red onion and cilantro to be omitted, she asked if we wanted these omitted from our other dishes too. Maybe to some people noticing those things wouldn't be a big deal but we were really impressed that she was paying such great attention. We will definitely be back.
