1CeWMRJwyFkQ-fc3MR1Dmg Came to this branch yesterday with a couple of new friends to share some dishes family style. We ordered the following to share:
- House special congee (seafood)
- Vegetable chow mein 
- Vegetable fried rice 
- Garlic stir fried snow pea sprouts
- XO sauce turnip patties
- Seafood stir fried Taiwanese vermicelli

The congee base was excellent - as someone coming from Mississauga, I haven't had such good congee in a while. However, the seafood they chose was lacklustre. Our bowl was loaded with tilapia and bass, instead of stuff like shrimp and salmon. 

Since I was feeling slightly sick, I didn't sample everything there. The vermicelli, however, was really good and tasty. I also loved the snow peas, which came in a generous portion. 

After splitting the bill among 9 people, the total came to slightly under $12 including taxes and tips.
