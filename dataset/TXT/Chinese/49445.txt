CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw The food is good but it's so pricey and smaller compare to other place. I've had better food but the service is better  It's also clean, they wear latex gloves when handing you the dim sum. I've never seen a Chinese restaurant that wears any. I also had the roasted, the presentation is great.

If you wanna get full for a good price. Don't come here. If you're lazy and don't want to leave the Strip and don't like PF Changs or Chin Chins. Come here.
