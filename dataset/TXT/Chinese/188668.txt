yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA DO NOT GO HERE!!! I don't usually write bad reviews but place this deserves ZERO stars. They increased and over charged everything on the menu. While eating we were already disappointed how terrible the food was compared to before. 

When the bill came out, we realized they ripped us off. We ordered tons of food, they brought out white rice and charged us $15. First of all, a bag of rice is $25 that will last you for a year. They freaking charge you $1.50 per small bowl...WTF??? We didn't even ask for rice and they brought it out for no reason and refused to refund us the money until we argued with them.

I would never come back and I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are tons of restaurants around, there is no reason to come here. 

Steam chicken $26
Ca Kho To $18.90
Canh Chua $18.90
Coconut (not fresh) $5.50
Fried Tofu (4 )  $10
Rice - $15 for a bucket 

Vietnames food should not be this expensive. This place is NOT an upscale restaurant. I rather spend this amount at a Thai, Japanese,  or other upscale restaurants. Coconut is usually $2.50, Ca Kho To is usually under $10. If the food was superb, I don't mind paying for it but it wasnt.
