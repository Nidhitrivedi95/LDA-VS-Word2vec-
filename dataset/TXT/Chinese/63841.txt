E_mRnwhHLuz6tgMBScw1mw I just ordered a second time and I'm so dang please with how fresh the food tastes. I had a vermicelli soup and I ordered everything with shrimp, chicken and beef and boyyyyy was it worth the extra to add some of them in. I ordered a mixed vegetables with shrimp, chicken and beef as well and plain white rice all I can say is OMG. How fresh their food taste and how large the shrimps are is just wowzers. The beef is large as well and everything is extremely tasty. I could eat here everyday. I've been feeling for fresh tasting food and this restaurant hits the spot at all times. Will continue ordering from here. They are officially my favourite place to eat. One day I'm going to have to eat in to check the place out :)
