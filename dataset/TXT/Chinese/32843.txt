a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg We had take out here once and the food was very over priced,  meet friends there yesterday at their request and the food is okay but the prices are real expensive especially since the food portions are really small.  Everything is a la carte, you do not get soup and an egg roll with your entrees.  The chicken chow mein is really good and the same way they make it back east.  The dinner portion is very very small and comes with a very small bowl of rice white or brown.  They will not substitute fried rice and they only bring out the chips when you order either a soup or a entree.  We had to asked the waiter who I think was the owner more than 5x for chips.  The wor won ton soup really does not have any flavor and is a bit salty.  Very expensive for the amount of food you get...plus it is very  very cold in the restaurant and they would not lower the a/c. I had to put a sweater on and wished I had gloves...if you want less expensive good Chinese food with large portions try Qwik Chinese Bistro on 92nd & Via Linda which is where we wanted to go but they are now closed on Monday.   The food is just ok, nothing to write home about and the portions are really small they will not fill you up.
