IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ My husband and I really enjoyed this place.  The soups are a must for a good hangover!  I'm giving it 4 Stars because of the Roasted Duck soup, and the service was friendly. 5 Stars are for the "OH MY GOSH!" places. While good, this wasn't one of those.

  I think the reason people aren't giving this place better reviews is because they are used to their hometown Chinese joint, which I get, and because it's Vegas and it's pricier than their hometown too! LOL.  We loved it!  It tastes like Sam Wo's in SF, CA! Which I LOVE!  My sister ate here as well with us, and we've literally been craving the place, and my sister is SUPER picky with food!  So, there is my opinion!  I love it.
