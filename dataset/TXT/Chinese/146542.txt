"When would you like it?"

That's the FIRST thing that comes to mind when I think about my review for Gourmet Wok.  I found this place through some searching around my immediate work area and, being the diligent Yelper I am, wanted to try something new.

I haven't been so excited to try a new place in awhile!  I get excited when I find diamonds in the rough, and I think that's a fair assessment of this place.

Their prices are great and it's insanely fast.  I ordered, drove over there (~4 minutes) and my food was already bagged and ready for me.

I've tried the veggie egg foo yung and kung pao chicken here.  They are both different styles than what I'm used to, but good nonetheless.  Portions are a good size, and $4.25 for a lunch special?  Come on, bro - why even bother with McDonald's?  Cheap, fast, healthy.  Sold.

The lady at the counter is always really nice too.  One time I called in and she asked for my name and she laughed and said, "You have a very expensive name."

ALSO: They have boba tea!  Yay!  Close boba tea!  Not great for my low-sugar diet, but that's ok.  =)
