ZL9sk7Imc42BNRhcjgnqPw Maybe I'm outgrowing my love for deep-fried foods, but the last few times I've ordered my "usual" here (general Tao chicken), I've been disappointed by the hard-to-find pieces of chicken under the very thick coating of batter. I'm a creature of habit and wish they would just make my "favourite" like they used to, rather than me try to find a replacement on their menu. There are too many other consistently good restaurants in mtl to bother.
