9xitj8uws6IpbhlxV5tpSQ The Only Cuisine Corp location used to be a Bar10der where a lot of UFC party has been held and of course other sport viewing event include College Basketball.. And now it is a Northern Chinese Restaurant.

The interior has been completely renovated. No more TVs and monitors showing baseball/hockey games. All the patrons have one thing in mind now.. just like me is to eat!

Everything here is just mega sized, for sure bring a friend or two with big appetite as the menu here is extensive!!

I ended up trying:

Beef Noodle Soup (a little blend in taste)
BBQ Lamb Kabob (well flavoured with cumin)
Sliced Beef Bun (a little on the dry side)
Lotus Paste Pancake (for dessert)

Price wise is really reasonable. Though nothing outstanding and exceptional but everything done A-OK.

The patio in front is perfect for smokers to hang out in between dishes, not really set up as space for eating and drinking.

Give The Only Cuisine Corp a try if you are in the area..
