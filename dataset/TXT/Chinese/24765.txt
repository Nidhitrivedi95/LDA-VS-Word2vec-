6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ I've been here a few times and each time it was pretty good. The food is decent and the service was good.  Although I've only come late at night and there were only a few other tables with couples.  It's not your typical Japanese restaurant with sushi.  The prices are fair for the portions.  I always leave feeling satisfied.  The food is tasty and they have some interesting flavours for the different dishes.  I like that they are open late and the food has been consistent.
