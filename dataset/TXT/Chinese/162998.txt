uP2-0N59oW5lggIyvdfWkQ We took my in-laws to this restaurant for lunch today.  We have ordered mostly the traditional Chinese dishes such as steamed pork dumplings, pork pot stickers, Shanghainese stir-fry noodles, Green Onion Pan Cakes etc.  Although the taste was decent, I am more concerned with the service as they have no idea of what was served and was still missing.  Moreover, they have a tendency not to write the order down mean while there were only 5 tables at the time.  May I also mind you that the portions are quite small too compared to other Chinese restaurants.
