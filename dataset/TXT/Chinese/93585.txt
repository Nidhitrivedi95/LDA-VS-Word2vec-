J3pAkjiicmJzXRIEDZInEA Panda Peng offers a table hote course or an all-you-can-eat menu. Since I was here for lunch, I opted for the course. I went with the Won Ton soup and General Tao. What can I say? I always go for the classics.

The Won Ton soup was served within minutes and was pretty good. The size is about what you'd expect.

The General Tao plate consisted of a moderately sized rice ball, a decent portion of General Tao and a huge serving of veggies. The General Tao was really solid, it was crunchy and the sauce was just right. The rice ball was freshly prepared and accompanied the General Tao perfectly. The star of this plate however was the veggies, they were phenomenally good. They were the first things to disappear from my plate. The meal was very good.

As for the service and decor, the service was friendly and courteous. The decor was really nice and modern. The seating was comfortable. The price tag for lunch is economically and worthy as a regular lunch option.

I'd definitely be back for the all-you-can-eat option though. If that passes the check, I'll upgrade this to a 5 stars! :)
