zs710LuQ8y10YsQHIjxjyw I went here with a group of friends 2 weekends ago and I can say that it is a really busy restaurant. To be honest, every restaurant at commerce gate is busy on the weekend... Parking took me probably 25-30 minutes to find. We also had to wait for a seat, which probably took another 10-15 minutes. The restaurant was full so it was understandable. They rushed to give us a table which was appreciated. 

We were put in a corner (technically is like a hole because there's 3 walls around us, well for half the table anyway) to fit 6 people and all I could smell when I first sat down was vinegar. It wasn't something I would want to smell throughout the dinner. Since we were in a corner, it was hard to find a server but since we were a big group and were chatting most of the time, it didn't bother us too much.

They had a large variety of dumplings and dishes on their menu for a fair price. Everything that we order tasted great. The only downside to what we ordered was the Mo Shu pork. It was $8.99 so I expected it to come with the thin pancakes (like all the other restaurants) but it didn't. The dish was also very small so it is definitely not worth the price. We had to add pancakes for an additional cost, which to be honest, we didn't want to pay, but we did anyway.

Overall experience was decent, as it was my first time going there, but it wouldn't be my first choice in Dumpling restaurants.
