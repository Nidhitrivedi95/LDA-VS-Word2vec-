The staff inside are friendly, efficient and seem to be constantly smiling.  The menu is what you would expect in most Chinese takeaways with plenty to choose from in the way of soups, curries, szechuan and sweet and sour dishes.  I went for the chicken Kung Po which didn't take long at all to be prepared and had an interesting combination of mushrooms, chillies and even peanuts.  It was delicious and I would have it again any day of the week.  This, along with a portion of special fried rice and a can of Irn-Bru, came to about £7 which was certainly reasonable considering the quality of the food.  
If you're on Leith Walk, or even fancy a delivery, then Capital Chinese Take Away is well worth a shot.
