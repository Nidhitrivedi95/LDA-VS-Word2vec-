E0h1kK-8P_DtBHk5ClVI_g Went back for a second try - not by my choice, mind you...

... and my rating's still the same: 1 star.

Again, food was okay. But service was just as brutal as the first time 'round - if not WORSE because this time, we sat in a smaller dining room. So I guess if they can't see you... you ain't getting served.

Oh, and this time? No mustard at all. Not even Frenchies...

If this place ever deserved an award it would be for: Consistency in Poor Service!
