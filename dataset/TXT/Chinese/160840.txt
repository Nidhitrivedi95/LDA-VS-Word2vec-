UC2dfjZg8mrRh10maovQfw My Dim Sum standards are probably lower now that i've moved away from Toronto. 

However, I think that Royale does a pretty solid job at it. 

It's conveniently located and its parking lot is relatively easier to navigate than other popular Dim Sum restaurants. 

It's spacious with high ceilings and numerous tables. 

I also found the staff to be pretty attentive and the overall environment a little less frantic than average.

The true reason for the 4-star rating is their char siu bolo bau (pineapple pork buns). They were great and I would return just to reorder them again.
