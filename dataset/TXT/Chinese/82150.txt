I was a little skeptical because the exterior went in after the lunch rush and ordered a combination plate really really good. The experience (food) took me back to the 1970's eating dinner with my parents having  Cantonese Chinese fare. As a matter of fact I'm taking the folks next week. You gotta give this place a try who would have known apparently most of Phoenix except for me. In closing the prices are super reasonable to.
