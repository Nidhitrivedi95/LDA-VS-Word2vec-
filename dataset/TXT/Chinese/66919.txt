ejdBoVvEdn5fdycuJRen8Q First Wok's your typical Chinese take-out restaurant: greasy, run-of-the-mill, one-dimensional food with monosodium glutamate overload to boot. 

Last time around, the person at the counter, probably the owner, seemed to be in a particularly grumpy mood. Maybe she was just having a bad hair day?

On the upside, at least I didn't end up with an upset stomach after eating their chicken lo mein. So there's that. 

Overall, at best, First Wok's worth 2.5 stars but I will be generous and round it up 3.
