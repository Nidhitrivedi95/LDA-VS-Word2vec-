wh44YZa9OCXjV-ziZ6gjNA Honestly, wasn't a fan. The food was ridiculously too common. They didn't have alot of specialties. The rolls were really small which is good for AYCE I guess. . Barely any veg options. Just had cucumber and avocado rolls. The tempura we're really soggy. Steak was good and meaty. The fries were also crunchy and yummy.  MY favourite dish was the grilled tofu.  The service was bad. We asked about 5 times for extra plates or clarification and they would say they would come back but they didn't.  They forgot alot of our dishes too so we had to keep reordering. Using an iPad to order is cool.
