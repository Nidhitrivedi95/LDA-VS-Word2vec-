PEulzjDwcSL_ujv5mRbc4w New York Wok offers pretty good General Tso's Chicken, Orange Chicken and Sesame Chicken. The Cantonese chef does a great job serving up crispy chicken with flavorful sauce. The char siu fried rice was mediocre, so I recommend ordering the entrees with steamed rice. Take-out Chinese.
