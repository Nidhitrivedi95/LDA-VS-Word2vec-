Q6Kp7sp3GXykifV2TjomZQ This Chang Jiang location was my go-to place for Chinese takeout when I used to work in Verona.

As with all the Chang Jiang chains in the area, the food can be quite greasy, but the portions are huge, the prices are decent, and the food doesn't taste bad at all. Your orders are completed quickly and sometimes one order can last 2-3 meals.
