bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Very nice place Chinese restaurant. A little bit loud, but food was delicious and service was good. Have vigeterian option for the vigeterian people out there.
Most importantly, they have nice shows at night. I enjoyed that on a Friday night, but not sure how often do they run it.
