8TpKY3zo6UzG3SVk6a-FRg This is the second time I've been back here. The congee is so yummy here and the portion is huge for only $5. I did also have the beef rice crepe, which I found the crepe to be too thick and the soy sauce bland. I wouldn't get dim sum here. I also had the beef and egg sauce over fried rice noodles. This was starchy goodness. It was good, but it didn't have the crispiness on the bottom of the dish that I enjoyed so much at another restaurant in Toronto. When I'm in this area, this is my go-to for some old fashioned comfort food.
