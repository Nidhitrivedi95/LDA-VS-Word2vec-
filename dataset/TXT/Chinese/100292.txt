JzV9vG0z6h2pllvUyTVxFw I really liked this place back when it was in the strip mall that Bill's grocery store is in. We would get the take-out all the time and it was almost always good and tasty. Now that they moved into a stand-alone restaurant with a buffet the quality has really gone down hill. My family went for the buffet once and it was quite disappointing. I'm sure it doesn't help that buffets in general gross me out but the food was abnormally bland.
At least a couple times after that we tried ordering take-out. Again, disappointing. Nothing like the fresh food we had gotten many times at their previous location. In fact, I'm 99% sure that the last time we ordered take-out there it was given to us from the buffet! Yuck. It wasn't hot or fresh tasting when we got it home. So, that's the end of our relationship with Ming Moon. Too bad because Oregon could use a good Chinese restaurant. Or Indian. Or Thai. I'm not picky if it's good! :)
