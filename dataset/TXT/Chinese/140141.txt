r2qLNZaYTZKjvVXfXB1BLQ I got the tomato beef hand pulled noodles. Yes, they are hand pulled noodles so will not be all equal widths. However, this led to undercooked noodles. Beef brisket were tiny cubes that were slighter bigger than the size of dice. 

The three of us that got hand pulled noodles were almost finished before the sliced noodle arrived. So they need to work on timing of dishes arriving.

We also got the beef pancake. Very doughy and salty not a lot of beef. This was supposed to be the appetizer, but it arrived last. 

Considering this is a new establishment, they have a lot of room for improvement.
