8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ Been here like 5 years ago.   And what pissed me off is the greeter, JUDY!   She lets people in without waiting nor reservation.   For god sake.   There is like 30 people waited for at least 45 mins!   What kinda of service is this?    Unacceptable.   Fast forward to 2017.   JUDY is still here.  And I called prior coming.  And the restaurant said no reservation during 9-11am.   So I give it a try and hope that their service improve.  The result is. Beyond terrible.  I was waiting for like 45min.  A women walked in and asked Judy table for 3.   Soon the lady got the table.  Which was suppose to be mine.  I guess next time just come in and ask for JUDY!   No need to wait!   Parking is terrible.  Only 10 spots for the whole restaurant.
