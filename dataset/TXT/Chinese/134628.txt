Q6ql-vhEfkUiry1r0XoDTA Arriving on a weeknight, the place was only at around 25% capacity.  The place overall isn't too big, with tables that are too small.  Luckily, they will provide a table extension in order to hold all the food you will be ordering.  

The pricing is in the mid-high $20s, with soup bases costing extra.  You get what you pay for, with not much extra value being provided.  

Service was attentive, with the wait staff coming by frequently to refill our water and soup.  Unfortunately, a few items were missed which required reordering.  The staff speaks English, Cantonese, and Mandarin.

Overall it was an average experience, which doesn't mean it's bad.  There's just wasn't really anything that makes it stand out from the many other hotpot restaurants in Markham.
