RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ How could I not love Rose Tea Cafe?! This was the first place that served up bubble tea and the food is not half bad either!  I love the shaved ice dessert above all else.. This place does not disapoint with the choice of dishes on the menu.. I usually order the three cup chicken - delish! a must go for great taiwanese food.. I'm not sure if they have expanded the restaurant but if I remember, the place is small and it does get crowded during busy hours.. still not too bad of a wait tho.
