cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ Visiting town and I came across this little gem. I'm from the San Francisco bay area where we have great thai food. My expectations were very high and Sakina Thai definitely met up to those expectations.

Me and my wife ordered:
Satay Chicken - 5/5
Pad Ze Ew - 5/5
Basil Fried Rice - 5/5
Orange Chicken - 5/5
Mongolian Beef - 3/5

Yes 2 people ordered all that food. The Basil fried rice is a must here! Mongolian Beef was a little overcooked and dry but I still gave this place 5 stars because the owner and chef Sakina is super sweet. My only word of advice is to check water levels. The misses water glass was empty for a long time before waitress refilled it.

I have a stomach cramp from all the food I ate but it's a happy cramp. Go to Sakina; you won't be disappointed!
