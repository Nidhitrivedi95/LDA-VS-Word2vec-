fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA Chinatown's best dumpling hot spot! Always super busy with Chinese ladies making your order a la minute! The place is small so go early to get a spot. My favourite are the pan fried lamb dumplings, lamb dumplings and Shanghainese noodles. Pan froed dumplings are super crispy! I love this place! Cash only.
