VGKq16vCdPPHMoryy6XTHg This place houses my FAVORITE meal in madtown... 3 CUP TOFU!
This stuff is amazing!  White rice topped with a deliciously sweet and spicy sauce with tofu that is cooked to perfection with some amazing pickled vegetables on the side.  My boyfriend is a meat eater and this is always what he orders as well.  And we always start with the chips and guac.
Seriously, stop in for this meal!!!
Drink wise, they have a large selection, I usually get a beer and the bf loves the high tea (i think that's what it's called).
Love that they have DJ's every night.
As for the crowd, I feel as if it is the perfect mix of all types of people.
