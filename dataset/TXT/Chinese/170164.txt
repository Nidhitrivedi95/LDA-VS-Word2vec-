VVUL1lzBOipXJlOG1wURMg We ordered the Thai Red Curry Chicken with rice from the lunch menu.  I really enjoyed this red curry chicken since the red curry was extremely creamy and the coconut cream was very evident.  The pieces of chicken in the dish were also tender and moist.  There were also chunks of eggplant and green peas within it.  It was a great choice!
