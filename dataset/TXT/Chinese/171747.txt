VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Always solid service, food, love the updates they did to the restaurant (beautiful booths, colors, pux).  Clean, friendly and the best chinese fusion in the area. 

Been coming to flos for over a decade..saturday 6.00 lunch.. Amazing! Salad + seems like over 20+ items to choose from for sat special. I would come and pay full price :) arrive before 12 noon the place will be packed by 12:10.

-flos bbq pork+ chicken fried rice always a must. Chili oil and their yummy salad with their signature dressing. Delish!
