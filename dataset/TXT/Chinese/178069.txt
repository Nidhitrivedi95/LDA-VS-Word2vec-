x_4gEfC25uiX21NyYdohgQ Main reason for coming here is they have Mongolian BBQ.  The only place in west Phoenix that offers this specialty. And it's delicious. They also have a variety of shrimp, seafood, and meat dishes. My Favs are chow mein, bacon wrapped shrimp, walnut prawns, egg custard tarts,and BBQ pork.  Priced right! Overall if you are looking for a buffet this is pretty good.
