tw8I1hZdlGpwO2QaAIeQWg Great selection of food, always pleased with the food, no complaints there. 
Bathrooms do not have a baby changing area which is extremely fustrating.  Although the place is busy, the servers don't keep up with keeping the tables cleaned from dishes and keeping drinks full. Also on several occasions while eating there the staff doesn't pay attention and will walk into you and not say excuse me. That's rude. I would like to give 5 star but in fairness not having a place to change your baby is a big deal and servers who frequently bump into customers because they are simply not paying attention and not say anything to customer isn't good.
