SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ I've missed this place because it's sort of "set back away" from Shea Rd, IMO. Or, maybe I drive fast and just blur by it.

I'm glad I stopped last night to try them out. Granted, it was take-out, but I was lusting for some Pad Thai. They do a nice one - excellent/vibrant flavors and generous chunks of moist chicken and shrimp. 

Tried Chicken Lo Mein as well. Noodles were of good quality and nice and firm. Flavors worked well and ample chicken pieces.

I wish Take-Out orders would be handled by Hostess or other, in lieu of Bartender at very busy bar. I felt like sort of a tool and "in the way" standing by ppl seated at bar w/not a seat free.  Not a huge deal though. :)

*NOTE: Parking is viciously competetive around 5-7pm on weekday evening, if you're cheap like me and don't valet. LOL
