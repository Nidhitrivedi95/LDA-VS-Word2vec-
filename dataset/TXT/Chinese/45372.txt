brAUHv7Kmxx5nclssCPldA Went to this restaurant with a total party of three this afternoon. 

Yelpers have half praised this place. As expected, there are some dishes that are very well done but some, not quite to my liking. 

First, this is a comfortable small restaurant. The decor is not too grand but decent enough that you won't feel that you are in a hole in a wall type. 

In a corner of the restaurant, there is a set up for Tea Tasting Ritual -- when I asked the waiter how much is that for showing us the Tea Tasting Ritual, he said we have to inquire with the owner.

We ordered five dishes:

Crab meat Xiao Long Bao - Quite tasty. I suspect that a fair amount of MSG is in it. But the problem is that the skin is too thick -- not to my liking. Grade C. 

Dumpling - issue is the skin is not well cooked -- need to spray some water on the dumplings prior to finishing the dish. Grade C. 

Kung Pao Chicken - quite tasty and well cooked. Grade B.

Marinated Cucumbers -- Good dish to have, Grade B. 

Beef noodle soup -- the beef is outstanding, but the noodle is just not right. The soup taste is ok. Based on the beef, it is worth a B.

Business is decent but they have only one waiter. He is stretched way too thin. Also the dishes take too long -- I suspect that there is only one cook in the kitchen. 

Pricing is reasonable, not cheap but properly priced. Portions are adequate. 

Final grade: This is not really a four star restaurant but is a solid three star.
