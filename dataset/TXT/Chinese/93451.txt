Ask my Spousal Unit and she'll tell you that all Bob S. ever really wants to find is a noodle shop that serves big bowls of noodles with all sorts of goodies on them. I'm still working my way through their several noodle types and additions, searching for that transcendental bowl of noodle-ness. 

I ordered a spicy broth, egg noodle, baby bok-choy with beef. The broth wasn't very spicy but there are 'Scoville' additives available on the table for cranking up the heat. A tasty bowl but, I'll keep working it. Service is variable, language confusion happens but, hey, it's a new place, I'll give them some time to work out the kinks. In the meantime, find me slurping noodles at HKS.
