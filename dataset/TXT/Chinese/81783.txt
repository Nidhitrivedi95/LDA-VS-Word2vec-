H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag Ordered the Kung Pao Chicken all day special and was impressed by everything I got. Wonton, Shrimp, Egg Roll, Fried Rice, and obviously my Kung Pao. I would've also got soup but the lady assumed I wasn't staying in so I just decided not to. My only complaint would be that there wasn't much chicken in the Kung Pao Chicken.
