tUxOHYVW6e1l2frBQ7pAtA We were glad to see this place open up where Regal 16 used to be on 16th Avenue. The decor is great (typical Chinese restaurant), food is fantastic and service is very friendly. We love the embience here and we like that it opens late. 

The food is above-average from other comparable Chinese restaurants. There is a very large menu selection and surprisingly dishes come out very fast. We usually order more than we can eat so we can take the rest home to eat later. 

Unlike other Chinese restaurants, all the staff seem to be able to speak English; a plus for "gwei lohs" like us. In summary, a great place, great food at a very reasonable price. We will return for sure.
