cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A Food is always great as it speaks for itself I just love this place. I like
 How you can try everything before you buy it and its rare that restraunts let you do that.  I usually get that ginger chicken thing(emerald) and jen red chicken jerk fried rice and blk beans . absolutely delicious i use to hate beans there for not eat em but chino has truly got me into them ty again chino i think you guys are great if you. Dont believe me ask Guy from dinners drive ins and dives n he'll tell ya!
