hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA Go for the Salt n Pepper Shrimp, fried chicken wings, cocktail shrimp, snow crab legs, raw oysters, greens, and fish... they also have clams, mussels, crawfish... the kids love this place.  We always print out the 10% off coupon online.  For all the seafood thats offered, it's better than your average chinese/asian buffets around town...
