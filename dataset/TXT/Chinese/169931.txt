Vuk8Xn0RmP1o88QqfB75qg Bonflavor is one of the few places in the Willowdale area where you can get dim sum.  Unfortunately, that doesn't make it good.

One good thing about this restaurant is that it's near Centerpoint Mall, so there's ample parking.  But just look at the banner outside and you'll see:  Its so-called dim sum special (before 11AM) still has each dish costing over $3, more expensive than any place I've tried in Chinatown, and the price looks even higher compared with the places in Markham and Scarborough.  This place even adds a surcharge of over a dollar per person for tea, a cheapskate move that immediately lowered my esteem of it.  Service was okay, staff was courteous, but the wait time for the food was substantial.  And the dim sum menu is very small.

The food looks better than it tastes.  Because of the sky-high prices, I ordered only three dishes.  The Phoenix Talons (fung zau, <U+9CF3><U+722A>, chicken feet) are all right, but for such a high price, you get a pretty small portion.  The pork dumplings (siu mai, <U+71D2><U+8CE3>) are fine, softer than most places and tasting like they're not as overstuffed with MSG.  The deep-fried shrimp dumplings (<U+8766><U+89D2>), however, are literally the worst I've had anywhere.  They look and taste like they were left frying for too long, and the insides are way too salty, with an aftertaste that I normally associate with seafood that isn't fresh.

The decor isn't even all that great, a spartan wood-and-white-paint kind of deal.  Seating is comfortable enough but nothing special, either.  For these prices, I can get five or six dishes somewhere else.  I feel like this place wants to be upscale but falls short on both visuals and food quality.
