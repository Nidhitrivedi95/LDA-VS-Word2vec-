R8Mw0iFenJ3nwXuZb7Ql4A Service was so slow, why cold desserts took over 25 minutes to serve is beyond me. My small bowl came out first, and I finished it. Then my friends came out after we had to ask when it was coming out! Looking around, others weren't getting their menus nor their orders taken. Saw a few people having to go up to the old waitresses to tell them in person because they were tired of waiting around unacknowledged. Desserts themselves tasted decent but not special. I've had better in other locations for the same price in bigger portions with much better service. Even as I was trying to pay, the waitress trying to cash me out wouldn't give me the tray with my coins, holding onto it with dear life it seemed. She was trying to say OH by the way tip wasn't included in the bill you know. Since when do you need to ask me for my tip like that??? So please, can I get the rest of my change back and let me decide on my own? It was all despicable. Won't ever return. What a waste of money, had a really bad evening out.
