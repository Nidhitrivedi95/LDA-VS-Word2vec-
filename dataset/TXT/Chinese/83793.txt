hDwlVqoOOFuWX6DG41QP5g I wish Yelp would allow two and a half stars. 

Why is it so difficult to find Moo Shu in Gastonia?  Don't know.  China City has Moo Shu  pork, chicken, etc. on their menu.  That's why I tried them. 

They ONLY take cash as of 12/01/14.   Not knowing this, I had to visit the ATM at the BiLo  next door.  Bummer. 

I got Moo Shu Chicken.  It tasted yummy, but it was light on the meat and heavy on the cabbage.  There were no mushrooms. 

The shrimp eggrolls were huge. Lots of shrimp. Mega greasy. 

The young man at the counter was friendly, very attractive. Sexy. 

China City is out of my way. I don't see myself going back.
