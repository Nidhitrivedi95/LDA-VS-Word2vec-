Vuk8Xn0RmP1o88QqfB75qg Good location... Lots of businesses and people in the area... But it was quiet at lunch time.  The XO beef rice noodle... Had nice tender beef and good portions but it didn't have much XO flavor.  Just spicy hot.  Also had preserved salty fish and chicken cubes fried rice... Again not very flavorful... Really wanted to find good Chinese food in this area... Haven't tried the dim Sum... Looks like the dim sum menu is small. Special Prices before 11am on weekdays and 10:30 on Saturday.
