8FUzCm4Q13MJMX7N6ftmQw Good take out w/fresh ingredients and generous portions.  Big menu of wok-cooked Chinese fare served fast and furious.  I was not as impressed w/the flavors of the food as apparently others were.  Not a good dine in place but gr8 lunch specials.  Sea bass in black bean sauce is good.
