U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Awful food.  Shared mongolian beef with wife.
Cheapest cut of meat I have ever had.  Chewed like a rubber tire.  For $24 they really failed miserably and then added insult to injury with a portion of rice that was in a mini bowl the size of a cup.  Shame shame to the tightwad owners
