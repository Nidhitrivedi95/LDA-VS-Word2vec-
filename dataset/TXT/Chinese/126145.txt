OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA My family has been going to this restaurant for years. Despite the terrible customer service and total lack of ambience, what kept us going was the decently priced food and taste. After several encounters over the past year with rude servers and management, we won't be coming again!

When dining in the restaurant on a busy Friday, our food arrived undercooked (pakoras deep fried until quite dark, but raw from the inside) and when we sent it back, they simply threw it back in the fryer and brought the exact same batch out. When we inquired about this they were unsympathetic and literally told us "if you don't like it then don't eat it". We left without having a meal and took our business elsewhere.

A restaurant that does not care about the customer experience and only about delivering low quality food "on time" is not a place worth going to. Try the millions of well priced and quality food/service Hakka places in the GTA.
