TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA Not like it used to be.  I used to come here all the time about 6 years ago.  I always got the Golden Gate Special Beef, which was a huge pile of beef in a thick red sauce, sprinkled with candy-coated walnuts.  I decided to get that again and was disappointed to find a small plate of soggy fried beef in a watery sauce with a few plain walnuts.  My dining companion had the garlic chicken and it was a little slimy.  The crab angels tasted fishy and the pot stickers were more wrapper than filling, so everything was a disappointment.  It definitely isn't as good and it's far more expensive than I remember it.  Too bad.
