h8zFBTYBKSwDFcHuFgwpmQ Came here with my family yesterday for a birthday celebration. The service was not bad. Seafood was very fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the congee base we selected because after an hour of steaming,  it was really flavorful! 

Price wise is on the higher end.  For 5 people, we ordered combo c and a and a few side dishes (skewers)  and it came to around $360.00. 

Final verdict: would I come here again?  Absolutely,  but only for special occasion.
