CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw This is quality stuff.  With a hefty price tag.  No MSG and everything made in house:

*Ordered the siu mai platter and the scallop was the favorite.  Gold leaf, completely unnecessary, uh this is how they charge $2/pp, plus you're in Vegas, deal with it
*incredible egg noodles in the won ton soup
*DO the pea shoot salad, lovely
*LOVED the wood ear starter, slightly pickled and for the more adventurous

Skip: choy sum, don't like all the sauce, or I would order on the side, meaty shitakes

They have fab tea: jasmine pearls.

Everything tastes natural and fresh.  Love it.  I don't like the TYPICAL grease laden, salty Chinese food.  They say the portions are HUGE, but they are not.  Order as you normally would.  

Cute: they bring you their folded paper version of the chopstick holder.  

Great food and service.  Wonderful last meal to cap off the weekend.
