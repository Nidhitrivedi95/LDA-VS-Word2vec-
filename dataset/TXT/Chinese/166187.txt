vbVJzKDhHlhMnKRpES5QzQ I've heard good things from friend who dined here, but was never really convinced because, who would think of Sichuan food in Vegas? Los Angeles and New York should top the list for no doubt. 

But I was really amazed. Cold rice noodles just feel like home, ginger spicy beef is close to Mom's, and I'm still craving that pot filled spicy chicken which is only available after 1:30 pm. Would recommend this place!

Oh, one more thing is that service is less than pleasant, which is acceptably normal among Chinese restaurants.
