rT8DwZu7pvuWKRM1nwVuug As a very close, local chinese restaurant, it's our go-to so far for chinese as we are new to Phoenix. The first few times we've had food here, we thought the fried rice was phenomenal. I particularly didn't like the chicken and broccoli though. We've also tried lo-mein and other types of fried rice and they were very good. Decently priced but I give 4 stars because chicken and broccoli is usually my favorite.
