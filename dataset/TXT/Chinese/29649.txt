966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA We just found a "go to" local restaurant. So yummy! We had dumplings, veggie noodles, green bean sausage fried rice, and their bao buns. Each was just as fantastic as the next. We had the shaved ice dessert and it was also delicious. The service was wonderful and the staff couldn't have been nicer. We'll be back for sure. Yummy!
