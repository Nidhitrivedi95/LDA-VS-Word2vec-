BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ I enjoyed Plum.  It's decorated really nicely and looks unique.

I had the pineapple fried rice and I enjoyed it - i would get it again.  My boyfriend had the walnut chicken but it wasn't as sweet as he is used to - it had a typical brown sauce instead of the sweet white sauce like most other places put on walnut chicken.  I think he was disappointed in it.

I also ordered tea (Bombay Chai) while I was there because I was freezing (will winter ever end?!) and it was amazing! Although really expensive ($4 for enough for 2 cups!). They serve Tea Forte teas which is a more expensive tea brand ($1/teabag) so I can see why they're charging that.... but if they're buying the tea in bulk they should be able to offer it for $2 or $3 and still make a good profit on it. 

My only major complaint was that the waiter seemed really distracted, confused, or just plain didn't care to be there. Hopefully it was just an off night for him.
