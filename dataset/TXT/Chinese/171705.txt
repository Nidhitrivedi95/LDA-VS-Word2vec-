VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Always busy. Expect to wait for a table. The food is very good. We always enjoy the broccoli beef and teriyaki chicken, and the wonton soup is a great choice. Lots of variety on the menu. Staff is good, but always rushed. You can't beat the price for this kind of restaurant. A fave of ours when too busy/lazy to cook.
