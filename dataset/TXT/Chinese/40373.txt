B19KKE75ZxqoR3EDuvA1qw Boyfriend was feeling Panda, but I'm trying not to go there, so we tried this place instead :) 

For what you pay for, you can definitely eat your money's worth. Lunch ends at 4pm!! 
It's a buffet so don't expect much service since everything is self serve. Plenty of seating and they have everything from fruits to dessert. The food overall was decent, there were plenty of protein to pick from, but not sure how often I'll be making my way back. I'd say it's a great alternative to Panda since you'll be paying the same price anyways.
