CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Line is long so be prepared to wait even on a week day evening. Prices were a little heavy for my taste (I'm from manhattan so I'm used to it) 

The wonton soup was above average, the potstickers were average but the sweet and spicy beef noodles we're good. The beef was tender and tasty, the noodles were the same over all good dish and a big portion with fresh ingredients. Good experience with the pre-fixed menu but i won't come back.
