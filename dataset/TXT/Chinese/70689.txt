F9h98ZFHLCHG7SdVbXMz0g Went this Saturday for dim sum.  

Atmosphere: quiet and clean.  Decor is modern

Food: All day dim sum and during dinner service hours they offer traditional clay pot rice.  Today we ordered typical dim sum food and everything was hot and delicious.   The cheung fung  was particularly good as was the vegetable dumpling.  I like the fact that all the condiments are already on the table so no need to ask.  Even the soy sauce for the cheung fun is already there!  We tried the green tea sesame ball and that was okay.

Price: $3 - Small, 4$ medium, 5$ large, 6$-XL
Tea is 2$ pp

Service:  everyone had a smile on their face, and as well they were all attentive and helpful.  This did not feel like your typical Chinese dim sum place which makes the experience much more pleasant.

Overall: definitely a great place for DimSum in North York.  I will be back!--
