aS4t4ee3xqQXgNHNxi9gAA I was new to Madison and because of hungry I want to order something to eat. I call to this restaurant and place a order for pork chow Mein. They ask me small or large. I'm just asking how small is it!!! (It is because I'm not sure if I can finish it or not) But then the lady says go to check in the website how small and big is it. And tell me I can only order inside the restaurant. After that, she cut the phone off. How rule and bad service in this restaurant!!!! I can't image how they treat the customer inside the restaurant! I'm so sad and disappointed of them! I will not go there anymore! This restaurant is a blacklist in my yelp!
