Most everything is around $3 even for the rolled stuff rice papers aka banh cuon (I'm not Cantonese so I don't know what they're called). One time though, during when I pay, one lady pointed to the tip line and wanted me to tip (credit card). When I tried to leave, she called me back insisting me to tip. Seriously? i went back and took my cash tips from the table and no tips for you rude server. $0.01
