S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ this review is for non banh-mi stuff. i didn't get a chance to try it so ignore me if that's what ur curious about.

this place is alright. 3 stars is pretty appropriate. my guess is that they tried a little hard to do too many things (their menu is ridic long) and so ultimately don't excel at anything. didn't have anything that was bad at least though. i know everyone takes their fish sauce a little differently but there's was much too sweet for my taste.
