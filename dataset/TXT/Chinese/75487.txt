FYWmowvbtNvXMUsWgMiwaQ I read a few reviews and some said, "Best Chinese Food in Lake County".   Well, decided to give it a try.   Walked in and was greeted by a young lady at the counter, who clearly seemed to be having a nervous breakdown because they were so busy.  She took my order, and when I asked, "How long before I should come back?" -- she broke into tears and told me they were so busy she had no idea.   I should have left then.   I waited 45 minutes, and then it still was not ready.  The kitchen and the cooks feel cluttered and messy.   Since the kitchen is open to full view, it does not lend itself to a healthy environment.  Regardless I took the order, over an hour later.   Got home, and an entree was missing.  "Best Chinese Food in Lake County"??  I would rather travel further for better.
