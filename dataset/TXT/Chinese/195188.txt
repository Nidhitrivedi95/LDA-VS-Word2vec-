zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ This was all over the news when it opened.  I was really looking forward to coming here.
I've done many Summerlicious' at some of the best spots in Toronto, especially the high end ones.  I became very excited when I saw Momofuku listed as one of the options.
Unfortunately, it was very disappointing.  The portions were very tiny.  The salmon appetizer where three very tiny thin slivers.  The main were two very small drumsticks (at least use the Costco sized drumsticks).  The cake was a squished up Timbit.  The only item that tasted good was the drumsticks.  Unfortunately the plate was simply two tiny drumsticks on one leaf of lettuce with a spoonful of kimchi on the side.
Wow... the portions and the effort to put it all together was almost insulting.  Bymark/North 44/Scaramouche/Jump are some of the best restaurants in Toronto and their Summerlicious/Winterlicious portions are gigantic compared to these... and the taste is on an alternate plain of reality.
