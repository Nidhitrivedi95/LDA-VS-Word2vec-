TvHC_I01Ilvd5_fFi4sqIg This chinese bakery has been around for a long time. It's outside of pacific mall and beside the bank. I would have to say having to try so much chinese bakeries because it is so common. This is one of my favourite bakeries to go to.

There are reasons they have been able to stay open for so long. The quality of products has stayed the same throughout the years which I find very difficult for chinese business to keep. Usually, when the business gets better the quality will drop.

Not for this place! The whole family works here thats probably the reason why they can continue to keep the quality so well. The old guy (the boss) has a nice attitude and keeps on smiling at all the customers.

I simply love the butter egg tarts from this place. It is soooo goood. The tuna is also another favourite of mine because you don't need to eat 3/4 of the bun before you can actually taste the tuna and its real tuna. The tuna sandwich has not been overwhelmed by the mayo like most places to save on the tuna, I guess cuz cans of tuna nowadays are getting more expensive.

On to the milk tea, quality milk tea no matter hot or cold. They use Carnation milk instead of the other cheap brand. They once changed to cheaper brand but I totally told the boss more than once that the quality taste so much different. After awhile, I guess I was not the only one telling them. They went back to using Carnation milk.

All in all, I would go out of my way to come here when I really crave for an egg tart with good milk tea. I live a further up north but I will still come.
