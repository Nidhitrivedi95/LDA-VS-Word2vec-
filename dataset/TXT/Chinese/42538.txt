bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg My new favorite Pgh restaurant! Hip/trendy ambiance, super friendly service, a-MAZ-ing cocktails, and of course the food was outstanding! This is not your normal "meat and potatoes" kind of restaurant (no pun intended), so I would only suggest coming here if you're ok with eating outside the box. Very different than any other restaurant you'll find in the area. They approach every dish with a lot of creativity in both taste and presentation.

We had the following "large plates' (entree-size; they also have "small plates" for sharing if you prefer): 

Dayboat scallops, shaved Brussel sprouts, crispy pepperoni, buttermilk, garlic crouton, pickled banana peppers

Braised goat, appams, garlic + ginger, smashed potatoes, curry, creme fraiche, lime

I would highly recommend them BOTH. The braised goat is now my ultimate most favorite entree I have ever had. It didn't come out with smashed potatoes but actually a kind of na'an (Indian pancakes) made from semolina flour that I used to soak up the curry... absolutely divine. 

A great date place but be sure to request a booth when you make the reservations otherwise you might end up at a communal table, which is fun with friends but not quite as romantic an ambiance.
