vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I have discovered P3 since 2013.  I visit evey 4th of July week up to 2016.  Still it is the best dimsum place!  

I had dim sum very much every where. By far this place was the best.  Although don't expect the best service.  It seems like most Chinese restaurant service is not that great.  I would visit again but I will only tip them based on service!
