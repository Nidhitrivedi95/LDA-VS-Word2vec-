mQCT1psNh2pJT38ohSQDHA We just had dinner there and while the food was very good, and the chef entertaining, the service was lacking. We were there for around 45 minutes before a chef came to our table to prepare our food. With 2 small children in your party that can be an eternity. Our waitress never refilled, or offered to refill, my water the entire time. It also took a long time get the bill taken care of. Hopefully these are issues that will be resolved as the restaurant has been around for a while.
