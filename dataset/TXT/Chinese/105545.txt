kxAqrCuEqnLI_F3vEfDtRQ This place has really good Chinese food have been coming here for a few months now and the food is dread hot tasty when I first came here the sushi was one of the best in the area for a buffet, but in the last month or so they are using less seafood and more vegetables and cream cheese, so most places use the crab salad in the Center they us veggies and lots of cream cheese. I knew they would not keep the high quality of food sushi forever but thought it would be longer then they did so for regular Chinese food they get 4 stars but the sushi dropped to 2.5.  
So sad.
