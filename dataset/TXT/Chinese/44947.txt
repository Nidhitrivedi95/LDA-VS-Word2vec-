BmSLyxm8b86dtzwuT7LqBA Coming here with Jen C.
She's been here before and recommended we try this place since the reviews are pretty good.  Located on the second floor of P-Mall Sun's Kitchen dishes out some classics and if you love homemade noodles this is your place as you can watch their workers making it from scratch which is always a PLUS in my books...beware if you hear loud pounding noises...its because the chef is making your noodle lol!
I decided to try #17 their spicy noodles with BBQ Pork.  Though presentation was lovely, the broth from the soup was deliciously spicy...not too spicy.  Only drawback was the amount of BBQ pork.....only 4-5 slices..what happened to the rest of it? The overall dish was delicious from a taste-perspective. 
In addition we shared a side order of their pancake which was delicious and not drenched in oil. 

Price 4/5 (it's cheap)
Taste 4.5/5
Overall 3/5 (only because lack of ingredient in my bowl)
