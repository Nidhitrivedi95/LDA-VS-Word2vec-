ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg I used to get lunch here at least once a week since it's so close. The food is actually really good, the service ok, but the prices are outrageous. $9 for veggie fried rice and a side of sauce (Hunan) is $2. But that wasn't the problem for me. It was the fact that halfway through my fried rice I saw a dead cockroach hiding in my meal. I have not eaten here since and not one of my co-workers has either. This place was a weekday lunch staple. WATCH OUT!
