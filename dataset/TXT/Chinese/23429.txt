6uA2uRexFr8kfv7ghzryHg This used to be my ALL TIME FAVOURITE place to have noodles
However, my recent two visits have changed my opinion of this place completely.
1. On my second last visit, the meat tastes really weird. It is not rotten, but it tastes like meat that has been in the freezer for two weeks.
2. On my last visit, the vegetable (Shanghai Bak Choi or <U+6CB9><U+83DC>) is rotten and COMPLETELY UNEDIBLE, I had to spit it out (my friend couldn't swallow it either)
In my opinion, the flavour of the soup is really nice, but the quality needs huge huge improvement. It is truly disappointing to see a place I've loved so much became so awful. Not to mention that the portions have been small since day 1.
This is the longest review I have ever written in my life. Owners, please take my suggestions into consideration.
