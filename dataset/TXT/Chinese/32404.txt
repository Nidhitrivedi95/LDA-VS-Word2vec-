9Z_6rRy7Tl_C6HIgm7y6FA This is a clean neighborhood Chinese American restaurant. You'll find your old favorites here, but don't look for authentic Szechuan or Hong Kong dishes. That's not what it's about.

The staff is friendly and attentive, the decor is used-to-be-a-coffee-shop, but well maintained. The prices are very reasonable.

Families are welcome, and I hope people bring their children for the kind of Chinese food I remember from when I was a kid.

I had moo goo gai pan, which came with two or three sweet crab puffs, an egg roll, a cup of plain fried rice, and chow mein noodles. With a pot of hot tea, it came to $10.51 with tax. Hard to beat that for value when it tastes so good.
