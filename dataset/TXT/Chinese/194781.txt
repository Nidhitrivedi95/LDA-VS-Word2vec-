zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ My review is only for the Noodle Bar, I would probably come to Momofuku for Daisho next time. The service here was bad. Our servers didn't bother to pay attention to us, and without asking, she gave us the bill before our dessert even arrived!

-Pork Buns - hoisin, scallion, cucumber - $10: I love the pork buns in Momofuku, but it's not something that I would come back for just to have. For $10, these didn't have enough cucumber or scallion. I wish it would have had something pickled to add some tart to the buns and balance the flavour out. In any case, these were delicious and the pork just melt in your mouth, mhmm so good. 

-Winter Ramen - smoked chicken, squash, kale, egg - $15: although this time they improved a bit with the broth, it was still lukewarm, not hot like other authentic Japanese ramen joints. The broth lacked flavor and I didn't taste the kale at all. That small yellow lump in the center is the squash and when mixed with the broth, the entire dish turned too sweet so I don't understand why they felt the need to add squash onto the dish? Also, I'm surprised the egg was poached, hence it had a very runny egg yolk, which is completely different from a traditional Japanese ramen... Normally the egg should be soft-boiled, with the egg white just set and an almost runny egg yolk. The best part of the dish is perhaps the chicken. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce seemed to be a teriyaki sauce? Very delicious and flavorful.

-Milk bar soft serve- Twist of Cereal Milk and Fried Apple Pie - $8:  I prefer the cereal milk instead of the fried apple pie. The fried apple pie was overly sweet whereas the cereal milk was done just right. I remember there was a slight salty taste to the cereal milk soft serve, it was really unique and overall, delicious!
