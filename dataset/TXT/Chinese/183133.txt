XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw Came here a few weeks ago craving dumplings. The waiter (older lady) was more interested in talking to a visitor, than checking in on us. We actually had a pleasant man come by to help us with the non existent service. 

The young man told us that this restaurant specialized in "Northern Chinese food" and recommended his favorite dish. We love to try new things, so we passed on the dumplings and received a dish that consisted of literally only fish, oil, and red peppers.

I was pretty disappointed that I wasted my weekly "cheat meal" on such a bland, unhealthy dinner. By this point we were completely abandoned by our original waiter, after talking to our "shoe in" waiter we found out he didn't even work at the restaurant, he was just a close family friend.

Too many bad signs to even consider coming back.
