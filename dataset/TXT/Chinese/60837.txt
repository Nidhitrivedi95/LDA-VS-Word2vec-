dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ I've been going to this place for 16 years. The food is amazing, hasn't change over the years! The staff used to be better but still decent customer service(when it's not super busy, otherwise it's not great) The orange chicken is the best around. Prices are decent for the portion sizes. I bring friends and family(which are mainly from out of town) to this place and they love this place as well and come every time they are in town
