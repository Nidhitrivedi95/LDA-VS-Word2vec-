eI1ZHGOr2Pus842KrZD5ZQ Casa Imperial took my Virginity. First time in my life I've EVER spent $7.10(!) on Har Gow, OMG. It got me all emotional, I felt my Wallet getting gooey wet. They put their Name next to the word "Har Gow" so how can a first-timer avoid doing that obligatory check-mark? CHECK 

I felt instantly pretentious just stepping inside this Mansion, "ME" pretentious because some items on the Menu cost more than the clothes on my back. I'm the old-school Dim Sum-er with even older-school mentally with 1990s pricing. I haven't quite caught up to the 21st century with the Health Trend and over-the-top Ingredients. Age-Gap? CHECK 

Impressive decor, good service, elegant table-setting...
