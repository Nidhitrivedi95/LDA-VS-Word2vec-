PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Travelling all the way from Connecticut for a roadtrip and stopped by this dim sum place for lunch. We have been craving authentic chinese food for a long time and this place delivered!

We ordered chicken feet, pork ribs, custard buns, rice noodle, shrimp dumpling, sticky rice, and all were great. My favorite was the egg custard buns and chicken feet. Highly recommend!

Very friendly management and even gave us a free dim sum to go!
