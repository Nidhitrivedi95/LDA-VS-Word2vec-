KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw I like this tiny little space. I was quite surprised by the stylish decor and the care put into making this space look unique and special. I thought it would be a hole-in-the-wall but it is quite charming. Even the bathroom has stylish modern fixtures that put a smile on my face- felt like a fancy hotel. Nice touch!  

Anyway, the food: I LOVE the won ton soup. It's jam-packed with noodles, meat, shrimp and surprises. It's tasty and filling and wonderful.  I also love their seafood combination entree, which is made with a light garlic sauce.  I usually order these for delivery in Summerlin,   At the restaurant I had their egg-drop soup, which I enjoyed (I don't remember egg-drop having corn kernels like this one does).  The service was great.

I have to mention, in all fairness, that they aren't consistent in their delivery. Sometimes they leave out the rice or the fried won tons. I pretty much expect something to be forgotten when I order from them these days, which is not a good thing. Still, I have to give a shout-out to the delivery guy. So friendly!  I don't want to stop ordering from them because they haven't actually messed up an order, but when you can expect minor errors, you have to start considering getting your carry-out from somewhere else.


Another thing I have to say: it is pricey.  They could stand to lower the prices for their soups and entrees by at least a couple of bucks. But I'll still come here- I'd just come more often if it were cheaper.
