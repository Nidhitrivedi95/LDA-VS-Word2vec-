1PMwRG0uWGxk2hIVEQj62A I love this place for dim sum! I went there at 930am which was a good time since it was still kind of empty. We ordered so much food lol, got carried away and forgot the special is only S/M/L and not XL XXL etc. The fried taro pork dumpling came first and it was melt in your mouth. The ha gao was good as well. The siu mai was meh. Shrimp roll, very slippery and yummy. The beef short ribs were tender and delicious. Spare ribs were ok, nothing special. The turnip cake was the right consistency and flavor. All washed down with palette cleansing bo lei/pu erh tea. The servers were nice and they speak Mandarin and Cantonese. 

Special: $2.99 cash only for S/M/L and pay before 10:45am(special hrs 9am-11). The washroom was clean. Before you get seated, don't be seated near the door. We made this mistake and our food got cold faster. 

Overall, I would come here again! Much better than other dim sum places in Scarborough.
