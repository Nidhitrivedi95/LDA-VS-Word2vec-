AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA My DH ordered take out from Veggie House on our first night in Vegas. We loved the food so much that we ended up having dinner from here 3 nights in a row!

What we had:

Roti with curry - Delicious! I haven't had this good roti parata even in south east Asia! Highly recommend. 

Steamed veggie dumplings - Omg these were the best dumplings I have had! Highly recommend!

Fried veggie dumplings - very good but prefer the steamed ones over these.

Buddha delight

Curry vegetables in tamarind curry 

Mushrooms quash pumpkin with tofu 

Vegan ice cream with green mung bean - recommend! 

No comments on the ambience or service since we only ordered take out. Portion sizes were generous. 

A great vegetarian / vegan place with plenty of options! Highly recommend!
