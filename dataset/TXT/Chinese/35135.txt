adaYhaXJR2TeU7UGZbJ6tQ If you are looking for a quick, tasty and simple bowl of noodle soup, this is the place. Not to mention, its cheap cheap cheap. 

Don't let the cheap fool you, everything is quite flavourful and simple. The way a good bowl of noodle soup should be. 

They have a good sized simple menu with many choices. My wife had the Shrimp wonton and noodle soup, the shrimp wonton's were plentiful, surprising given the price of $5. 

I had the beef brisket noodle soup. Very tasty and the beef was cooked perfectly. We also ordered a side dish for $2.50 of Chinese broccoli with Oyster sauce. Chrisp, clean and tasty and was a great addition to our meal. 

It can get very busy here on weekends, so go early and don't plan on sitting around for a long time, order, eat and get out of there so you can share the goodness with the ones waiting. 

I gave this a 4 because for the price and the way they cook it with so much flavour its a great balance.
