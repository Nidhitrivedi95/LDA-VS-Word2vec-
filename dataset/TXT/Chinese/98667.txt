Jtj8qgXzuWKjO2DYIn45dw We had not eaten here for a number of months. So my Daughter and I thought we would have it delivered. We got the Orange Chicken and Beef and broccoli. They both had little flavor and the beef was tuff and grisly.  We also got the hot and sour soup and it also lacked flavor.  Very dissapointed. I don't think I will go back.
