SRYM6FaIF6LuXldcC1PY8w Man..Is it me or has this place gone down hill or what. It's just not the same.  Ordered a dessert and coffee from the bartender and he sighed and said "It's going to be a wait on the coffee...maybe 10 minutes or so.."  Seriously?  Told him to just forget the Coffee..and then boom...the Coffee appears in like 30 seconds.. ..Before the actual dessert...Weird.  Guy seemed super stressed out. Still like this place..hope they get things sorted out.
