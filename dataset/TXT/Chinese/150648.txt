sVqV9lzvx98kWU39Fn4c6w My parents live near and we decided to have lunch here. The atmosphere is a 10, the service was very good, the food was good as well we ordered basic Chinese dishes and all were tasty. If you don't compare the lettuce wraps to PF C's then they were good as well.  The serving sizes were generous. 

I would return and be more adventurous with my choices as they have a lot of options.
