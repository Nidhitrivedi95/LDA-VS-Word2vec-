AYr2URtjoQ8Toh8_Jr4G6A Let me preface this by saying that the Rose Tea location in Squirrel Hill is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh and is consistently good.

Although I was excited when Rose Tea Express opened on Craig Street, I have not been nearly as impressed as with the other location. The food quality seems lower - I may be imagining things, but dishes have seemed greasy and have come with too much sauce. Additionally, the menu is a small subset of the menu at the other location, and is unfortunately missing most of my favorite dishes.

I hold out hope that this will improve, but for now the small menu and subpar food as compared with the other location makes this a solid meh.
