PEulzjDwcSL_ujv5mRbc4w We used to love this place and would order once a week. It was family owned and the young girl answering the phone already knew our order. This was our first try after it was sold in April and we will not be back. Nothing we ordered was worth eating, the sauce was horrible and we were given chicken when we ordered shrimp. I called to speak with a manager who of course was not in and was met with little apologies and no resolution. If anyone knows where the original owners went I would love to know.
