zpaXQga1MIqPc5nAWZXtdQ My first 2-star review.  My review is based on 2 lunch specials I had here.  One is their House Special Chicken, and another is their Mongolian Beef I had 2 years ago.  There is nothing special about their House Special Chicken.  Although they offered dark or white meat, the chicken was not crunchy, and it was drenched in some kind of sauce that was very salty.  Their fried rice was just that...rice that is stir-fried with nothing else in it.  Wonton with cream cheese was bleh, although their soup was decent.  As for their Mogolian Beef, there was a layer of sugar that wasn't even melted on my food.  I know good Chinese food, and this is not even close by American standards.  Panda or Pei Wei is better than here.
