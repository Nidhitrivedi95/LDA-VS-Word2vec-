U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q My favorite Chinese restaurant anywhere ever. I love coming here.  However, it is pricy so be prepared... it is the strip.  But so worth it for the occasional splurge... knife cut noodles are my favorite.  I also like the dan dan mien.  Eggplant and green beans are awesome, as is the Szechwan fish. Lamb or pork pancakes are another winner, and they have soup dumplings! I'm hungry all over again... yum.  They did change the menu recently so the salt and pepper shrimp isn't as good as previously, but still worth a taste.  Also, no more crispy beef or Beijing pork -- two of my favorites.  Overall though, a must try! :)
