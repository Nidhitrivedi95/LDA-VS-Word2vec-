ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Went here for lunch today with some co workers and was very impressed! I had a fried rice bowl with brown fried rice, tofu, broccoli, egg, and kimchi. Sooo delicious. Price wasn't cheap but wasn't terrible--base price is $5 but after adding all those options my bowl cost $10. Loved the two different types of home made sriracha also. My co workers got a ramen bowl, noodles, and for the low carb dieter--some steamed veggies with chicken. All were very happy with their food. Service was friendly and good. Liked the vibe. Will be back again.
