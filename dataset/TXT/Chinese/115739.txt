N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ YUM this place reopened yesterday after experiencing a fire next door - and it's spot on! 

We had the dirty fried rice, juicy jerk chicken w Jamaican coleslaw, and the Kim chi dumplings to eat - everything was absolutely delicious, just the right amount of spice and flavour, outstanding!! Also I had a drink w egg whites and scotch bonnet infused tequila - smooth and spicy, highly recommend. 

Also, the side plates were super cute, had beautiful blue fish painted on them, decor in the restaurant is stylish and laid back. 

Reggae and Caribbean vibes made us feel like we were on a beach vacation! 

Most importantly, our server Spencer was very informative and gave us EXCELLENT service. He really got us excited about the menu while we were choosing our items, and he was friendly and attentive throughout the meal.

We will be back for the pineapple bun burger!
