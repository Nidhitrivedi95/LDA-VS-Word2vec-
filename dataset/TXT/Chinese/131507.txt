pJnN5PxqFPGZW2pJWkQtzA Why do so many places around Phoenix do Teriyaki so poorly? I'm always looking for a good Teriyaki place in the west valley and they all seem to just throw a piece of chicken on a flat top and serve a dry, flavorless and WHITE piece of chicken with some sauce poured over the top. Teriyaki should be char broiled over a flame and have some flavor before adding the sauce.

I ordered a Spicy Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl but it came on a plate for some reason. The chicken was flavorless and the sauce wasn't spicy and very mild in flavor. I would never order the Teriyaki Chicken  again from this place.

The California Roll I had with it was decent for the price and I would eat this again. I will try it again but will try something else on the menu and skip the Teriyaki Chicken.
