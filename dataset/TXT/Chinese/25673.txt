7F6JYzEDGs2d2mYW_To57A Went here w/ my relatives (16 ppl in total) on the weekend. We had a private room at the back & I believe the bill was just under $300. Not too bad! 

It's a Northern Chinese restaurant. I'm sure it is prob. better with the dim sum during the day. But for dinner the dishes were just average. Or maybe cuz I had really good Chinese food the night before ;)

I thought the lobster was a bit bland. The soup was great though. I should really remember what the dishes are called so I can yelp properly! Red bean soup dessert had a slight herbal taste to it. It wasn't really my cup of tea. But I liked how they put in tapioca.

Service was ok. We didn't have to wait long for our food even though it was hella busy.
