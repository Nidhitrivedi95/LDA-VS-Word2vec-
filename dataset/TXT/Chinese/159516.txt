U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ This place is a truly hidden gem around the neighborhood. Quick, efficient, delicious, and friendly are the words to describe this pho joint. 

The Calamari plate looks so naked, probably the cooks should use more decorations to make it appealing (like some lettuces, slides of tomatoes...etc). However, the sauce is great and Calamari is crunchy. Pho P1 has plenty of meat which satisfies my meat crave. Service is super attentive and prompt. They have full house during rush hours.
