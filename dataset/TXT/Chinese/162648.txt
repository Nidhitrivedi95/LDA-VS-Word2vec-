uNLvQTK7DnLGRvDUD-i4JA On days where I don't bring my usual lunch, my co-workers and I would hit up this bakery for quick bite. 

The bakery is generally packed during lunch time, but there is ample seating to fit the crowd. The place is kept clean, Chinese music playing in the background, and sometimes, movies are viewed on their 2 flat screen TV projectors.

You can also order noodles/rice/congee with a choice of 7-8 side dishes.
A meal with 3 side dishes comes to $4.30, along with soup. A choice of 4 dishes is about a dollar more. Trust me. 3 side dishes is more than enough! They rotate their food items daily, which gives variety for regular customers.

Note: They're opened 7:30am in the morning. I usually get my usual hot milk tea before work. And it's GOOD!
