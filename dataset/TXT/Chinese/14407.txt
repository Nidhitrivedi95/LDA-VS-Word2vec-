3dk9XrtorfOJu8yX6BVYRg I wish I could give five stars, however, one of the best reasons why I came here to eat was because they had caffeine free DIET soda. I don't drink caffeine after noon and I could come here and fix my food that way I want too and also have a bubbly drink. 

I was shocked when they had no caffeine free diet soda. I asked and the management recently changed form Coke to Pepsi products and out went the caffeine free diet soda. So they do not have s price for dinner that doesn't include the drink. So I paid for something I didn't drink. Also no soda water. 

While I love making my own food and the fresh veggies and quantity you can make, I probably won't be back for lunch or dinner. This place was founded on health and healthy choices. So I say offer a wide variety of drinks for all and not just some.

I was extremely disappointed on this visit
