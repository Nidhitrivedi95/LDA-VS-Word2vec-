Get a fried egg on top of your rice!  Super nom!

To me, service is a big part.  Every time I go there, the owner knows my name and greets me.  I just smile and say "Hi sweetie, great to see you"; but the fact that she remembered me after the first time, says a lot. That being said, food is DELISH! My ADD appreciates the limited menu.  Its a goto for a healthy, but tasty lunch. 

Two Small downsides-
1. Close early
2. Chicken breast is not skinless (I prefer no skin), but I peal it off like a big boy!
