ZuNJelvkJD4wsXNBRg6t5w The staff is EXTREMELY friendly- it made the experience so enjoyable. Every customer leaving seemed to be very happy with the service & food- all saying they were gonna be back. It's very clean and the food was delicious. Good portions and flavors. I can see why they already have so much business only four days after opening.
