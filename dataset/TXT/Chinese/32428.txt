I've heard some great reviews about this place from folks either waiting to be seated or standing in line waiting to pick up orders. 

To many folks thanking them for being open after being closed for more than two weeks.  Owners were in China. 

Everyone that walked in just kept complimenting their delicious dishes. 

I'm sure I will find out once I taste their food.  I stopped in after searching for a Chinese restaurant with at least 4-5 stars.  This place has 4 stars by their name so I decided to take my chances and stop in for some take out.
I bought $65+ of food to take home for myself and adults kids and their children/significant others that are dropping in for dinner. 

My chosen will be the final judges and I will soon post once again as to how our experience with their food was. 

Good thing my kids weren't with me, otherwise they would have complained  of the foul smell that lingers through ought this place. 

Hope they prove is wrong. If so, we'll be back again.
