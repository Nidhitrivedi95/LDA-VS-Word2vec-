W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  I came here for my bachelorette dinner and it was perfect.  We asked the chef to bring out his recommendations and we were not disappointed.  The pork buns, octopus, tofu donuts, chicken, lamb, and fried rice were so good! The wait staff was very attentive and made our night really special.  It was high class food, but a relaxed and mellow atmosphere.  I will for sure recommend this to others and be back in the future.  This place really lives up to the hype!! A must!!
