vHaXbmEl6K_Lf-w5PFGBSA I've been a customer of this restaurant for years. Not the most upscale or high demand restaurant but the employees are very friendly and I've gotten a deal with ALL of my orders. The wait time is minimal and tastes fantastic, I've NEVER had an issue with my food.

I've moved to another neighbourhood and try different chinese cuisines but always find myself returning to Xin Yi Garden. I have yet to find anywhere in any city that I've walked in to or travelled to that compares to their wonton soup!

Four stars because I'm over in Etobicoke now and they're iffy on wether or not it's worth it for them to deliver there. Sometimes it's yes, sometimes it's no... I don't get it but it sucks cause I truly love their food.
