Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA My favorite neighborhood Thai restaurant and there are 5 within 1 mile of each other in thus area! Inexpensive, fast and tasty. Try the pot stickers, Kau Kai , duck soup and eggplant. The orange chicken is in a batter so light and fluffy we renamed it doughnut chicken. All but one of the wait staff are friendly and efficient. If you get the girl who invests in her appearance and not her personality or profession, your order will be wrong and you will be asking for essentials like forks and your drinks, getting nothing but attitude.
