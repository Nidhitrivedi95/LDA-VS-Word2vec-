zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Went on a Monday night and it was half full only, which was nice as I heard there are usually line ups. We sat at the bar where we saw all the food being made by a couple of guys who didn't look very happy lol. Everyone who reviewed the restaurant had the momofuku ramen and the pork buns, so I ordered those and the mushroom dan dan. Upon looking at the prices, I was actually a little shocked at how pricey they were. Coming from Van where I tried a lot of ramen, I thought this better be delicious!

Pork buns - This dish came really fast and it was good, but not amazing. Brisket was very soft, and probably best tasting dish of the night.  4/5

Momofuku ramen - Was only ok as I had way better broth and noodles before for less $. For the small portions and taste, not worth it. The 3 small slices of pork in it was pretty good though. 3/5

Mushroom dan dan - I actually liked this dish quite a bit when I started eating it. The sauce was pretty good until you're half way through the noodles because all of the sauce was sinking to the bottom and it got REALLY salty. 3.5/5

Everything plus tip came to $50 and both of us weren't exactly stuffed. It was a good experience, but will probably not come back.
