VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q Their service is horrible... reason why they deserve a 2 star only is because the soup noodles were decent. 
I waited to be seated for almost 30minutes on many yet to be cleaned tables.
It took me 15 minutes to get some service to eventually get my food ordered, not only did it take 15minutes, our food took almost 25 minutes to come to the table.  As soon as the noodles that i ordered (which was exceptional), I asked for hot sauce which never came...so i asked another waiter to give me some hot sauce, nor did he give me any. Why is it so hard to get me some hot sauce!! NOT ONLY THAT.. I had to ask for an extra bowl so that my bf and I can share the noodle we ordered... I mean it is obvious.. we need at least one bowl to share 1 bowl of  noodles.. COMMON SENSE... 

So eventually they gave us a bowl, with no spoon, (so i'm gonna eat a bowl of noodles that has soup without a spoon... ok...)(which i did because they take forever to service whats obvious which concluded me to not even bother asking anymore).. 

Soon after we finished our meal, we asked for the bill. NO PROBLEM. GETS THE BILL RIGHT AWAY, but GIVES THE CHANGE 15minutes later! 

Anyway you get the point right? service is terrible.

Also there was a lady screaming at the waiter in mandarin , which actually at least made me feel better about going here.
