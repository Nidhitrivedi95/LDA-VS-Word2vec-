BaEwrpEQyWDOOuAzu0q6Zw Came with my brother and cousins for some late lunch/early dinner? We selected this spot due to our other cousins positive ratings.
However...maybe these guys had a bit of an off-day when we visited. 

First off, let it be known that this is a buffet, no high expectations here. Also the price is pretty cheap, $11 I believe?

The sushi was ok, pretty basic flashy rolls. However, the rest of the food is what really concerned us. Nearly EVERYTHING else tasted.....off?

Very hard to describe the taste of all of these dishes, just that they did not taste like the way they should have. 

I kid you not.
We actually spent about 35 minutes playing a Dare Game out of the foods. 
We grabbed a plate of food and did a taste reaction to each of the dishes. 

Let's just say we can all agree that really the only thing we enjoyed was their egg drop soup. I don't think I shall ever return. 

I mean...seriously. Who's Mac n' Cheese tastes like Whiskey??? (not the good kind)
