5It12biyGxe2Dz6kkf7wGQ Worst general so chicken ever. Didn't even save the leftovers! Over cooked to shoe leather! Bad enough we ordered pickup and it wasn't in the order. Had to hold dinner and go back to get it. Tastes like they found it and nuked it. Expensive mistake. Ginger chicken and greenbeans was way too garlicky. International chicken was ok but not worth the price. We need more chinese options in Franklin Park.
