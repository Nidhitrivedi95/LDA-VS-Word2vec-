sDQDMrb5xez4aASZ8U5qTg Even before setting foot into this establishment, my mom had warned me about their poor service. But the place had survived this many years with that bad reputation because their tofu desserts are just that good.  While I absolutely agree that the tofu is phenomenal, this cannot justify nor pardon the exceptionally poor service rendered here.

I usually err on the side of generous with my Yelp reviews, but the bitter taste left in my mouth by our one female server simply could not be washed out by the silky soft tofu fa. 

I am a VERY accommodating person, and honestly, easygoing to a fault: I'll put up with you demanding us to sit down as we erroneously approached the counter to place our order, intentionally ignore us as we try to order, roll your eyes and mumble a very audible complaint under your breath for requesting extra spoons, and treat us as though you were doing us a big favor by making a purchase at your store. But when you try to pull this ish on us and then bully my Mom to tip you more, you have crossed the damn line. I pulled a tooney out of the pile of change she left on the tip tray for my Mom as she looked on with much cathartic delight...Only to hear her say an earnest 'thank you.' Guess the lesson is, sometimes you have to fight fire with fire. We still ended up leaving about 10% tip for the other waitress who served us. But dayum. BAI.
