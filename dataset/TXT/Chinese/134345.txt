Q3UkgxNNInsPcUFhsQFcrg The super long lineups that are almost out the door should already be a sign that this place is a solid Chinese BBQ joint. 

Having tried the BBQ pork (chasiu), BBQ duck, BBQ chicken, and soy sauce chicken, the cuts of meat I got were fairly good. Because they were tender and saucy, I was able to eat a lot more rice than usual! I also really liked that they gave us some green onion and ginger on the side, without having to ask. It definitely made the meal tastier.

Their price point is fair for their location in Richmond Hill but I would say that I could definitely find better and cheaper in Scarborough.
