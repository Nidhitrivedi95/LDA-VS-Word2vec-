tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw Who in the world and for what reason would any give this place less than 5 stars? We stopped here unplanned to pick up something to go for later. The woman at the front who took our order was so so polite. And I dont just mean polite, I mean GENUINELY polite. She explained how some items we ordered were made a bit different than other places, and brought a piece of the (orange) chicken out to taste. Id say 8 minutes later, barely enough time for me to catch up on Facebook, our food was ready to go. Nicely packaged to take out. She showed me how to eat the lettuce wraps since it was all packaged separately (I knew how but it was still nice of her). 
So...the food. BEST EGG DROP SOUP AWARD. EVER. Seriously. This may seem minor but I am a soup lover. 
and chicken lettuce wraps...amazing. The rest of the food we ordered between the 2 of us was all great. 
I foresee a problem here. This will turn into a weekly visit
