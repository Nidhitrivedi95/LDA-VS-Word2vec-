qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA Once is a coincidence twice is not. I'm not sure what's worse, the staff or their manager Ken. Twice now they have butchered our orders and tonight was extra special. I placed an order through DoorDash and ask for a call if there is a problem. I get a call "we can't make it without the sauce, do you still want it?" Me "yes that's fine". The staff then tells me they canceled it and I have to add that plate back on I let them know I can't and after 15 minutes of on and off holds I'm told to call DoorDash. Really? I asked to talk to the manager because to me there's just a matter of common sense here, either you apologize and include it because you had no reason to cancel the order in the first place or you take a card over the phone ... 6 minutes later Ken the manager gets on the phone who hardly lets me get a word in and finishes with "okay okay just come pick it up no problem". Ken, I don't think you know how DoorDash works or how customer service works.
