zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Some of the reviews on here are ludicrous. It's a noodle bar, not a Michelin starred restaurant, so stop with the ridiculous expectations of transcendence and be a little realistic. 

 The menu has more than doubled in size since the opening weeks, and there are now desserts on offer.

I've been a few times since they opened, and the consistency has been pretty good, although on one visit the ramen broth had slightly too much tare, leaving it slightly salty.

Highlights are the hanger steak with soy hollandaise and confit crispy potatoes, the always amazing pork buns and the signature ramen. A special one night of seared veal sweetbreads in a fish sauce caramel with toasted coconut and cilantro was flawless, I hope it makes it onto the menu soon.

That being said, pretty much everything I've tried here has been solidly delicious. I also don't see how anyone can complain about the prices, if you can get stuffed full and have a beer for under $30 before tip, then I think it's pretty good value in this day and age, especially considering you're getting locally sourced, high quality produce.

Can't wait to try Shoto.
