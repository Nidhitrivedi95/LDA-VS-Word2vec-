XF2eTNV5RfzoSJQ-kRZJmA Our waitress, Thoe was so sweet and helpful. We came with a party of 12 for the twins day festival.  She was great to guide us with our choices  and the food was delicious.   Tom yum and Tom kha was so good I'm still dreaming about it. Curry dishes amazing too. Order brown rice for a healthy option too. Love this place. Coming back next year !!!
