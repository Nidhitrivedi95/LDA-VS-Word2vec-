h5pqhSb74UeLNkv534m5Hg We ordered a mixed noodle bowl and a beef noodle soup for that night. The mixed noodle bowl was alright. I don't like the taste. On the other hand, the beef noodle soup smelled very good and the soup had enough taste to it. I wanted to give out more stars to this place but seriously waiting for 45 min for the beef noodle soup wasn't good a experience. I was pacing myself when eating my mixed noodle bowl. I almost finished my bowl and the beef noodle soup finally arrived to our table which was kind of pointless since one side was almost finished. 

I guess they were cutting their noodles in the kitchen so it took them this long to make?

This is a place that took the longest to make their noodle soup out of all the restaurants I tried so far. Anyway it was a bad experience and we won't come here again.
