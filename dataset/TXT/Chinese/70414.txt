f4ca22TTZcsmkzjfB7_Zzg I guess I picked the perfect day to come to Silk Road Restaurant...

Cold and Snowy...... as I drove in the empty snow covered parking lot with no idea how and where to park my car...

Should I be excited to have lamb everything? I am never a huge fan for lamb but I have to say Silk Road might have converted me. 

Lamb Noodle Soup ($9.99)
- Love this Clear Broth version! The aroma of lamb is subtle and memorable with a hint of herb and spice
- Homemade noodle chewy with good bite, without the floury taste as some of the other place I been to

Lamb Skewers ($1.99 each)
- love the spice on the lamb... the meat is chunky so the inside of the meat still really moist 

"Ding Ding" Fried Noodle ($8.59)
- remind me of those kraft dinner package pasta, but of course these have a lot more bite to it..since these are freshly made!
- The sauce is kind of sweet and salty and a little gooey for my taste

Service though a little indifference but I am here for the food... I got my water, food and bill.. and I am happy.

Silk Road Restaurant is definitely a great place for some Lamb Hand Made Noodle Soup..... I will be back!
