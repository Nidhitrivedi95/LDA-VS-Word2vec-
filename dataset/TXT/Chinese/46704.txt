bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q It's my first time here. The place is so clean and the food is so good. The staff that served us was so attentive to our needs and very entertaining. I really really love how the pepper steak was cooked and the orange chicken was so so good. But what blown me away was the triple chocolate mousse. It melts in my mouth and the sweetness is just right. I could have two of those in one sitting. Lol

I would love to go back absolutely  with my friends who loves to eat good food just like me. This place is worth spending time relaxing while having a good food. I would love to recommend this to my friends.
