qO6CWdRFfbOqDJ2UOulpaA I read a bunch of these reviews and was nervous about trying Chen & Wok but figured I'd give them the benefit of the doubt.  We ordered delivery and the service over the phone was very friendly.  We ordered on a Saturday evening and knew it would probably take a long time so that was to be expected. They told us 45 minutes, but our food arrive short of 30 which is always awesome.  
     Maybe I'am spoiled from the million and one Chinese take outs from the east coast but the food was not that great here.  I wasn't expecting gourmet or anything but like the other reviews said the food was very greasy dripping from the boxes. Not the end of the world but the flavors of the veggies, chicken and other goodness were completely lost in this mix. It was like eating bland shapes of what looked like food that were propped up with sauces to make it taste somewhat real.  If they could tone down the oils and sauce by half their food would probably be amazing. Sorry guys but I won't be ordering here again. Hopefully they read some of these reviews and adjust their food a little bit. Best of luck.
