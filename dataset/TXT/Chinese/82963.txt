hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Very unprofessional treatment today. Called at 2:00 to make sure they delivered to our address and the person who answered said yes. Called at 5:00 and was told that they do not deliver to me despite the fact that I was told they do earlier and that their website advertises a 3 mile delivery radius and I live less than 3 miles away. Additionally the girl who put me on hold simply put the phone down on the counter so I could hear her saying disparaging things about me while I waited for her to get back to me. I'd recommend finding another place that values their customers. There are LOTS of them here in the Burgh!
