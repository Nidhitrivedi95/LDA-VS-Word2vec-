pdy6EAcJvZks1hKogxOj6Q After recently having a less-than-stellar experience at another Yelp-recommended Chinese restaurant, my girlfriend and I decided to stop by New Asian Kitchen in hopes of redeeming our colossal failure. Actually, it's more of my failure than hers - but I admittedly like blaming others for my own mistakes.  

We've been here a total of three of times in the past few years and have mostly been pleased with what's offered. Although unlike what I've seen on here, I don't believe every-freaking-single-visit requires a separate review. Review the place once and modify in order to avoid skewing the ratings.

Anyway, its dishes are what you'd typically expect at an American-Chinese restaurant. The place itself is fairly small and has a fair mixture of pick-up customers and those who choose to dine in. 

We always order the pu-pu platter, which consists of a combination of fried shrimp, excellent crab puffs and egg rolls, BBQ pork, and some god-awful beef skewers that remind me of the texture of my distressed leather wallet. For it's price, it's a great deal, although a bit of a mixed baggage in terms of what's good and what's not.

I usually order their beef and broccoli, while my girlfriend prefers their honey garlic chicken. Both are decent quality. I usually upgrade my white rice to fried, which is also done fairly well here.

Honestly, I won't really over-hype the place. It's good, but not quite great and nothing I'd consider to be memorable. But given their reasonable prices, I see no reason to complain. In comparison to other Chinese restaurants in the area, you can do much, much worse than New Asian Kitchen. 

The server was polite, the place was clean, and based on our experience, the food is pretty consistent. Therefore, if you're in the mood for no-nonsense Chinese, I see this as a pretty reliable option.
