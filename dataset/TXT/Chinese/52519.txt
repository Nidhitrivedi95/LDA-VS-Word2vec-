CIFjkjllhTPGyx9eWBwJGQ Have you ever tasted something so good, you just had to try recreate the flavours for yourself? Sprout Hainan Noodles rice noodle bowl did that to me. Inspired by Garlic Explosion and Funky Shrimp, I combined my favourite elements from two tasty bowls drenched with gravy to create my own. The key attribute as Amy, the lovely owner will tell you-- Hainan's unique yellow lantern chilli sauce as a tiny topping for a super hot experience!      Slurrrrrrpeliciousness!
