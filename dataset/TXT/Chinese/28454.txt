8MdMBYTVavXF-smJapxrQA Came here for a late lunch and it was full, but we only had to wait for about 5 minutes before a table freed up. 

We were provided with the lunch menu (11:30 to 5:30) and the afternoon tea menu (2:30 to 5:30), along with the regular menu. 

We ordered: 

Baked Portuguese chicken with spaghetti from the lunch menu, which came with a soup and hot drink. The portion was smaller than average but it tasted pretty good. 

Guilin soup noodle from the afternoon tea menu, which came with a hot drink. I think the afternoon tea portion is supposed to be smaller than the one from the regular menu, but we were given the full-sized bowl by mistake and by the time the server realized her mistake, we had already finished eating it! After realizing this, I wouldn't order it again because it is about half the size of the regular bowl - so beware! 

Food was okay, but it is more expensive than your average HK style cafe. I would only come back out of convenience.
