s2oTzh21fWMXy4YrSAq_wQ Spending a weekend in Vegas.  Great restaurants all over but my party insisted on hitting Chinatown.  Off the strip, this is a Restaurant that definitely serves up traditional Cantonese dishes.  For the most part the food was ok.  One of my pet peeves on seafood is that it's got to be fresh.  We had a salt and pepper frog dish that was totally sub par.  Over battered and frozen frogs.  The second problem was they gave us a dish we did not order.  We ordered a basil clam dish.  But they ran out of basil so substituted a bell pepper onion with black bean sauce clam without telling us!!  Shouldn't you at least ask us before doing that?  The salt and pepper crab was good.  An Xo sauce was used as a try sautéed mix. That was their saving grace.  Now if course we had to check out the bathroom.  It was relatively clean.  The parking is also very convenient in a strip mall.  Overall experience is more like a 3.5.  Until next time...ciao!
