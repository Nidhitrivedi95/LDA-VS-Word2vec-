Pan-fried noodles mean different things to different people, particularly between me and China Garden. Normally, I have them as thin, chewy, slightly greasy and un-sauced. These are soft, thicker noodles in a brown sauce but the pan-frying gives them a really good grilled flavor. Score.

"An order of eggrolls" means one eggroll which wasn't terribly tasty and definitely nothing interesting but you know.... good filler.

The broccoli beef (large order) was fresh, tasty and arrived piping hot. All this delivered for about $14 inside of 30 minutes.
