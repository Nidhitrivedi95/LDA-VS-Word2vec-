It's hard to enjoy your overall experience when you've waited 1 hour just to cop a seat and then another 45 minutes to get your first piece of food. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem waiting an hour; HOWEVER, if I see people who came after me getting a seat before me, I'm not going to be pleased. Yes, I understand 2 people get seated before my party of 4 but I don't think this applies to parties of 6. Yeesh, they seat hour-early reservations of 10, 13 , 11, 12, etc., then let in the regulars, then Chinese-speaking guests and finally, the non-Chinese speakers. 

After all this, once I got enough food to get over my hanger... the food was mediocre. I don't think the prices are super expensive - they're on par with other dim sum places in Markham. Not the best food I've had, not the worst. But the overall experience was less than stellar.
