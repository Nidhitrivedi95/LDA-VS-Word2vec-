X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Hakkasan is definitely one of the hottest clubs in Vegas right now, but that means $$ to get in (unless you're a lady!), CROWDS galore, but you also get DJs like Calvin Harris spinning. I liked that they had room playing hip hop, although the dance floor is small and gets crowded quickly. However, you can get some elevation by dancing on the platform areas in between some of the booths (if you're a lady..)- they have stairs on the side to get up and down. The worst parts about Hakkasan are that you're packed in like a sardine on the dance floors, it takes forever to get an overpriced drink, and the horrible cement stairs- it's almost two flights to get from the hip hop room to the EDM room! Your feet will be killing you long before the end of the night. Take advantage of the elevator if you can.. 

I would highly recommend getting a booth if possible so you have a place to sit and escape the crowds, although that will cost $$ as well. If you're doing a girl's night in Vegas, get on one of the promoter's guestlists since it's free admission until 11pm, and the line isn't quite as crazy/long.
