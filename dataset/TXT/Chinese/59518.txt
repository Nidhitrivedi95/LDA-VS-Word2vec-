dJnF_GUWdoX3tUucpKbYMg I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants, but I've never tasted such bland chinese food before... ever!

Mind you, it was dinner for Chinese New Year so the restaurant was packed and I mean PACKED!  People were waiting upwards to 90 minutes to get a table!  So maybe because they were so busy, they had to bring out the food fast (and they were decent) and sacrifice quality.

Back to the bland food, the soup was watery, the deep fried shrimps were tasteless, the fried rice and noodles at the end were completely saltless.  

Maybe they ran out of salt?!
