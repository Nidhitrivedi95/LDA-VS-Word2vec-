I had a class downtown that started early, so the lunch break was earlier than most places opened. The sign on the door at Tom Yum claims they open at 10. To me, that means prep work has been done, and the kitchen is ready to take orders by 10. Maybe 10:10, on a bad day. I walked in at 10:20. The young lady behind the counter seemed put off to have me there, and said they weren't able to do everything on the menu, as they just opened. My order was simple. An order of chicken satay, and a bowl of tom ka gai. She took the order, took my money (which I stupidly left a decent tip on), THEN told me it would be 45 minutes to an hour for my to-go order to be ready. I was incredulous. This is downtown Phoenix. Most of the people who would be here for lunch get a total of 30 minutes, *maybe* an hour for lunch...no one can wait 45 minutes to an hour before getting the food!
I asked her to refund my card - I would find somewhere else to eat. She didn't know how to do that. I asked her to call over the manager. There was none. Just her, and two men in the kitchen who also claimed to not know what to do. I asked her to call the owner. She went to the kitchen, and when she came back, told me my food would be ready within 10 minutes. WHAT? Somehow, my demanding my card be refunded enabled my food to cook in a fraction of the time? I should remember this magical trick everyplace I go that expects me to wait longer than I deem reasonable!
Anyway - I get my food and take it back to the classroom to eat. The chicken satay was painfully dry and bland. No amount of peanut sauce, hot sauce and cucumber could fix it. After two bites, I threw away the remainder. The soup was okay. If someone else bought it and brought it to me, I would be more than willing to eat the soup again. Short of that happening - the next time I will be in this spot is when it's the new restaurant in this space, after Tom Yum is out of business.
