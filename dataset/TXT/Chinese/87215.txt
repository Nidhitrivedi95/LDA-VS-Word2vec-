I've been here 2x, one at morning one at night. The service during late night is ridiculously slow. It took forever to get out food. Though the waitress was nice. The service in the morning time was better, average.

I ordered the egg white omelet which wasn't very good. There wasn't much substance in the omelet. On the plus side, comes with a side of fruit.
The next morning I came for the skillet scramble. I specified to put extra veggies and add avocado. 

Awesome thing is that they really let you customize your order (with additional charge for certain things). Also, it is open 24 hours!
