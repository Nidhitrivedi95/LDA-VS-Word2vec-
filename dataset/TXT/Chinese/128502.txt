PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ First timers!!! Heard good things so we decided to come down. Very cool place , not exclusively <U+30E4><U+30E0><U+30C1><U+30E3>, they also serve dinner items and have a semi buffet style counter for other foods not on the carts. Food was great! Chomped through some chix feet (that I haven't had in 6 years) that were bomb. The lotus leaf steamed sticky rice is a must. The host took us up to the counter and explained all the food options then gave us some complimentary dessert to try! Warm tofu with ginger syrup was delish! We will definitely be back!
