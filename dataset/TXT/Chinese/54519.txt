csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA I am an occasional diner at this restaurant. We went in for take out today and were greeted by Coco, who was a joy to talk to as she made recommendations on the various items on the menu. She even got our pre-ordered wings spiced to our taste up by the chef. The sweet chilli wings were some of the best wings I've ever had. They come smothered in a sauce teaming with natural flavors, sweet, spicy and fragrant with tastes and aromas of basil amongst other herbs. On Coco's recommendation, we tried the dancing scallops which are tempura fried scallops topped with what looked like uni and other savory ingredients. I used to be a professional caterer and consider myself quite the chef but I was blown away by this dish! I can honestly say that this was the best seafood platter I've ever had in my life and everyone should try it once or twice; you'll thank me for it. I have always loved the Singapore curry and get it on every occasion I visit the restaurant but the dancing scallops have become my new favorite dish. Coco gave me a chance to meet with chef Jim who had prepared these amazing dishes for us. He is as humble as he is talented and I can't wait to see what else chef Jim has brewing in the kitchen. By the way, after we tasted a bit of the food, we couldn't wait to get home and eat so we just sat right there in the restaurant and ate almost all of it. That's how good it was!
