x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ The food was not acceptable.  The guy who took order do not even write order and have a attitude problem. The food was totally different than other locations of same franchises in different states. Moreover the food was not tasty. Moreover it looks like the management is new and down not focus on customer satisfaction and quality service. Never go again.
