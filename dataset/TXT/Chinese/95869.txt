JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA Four of us from the SF/LA area tried the Taiwanese breakfast at this hole-in-the-wall.

Recommend:  Spicy beef soup with tendon, Taiwan sweet spicy cabbage, tendon brisket tofu, beef sandwich.

Okay:  Green onion pancake with egg, salty rice roll (fan tuan), pot stickers.

Not so great:  Sweet soy milk (not at all sweet), Chinese donut (not crispy).
