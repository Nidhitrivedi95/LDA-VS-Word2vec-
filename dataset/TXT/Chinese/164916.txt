uxSL4FHWiO-fr2iae_d3Bw Britney was amazing. My son and I had been traveling all day and were in a hurry so I called in the order to be ready when we arrived to eat so we could get right back on the road. When we arrived our drinks were on the table. We weren't sitting for more than a minute and our food came out. It was delicious as always. Her customer service was A+. We will be back.
