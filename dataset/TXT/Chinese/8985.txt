1NZNZHnGE4-FLZmU6xp3oQ considering its a chinese restaurant, i didn't see any Chinese staff. the food was not even worth the price! it was too expensive and nothing compared to panda express. the food was great but it was nothing to write home about. if you guys are craving chinese good while in the outlet, better just eat before going there or after because you'll be surely disappointed.
