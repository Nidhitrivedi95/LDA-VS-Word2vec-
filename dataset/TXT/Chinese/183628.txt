XqPMOwrJ0xjphyNQYcoPLg Let me be clear - I'm a fan purely because of the value this establishment offers. The one elderly lady that works there always smiles and greets me like I'm a relative (shame she doesn't give me a relative discount though!). 

The food is greasy, yes it is. The large is damn large, so go for the small, unless you're sharing (which is recommended). 

This is not the place to go for ambience/vibe. What you see is what you get - cheap, greasy, veggie Chinese food. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. I love going here with a group of friends and sharing a few dishes. 

I dig the hot'n'spicy soup.
