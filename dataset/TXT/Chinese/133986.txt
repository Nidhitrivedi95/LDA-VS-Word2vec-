Q-eUzUjOwRlAXkwN8qDXXg My parents are quite big fans of this place but I don't get it at all.  We came for dim sum.

Parking - a tiny parking lot made finding parking impossible.  Hard to understand why so many people like this place!

Decor - My parents said this place just underwent either an ownership change and/or a renovation.  Seriously guys?  Grey, blue, and purple do NOT go together this way.  Further, the lighting pieces change part way through the place, and scratches/dents in the wall.  Crammed tables & chairs together.  Finally, the use of white light bulbs instead of warmer shades make an industrial feel of the place.  I'm usually not the type of person that cares too much about decor, but this has to be the worst ever.  Those purple tablecloths can't be cheap to have bought or clean.  Polyester everywhere.

Food - Definitely lower tier for Toronto North standards.  Not much flavour or complexities in the food, especially for its pricing.  We left, and both my wife & I felt a bit dizzy from the food, which is our typical symptom of foods with a little too much MSG for us.  They even disappointed in my childhood classic favourite, "deep fried milk".  Mess that up, and forget it.  I don't want to come back.

The positive - My wife said they have a change table, and that made it easy for her to change our son on the way out.
