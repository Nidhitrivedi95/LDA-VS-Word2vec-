qAbXHsddBhmfQFegGiV7Dg As a Seattle to Phoenix/Mesa transplant, I was nervous to find a decent teriyaki place. Asian food of any variety can be so hit or miss. Tokyo House was stupendous! Amazing teriyaki and gyoza exactly how gyoza is supposed to be. Clean, friendly staff, excellent iced tea. I can't wait to go back!!
