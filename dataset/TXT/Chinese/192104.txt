yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw We ordered delivery and the wait time wasn't bad at all! Food had lots of flavor and the price was worth it! We ordered the eggs rolls, crab rangoons, orange chicken, fried rice and honey walnut shrimp for about $36. The honey walnut shrimp was my favorite. Sauce was great, and everything had so much flavor and everything tasted so fresh. Will be ordering again!
