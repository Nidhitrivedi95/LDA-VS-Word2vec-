0gj8bpTF6I6T_C5xyBUafw This is one of my go to pace for cheap chibese take out.   the only place that makes 

Ketchup deep fried boneless  chicken on rice.   They make a good honk kong tea also.


They have loyal clientele so foe bust times on weekend and weekdays after 5:45 call 10 minutes in advance so yiu don't have to wait that long .


Other good  menu item are pan friend noodles.   It is a dated food court so bathroom  are so so.  But they just gutted it last month.  But it is icky again.


So many people take out and eat at the comfort of their own home.  


This place is solid since they lasted here along with the bbq inside the food court.    Other have come and gone.

Most dishes are lest the $7 which includes a soya drink , hk tea or lemon tea
