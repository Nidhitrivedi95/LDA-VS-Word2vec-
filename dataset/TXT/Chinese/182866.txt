XJo_kPFlbuORqL-mE2Ny6w Before heading to an alumni mixer, my friend and I decided to stop and grab dinner beforehand. She suggested we go to Stir Crazy, as were in Legacy Village already. I slightly hesitated (another wanna-be asian place?), but went in, nonetheless.

The restaurant was quite large. We were led to a booth (after the hostess had asked my friend when "he" was coming...not realizing 1.) she was with me, not a he, and 2.) I was outside parking). Our waitress was perky, talking about the menu, talking about her favorites on the menu.. good job. Her recommendations were kind of boring- "get the pad thai!" but still, she gave some type of recommendation.

My friend got the sesame chicken with broccoli. I got the thai coconut chicken curry. My friend commented that she enjoyed her dish. Mine... was strangely over-soupy. Don't get me wrong- the flavor was actually quite good...but..it seemed to be all watery curry....where were my noodles? And chicken? And just..stuff in it? I think it would have been better with less soup-i-ness, and more noodles and meat.

We decided not to get dessert (waitress: "do you want some deep fried wontons ice cream?".... in my head, i was like, "omg, seriously?"), but paid the bill and left. The waitress we had though was super friendly- always filling our water glasses and being chatty.

This restaurant is okay- if you want more of the "fast food" of asian foods....would I go back? Meh, maybe. I think they might have had some vietnamese spring rolls on the menu....
