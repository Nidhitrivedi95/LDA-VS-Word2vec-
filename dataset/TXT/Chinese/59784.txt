dKzp--NRN0dxkcvAczzSOw Ordered dinner for one combo D with sweet and sour shrimps. It had a total of three shrimps. I understand for the price point of $7, three shrimps are reasonable, but they are very heavily battered. It was 1/3 shrimp and 2/3 batter, and it tasted like it was soaked in oil. I couldn't finish my meal at all. I came here because of the good ratings, maybe I just ordered the wrong dish.
