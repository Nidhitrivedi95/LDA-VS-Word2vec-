The restaurant's decor is nothing to write home about, and there is no way I'm going there with a date or anything. But the service is surprisingly great for a buffet, water refills come very fast and they are by to clean up the plates as soon as I go back for another round.  Now if only the food tasted a bit better I could give it 5 stars.
