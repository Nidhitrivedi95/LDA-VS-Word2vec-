xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I will give this two stars now that I have finished CMU, but while I was there I would have considered giving it three. This place is there for students and it is good for that. The food is cheap and passable. Service is slow but usually friendly.

It is pretty much just your basic Pan-Asian place nothing to special about it. I would go there a good bit when I was at CMU and was on campus late working. The slow service was a good excuse to take a long break from work. If you are going to go I would recommend the noodle soups and the crab Rangoon, but neither are worth more then a quick walk over from CMU.
