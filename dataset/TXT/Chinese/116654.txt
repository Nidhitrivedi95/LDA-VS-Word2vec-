naIri3sawHNvekftRyrasg I come to here sometimes because it is across from my condo. The owner is okay. The meal is okay. The lunch special is very okay. Monday to Wednesday: LA Galbi box is 7.95! Sometimes you get Pork neck bone soup with 4 side dish and purple rice for $4.95 + tax. The deal is too good to be beat. The overal meal is not impressive but a cheap place to eat for lunch.
