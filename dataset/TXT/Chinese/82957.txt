hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q I thoroughly enjoyed my time at everyday noodles. This was my last meal while staying in Pittsburgh and I'm glad we fit this in our schedule. 

You write your order down on a sheet using a pencil. Sort of like how a lot of sushi restaurants take your order. We got shumai, pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, and some dessert to share. Soup dumplings weren't as good as the ones you'd find in NYC, but still pretty good. Scallion pancake was okay.. decent, but nothing to drool over in retrospect. Highlight of our meal was most definitely the shumai. I usually don't like shumai that much but these were delicious.

The ordering style sort of backfired later, because we decided to get dessert but since we didn't mark it on our sheet, we had to ask for another sheet and wait longer. We got the red bean sesame balls and a coconut jelly dessert. Both were meh. Probably wouldn't order again, but it was nice to try something new regardless.

The kitchen is open with glass so you can see the chefs working and the man pounding and stretching out the noodles was mesmerizing! I'd love to come back and try their noodles.
