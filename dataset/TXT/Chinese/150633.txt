Every employee is delightful to talk to. The ambiance is superb- quiet, spread out, relaxing, intimate. There are seriously not enough words to describe it.

The sushi is to die for. It's always fresh. The lemon drop roll has become my favorite next to the summer shrimp roll, and the inside out crab rangoon appetizer is perfect "feel good" food.

When we want to venture closer to home for date night, we go here, hands down, no questions asked.
