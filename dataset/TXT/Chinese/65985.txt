EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw Lots of Dim Sum to choose from! It's a laid back atmosphere where you order off a menu with Dim Sum divided up by price with the cheapest being $2.50. Unlike lame tapas places where you order something delicious for $8 and you only get 2 small bites, these portions are much better and each one could be a satiating snack in itself. 

I kind of went nuts and ordered more than I could eat but it was worth it: Fried Shrimp Ball, Pan Fried Chive Dumpling, Stuffed Eggplant, Baked BBQ Pork Pie, & Chicken Shu Mai. I liked the Chive dumpling and BBQ Pork Pie the best. The crust around the pork on those is pretty weighty and dense so they'll fill you up. Delicious!
