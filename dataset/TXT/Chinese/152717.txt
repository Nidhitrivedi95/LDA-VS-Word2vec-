t4P-8drZzj3TMwA_WU-4Zg Normally I really enjoy this restaurant but tonight came by for a to-go order and there was a new guy behind the counter who was quite rude. I came to the counter to pay before the order was ready and he didn't say anything at first, just walked off to take a few orders at the tables. By then there was a lady waiting to check out behind me and he ignored me and took her check. I waited and once he was done, he still didn't do anything. I asked "can I pay now?" and he scolded me "just wait a minute". He then took the next couple that came up behind me. Once that was done, I said "do I have to wait until the food is ready?" He said yes and walked away. Later one of the regular staff that we usually see here rang me up (food still wasn't done). Usually we get great service here and I've recommended it to a lot of people, so this was highly disappointing.
