8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ Best seafood dinner ever! Our group ordered the nine pounds spider crab three way. oh my goodness, claws steams with garlic, fresh sweet chunk white meat, so delicious! Second way ginger and scallion. Third was steam egg with the crab roe. I can eat that all day long. 
For the price of $48CAD a pound times nine, sounds like a lot, but was worth every dollar! 
All the other dishes was equally delicious! Service was 
so so, they were so busy, it was on a Saturday and the place was packed. The wait staff looks over worked and tired. Maybe on a weekday night would be better. But food is good enough for this to be overlooked. Will be back for sure!
