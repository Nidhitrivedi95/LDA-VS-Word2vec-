9ok8nLK-8emYWbt6kwd-HA My family decided to try something new on Mother's day. This place was chosen because my cousin recommended it. But since we are slightly paranoid we came first for dim sum. So here's my two-cents on both. 

Yum cha: * 
We went on a weekday so there wasn't much people. What I saw was mostly white-washed Asians (no offense but I personally think that if there's not a lot of Chinese Chinese people at a Chinese restaurant, it usually says something about the food. Same goes for Korean people at a Korean restaurant etc etc.) I had hoped I was wrong in my crowd assessment. Sadly, I was not. The food was terrible. They failed my three main dim sum test for restaurant quality. 1- siu mai: although not bad, it wasn't completely good either. Subpar 
2- rice noodles: terrible. It arrived drenched in oil. Even with Dai Fu's drop in quality, it's still better than this abomination. 
3- beef balls: something that should not be hard to f-up they managed to do it spectacularly. There was a pungent taste to even though it wasn't spoiled. 
Even though there wasn't a lot of costumers, service was slooow. 
The red tea we got was pretty smooth even though it wasn't hot enough. 

Dinner: ****
Given the terrible dim sum experience, I had reservations about dinner. However the food was surprisingly good. I don't know if it was because it was a Mother's day special and everyone ordered the same set but the food- the fish, lobster, shrimps, abalone were all well made. The price was really good for the set dinner. Service was still incredibly slow though.
