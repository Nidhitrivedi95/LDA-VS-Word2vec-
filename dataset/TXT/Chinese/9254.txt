1pZk5sw5m8kPTMdvIp6UVA When I first game here over a year ago the food was delicious. It became a favourite of mine until recently. In the past few months I've noticed that the food quality was getting worse and worse. A week or so ago my mom and I decided to go there to have supper after we weren't able to find a parking spot at Mandarin which is across the street from it. That visit turned out to be our last. The food while edible certainly wasn't the quality it once had been. The seaweed salad which is one of my favourites tasted fishy and off. The teriayke beef didn't taste at all like it was supposed to and the meet was shoe leather and grizzle. We both felt sick after eating there and while the staff are very friendly we will not be back. Sorry guys but the food is not worth what they charge.
