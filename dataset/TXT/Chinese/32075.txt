9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw Love this restaurant! 
When we don't want to cook, their delivery saves the day. 
Our order is usually the same; Pork fried rice, Pork chow mein, Fried Dumplings. 
It has hit the spot every time we've ordered.
The restaurant itself is charming and their servers are friendly. We usually order through Yelp Eat24 and haven't had a problem with our order once.
