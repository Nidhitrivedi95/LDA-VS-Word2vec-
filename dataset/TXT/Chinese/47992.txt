C1JNZrYl3H-YzF1dys9SoQ Really fast and cheap place. 
This place is really not for me, but if you are looking for a Chinese restaurant that offers really good food this is the place to be. 
The sauces are a bit heavy so if you don't like sauces that have a lot of salt in it, I wouldn't recommend it. 
Great service, the people are really nice and friendly. Always greeting you with a smile! 
Spiciness is okay, but it's not what you except. At least for me since i'm a very big spice fan. It's a meh.
But for it's prices, it's really great.
