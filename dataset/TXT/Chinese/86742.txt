hPTx2Y5e4Czbr21XcbDN8g I've been to this place three times, and the beef noodle soup is some of the best that you can get in Toronto! The noodles are homemade, so they have a great chew and they are thick, which is excellent. The beef is tender and the soup has a tang to it that comes from the pickled mustard. I definitely recommend a large if you are a big eater, but the regular size is suitable for most.

They also have some side dishes; the ones I tried were the preserved egg with tofu and the stinky tofu. The preserved egg is good, but you may find it a bit salty with the sauce and bonito flakes. The stinky tofu has a great smell, and it tastes pretty good also. I would avoid the black bean sauce noodle though, as the sauce isn't special and the dish is pretty small compared to the noodle soup.

Overall, this is an excellent place to have lunch and I highly recommend it!
