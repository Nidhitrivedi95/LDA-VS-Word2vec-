yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Came in late last night for dinner and saw a short line of people. Fortunately, service was swift enough and both me and my bf got seated almost immediately. 

This place is busy! Noticed that patrons tend to be either party-goers or families. Food is ok, not fantastic. I got the rice noodle with barbecued pork and egg rolls while my bf got his usual chicken pho. Didn't think too highly of the food, but when you are starving, it actually left me pretty satisfied. I can see myself coming here before going out for a party or after a clubbing night. 

One of those places to go to if you are looking for comfort food.
