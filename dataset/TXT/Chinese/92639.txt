The yellow curry with chicken was the f#&$&=#!ing bomb!!
The Won Ton Soup was the best I have ever eaten.
From the time I placed the order on Yelp24 App, the food was delivered hot, fresh and on a Sunday night with the Olympics on TV.
24 minute's!!
They do it exceptionally well, Oh and by the way, the Chicken Wings may and I say may have been the best I have ever had!!
