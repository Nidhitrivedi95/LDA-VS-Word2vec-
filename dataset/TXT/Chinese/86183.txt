HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA My friend pretty much insisted we have lunch at Fat Choy while in Las Vegas. It's a relatively small Asian American diner with a lot of flair and personality. Be prepared to wait a bit since the plates are made to order, but they play good music and if you have good company, you'll totally be fine.
 
I had the eggs Benedict, super yummy. My friend gave me a bite of her burger with bacon which was absolutely fantastic with its distinct sauce and some kind of cheese on the bread....it's something you have to taste for yourself.
