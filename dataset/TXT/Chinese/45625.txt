bsjBLLHR4TMVR5eAeLAI9w One of the Best Dim sum houses in Montreal! I'm from NYC and quickly realized how spoiled we are since we have 2 Chinatowns (NYC & QUEENS) So after moving here I asked around where we can have dim sum and was told Ruby Rouge.  Nice large dim sum house but the food was not up to par.  Being chinese and knowing good dim sum you can always tell by a good dim sum house by their "Har Gow" ( shrimp dumping)  Sort of like going to a italian restaurant and finding out they can't make a proper plate of spaghetti!   In A har Gow-The Shrimp dumpling rice skin should be soft, moist, silky and the inside should have full perfectly cooked shrimps inside!  
~Fail~ Not what we got at Ruby Rouge! Tough rubbery skin and tasteless over cooked shrimp!  I won't go into the other 3 dishes we ordered... FAIL~

After being disappointed I asked where do all of the local chinese people go to and was told by a shop owner KAM FUNG on the second floor.  We went the next weekend and as packed as it was we did finally get a seat!  The test... Har Gow! Yes.. it was excellent!  Hong Kong quality and the rest of the dishes from the pork dumplings, fried seafood wraps, crispy dumplings, and yes the very difficult to pull off... braised chicken feet!  Impressive for a little dim sum house in Montreal!  I can say that as I'm from Hong Kong!  ...Now you want a 5 star rating?  Go to their sister restaurant  in Brossard! (7209 Taschereau, unit 111, Brossard, QC J4Y 1A1
Phone: (450) 462-7888)  This one gets the full 5 stars!  The decor, design and food are a home run!  I have brought family visiting from NYC & HK and they all have said the food and experience are very Hong kong!  Well done Kam Fung Brossard!  Their hostess Veronica Kwan took it up a notch with her suggestions and her excellent service!  If you can find transportation to Brossard go if not you will enjoy Kam Fung in Montreal!
