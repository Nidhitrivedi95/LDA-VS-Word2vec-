88RkIuXwJeDzfzSu9xsyzw I've been here a few times and the food is decent.  I would sort of classify it as Westernized Shanghai style food.  However, for a Chinese restaurant, service can be pretty terrible at times.  The first time, the orders got mixed up.  The second time, my dish came out way ahead of my friends (and while it's not typical for Chinese restaurants to serve food at the same time, it's got to be within 5-10 minutes) and my food came about 15 minutes ahead of my friend's dish.  Also, I expect Chinese food to be served within 10 minutes of ordering, and I think we waited for almost 35-40 minutes for the entire order to complete.  This is not good for a Chinese restaurant.  Granted, this place is very busy, so maybe I'm missing something, but I'm not the biggest fan of this place.  

Much rather go to any other Shanghai style restaurant.  I would classify this as the "a la carte Spring Rolls" of Shanghai food.
