tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw We stopped in while visiting friends to enjoy some Chinese cuisine and have to say the food and service lead to a PF Changs experience that has been one of the best we visiting yet.

The waiter was fun and attentive, food was prepared perfectly and they offer a very nice menu.

The restaurant was very clean and nicely decorated.

Definitely a good stop for decent, consistent Chinese food.
