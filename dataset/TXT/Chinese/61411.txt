dQojkooHaWvyCor5qcAS6Q The Beijing Duck here is excellent. It's good enough for any major Chinese city in China. We ordered several items off the regular menu also. The fish fillet was especially good. Other items were decent also. 

I was traveling from US. This was almost worth the trip by itself.
