AVLj5MSJD1si-Rl6X6qTXQ The worst dining experience I've ever had. DO NOT GO HERE!!! I have eaten in all over the world and this is the absolute worst. The chicken was not chicken and had a very questionable crunch. The "beef" with rice and egg was mushy and it was absolutely not beef. We questioned leaving numerous times. There was not a single redeeming dish. The servers were rude and never came to check on us and we had to hunt them down for water. I asked one of the servers what the dishes were and said she didn't know and that she guesses. We were forced to eat the food or pay more and it borderline a bad episode of Fear Factor. 

We left concerned for what we ate and very disappointed. 

Let my experience be your warning and DO NOT go here.
