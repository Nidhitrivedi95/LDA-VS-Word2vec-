uyoZHZzHaZpqMzXovJxDTw Awesome awesome awesome Chinese. I'm usually skeptical about finding a new place, but this place was excellent. Ordered delivery and it was at our door piping hot in 13 minutes!!! Beef and broccoli had plenty of sauce and the broccoli was cooked perfect for how we like it! Chicken fried rice was delicious as well and the chicken wonton were superb! Online ordering makes it even easier!!! Will be eating there again!
