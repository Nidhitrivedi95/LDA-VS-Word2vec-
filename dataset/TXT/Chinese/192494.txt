Z4MvEVylnZPW_vddQc2Ihg As a buffet place, I didn't really expect much of the food here, but I was pleasantly surprised. I thought all the items I tried were solid - it's prepared well, not overcooked and the flavour was decent. I especially like the mussels, which are green lipped New Zealand mussels that are known to be good quality and meaty. 

The thing to go for here is definitely the raw section where you place raw items that you like in a bowl and hand it over to the chefs at the circular grill table. Not only do you get a hot piping bowl of stir fry, you also get a side of fire show as entertainment...neat! 

I was told to add at least a ladle of sauce to the bowl so that food would not be dry after the cooking process, and that worked out really well. I had two very satisfying bowls of lamb and beef stir-fry here.

The food at buffets are not meant to blow your mind, and is much the case here. But to put everything in perspective, even on a "pricey" weekend night, it is still under $30 a person. Great deals can be had if you come in for a weekday lunch or dinner. Compare this with "asian citrus fruit" buffet which can cost up to $32 a person. So in my book this place provides very good value compared to your typical buffet and a 4-star establishment for me.
