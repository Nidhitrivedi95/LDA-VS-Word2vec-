t4C5LsJJrm4FL1VCEkBcHw Let me start off by saying that the decor and service at Le Piment Rouge was stellar. The waiters were top notch and completely went out of their way to make our dinner excellent. 

Besides that, the food was ordinary. Definitely nothing spectacular or deeming the extravagant prices. I had 4 courses, each being good but not great. 

I'm not opposed to a lavish dinner every once in a while, but if we're spending hundreds of dollars, I would hope the food would amaze, inspire, or satisfy me. 

Sadly, Le Piment Rouge did none of the above.
