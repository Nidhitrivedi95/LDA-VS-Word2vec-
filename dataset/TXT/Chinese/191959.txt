yYL95YmG-2lI33G9ZLseyQ Well, there is nothing really special about this place, let's be honest.  Health Gourmet prides itself in creating dishes without a lot of salt or MSG, but honestly, I did have a taste of salt in my mouth after the experience. For dim sum, the selection were pretty standard. I would not say that it has the best dim sum I ever, but certainly it was not the worst. The service was very average, at best, depending on the time of day it is when you dine at the restaurant.  The interior of the restaurant is very spacious, but I wish they can still do a lot better in terms of creating a more classic environment in the restaurant.
