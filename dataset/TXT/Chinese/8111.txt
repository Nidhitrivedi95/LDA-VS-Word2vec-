This restaurant looks a little newer than most PF Chang's and also includes nice patio dining in addition to an attractive bar area which I opted for.  Happy hour runs from 3:00pm-7:00pm and I ordered the popular chicken lettuce wraps for $6.00.  Pretty flavorful and a great value for the price. I also added spring rolls which were not outstanding but okay enough.  But the best was being pleasantly surprised on how well they made their dirty martinis.  I don't think of PF Chang's as a place for stellar cocktails but everyone in the bar area seemed really happy and satisfied with all their drink orders.  PF Chang's continues to evolve their menu items towards the needs of their customers.  That alone and a good effort and delivery on food makes this place a pretty good and consistent choice for lunch, happy hour or dinner.
