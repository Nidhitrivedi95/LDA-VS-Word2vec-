CanfdSFEs_o_h9SBvxyXlg Had a really bad day so I decided to head here to get some comfort food. I paid 6.95 for soy sauce chicken noodle which was better than I expected though the chicken was slightly overcooked but the taste was good they were generous to give lots of toppings like sliced red carrot, chopped ginger and leeks. The chinese owner was nice to customers and it's really big plus.
