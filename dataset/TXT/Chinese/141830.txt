Rh2smrKvcamnP8VBUgMI0Q I honestly don't know how anyone could enjoy the food here.  My boyfriend and I went on Friday night around 7, service was alright.  I knew we had to ask for condiments so after flagging a server down we were given soy sauce and hot sauce.  I asked about the ginger sauce which I could see on the table next to us and was basically told three times they don't make it until I pointed it out, at which point I was told that "probably the kitchen can't make it, we're very busy right now".  Huh?  You can't even ask?

There were a few dishes that probably would have been decent had there been a ginger sauce to go with it, particularly the one that said "ginger and scallion", because everything we ate was extremely bland.  I will happily eat food that is delicately flavoured and appreciate the subtle nuances, but this literally had none of that, no fragrance, no flavour, just oil and meat.

I'm honestly baffled.
