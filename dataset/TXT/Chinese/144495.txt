RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ Yes. Doing Taiwanese food justice in Pittsburgh. It was pretty delicious and I would say that the food is very shareable. In fact, I feel like it should be mandatory! I joke, but really, the portions are generous without the food lacking in flavor. The food isn't heavy at all and I would say it's seasoned quite well. The downfall of a lot of Taiwanese food places is when the food tastes heavy and just makes you want to sleep right afterwards.

I would have to say that this place is busy almost all the time, but hopefully you are willing to wait for it because it's definitely a place I would go more than once. The boba is pretty good for Pittsburgh and I would say if you do want to try boba, you should get it here.
