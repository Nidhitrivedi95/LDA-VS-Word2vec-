6PdHFAW72p0sSrMCX0mmbw I came here a couple of times because my roommate loves their noodles. Food wise; The noodles are not bad but the soup base lacks flavors. Do recommend the lamb skewers as they are probably the best thing on the menu . Service wise; there's a 50/50 that you will either get a server that's amazing or the really shitty ones who acts like you forced them to work there and treats you horribly and will ignore you as well. 
Also, They constantly forgets orders (they forgot parts of our orders on three different occasions)  And if you ever ask them about your missing orders they will raise their voice at you.  Overall, the food is average and the service is horrible. Would not recommend at all.
