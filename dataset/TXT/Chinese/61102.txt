dqeUvrlMxTAk0VL2n1ukaw Overall a good experience, would like to give a 3.5. Got two combo dinners, the sesame chicken for me and the curry shrimp (no shrimp, add chicken). Within a minute of the waitress taking our order we got our soup which was good. Maybe 2 or 3 minutes after that got our meals, which we don't know how to feel about that. The sesame chicken was surprisingly delicious and most pieces were chunks of chicken, not just fried pieces. The three star for my boyfriends meal. Not only did it not look appetizing, but maybe a 1/4th of the plate was chicken. The rest seemed to be an entire onion, and some watercashews and carrots. He was pretty disappointed, so ended up helping me with mine. Big portion sizes!
