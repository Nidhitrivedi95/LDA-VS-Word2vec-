C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ Not sure why this place gets knocked a lot but I do enjoy the occasional Asian buffet splurge and I think this particular location provides a good bang for your buck.  I probably come here twice a year and I have yet to be disappointed.

The price for dinner is about 1/3 that of a Strip buffet's price with a plethora of options to choose from for food and dessert.  Along with your freshly cooked typical Chinese fare, other options include a variety of soups, a sushi bar, a Mongolian BBQ/noodle station, and American classics (pizza for instance).  

What makes this establishment even more worthwhile is their crab claws.  Now if you're a fan of the buttery crustaceans then definitely go here one time!   The last time I had dinner here, the claws were replaced frequently and the size of the claws rival those of their Strip buffet counterparts.  An unlimited amount of crab legs is probably bad for the heart but good for the soul.  :)

This location hosts a private room for private parties if needed and the space is pretty clean and well-maintained overall.  However, the bathrooms could definitely use a make-over.   

When you're trying to stuff yourself and your family without breaking the bank, consider a trip to this buffet.  Your appetite will thank you for it.
