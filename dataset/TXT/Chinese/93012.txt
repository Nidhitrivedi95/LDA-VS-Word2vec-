IycHntUVv2kyIo7w9FJWlA @ Food Truck Festival Feb 22... 
Tried a few of the different Food Trucks, and though not a full beleiver and probably wouldnt chase any truck around town, I would definitly buy from these guys again, if they happened to be at a local area that i was at.. 

Tried Dumplings, and they were bettter than any local restaurant. 
Imperial Chicken, had great flavor, but would be better on a full piece of chicken, like aq drumstick, thigh, or wing or on wings themselves,, 4 piece meal or somehting.. 

Will buy again , but will no travel to chase them down.. 
Service and hospitality #1 the guy greeting everyone was very nice and energetic, remembering most customer names when we went back to drop our votes !! Great work guys !!
