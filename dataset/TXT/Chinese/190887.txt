yPR8Bh55-9NXmooZS7lrLA Had takeout numerous times, rice dishes kids loved.  Decided to have a sit down lunch on Sunday, invited the extended family, party of 14.  They got swamped and some of our orders came late or did not get made.  The food was great, the General Tsao was a nice surprise better than other similar restaurants.   The sweet and sour pork was similar to mall food, think Manchu wok.  Overall a good experience in a quiet corner of scarborough, a good local spot.  Service should improve since management did apologize and did tell us that they are getting another server.
