M0A8RFdN1UqSd-tIqXFEBQ I'm giving this place four stars because the people who own it are the sweetest people I've ever encountered in a Chinese restaurant.
Extremely friendly and knowledgable.
China tango is definitely better for what I order but if this was my only option I would go back again and try something different.
Ready in about 10 minutes which was nice!
