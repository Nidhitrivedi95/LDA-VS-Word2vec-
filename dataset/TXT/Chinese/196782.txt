zpaXQga1MIqPc5nAWZXtdQ I have found a diamond in this town. The best, freshness, and old school Asian cooking. The food makes you travel across the seas to Asian cuisine at its best. I came here for my birthday and ordered the entree, "amazing chicken" and my girlfriend ordered "lemon chicken." I was licking the plates clean. For someone not to like this place is because they are use to fast food and never experienced great food. I met the cooks and shook their hands, they are the real thing....I will make this place my frequent go to place. Thanks S-LA!!!!! Fantastic.
