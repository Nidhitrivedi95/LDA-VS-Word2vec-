tbMAjldMYhvDUS2gG5Fdxw First time ordering food from here. Cody on the phone was very pleasant and repeated our order back to me. Took a little longer than the 10 minutes quoted on the phone but no problem. The food was great tasting and still hot when my husband arrived home with it (live 5 minutes away).  Portions were good sized; we will be able to get 2 meals from our dinner combos. Parking is limited but this is no fault of the restaurant. We will definitely going back!!
