jIc8lKpK0S265D18cgQKEw Celebrated Chinese New Year here and was blown away by the wonderful food! I adore classic Chinese restaurants, no modern for me, and the Pearl delivered high quality food with amazing flavor. The scallion pancakes were a perfect starter and the pineapple fried rice a nice surprise. As we ate family style, I must have tried 10+ different dishes and every one was a winner. They even deliver!

Honey Almond Chicken is my go to dinner here and I was sent an $8 off birthday coupon - be aware that using coupons here requires you pay in cash. Also I wasn't able to use it and take advantage of BOGO drinks.
