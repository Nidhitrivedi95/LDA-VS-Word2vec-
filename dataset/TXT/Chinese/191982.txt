yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw I went here today instead of my usual place because I just didn't feel like making the drive.  Well, as the saying goes, when you cut corners....

Bleyck! I spent like $20 on 2 items and they are both going in the trash.  I'm not calling to argue with them and i'm certainly not taking it back because then I've made 2 trips and I really don't want them to replace it with anything.  I won't eat here again.  I've never even written a review of a restaurant but it was so yuck I had to. 

I ordered veggie chow mein and honey walnut shrimp.  The shrimp was absolutely swimming in sauce, like drowning in it, and it took me taking it out of the container and putting it on paper towels FOUR times to get the excess off.  Secondly, for those who don't know, honey walnut shrimp uses mayo in the sauce.  They had used so much that I could see white swirls in my (strangely lurid ORANGE colored) sauce and it tasted more like mayo than it did anything else.  After that it was partially edible but the taste is off (no it's not bad shrimp "off") and didn't taste honey or walnut at all. 

The chow mein tasted greasy.  When I looked in the container afterward I could see at the bottom a good half inch of oil just sitting there.  The noodles were drenched.  Even my dogs who love to beg had no interest in trying a noodle and they've eaten stuff off the side of the road. 

I have no idea how this place got 4 and 5 stars previously.  No idea at all.  I will NEVER go back.
