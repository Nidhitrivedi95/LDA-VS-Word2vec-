5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g We had beef stew noodle soup, spicy and tasty, different than pho or Chinese noodle soup.  The beef pancake is good too, they were delicious.  The price is around $8 and $9.  The portion is good. The service is fast.  A small place but good noodle soup, we would come back again.
