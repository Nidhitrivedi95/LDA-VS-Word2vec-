I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w We drove all the way from Westlake to Richmond Heights bc a friend recommended this restaurant as "the best Chinese food they've eatwn" however, I must disagree.

I can ignore the (scary) location and the (shady looking) aesthetic of it no problem. But the menu offers no explanation or ingredients for the dishes so make sure you know exactly what you want.

The food was only so-so. Not worth the drive but edible. The portions are HUGE however so that's a plus.

Some of the staff could use some manners or at least lessons in being polite to customers, even if they're faking it.
