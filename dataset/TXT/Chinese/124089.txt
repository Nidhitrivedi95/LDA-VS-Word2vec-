Just discovered this place and I love it. The lunch buffet is dirt cheap at $6 and the variety and quality of food is high for that price. The standard Chinese menu is on the buffet as well as sushi, stuffed crab, fried bananas and a huge desert selection.

The staff is great too, and you never have to wait for refills or your check.
