s6L6SdVYhPcOQEDmNIg1-g You know, apparently it's a lot harder to find Chinese delivery in my area than I thought. 

After an exhaustive search, we found "Happy Wok" aka the Chinese restaurant formerly known as 'Cheng's Express' and ordered the family dinner. 

The order arrived in pretty speedy fashion and was maybe slightly over what you'd hope to pay for standard Chinese. We got Sesame chicken (solid), Mongolian beef (average, could use more beef), wonton soup (average) and fried rice (average).

Overall, it's not bad, it's not great, but if you're looking to satisfy your Chinese urge in this area, and you're too lazy to visit the deliciousness that is Panda Express, this place is alright.

Three ***.
