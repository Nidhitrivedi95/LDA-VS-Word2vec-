chBeDQdaZgrb8iOzqgeCDA I used to get delivery from here all the time when I lived in the dorm rooms at UNCC without a car. It was basically my only Chinese option since not a lot of places in that area have delivery. The rice here is REALLY dry and always tastes more than a day old. Besides the rice, the food is alright. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's average. The chicken wings are prob the best thing I've had from this place. Or any place actually. Sesame tofu and sesame chicken is ok but the sesame tofu tastes better. The lo mein is extra greasy but very tasty. 

If you call to order your food, the lady might sound rude and have a hard time understanding you. But after meeting her in person, she's really sweet and understands me very well. She's just not a phone person so don't be put off when you first talk to her on the phone.
