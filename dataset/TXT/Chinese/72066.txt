FEWTPBUv-QiugBe-2uXD4A It was a Tuesday night. The weather was just breezy enough to wear a light jacket, but the skies had formed a deep red as the sun had just set beneath the mountains surrounding the valley. My boyfriend had just received the keys to his new house and I was excited to see what it had looked like. The rooms were void of furniture and as we sat together on the carpet in the empty living room, we talked about the endless possibilities of ways to decorate. Suddenly, I hear a growl in my stomach. "Feeeeeed meeeeee," it screams. My boyfriend, understanding it was getting late and there was no food in this new house, quickly grabs his keys and we both run to the car. The car speeds down Marks Street and into the shopping center. "Let's get Chinese food to go since you have your own kitchen now!" I tell him. We enter Chopstix and the delicious smell of Chinese food overwhelms me. I order cream cheese wontons, sweet and sour chicken, broccoli and beef, and to my surprise, it comes with delicious chicken fried rice! I make sure to ask for extra sweet and sour sauce and we usually end up fist fighting over it if there's not enough. The lady says there is a "big bowl" and i see it red at the top, assuming it's full. Pleased, we head home anxious to begin eating. "Ah, I'm so hungry, I can't wait to eat!" he muttered. As I opened the sweet and sour sauce, we both simultaneously took a deep, sorrow breath in, realizing that there is not nearly as much sauce as we hoped for. Then, we both cried as I felt all our hopes and dreams die along with this nearly-empty bowl. There simply was not enough sweet and sour sauce. Betrayal is never a good feeling, but this hit us hard and we shared this traumatic experience together. It bonded us. The end. (The food was great though).
