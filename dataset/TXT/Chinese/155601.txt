Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w The hours of this place blew me away. Open until midnight?! For real? On a Monday? Well okay then! Lol. I strolled up here and had a seat. The staff is well-dressed and friendly. The decor is simple and not overwhelming. I started off with 2 appetizers, the Siam Wings, wish are like... somehow boneless, but they look like a regular wing. They were very good! I also had the stuffed crab claw. Amazing. So rich and just tasted incredible. For dinner I had the Seafood Dynasty. I LOVED the sauce that everything was draped in and the portion was huge. I'm not a fan of squid of mussels so I just took those pieces out of my dish. I would definitely come here again!
