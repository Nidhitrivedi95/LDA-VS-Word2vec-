HQpMwOOrGND3GaRqMNV9ig Excellent place to visit for a quick, authentic, simple, and cheap meal.

This restaurant has been around for many years, recently made some new posters to put on the wall, a colorful version of the menu! 

tea is self serve, and a minor selection to choose from, but the few that they offer is their specialty.

The wontons are huge, and soup base is excellent (even though I believe it used to taste better years ago) since there were management changes.

Definately a place to go to if you haven't tried!
