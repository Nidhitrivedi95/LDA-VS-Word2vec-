3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug On a Saturday night the restaurant was packed. Reservations made for 6 o'clock for 7 ppl. The restaurant was packed. Food came okay fast. We got the lobster combo for 6 ppl. 

Lobster was 8 lbs served 2 ways. The soup came after the lobster... kinda weird but they were so busy. No one changed our plates. We were being rushed out even though we didn't finish dessert. They gave us our bill. We understood but didn't really like that gesture. 

The food was delicious but 2 of the dishes were over salty. The food was enough to feed 8 ppl even though it's for a 6 ppl combo. 

Dessert we got mango Mochi and a sesame rice roll. Also came with sweet soup but it was different types.

Would come back with a big group and only with reservations.
