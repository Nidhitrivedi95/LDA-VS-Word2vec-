D9bf5U0y_0MnL9wMFc4bKQ The atmosphere is really cozy and intimate--this is a great place for a quiet dinner or a special date.  The food is billed as small plates, but the portions are perfectly sized for a single diner (so nice to be served exactly as much as I want to eat!)  The staff was accommodating when we added an extra person to our reservation, but they did mess up the bill and we had to flag them down to have them correct it.  The menu is small, but I understand it changes regularly, so it would be interesting to visit in a few weeks and see what they're serving.
