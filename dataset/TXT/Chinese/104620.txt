kP2wC0luve3mT5fcdrA3nQ I went there 10-19-15 for a late lunch with a friend, upon entering the front door I saw a dead roach in the door entrance, looks like they never swept anyway. Place is VERY dark.  We were seated right away and was brought water and the waitress already had her pad asking what we wanted to eat, we didn't even have a chance to look at the menu yet, I told her not yet and asked for a straw for my water, she came right back with it and asked if we were ready yet. I said no to give us a few minutes. They had two lunch menu's on the table in the plastic holders, was confused as to why that was. We ordered from their lunch menu they gave us, and was brought out soup right away, was warm not hot. I was not happy with what I ordered, the house chicken which is to be coated and crispy with a gravy, it was a little too crispy, tasted old like maybe they reheated it and hardly any gravy, dry for the most part. My friend had some kind of beef with veges and she said it was watered down, the beef looked like it was paper thin like from a deli. NOT GOOD at all, we were rushed the whole time we were there. Also another two ladies came in and one ordered what was the special noted on their menu board when you walked in, the waitress said there was not that for a special, that lady had to get up to show her!!!! really. I was not happy with this place at all and would never go back there.
