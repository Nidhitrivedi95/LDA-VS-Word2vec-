I thought it was just two pieces but it's loaded with it I sent it back good thing I didn't do take out! I don't think I will be back sad! Now they gave me chicken instead of shrimp that I  paid for! And he is complaining!  Give me my money back. Well I was in my car and the manager came out to apologize and give me a gift card.  Unfortunately he is the same person who argued with me and blamed everything on the cashier! I told him that this has happened before and last time it was take out. Don't think I'll be back at least to this one.
