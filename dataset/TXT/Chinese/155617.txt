Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w I always enjoy a trip to Siam Cafe! Although I tend to typically move towards "Americanized" Chinese food, I am blessed enough to have an abundance of Chinese and Taiwanese friends who have recommended some great dishes at Siam. The authentic dishes and the Americanized ones are all delicious, and the waitstaff is very attentive. I recommend the cocktails as well - great blends and really affordable!
