Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA I wanna start out by saying that this review is based on food delivered to my home.My husband ordered the Musamun curry and pineapple fried rice and did not eat the food.

first of all everyone knows take out food pales in comparison to eating in the restaurant,so that is why I will give two stars instead of one.

The  rice was dark and unappetizing with bland and unpleasant taste and very dry.
The curry was huge vegetables just rough cut and chicken was over cooked & dry.

All in all it was uneatable

Sorry,  my husband and I  know Thai food and this was A disappointment.
