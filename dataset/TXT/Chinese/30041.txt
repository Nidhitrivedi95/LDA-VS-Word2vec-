I asked one waitress if I could charge my phone, and she took it and said she'd charge it. I asked for a Tsingtao, and the waitress acknowledged it. 15 minutes later, no beer. They started bringing out all our food, so I asked another waitress for my Tsingtao. She nodded, then walked away and went nowhere near the beer section. I asked her again, and she said, "Oh, Chingdao!" So it was because she didn't understand me. Okay... then she walks away and goes nowhere near it again. I had to stand up and ask the dude in the back for it, and he finally brought it. After we ate, which was pretty good, they gave me back my phone, uncharged. 

Serious mental illnesses I think. Just expect 0 and you may be pleasantly surprised.
