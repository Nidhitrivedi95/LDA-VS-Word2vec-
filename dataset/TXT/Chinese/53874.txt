cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Seems to be the same as Dragon Legend in Markham, so my review will be similar.

Lunch buffet was about $16 which I found to be very reasonable. The quality was great for a buffet. Best things include the sushi, grilled vegetables and meat and the homemade noodles in soup. They also had one of my favorites: hollow balls that look like cream puffs but they are rolled in sugar.

Clean restaurant, constant filling of water glasses and clearing of used plates. They were great with our very large group.
