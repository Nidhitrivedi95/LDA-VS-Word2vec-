-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ I still enjoy this place very much and still go quite often. I'm only rating it one star less because today I tried their sushi just a basic California roll, nothing special, and though I thought it was very tasty,  it was very small in size. I'm not saying I was expecting some monster roll or anything,  but I've had my fair share of California rolls and this is the smallest it's ever been. It makes me glad I just ordered that and not something more expensive cause I'd be really pissed about it. They still have bomb Chinese food,  cant go wrong with a lunch special!!
