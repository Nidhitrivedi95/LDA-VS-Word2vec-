CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw We had a great dinner here.  The Ku Sticky Wings make you want to order more...a perfect combo of sweet & spicy. We also ordered the Lo Mein Noodles that war very tasty.  You can tell the noodles were fresh!  Drinks were awesome too! You gotta try their specialty Green Tea Margarita & Sake Punch.
