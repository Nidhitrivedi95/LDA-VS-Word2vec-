HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA This place is a great concept and I liked my meal. The vegetarian bao was really good. But the sesame noodles were pretty flavorless, unless I should count sugar as a flavor. Weirdly sweet. And I get having a limited menu but there were nit enough vegetarian options - I feel like I had both of them? For example, there are sandwiches - but not a single one is vegetarian. Anyhow, I like the place but it needs some tweaks.
