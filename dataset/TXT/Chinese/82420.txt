H94fBucKEuNKsjbSy7WODg What a lovely little family Chinese restaurant. Food is excellent. Never had such a thick egg drop soup. Swanie, the owner, is friendly and fun to talk to. 

I came in for dinner at 5 on a Wednesday and was there till 6:30. Lots of people came in for take out, but almost nobody dined in, which surprised me, as the food is excellent and the atmosphere of the restaurant is quaint. Nice little undiscovered family restaurant.
