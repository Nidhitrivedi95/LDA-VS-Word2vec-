OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw we just had our wedding reception here at chang's...they were awesome and took care of us.  thanks to Jack and John our special day was as memorable and smooth as can be.  besides the service, their dinner was delicious.  we had the seafood chowder, peking duck, walnut prawns, black pepper steak, flounder, veggies, house special fried rice and noodle, whole chicken, orange blossom pork chop, etc.  everyone of our guests were satisfied.  fantastic job chef!  it felt like we had the whole place to ourselves too =)  if you're visiting vegas or local, please make sure to try out chang's, you won't be disappointed.
