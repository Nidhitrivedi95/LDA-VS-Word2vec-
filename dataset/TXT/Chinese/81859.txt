h0Wmyzb8q0bXbrqmWqVvfQ Ordering a pickup doesn't do this place justice. The inside is clean and the tables are cool, plus if you take too long to get it home and start eating, it can get soggy in the container! I can't say any Chinese food is the "best" since I've had authentic 5 times in my life. But, this place has my favorite "general tso's chicken" anywhere around here. It's crunchy not soggy. And they ask you how hot/spicy you want it. I always say hot and its not overpowering. Everything is made fresh. They have big chunks of chicken breast in the crispy breading instead of mushy frozen crap. Also, Sezchuan Chicken is my second choice at this place! 10/10

This is not a buffet. But, they give you huge portions.
