iM-sH2Ey0IWbk9Y_FY5rwg For $9.50 you get a large all you can eat container as long as you can close it after getting your food. I guess they charge you more at that point. I was a little irritated with the cashier, she explained the rules about container must close and I completely understood. She was breathing down my neck the entire time as if I was going to not be able to close it and try to run out. I feel like maybe if it has been a problem eliminate the to go platter. The food is good but I won't be back.
