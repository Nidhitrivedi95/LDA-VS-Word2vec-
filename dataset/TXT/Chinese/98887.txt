jtxwnAAfwskSC_TdB0E3bg I tried this place first they open. People lining up. I waited for 20 mins. The service is ok. Maybe it was the first day they open and they don't have enough staff. The menu looks good and seems has lots of food choice. They have 9 Soupbases. Spicy and non-spicy. You can mix and match 2 soupbase if you like. My favor is their signature spicy  and Pickled Cabbage with Fish Soupbase. They also have free upgrade during the soft opening. I got half lobster, angus beef slices and beef ribs.  Overall experience is good!!
