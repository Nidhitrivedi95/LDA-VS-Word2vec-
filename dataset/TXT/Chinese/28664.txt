8Sqd1E8Jhjt3pbsoyOZ4dQ I ordered the chicken and veggie noodle soup with spicy broth, thinking it would be a light and delicious meal. The option of wheat noodles lured me.

I'm an idiot. Come and open the soup bowl in office and oil starts oozing out because of the vaccuum the hot soup created inside. Ruined my nice new skirt forever (I'll try not to let that influence my review).

The taste would have been ok if I could see and taste anything other than oil. Veggies were 2 pieces of broccoli and 1 piece of bok choi. Chicken was, well, fried, soaked in oil (even though I didn't get the crispy option). I removed 7 soup spoons of oil from the top, but still plenty sticking to my palate.

A few bites and I was done till the evening. Take your health and taste buds somewhere else! Never again.
