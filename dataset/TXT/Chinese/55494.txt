cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw Service: Excellent. This a small establishment and our hostess/server took great care of us. If you have a second beverage already on the table before I finish my first, you are doing it right.
Food: Fantastic. I've only tried the Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken and Crab Wontons, but I was impressed, especially considering the price. The menu looks to be quite varied and interesting; all dishes can be served with beef, chicken or tofu and a side of steamed rice, fried rice or noodles. They are very vegetarian friendly.
Price: Excellent! I spent $8 and walked away very satisfied. At $6 an entree this is very affordable.
Appearance/Location: Meh. Now I don't really care about these sorts of things, with food as good as theirs, but it is in an awkward, aging strip mall facing away from the street. It's a good thing the QT is right next door, or I never would have seen the joint.
Summary: I will be going back and bringing friends.
