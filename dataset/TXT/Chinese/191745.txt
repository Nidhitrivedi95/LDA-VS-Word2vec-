Review based on weekday dim sum only.

Dim sum Monday to Friday 11am - 3:30pm
Weekend 10am-3:30pm.

No special price (S, M, L, XL, SP, J, SJ) range from $4 per plate to $13.

Some dishes were ok some were horrible. Had the fishball soup noodle for $17.80 and there was barely and soup and the fishball seemed like it turned bad. I came with 7 people and we all spit it back out.

There were only 2 servers so we barely got service. 

I rated the previous restaurant at this location a 1 star. I was hoping this place would deserve a bit more. Unfortunately it only has the looks. I hope to try the dinner and see if they are more deserving.
