yZZaCLmVbsKqQAdjaszupA A friend and I came to this restaurant for a little get together. We searched for a buffet in our location that is reasonably priced but we were unfortunately incredibly unsatisfied, disapointed and underwhelmed. Do not come here for a late dinner from Monday and Friday 7 - 9 (closing) otherwise you'll be resorting to eat the left over food that has sat at the end of the day. They do not replenish the food during these hours so it's basically first come first serve and what's there is there. The food was mediocre (bland and commecialized), you can tell it has been sitting for quite awhile,  and did not provide much variety. However, the desert was okay. I personally believe for the quality and variety of the food, especially during those hours of operation should be discounted considering you do not get your money's worth. The total came up to $30 per person. You'd be better off going to a better high end buffet for the same cost or $5 extra like Dragon Pearl or Mongolian Grill. We will not be coming back and I do not reccomend.
