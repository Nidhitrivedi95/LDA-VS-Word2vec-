B4ZuEVKHnr2blYg-QiGOkw After our last visit to Pei Wei we won't back. The food is just way too sweet and there's nothing on the menu that isn't a sugar bomb. Panda Express, which I'm not a fan of, is so much better. 

Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this fake Asian food designed to taste like a candy bar. What are they thinking putting chicken, coated in a sugary sauce on a salad. ICK!

Here's what we got. An appetizer, two entrees and two drinks for almost $30. Way overpriced and tastes awful. 

Never, ever again.
