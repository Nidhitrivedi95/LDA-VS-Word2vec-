hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q After seeing many good reviews about this place I wanted to give it a go.
The place itself is quite cozy and small and looks inviting. Staff is really  nice and welcoming, but from there it unfortunately went downwards for me.

I had the shrimp and pork wonton soup and I was quite disappointed. The wontons itself were nice, but the soup just bland. The only thing that gave it some flavor was pepper. I like the fact that the noodles are made freshly on site and you can even watch the chefs preparing them. But for me this just didn't do the trick. It tasted like wontons in hot water with a bit of pepper and 2 small pieces of broccoli that were still raw. I don't know. Maybe I am spoiled from NY and many other places were the broth is just nice and rich, with plenty of veggies and fresh spices. Maybe their specialty are the wontons and dumplings. I would give them another try for the dumplings, but don't expect me to come back soon!
