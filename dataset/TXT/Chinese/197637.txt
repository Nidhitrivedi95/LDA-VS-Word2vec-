It is decorated in a modern-traditional style and is light handed on stereotypical Chinese restaurant decor.  It felt very cozy and welcoming, which is a great feature.

The food was very good!  It was presented attractively and the portions are enough to feed you for dinner and again for lunch tomorrow.  I ordered a vegetarian stir-fried noodle dish and was totally happy with my selection.  I tried a bite of my roomate's fried rice, which was a bit oily for my liking, but still tasted quite good.    

I will warn you against ordering the egg rolls, because they are the frozen kind.  They taste just like the ones at Panda Express.  I think I would give this restaurant 5 stars if their egg rolls were bigger and homemade.  Over-all it was a pleasure to eat here and I will definetly go back!
