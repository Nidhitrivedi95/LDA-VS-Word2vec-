1FL3oE2mqq_EFAYPd1TWUg I've always eaten take out from this place, so I'm not too sure about the service or experience of eating in in this place. However, every time I come for take out during lunch hours, it's packed and has a small lineup. 

I've only really tried two different types of food here, their dumplings and their stir fried noodles. As their name suggested, only go for their dumplings. Anything else, you'll probably end up with a disappointment.

If you've eaten a lot of Chinese food, you'll notice that they like to use a lot of oil to cook. In this place, you'll feel like they took it to a whole 'nother level. Their pan fried dumplings will feel like they were deep fried, or at least the bottom of it. Luckily, they didn't soak up the oil, so the pan fried dumpling always comes with a nice texture of crispiness on the bottom, but with a nice soft skin on the top, and mouth watering juice in the meat. However, if you get their stir fried noodles, oh man..... every bite feels like the noodles were dipped in oil before eating them. It was oily, and salty, and nothing special to it.

So like I said, and as their name suggested, just go for their dumplings.
