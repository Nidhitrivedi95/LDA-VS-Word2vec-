7Nz4kTghhicjsR23GYMlLg A rare five-star rating,  Our now favorite Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area.

Very wonderful food.  They do it right and have some twists to their Cantonese style cooking that we love.  One of those is the "Szechuan spicy won ton."  These are soft won tons in a spicy brown gravy, warm but not hot.  The sauce is of the peanut variety and the won ton dough is "slimy" in texture, but they are DELICIOUOS. It is not on the menu so ask for it, in fact, if you are heading there, call ahead to insure that they will set aside an order or two for you.

My wife and I fought over the final one and ended up making a second order which we laughed through as we slurped them down.  So yummy will go there today for lunch.

Their won ton soup is PERFECT, being golden yellow, flavorful and not greasy or infused with soya sauce.  Marvelous with those soft delicate won tons.  Do wish that they would have a larger order and one with vegetables.  Will have to ask for the "wor won ton" type of soup.

I find that the portions are fair, but not generous.  Rice is a measured bowl and the servings are OK for two people, but far short of what you get at other places.  You might find that where you order two mains you might want an appetizer or a third main.

And don't expect spicy. Cantonese food is generally not spicy, so please ask if they will juice it up if you like more zip to their dishes.  Some dishes they will and others, no.  Chef's call.

It was no surprise to me when I found out that the chef of this family-owned restaurant is the former chef of Wan Fu in Charlotte.  This is another reason to know who is in the kitchen.  It makes a lot of difference.

Jade Dragon is located in Quail Hollow, off of Rea Road in South Charlotte.  It is in a Harris Teeter shopping center which also contains more of our favorites, like Brooklyn Pizza, The Lodge and Mai Japanese Restaurant.

It is a great restaurant.
