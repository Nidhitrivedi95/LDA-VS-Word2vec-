z8oIoCT1cXz7gZP5GeU5OA Like mother like daughter.... My mom and I are very alike in that we love to eat. We differ because she usually likes to venture out to try new Chineae restaurants and I like to venture out and try eveything! The Miliken Bar was our weekend adventure.

We got the dinner special. For $70 we got: Peking Duck, steamed fish, broth braised lobster, daikon and winter melon soup, beef stir-fry, stir fried greens and adzuki (red bean) sweet soup. This special is even more of a bargain during weekdays ($58!) 

The food was a bit on the salty side for me but all in all very tasty. The Peking duck was the best! The duck was not too fatty and the skin was crisp. The crepe was nice and thin and is one of the best I've had at a Chinese restaurant! The stir fried beef had a hint of five spice, was battered and then smothered in sauce. This was a little too salty for me. The lobster was good, the meat was nice and firm, though I wish they would've added some scallions in it for flavour. The stir fried greens were a little oily but savory. The fish was nice and tender though a but too flaky IMHO. The red bean soup is prolly one of the best in Toronto. The consistency was perfect! Not too watered down but not too glutinous either and just the right amount of sweetness. 

A must try!  Service was good. They changes our plates after we filled it with lobster shells and gave us clean ones.
