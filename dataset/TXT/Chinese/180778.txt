x8O-Mll5ksDpeIgtA0XY-w Worst buffet Ive ever been to. You could tell some items have been sitting there for hours and started to turn bad. I feel beyond sick as I am writing this, I dont know if I can finish everything Id like to say. But I paid $50 for three people on their lobster night... I got zero lobster. Everything was deep fried to mask how old it was. Staff was friendly but food was horrible. Im mad I even wasted that money. I could of just set it on fire and felt more at ease.
