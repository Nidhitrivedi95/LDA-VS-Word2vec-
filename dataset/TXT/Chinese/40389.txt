The Buffett line didn't have that much Chinese food out it wasn't a variety of Chinese food to choose from the fried rice was dry they needed to refill it  the white rice was gummy the salmon didn't look so appetizing.  I tried to coconut chicken and the teriyaki chicken it was very mediocre. Honestly me and my boyfriend could of went to Panda Expresss. Would I come here again probably not. I think Buffet Asia is way better.
