p0aNNb7o6Ou6kn4apz4lkQ As I mentioned in an earlier review, Magic Idea is one of a few places vying for second place in my estimation of the best places for bubble tea in Montreal.  The bubbles are a little fluffier than I like, but they still have a satisfyingly chewy center, for the most part.   They're just not perfect.

I really like the fact that Magic Idea is open until midnight every night, they have a wide variety of flavors available, and they have a stamp card so after 9 teas, the 10th is free.  I also really love the tall glass mugs, they're just super cool, to me.

You'll often find a lot of Concordia students here, given the proximity to the campus, and the free WiFi.

Unfortunately they only accept debit cards and cash, so if you prefer credit like me, remember to bring cash.  The bathrooms are also pretty grungy.

Overall, a very nice tea room, and worth a visit.
