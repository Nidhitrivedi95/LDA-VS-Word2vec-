AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA This restaurant is just amazing 
We have been several times, and all times the food quality has been 1. Consistent in quality &  2. Generous helping. The menu is big, you will not miss any meat options. 
I can go on n on - best option is get out there and try this 100% vegetarian Chinese restaurant. 
We will be back many more times.
Good work by team and Top Chef out there
