Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg I went to this place several times with friends and family. This place is pretty famous. I consider it as fancy in Chinese restaurant standard. It costs around 15 per person. I think it got best congee in Toronto. It is a good place to have a Guangdong-style family / street food.
