3eNRMrdaFSfid7KQF4BwpA I had a taste for Chinese food so I read the reviews and decided to call for a to go order.  Haven't gotten my food yet but call in service is poor.  Person that answered the phone just said "hello."  I had to ask if this was the Lucky Café?  When I gave my order he asked "sides?"  Since I couldn't read the menu online because it was so small I asked what sides they had.  He sounded upset that he had to tell me the sides.  After I gave my order, he said it would be ready to pick up in 10 minutes and hung up.  I realized he hadn't asked my name or gotten my phone number.  I'm on my way to pick up my food now.  I'll let you know if food is as poor as phone ordering service.
