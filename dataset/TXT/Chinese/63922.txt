E0zjBNt4_giYtJqUjugskw Both myself and my husband love this family owned restaurant. The food is authentic and no matter what we've tried there we've both been quite happy.

Today we ordered boiled chicken dumplings and crab Rangoon appetizer which were very tasty. I like that the wanton wrap they use for the crab Rangoon is'nt too thick or greasy from frying. I ordered the lamb ginger scallion for my main course and my husband ordered the beef chitterlings. What I love about the lamb they use is there's no gristle and it's well seasoned and tender. It's so far been my favorite main dish there. My husband was quite happy with his dish as well. Now I am not a fan of chitterlings but they do an excellent job of cleaning them so they don't smell like s#%t. They were also well seasoned and it really did'nt taste like what you think of when you think of traditional southern chitterlings, it was way better. 

The service here is also good we've never had any problems coming here. Even though from the outside it looks like a hole in the wall inside is very warm and welcoming. However it's not Vegas flashy so if that's what you need don't bother coming here. It really is worth a try though for authentic Chinese food.
