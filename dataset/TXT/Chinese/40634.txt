B2UK8R5y-nSyTrCpzn_VFA I've been eating here since I was a kid. The pecan steak is my favorite, followed by the shrimp fried rice, and their crab Rangoon is different from any other that I've had, but still delicious. My mom gets some kind of fried shrimp appetizer that's really good. Everything we get is always delicious.
