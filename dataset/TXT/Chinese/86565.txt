HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I came here for lunch with a friend last week. He had actually gone to Great Bao when it was open & wanted to try Fat Choy. The name & menu intrigued me, so I was in! 

Let's just get this out of the way: the only thing I did not like about Fat Choy was its location. Like many Yelpers have stated, the restaurant is located inside of the Eureka Casino & it is SUPER smoky! Maybe having a door would help? 

Aside from that, the food & experience blew me away - in a very good way! Our waitress Jenny was so friendly, attentive & gave great recommendations! Based off of her recommendations & my friend's prior experience from Great Bao, we ordered the pork belly bao, fried pork sauce noodles & grilled shortrib grilled cheese. The pork belly bao was so yummy! The pork was bigger than the bao (I'm not complaining!) & the pickled greens, cilantro & hoisin sauce tasted great! My friend had the fried pork sauce noodles where the noodles were cooked perfectly - not too hard, not too soft - just right. I might have to order it for myself next time! As for my order of the shortrib grilled cheese.. just think of a grilled cheese sandwich but better. Better as in, with meat! The shortrib was nice & tender. I am definitely a fan! 

We really wanted to try their desserts, but we were full from our entrees & shared snack. We will have to save room for dessert on our next visit to Fat Choy!
