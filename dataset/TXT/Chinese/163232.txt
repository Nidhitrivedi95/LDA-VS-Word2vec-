UPSzbM6D2SkarWAINq1I9A I love hole-in-the-wall places, and I have a soft spot a mile wide for kooky older Asian ladies, mostly because they remind me of my mom. 

As such, this place can do no wrong. It's run by a husband (chef) - wife (everything else, said kooky Asian lady) team. We went with a couple who used to come here when they lived in Parma. Though that was years ago, she still remembered them! 

The food was delicious - I ordered tofu vermicelli, and the tofu came out in delightfully crispy little strips. My order sadly didn't come with fish sauce, but the sweet soy sauce was just as good! Service was slow, but the wife apologized for it profusely, and like I said - this place can do no wrong.
