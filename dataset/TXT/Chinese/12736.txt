2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg bomb ass bomb ass food! the decor in this restaurant is really nice too! very clean and waitstaff looks sharp. we had a table of 9 and ordered from their special combination with lobster menu where you get to choose I believe 7 dishes and a soup for $107.99. every dish was good, even the ones we thought looked plain. 

- the soup... ugh can't figure out what its called but it was bomb!!!
- 2 kinds of BBQ cold cut: bomb, very flavorful roast pork
- steamed live fish with soya sauce: so good we ended ordering another one at the end
- 1/2 a free range chicken: juicy chicken with flavorful ginger sauce for dipping on the side
- deep fried 3 kinds of seafood with salt & pepper: looked very boring when arrived but very delicious and flavorful we ended up ordering a 2nd serving at the end. 
- baby bok choy: good but veggies so moving on.... haha
- braised lamb: good and flavorful
- eggplant and oyster clay pot: ok this one i had never tried before but boy oh boy was it good especially with their rice
- seafood clay pot: this is probably the only dish that was mehhhh ok compared to the other dishes but nonetheless not bad

10/10 for food and 10/10 for service!!!!
