9ibMbke1qYbmhJ2Qf3tWfA Went here for the first time tonight. I have a family of four and we all got an entree along with some egg rolls and Crab Angels. I am really happy with this place the Crab Angels were the best I have ever had. The Egg rolls were fabulous. All of our entrees were on par with or better than any Chinese food I have eaten in years. 

I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived to see that it was very clean and they have a window right into the kitchen.
