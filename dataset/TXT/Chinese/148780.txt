SlQNMsVEOSxN-ciIn93LOw I absolutely love this place. The food is consistently good, and everything that I've tried from here has been delicious. I could eat it everyday.

I'd recommend the choice of two (I get shrimp and chicken, add spice), and the shrimp fried rice is really good, too. The portions are a good size, and I've never had a problem with requesting slight changes to my meal if I wanted (more sauce, add spice, no onions, etc).

The restaurant is clean, and it's nice for a date or outing because it's right in the boardwalk area. The customer service isn't anything to write home about, but it's not bad either.
