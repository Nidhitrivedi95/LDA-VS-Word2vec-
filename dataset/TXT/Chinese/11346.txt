2gI7dlktBQXPZiuOW-HWvw Warning!!!!!!!!! After reading a lot of positive reviews I decided to check this place out.  I placed an order for the house fried rice by phone and was told 10 minutes. I got there in about ten minutes and it was ready so I was in and out in less then 5 minutes.  Went back home ready to eat and was totally disappointed. The chicken, pork, and beef was all dry. It's as though they used leftover cooked meat to make the fried rice. It was more like rice and jerky. The egg roll was gross, flavor and texture. Now that I think about it, this food taste like reheated leftovers. I don't know why but south Phoenix Chinese food sucks compared to other parts out of South Phoenix. I won't be back however the cheese wontons were good.
