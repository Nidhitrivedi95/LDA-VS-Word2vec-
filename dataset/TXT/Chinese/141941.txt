rH7HQC7_t3hksLUiK-Lj_w I paid 35 for 3 dishes and 2 rice. Over priced and no flavor. I ordered pork and the meat was so hard that you can't eat it without getting stuff stuck in your teeth.

Service was the worst. They didn't serve water so we got up and served ourselves. We didn't pay any tip because we served ourselves and no one even took our order, we gave the order straight to the cooks in the kitchen.

If you are considering this place and see this post, go next door.
