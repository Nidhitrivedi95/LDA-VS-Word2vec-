BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ Ate at Plum Christmas day.  They were busy but the waiter was attentive.  

Very nice decor.  I ordered the yaki udon, which was excellent.  My wife had the pad thai.  She thought it tasted very bland, and I agreed with her; so we sent it back.  Chicken satay was good, as well as my daughter's sushi (spicy tuna and spicy salmon), which she couldn't finish.  

All in all a nice meal.
