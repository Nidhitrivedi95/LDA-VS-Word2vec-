Dzm3_K2lnLLcGPVLZBZtog The food here is excellent! The best in Mesa. I highly recommend the crab ragoons, lemon chicken and chicken lo-mien. HOWEVER the service is so slow! They have 1 person to hostess, answer phones, and serve. It's ridiculous how long everything takes. Next time I'm ordering to go. Eat in the restaurant if you have time.
