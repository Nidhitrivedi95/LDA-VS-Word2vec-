ky5L-EfUwU9chSPcIeXM5w There are several China a go go locations throughout vegas that I have been to and this one along with the one on green valley tend to stand out. As far as this one goes its the nicest to sit down and eat at out of the 4 I have frequented. The only reason this gets 4 stars and not 5 is that the food can sometimes be inconsistent. Not bad ever, but sometimes it can be just ok. There mongolian beef is a favorite of mine, but can be a bit spicy for the not so spicy inclined. You are however you are able to ask for it without the chili peppers which still I would imagine would taste just as good. The staff is nice and attentive and the service is always solid. Overall not a bad place to go at for dinner or to go in and enjoy a good lunch special during your break from work.
