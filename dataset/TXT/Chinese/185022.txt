xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw Better taste and quality then Yc's. However, way over priced and tiny tiny portions. I was seriously confused when I was handed a tiny bowl to put my food it. I wasn't very good at stuffing all the ingredients I wanted into the bowl, but I figured the noodles i requested with it would be more than enough. I ordered it to go, couldn't believe it was $10...got home and realized my to go box was less than 1/4 full. I seriously have the smallest appetite, and 9/10 times have left overs with every meal. I ate my entire to go box, and was still starving.
While the food tasted good, it definately wasn't worth $10.

Oh, and it was super super confusing. One needs to pop a xanax before visiting this place.
