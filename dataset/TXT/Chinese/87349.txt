HTAAMVDZ4P0VX5F9euJBoA If your not into authentic Chinese spicy cooking, then don't waste your time or money. We were very pleased to find this cafe with the flavors we enjoyed while in China for the past few years. We enjoy the spicy chicken and pork chop (#58). So many local cafés are American Chinese and not authentic Chinese. They also offer a few Hunan style dishes....if your in a rush go to a drive thru....and remember, the staff is Chinese so speak slowly and be patient...they too are authentic.
