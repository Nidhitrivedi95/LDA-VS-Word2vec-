qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A We haven't been to PF Chang's in a while. Don't know why. We always have a good dining experience. Lawrence was our server. He was very helpful. We were trying to figure out an ingredient in the asparagus side dish and he went to the kitchen and found out for us. Our meal was so good that we ordered a pad Thai to go for later.
