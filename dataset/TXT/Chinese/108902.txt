There's two or three things I like and they're quite tasty, like the General Tso's chicken and the black pepper pork, but otherwise the options are lacking, and their beef and their seafood tend to be too chewy. Overall, an upgrade over Coreana, the restaurant that used to be there, which had some good food but terrible service, so it took ages to get lunch.
