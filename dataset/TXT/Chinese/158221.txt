TxNeo206T0jMvRRQ4nKSIg It's food. There's not muh to say about it. In terms of price to food quality, price is higher than food quality and it costs way too much to eat here.

The 'live cooking' is all youre really paying for. But to pay anything for just meat cooked in front of you for the price tou're paying is just a bit too much.
