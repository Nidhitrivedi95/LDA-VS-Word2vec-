8BBcTUOmXT0dJ33hYtLUAw Seriously? 
I must have come on an off day.
Other reviews sing high praises of this place, I'm not getting it.
My food was bland like I had a head cold, no flavor at all. I was worried when my hot sour soup was nether hot or sour.
And how rude is it the owners children where playing in the dinning area? 
The counter person was very nice, that's about it.
