1F4T9e6bRFwL11wnNxW4Ng I wish I could say that my complaints are isolated to this single store. They are not.

The food is cheaply done for a not so cheep price. One dish tends to taste like five others that they have. Like its the same sauce,  just with different meats and sometimes vegetables. 
It feels like the place belongs in the food court of a mall. Not near a Goodwell. I suppose its location can tell you something about the quality of food one is going to get.

The employee always look over work and seem to not enjoy being there. It makes it feel like I have slave labor preparing my food. Which is a little disconcerting. 

The bathrooms are not to bad, but at timea are filthy. At least the food and dining area look clean most if the time.

I can't recommend this place as I avoid eating here myself.
