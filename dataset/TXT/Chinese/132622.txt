POJH4cPxgKCWWGVYJ_2i0w i had many good experiences here up until recently, when i got my usual acupressure/reflexology combo, and the therapist was unusually rough, rushed, and almost angry or anxious. was not relaxing for me... and very unusual.

i called the next day to give them some useful feedback, but i was told it was the therapist's "style," and he suggested it was my fault for not correcting the therapist. then the man on the receiving end wrapped up the conversation and hung up the phone.

it peeved me because these services are not cheap, and theyre something i look forward to. i thought they had better customer service.
