ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w Went there for dim sum but were too late so got stuck with their dinner menu.  Food was overpriced for a very small portion and plating looked like it was straight out of the 1980s.  Service was absolutely horrible despite the restaurant not being too busy.  Would never go back.
