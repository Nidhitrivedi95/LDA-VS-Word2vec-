WzrMNz9eUF78RgZGDTS8xg I have eaten at this particular venue and others over the last few years and the service and food are usually pretty good. Today; WTF Pei Wei?? It's 2:30 in the afternoon, it's dead inside, and the counter help are just standing around. I place an order of Mongolian Beef over white rice, hold the mushrooms, but add bell pepper instead. Dine in. Simple enough, right? WRONG!!! l Let's see....waiting 30+ minutes for something so easy, bad sign. Shows up at my table. No scallions, and FILLED with mushrooms. I explain the issue and send it back. Then I realize I don't have time to stay and eat, as lunch time for me will soon end,.So I voice my displeasure and concern to some young woman who I was told was in charge, and asked for my entree to go. She was nice enough to take the price of my lunch off the debit I had submitted to the cashier, and explained it would be tonight before I see the credit. My entree was shoved out and literally shoved into the take out container, and packed to go. I opened the container, and the now tossed around food didn't look right. I asked her if this was the right amount. She seemed very put out by my question and assured me it was. By this time I'm fuming and just want to leave. When I get back to work and open the entree lid, I realized why it didn't look right; Scallions still missing!! WTF? How hard is it to get such a simple order right??? Perhaps if the cook read English....he could have actually discerned how I ordered my meal. Perhaps if the people working today actually gave a rat's behind about customer service and doing it right, I wouldn't be on YELP. Unprofessional, sloppy, and rude. And people in this field want $15 an hour?? You've got to be kidding me. Told everyone at the office who usually eats there, about my ordeal. None of us will be back.
