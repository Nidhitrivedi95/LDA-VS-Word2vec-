xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I don't know why Lulu's is so popular. The food over all just isn't that authentic or tasty. That said, I kind of like the beef chow fun, which besides being sort of oily still tastes decently good. 
If you like singapore rice noodles (with the curry and chicken and pork), I would compare it with Orient Express. 
Oh, and they own the Asiana in CMU, which is fine if you are in a hurry and can't leave campus but generally not so great. The kim chi is subpar. I like the canned grass jelly and guava juice though...

Whatever you do, don't get the Pho, it doesn't taste like pho, it doesn't even taste good. 

They have bubble tea. Some people don't like Taro chunks in theirs. I don't mind them but I also prefer Orient Express's Taro tea anyway.

If you consider Lulu's to be a good asian restaurant, I can't argue with your taste buds. But I will urge you to try Rose Tea Cafe or Kamei and allow your tastes to expand a little.
