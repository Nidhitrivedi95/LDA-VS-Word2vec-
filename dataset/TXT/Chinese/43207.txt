beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Went for dinner for the first time last night as we were looking for hotpot and wanted to go venture off the strip.  Service was awful despite us giving 20% gratuity- we had to ask for items multiple times and had to check on our meat order several times as well. Not impressed with service, but food was probably 3.5 stars
