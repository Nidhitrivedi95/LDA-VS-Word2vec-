L8DX7Jxt5r6lS68AOG43hg Oh, I don't know what I was thinking. I was in a rush as I had to get my oil changed and had to get back in the office for a web conference...craving Chinese food -I saw no other option. 

I ordered the platter - 2 meats plus one side but I asked if I could swap out a meat for extra veggies. The person working the counter was very polite. 

So I ended up with the orange chicken, veggies, and rice (plus two spring rolls...although I wanted one not two this apparently isn't an option) for about $8. The chicken was alright - not bad,  the veggies were excellent - steamed but still crunchy and a great variety of green beans, carrots, cabbage, etc but what really bothered me was the rice. I kid you not it tasted like wet dog smells...that's my only description I can offer. I usually love rice and this looked great but the taste was so odd I could only handle a bite before I gave up. The spring rolls were bad...I've had better frozen, no seriously, Pagoda's are better. 

1 star for veggies and 1/2 for pretty ok fast food orange chicken and polite service

I really wouldn't frequent this type of place to begin with and now I know why. Meh ..
