9Z_6rRy7Tl_C6HIgm7y6FA Dined here for lunch. I ordered the Beef & Scallops Combination, off the Chef's Specialties section and a side order of chicken fried rice. The Beef & Scallops, was prepared in a brown sauce, with snow peas, water chestnuts, black mushrooms, broccoli & baby corn. The dish was colorful, tasty, but nothing to suggest. When I commented to the waiter, "I thought there would be more scallops in the dish, he said, it's to expensive to have more." So, if you can, save your money & try something else on the menu. Besides that, the chicken fried rice was decent. So far, the roast pork fried rice was the best in flavor & taste. In conclusion, if you don't mind paying a higher tax for food in the city of Glendale, Grand Dragon is the restaurant to go for a well prepared meal.
Till my next review......CHEERS!!
