HQpMwOOrGND3GaRqMNV9ig Agreed w/ Valery C- Jim's is a place that had got their specialties down pat. There's not a huge variety at ALL of food, but what they do have, is delicious!

Would come back again.

Pros
- shrimp wontons are huge and delicious
- soup and noodles do not have the "soap" taste; haha, this sounds weird, but it's a Chinese thing. Sometimes when you eat wonton noodles, there's a taste that we say in Cantonese called "soap taste" which is a bad thing, and this place does not have it!
- fast & efficient service - you order, and you get your food almost immediately
- the chili oil sauce is *delicious*

Cons 
- no variety; but that's the charm of the place

What they do have and just variations of the type of noodle or combination of "toppings":
- shrimp wonton
- beef balls
- fish balls
