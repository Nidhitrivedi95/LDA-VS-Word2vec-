xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A We go out of our way to eat here and have never had a bad meal.  The K5 noodle bowl, soups, crab rangoons, and even the general tso's chicken are great.  Nothing tops the K5 noodle bowl though.  Prices are cheap and the food is made quickly.  One of the best places in Oakland.   I see there are a lot of bad reviews and maybe some people have had bad experiences, but I don't hesitate to recommend them.  In my opinion this place is top notch and worth sharing.
