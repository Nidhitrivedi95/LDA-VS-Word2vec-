kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA You are paying for the atmosphere. the food is good, but over priced for what it is. we spent NYE there, it was a preset 7 course meal, $175 per person. The bamboo shoot chicken soup and the rod was the best, albeit everything was served cold and all the  food wasn't served at the same time. I think it should have been $50 per person. the dessert was horrible, it was sesame ice cream with chocolate cookie, the ice cream tasted like nothing and the cookie tasted bitter.y vegetarians friends got a fruit plate and that was def more enjoyable than or fancy dessert. again, the food was decent, just too bad they were served cold! They finally re-heated our last course, by than we were all so full!
