VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg Ordered take out: Diamond Cake Noodle, Crispy Gau Gee, Beef Chow Fun, Kau Yuk.  Waited over 50 minutes for my order.  Disappointed with the Cake Noodle, sauce was too salty, noodles were too hard.  Chow Fun and Gau Gee were good.  I tipped them 15% for take out and made me wait a long time to be disappointed, hoping that the food would bring back ono memories of back home in Hawaii (Cake Noodle from Moon Garden in Wahiawa).  I'll keep on looking for other restaurants, not here!  Oh yeah, the Kau Yuk was meh (over cooked and unrecognizable)!!!
