vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q I went for Dim Sum lunch on an early Friday afternoon.  It was located on Spring Mountain Rd near S Decatur Blvd in Las Vegas in a small strip mall.  They were packed with almost all Asian customers speaking their native tongue.  The noise level was extremely loud.  I was hoping to make a phone call while dining, but there was no way I could talk on the phone.

The server came up to me speaking Chinese. I don't speak or understand Chinese.   I looked at him and asked him for some water and tea.

A cart came around a few minutes later.  I pointed to the Shiu Mai and Shrimp Har Gow. The 4 Shiu Mai had the red fish eggs on top.  The items on the cart were steaming, but this dish was luke warm.  The 4 Shrimp Har Gow had whole and chopped pieces of shrimp.

The 2 Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf (Loh Mai Gai) were flavorful.  They were generously filled with with chicken, Chinese mushroom, Chinese sausage, scallions, and dried shrimp.  They were one of the best I've had in a long time.

The 3 Deep-fried glutinous rice dumpling with pork (Haam Sui Gau):were hot and freshly fried.  They were stuffed with pork and dried shrimp and even some Chinese sausage.  

The Steamed Pork Spare Ribs with Black Bean Sauce had little cubes of acorn squash which was different.

The 3 Baked Sweet Buns had no filling.  I would not order them again.

The 3 Custard Tarts (Dot Tot) had lots of crust.  It was a little on the soggy side and the custard was a little too soft.

I was able to get a couple of To Go boxes and the check without too much difficulty. I would come back since this is where the natives go but the noise level was something else.
