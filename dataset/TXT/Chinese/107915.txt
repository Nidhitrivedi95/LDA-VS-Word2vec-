lEtpTFWetCf6xnzeImLiHg We've had both dine in and take out from Mr. Chao's. 99% of the food is wonderful and the staff is so friendly. The only thing on the menu I wouldn't order again is the orange chicken. It was suuuuuper bitter and not my thing. I'd say other than that, this is the best Asian restaurant in the area
