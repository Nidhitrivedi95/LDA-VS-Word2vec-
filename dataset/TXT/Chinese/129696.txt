pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Since the girlfriends and I were craving sushi while staying at the Palazzo, we decided to check Sushisamba out.  We stopped in for a late lunch and I ordered the grilled eggplant, and the pacific roll.  The grilled eggplant was grilled to perfection and drenched in this sweet teriyaki type glaze.  It was amazingly good.  In fact I think they should make that by itself  main dish. The pacific roll was also very very good, the sushi was high quality and a good size.  

Not only was the food fantastic but the customer service was GREAT.  The server accidentally spilled sauce on me (just on my leg and thankfully it didn't get on my clothes).  He profusely apologized and I told them not to worry about it.  Next thing I know, the girls and are were bought out an extra dish of scallops with a creamy pesto sauce on the house.  Apparently it was a chef special and not even offered on the menu, and it was fantastic.  The scallop was cooked to perfection...succulent and juicy and the pesto sauce on it was equally as amazing.  It was SO good in fact we went back the next day, and when we asked about that dish again since it was off menu, they were soo happy we came back and liked it, they gave it again to us free!  

Excellent customer service, high quality food, and free perks!  That's my kinda establishment.  Very happy and pleased with our experience, we will definitely be back.
