FJNzBAHuJbAiQCdhIdPQjA I have been here many times for take out. It is a typical Chinese Fast Food joint.
So you can expect plenty of deep fried goodness and grease. Otherwise you are in the wrong place.

I usually go for their set combos which are a great value as they pack the combos with a ton of food. I have also tried their Cantonese fried noodles and pad thai, it is passable; as I mentioned before; this is not a 5 star restaurant. It is a fast food joint.
But the food is rather decent and well priced.

It fits the bill for me whenever I am in the mood for some General Tao chicken, lemon chicken, egg roll and chicken fried rice.
