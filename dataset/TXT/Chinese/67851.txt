EnOCjP3wBpoICvEZXil4Cg Thank you for being open on Christmas and for serving us an unforgettable meal! A bunch of us gathered here, ordered lots of dishes and passed them around on the lazy Susan. The highlights were the dumplings (of course), crispy eggplant, dan dan noodles and bok choy. Some adventurous friends had fun ordering jellyfish and pig intestine (much like calamari, they said.) The scallion pancakes were also delicious and we left feeling very full and happy. Merry Christmas!
