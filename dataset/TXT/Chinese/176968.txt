WTuBrN0z2h7xvTaP7eN_XA I was excited to try out a new dim sum place, since a lot of them have been feeling the same for me lately. Overall, this place does have a better menu than most, but with a more interesting menu comes an increase in average price as well, since the unique items also use pricier ingredients (so very few s items, mainly m,l xl, or sp). Food is alright, Some items, like the chicken feet are quite yummy, while the baos in general seem to be really disappointing with a tough dough and minimal filling. Service wise is quite polite. They forgot our tea, but kept apologizing about it whereas the typical waiter at a dim sum restaurant would have just been like, "oh..ok, here it is" and walk off. However despite their politeness, servers are still quite slow, which I can forgive if he place was packed, but there were only 5 tables, so we shouldn't have strained ourselves as much as we did to ask for the bill. Overall, an alright dim sum place, but certainly not some where to go go out of your way for.
