GeZiOW34ZL6jC9g-mq9QvA I just moved to the Broadview area, so I blindly picked Hop Hing to satisfy my Chinese craving! In my opinion, this is one of the best Chinese take out places that I've had. I got the chicken with garlic sauce (not spicy because imma huge baby) and it was very good, the chicken was very tender and there was a decent amount of sauce on the food! The rice was perfect as well in my opinion. 

There are a few tables inside but it seems like they primarily do takeout. Also they have a $10 credit card minimum (that I didn't know about but the woman kindly ran my card anyway) just so you know. 

Overall, I'm very happy with my food and the service!
