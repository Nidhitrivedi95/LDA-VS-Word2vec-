Bp7Qj64Qr8jvj3r7WBtmSg I've been coming here since I was a child, and I can honestly say I've never had any bad experiences with anything. 

The BBQ pork and roasted pork is the best I've ever had, another noteworthy dish is the spicy fried squid which is an excellent choice. Something I've noticed however is that for some reason they tend to bring the white rice out close to the end of our meal. 

The food quality is similar to Emerald's (which is good), but at a more affordable price.
Overall great place, best Chinese restaurant in the Mississauga area!
