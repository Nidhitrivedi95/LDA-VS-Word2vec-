n2sA7raIheUCgBq14Vlt5w Long Wongs has the most amazing wings! They are crispy and saucy. My husband and I went with two friends that recommend Long Wongs to us. We got wings and pizza. I didn't like the pizza but the wings are definitely worth the 5 stars. When you go into any Long Wong restaurant you may think it looks not so nice but the wings are worth it. We got the suicide and the hot. The suicide are very hot like the kinda of hot that your nose turns red and water but the have good taste. The hot are very hot as well not as hot as the suicide but close. We really enjoyed are wings! I don't think I will be getting wings anywhere eles.
