3l_rMuRs97IKEA1DCZokOA This was the worst Chinese restaurant my family and I have been to. After spending over $70 on three meals, we left hungry and went for pho after.

We ordered the double green onion and ginger lobster, fried rice noodle with beef, clams in black bean sauce, and seafood chow mein. The portions were small and expensive for the amount received. It didn't seem as if there was actually two lobsters for our lobster dish. They ran out of rice noodles so we never got that. 70% of the clams were empty. The chow mein was average and it barely fed the five of us. Service was pretty bad as well. We asked one of the servers for a coke and she points to another person. But that same woman brought our dishes to the table.

Worse experience ever. Don't waste your money here.
