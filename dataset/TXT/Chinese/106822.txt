L2FZfel378lIpeqFrhX1lg I realize that this chinese fast food "restaurant" is in the middle of the MGM hotel walkway and it caters to the foreigners so it's not truly authentic.  I get it.  But where does it say that just because it's not authentic chinese food it has to taste like crap?  The chow mein is tasteless and has way too much bean sprouts.  The mushroom chicken & broccoli beef are both missing flavor.  Yes, it's relatively cheap (1 item combo for $4.99) compared to other places like Nathan's (2 hot dogs, fries & a drink for $8???), but is it really worth it?

My other gripe was I ordered to go and they gave me this HUGE container and gave me stingy amounts of food.  It looked like a stingy portion because the freakin container was so huge.  Here's a tip Studio Wok: if you're going to give less portions, get smaller containers so it looks like you're giving more.
