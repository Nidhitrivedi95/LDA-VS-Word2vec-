URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg I love that we live so close to CC, because our friends from all over the valley come to eat at CC! I have never ordered anything I don't like. The Szechuan Shrimp is my favorite and you can never go wrong with some hot Jasmine tea. Also, the food always comes out so fast and because it's such a large restaurant we never have to wait. To top it all off, the lunch specials are amazing!
