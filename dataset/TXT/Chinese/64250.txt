e7M2GgkCfDYTxdPN1LL1sQ Been here twice now, both times the resturant was completely empty. The staff made a good effort, but alas they were unprofessional. The food was slightly less than mediocre, but it was prepared and served pretty quick. If you're looking for authentic and delectable Asian cuisine, this is not the place. But, if you're in the area and need a quick, reasonably priced meal with large portions Wai Wai is your gem.
