W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g Received a message from my daughter that she just read that the best Chinese restaurant in Arizona was near me.  So off I went to give it my opinion.  The service is very friendly but the place is small and in a strip center so you might miss it.  Look close and you will be rewarded.  I had the lunch special, great value, and had the kung pao chicken.  Enough spice to make it earn the hot logo and more than enough food on the plate.  I really enjoyed the soup.  Usually a lunch special comes with a throw away type soup but this one would have been great to order by a bowl full and enjoy as a meal.  I am glad I found it and I am glad I tried it and now I will enjoy trying more of the menu.
