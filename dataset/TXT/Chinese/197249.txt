zQlaDJqp3c_HAuYP5Ukk3w I've only eaten at Sun Chinese Dining for lunch, but every experience has been a good one! Lots of food for the price. I like that I get soup and salad before my entree. They do love the celery though! Each dish I've ordered including the egg flower soup is laced with celery. I like celery, but if you are not a fan then be sure to ask for them to tone it down.
