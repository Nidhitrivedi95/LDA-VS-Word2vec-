Not wanting to go to a buffet and over eat bland dishes...we thought we'd try this local place. Well...I wish we didn't! Although I am going to give them two stars for the cleanliness and friendly greeting...that's about where it ends. I tried the cashew chicken and my wife tried the sweet & sour chicken. I refuse to order a drink from places that only serve cans of over priced soda, but my wife had a .99 cent can of 7UP. As for the food...my dish was way too hot (still steaming 15 mins later, the chicken at times had globs of fat on it, and every so often I would find bits of other dishes in it. I ate about 1/3 of my large order and threw the rest out. My wife thought her sweet & sour chicken was so-so, and the rice that came with our order was very dry and tasteless. I want to close with the menu had NO General Tao or Sesame Chicken! Two very common staples! In closing the place is clean, and people nice, but you can do much better for even average Chinese food.
