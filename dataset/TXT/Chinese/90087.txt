IDPbmH1OIhEbb9OIQyDJgw This is my family's go-to Vegetarian spot, especially for some Bean Curd and Marinated Gluten..yes that doesn't sound appetizing in any way but it sure is good! It certainly looks dated from the inside, however they have a variety of vegetarian dishes as well as dim sum. 

We usually go with the Fried Taro Patties, which come in a circular shape of mashed taro, wrapped inside a roll of bean curd and deep fried, which tastes delicious when dipped into the Sweet and Sour sauce. Another one of my favourites are the Pan Fried Vegetable Buns, which are loaded with mushrooms. The Fried Noodles with Vegetables is simple but incredibly tasty as they add plenty of crunchy bean sprouts and mushrooms. One MUST ORDER dish here would be the Vegetable Spring Rolls which are huge and loaded with crisp veggies. These are nothing like the $1 for 10 you would get at the grocery store. The Fried Dough Fritter wrapped in Rice Noodle was poorly executed as you can tell from the picture and was super soggy and slimy. We also got the Fried Milk which is great as well. 

This is not a bad place to get some vegetarian food, as the staff are always very nice.
