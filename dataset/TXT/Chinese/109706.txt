The chef spins, stretches and slaps the dough on the counter. He then separates the dough into fresh noodle goodness. It certainly attracts a crowd!

You select from about 8 different options including, pork, beef chicken and vegetable. Portions are a decent size and priced between $7 - $9 per bowl.

This is probably the first time I tried freshly made Udon noodles and it really makes a difference. These are damn good noodles.

I ordered the vegetarian soup and it was served with Bok Choi, mushrooms and lot's of green onion. I thought the broth was slightly oily but still good overall. 

I will be back the next time I'm in Montreal to try some of the other options.

PS - If you sit near the restaurant, it gets very LOUD. The dough is slammed against the counter over and over again, it actually scared me a few times.
