Cdywb13_07M1_g3U85VKTA I returned for the Moo Goo Gai Pan.  Always a treat.  This time got the Wor Won Ton Soup for $5.25 that feeds two.  Broth is well flavored but salty.  Just enjoy the wealth of ingredients:  broccoli, cabbage, snow peas, baby corn, shrimp, won ton, char shiu pork, carrots, mushrooms and white meat chicken!  Mmmm....
