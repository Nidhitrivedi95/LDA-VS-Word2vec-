Kw06PxDkF8gNMVWntmBKTw I came here for lunch today with my boyfriend and as soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated right away.  As we looked through the menu, our server waited patiently close by.  When we were ready, she came over immediately and took our order.

We both ordered the wonton noodles and a side dish of Chinese greens with oyster sauce and... Wow!  Our order came out in less than one minute!

The greens were what you'd typically expect - Nothing exciting but still good.  Each bowl of wonton noodles came with 4 big wonton dumplings and a little bit of green onions in the soup.  My boyfriend unfortunately bit into a piece of shrimp tail that was stuck in one of the dumplings.  This could have been dangerous as he usually swallows the whole dumpling in one big gulp!  LOL...

I noticed that they serve the noodles in plastic bowls.  Although they also use plastic plates and chopsticks like many Chinese restaurants, I would have preferred that they used something "longer-lasting" and "heat-resistant" like ceramic or porcelain.

On the other hand, when we paid our bill at the cashier, I noticed they were selling their own hot chili oil in glass mason jars, which I think is good.  I usually see hot chili oil sold in plastic jars.  (Obviously, I'm not a big fan of plastics but that's just me!)

In summary, the service was friendly and the food came out super fast!  We both thought the wonton noodles were very satisfying.  Can't wait to come back again next time.
