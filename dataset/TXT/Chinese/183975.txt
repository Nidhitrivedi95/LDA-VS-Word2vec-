XUDOc980cjB0PZvVS-T6Eg I've been here many times before and always had some great meals. However this time was different. Started off with an order of sushi and dumplings for an appetizer. It took almost 45 minutes for the sushi. And then when it finally did come out it wasn't even correct. I even argued with the server explaining that my tuna avocado roll was not the same thing as a crunchy spicy tuna roll. After arguing with him he just apologized and that was it. 

Our meal however was also just not that good. The best item that we ordered was the all white meat general sows which I think they do very well there and is a little bit sweet. The server also made an error with another order regarding the tofu. They did however offer to make us another one. But at that point we were just ready to finish our meal and get going. They did also offered to comp the tofu which was nice but did nothing with the sushi error.

I think the one in Wexford is always better it would not hesitate trying that one but probably going to stay away from Fox Chapel for a little while.

The worst part of the experience was the entire next day. I was sick in bed all day the next day with stomach cramps which I'm guessing was from the sushi. I was the only one out of our group that had sushi and within one hour after eating the sushi was not feeling well.

The service there is just not match the cost of their meals. I feel that at that price point you should be getting much better service.
