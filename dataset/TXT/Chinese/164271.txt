UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ Hands down the BEST chinese food I've ever had, along with excellent service.

We started with the calamari, and were just blown away. These are not the sad little rings you see most places, oh no, these little beauties are 3-4 inches long, as thick as your thumb- and are cooked to perfection. No rubberiness here! 
Hubby got thai basil chicken. Beautifully flavored in a rich, spicy sauce, with chicken so mouthwateringly tender it could be cut with a spoon.
I got the tres amigos, which is served fajita style on a cast iron skillet. Same mouthwateringly succulent chicken, but with equally tender shrimp and beef tossed with snowpeas, baby corn, carrots, and a few other veggies in a rich brown sauce.
While we were eating, the owner's wife came over and asked how we were liking everything, and asked if we'd like to try a sample of general yang's chicken. Of course we said yes! A few minutes later, we experenced the culinary masterpiece that is yang's. Same super tender chicken with extremely light breading- just enough that you get a lovely crunch as you bite down, and covered in szechwan sauce.
Everything was perfect, and we are going back tonight for more!
