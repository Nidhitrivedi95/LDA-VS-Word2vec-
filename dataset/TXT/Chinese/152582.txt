T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw I came to las Vegas for a yearly convention and during that time I was invited to have dinner with friends and they brought me to Las Vegas.

for starters the first impression of Las Vegas was intense when I came for the first time then my friends  showed me the great side of it.... the suburvia side.

We walked in and we immediately were greeted...I love that sometime some places they just ignore you until they want to say hi!

We were told that the wait time was a few minutes so we hit the bar.. we requested afew drink and they were pretty loaded... as per  every drink you have in vegas is heavy loaded....

in not time were were having lunch the food and service was really good...I know that this is another chain but I would totally recommend this place, in any citie I'm in I would look for one if I feel the desire for a chinese Bistro.
