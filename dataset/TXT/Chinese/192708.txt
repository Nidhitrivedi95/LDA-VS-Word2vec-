z9lOfnUorcbWR_xS0DSeHw Mediocre Chinese restaurant in Madison. Cliff and I came here for a cheat meal after a long cleanse. 

We ordered the black pepper deep fried chicken, garlic eggplant, and a seafood soup. 

The chicken was very disappointing; normally, chinese restaurants fry this chicken dish by the whole, but Fugu skimped out. They gave us the nasty little  parts of the chicken (including cartilage and god knows what else), heavily battered them, and fried them - so each bite consisted of crunchy dough and oil. A few pieces into the dish I started to question if they were even serving me actual chicken. 

The seafood soup was a miss. It was heavily salted and tasted as if they dumped frozen seafood inside an msg loaded broth. 

The eggplant was the only decent dish. I tasted sweet chili sauce more than anything else (didn't taste the garlic at all, so the name was misleading). Though it actually made me want to finish my rice. 

Aside from everything else, I feel like Fugu needs to chill with the red chili peppers and hot chili oil. They drench that in every single goddamn dish that when you finish and look at the plate, you realize that half of it consisted of red peppers.
