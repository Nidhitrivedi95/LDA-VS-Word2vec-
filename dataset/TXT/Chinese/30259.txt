I've been to Ming's Noodle Cafe over ten years ago, but haven't bothered returning as I'm not frequently in the area. After successive poor experiences at its sister branch of Kitchen M, I decided to return here and see if I can relive what used to be a great HK style cafe today.

I had the baked seafood and penne with rose sauce, which came with a starter soup and salad. The cream soup that they have is decent; it's actually quite creamy, which isn't like the watered down versions you get in most HK style cafes. The salad didn't have a lot of sauce in it, but was otherwise okay.

The main course came relatively quick. The presentation looked quite good, but upon first dib I realized the rose sauce didn't really taste like rose sauce, but more like the cream sauce from the cream soup. It still tasted okay, but it wasn't exactly what I intended for it to taste at the end.

Service was not the best, as the server I had needed to ask what my order was at least twice, even though she wrote it down. Not sure why she needed to do that, unless she was afraid that she wrote it wrong...

I likely won't return here since there are better options in the area now.
