pyZkGdnTwpRh5tFWfdmQEg Remember that Seinfeld episode where Elaine is on a frozen yogurt kick because she thinks that it's really healthy but when her pants get too tight has Kramer run a calorie analysis on it only to discover that there are way more calories in it than she thought? I wish I knew Kramer so he could do the same for the Thai curry noodles I just ate from Chins. The website says there are 251 calories in this thing, but there's no way that's true. Is it? It tasted like at least 550 calories. Maybe I misread the nutritional statement. After all, at one point in my life I was eating at Taco Bell every week believing the bean burrito had 180 calories only to discover many months later that it was really 180 grams and like 400 calories.

But whatever, who cares. It was pretty decent regardless of the # of calories. The veggies were fresh and crisp and though the two little peppers next to it on the menu board made me believe it was going to be spicier than it was, it was fine; about what you'd expect from a fast casual fusion restaurant. The Thai spring roll though, that was disgusting (and 194 calories if you care).
