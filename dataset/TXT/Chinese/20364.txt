5z-kd3h50BnaE1Ee8GV5bg This is the greatest dirty Chinese Food in Phoenix, nay anywhere! I have not been proven wrong yet.

As a customer experience, it is deeply flawed. 
- Yes, the staff is rude. I have seen them argue with customers before. My uncle was once kicked out for eating too much (to be fair, he is really fat). 
- Yes, the bathroom looks like something out of the scariest of scary movies. 
- Yes, the staff will bitch at you for asking for too much of a given product on a take out plate. 

However, the big thing here is FLAVOR, and I have not found a tastier place. Just haven't. Trust me, I've tried. I would love to have this restaurant with amazing service (and it would be so awesome I would never leave) but that is not a reality I can attain unfortunately. 

For now, I'll get reprimanded for asking for too much Crab Puffs and enjoy the bliss that is overindulging in amazing dirty Chinese Food!
