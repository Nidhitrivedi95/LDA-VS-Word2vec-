TetRSApdg8YUcQ-WvDyU8g My parents bought me to this place, and it's our new go to dim sum place in Markham and Richmond Hill. The dim sums are very fresh, well made and tasty. They were running a promo and all dim sums were $1.99 flat from Monday to Friday 9 am to 3 pm. The dim sum menu is in both Chinese and English. The staff were quick and friendly. This place is a bit of an unknown, so we never have to wait for a table.  I honestly cannot recommend another restaurant with dim sum of this quality, and cheap as well. Definitely check this place out for your next dim sum outing!
