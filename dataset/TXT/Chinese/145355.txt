S_5s_J6Mrii2cAi4ylK30w My parents lived in Yunnan for 10 years and this is definitely NOT authentic. That normally wouldn't bother me as long as the food still tastes good. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. We tried a variety of noodle soups and none were great. All of the soup bases were bland. We had to put a ton of salt in even tho we typically eat quite light. 

Worst part is, the woman in charge (manager?) had an awful attitude and no concept of service :/ it was a sub par meal to say the least.
