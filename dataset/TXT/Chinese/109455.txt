lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA Great food- I wasn't sure if the value would be there but was amazed at the pot stickers. 

Service was prompt- there when you needed them and not when you didn't. 

Main coarse was Kung Pao and Pan Fried noodle. The Kung pao was amazing, great quality of food and amazing sauce. They managed to cram a lot of flavor in there.

The pan fried noodle wasn't what I was expecting but was good although it was over shadowed by the  Kung Pao by nature of what it was. Still very good.

I would go back and try more on the menu.
