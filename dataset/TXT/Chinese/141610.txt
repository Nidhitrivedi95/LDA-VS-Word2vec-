rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g This is my 2nd review of Flamingo Palace. This would be my first time getting to-go from this place. As usual, blown away by the service. I arrived and my food was ready and waiting for me. $23 for Sweet & Sour Pork, Pork Chowmein, White Rice and Egg Flour Soup. Enough for 2 people for two nights, or 1 person for 4 nights. Not a bad deal :) Even got a little Tupperware container for the soup that was reusable.

as usual great service. If you want authentic great Chinese and a friendly atmosphere, GO HERE :)
