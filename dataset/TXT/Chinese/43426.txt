bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog this has been my craving ever since I first tried this place out. it's currently my favorite place at the moment which is surprising because I'm a little b---h when it comes to spicy things. 

the staff is a little bit awkward, but are attentive and very helpful. the place itself is small and clean. the drawings and messages past customers write are very cute and unique. 

food: so my boyfriend hates the numbing spice. I don't mind spicy but my stomach minds it. a lot. so every time we order, he requests no numbing spice and I request less spicy. both of us are content with our foods every single time! my favorite item is the house beef noodle less spicy and it's the perfect amount of spice for me every time. 

also, I could live off of that mung bean soup. I'm not kidding. it pairs with their noodles so well. I just can't. 

the only thing we were slightly disappointed in was the steamed egg because it had little to no flavor. the texture was amazing, but it was pretty "eh" to us. but that's ok, I just want noodles and soup and we good.
