nV8mDMin6c964MgjK6JZgg Chicken and duck congee was very good. Grilled lo bok go was alright. Noodle with tendon was good. Waited half an hour for the chicken and Chinese sausage hot pot, but it came undercooked, so we sent it back to the kitchen. After waiting another 20 minutes, we could wait no longer and decided to leave. Asked the cashier to take the hot pot off the bill, but had to argue with her for a few minutes before she would do so.

Was able to connect to their WiFi, but was not able to connect to any websites with it.
