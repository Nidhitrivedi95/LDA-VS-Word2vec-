MEN: Have a weigh in for a fight tomorrow in the UFC and are currently 5-7 pounds over your weight class and don't want to be docked points on the score card? Come to the Tropicana Panda Express located near the Bank of America and order the Fire Cracker Chicken.

I usually don't review fast food restaurants because everyone's been there and already have their own opinions but I had a unique experience at the one on Tropicana...

Had the fire cracker chicken and it tasted excellent. Portions are small and the place makes 2000% profit on white rice (which I usually don't get) charging $2 for something that costs a dime to make, no thanks.

The real fun began about 30 minutes after the meal. Explosive diarrhea (from bad chicken, I presume) that had me running to the bathroom a dozen times in a 4 hour period til there was nothing left in my stomach.

...and to me that earns a 3-star "A-OK"

Casino pools are due to open soon and I can now see my abs in the mirror. I may specifically visit this location the night before I'm due to spend a day in California at the beach or if I have friends in town who want to visit the casino pool..

Plus you get quality alone time away from your girlfriend/boyfriend to comb facebook and play candy crush on your smart phone while you are locked away in the bathroom for 30 minutes.
