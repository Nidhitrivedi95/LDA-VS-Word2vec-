VDdX2TGa9hNHwjzrnVSC_A A visit to this tea room is a must. 

Vintage wooden furniture, shelves upon shelves of different clay and porcelain tea sets, and walls of teas from all over Asia. If you are not a huge tea lover then it is still worth it to have a peak inside if you are in the area. 

You can order tea (with a small selection of dim sum type foods) or just buy tea leaves to go. The prices for tea ranged from $14 - $30 per 100g. They have a menu list of teas and will let you smell each one but do not expect them to actually know anything about the teas. Any question I had about things like health benefits, food pairing, caffeine levels, etc. went unanswered. Overall a cute gem in old Montreal!
