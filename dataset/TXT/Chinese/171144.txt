vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA This is probably one of the best dimsum place in the USA. We went there for lunch and ordered the most amazing dim sum from the cart lady. They can speak minimal English but the taste is so authentic and worth the long queue. Don't bother ordering from the lunch menu. GET THE DIMSUM!!!
