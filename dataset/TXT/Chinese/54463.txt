csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA Definitely one of my favorite places in the area. The vegetable roll is simply amazing.

The vegan rice bowl was also great - especially with the sauce they give you as a side. I just dumped it right in and mixed it up.

I also had the Popeye Noodle bowl (on my second visit) and did not regret it. Tasty and warm - and very filling. 

The take-out waiting area (a separate door) could use a few more seats and the bathroom could use some sprucing up - but overall - this place is fantastic and I wish we had something like it in my hometown.
