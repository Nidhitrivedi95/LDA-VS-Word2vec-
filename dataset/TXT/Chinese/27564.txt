8cjXEmuqgCbIRudb2D52qw I fell in love with dim sum when I lived in NYC.  The only time I was able to find it was visiting bigger cities.  But now it's in Madison!!!  Nani is very tasty and fresh.  Don't let the outside of the restaurant deter you.  The inside is very clean.  It's nicely furnished.  

Ok, the food!  DElish!  We ordered 7 apps because we wanted to try so many.  The stir fried sticky rice was great.  I loved the peanuts in the rice.  It was very sticky.  The BBQ pork bun was wonderfully doughy.  The shrimp rolls were perfect and full of shrimp.  We also got a couple different dumplings and the short rib with pepper sauce.  I could have drank the pepper sauce.  The jumbo sesame balls were a great dessert to finish off.  The red bean paste was nice and sweet.  

All the apps weren't brought out together which I was pleased about.  Everything was very hot, not warm from sitting around.  The waitstaff was attentive if we need anything and regularly came around to fill up our water.  Considering everything we ordered, it was under $40 and we got leftovers. 

I cannot wait to go back!!!
