DvelUmIuBmfbt95frynYsA Tried this place out a few times and you will always walk out full and satisfied. Most of their dishes are fresh, big, and hot! If you go there for the ambience/ service, go elsewhere. Their northern style charcoal BBQ on a skewer is pretty good and I am sure it goes well with their cheap beers. I haven't yet tried their BBQ "BULL PENIS" but I am sure it might suit others. You have to try out the BBQ chicken wings on a skewers! It tasted so good and crispy. Dumpling is so-so and I have had better. I like their noodle selection as their have the ones with soup and the "lo mein" style as well. They made their noodles extra spicy so you might have to ask them to tone it down on the spiciness if you can't handle it.
