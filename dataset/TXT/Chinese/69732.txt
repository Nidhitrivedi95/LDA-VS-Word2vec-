F_D-hssVHgarfpqWbFdXow This is probably my third time to this manderin location not far from where I live..First like most manderins the hospitality is top notch when welcoming people.. Food wise it's always fresh lots to choose from especially on weekends, but you'll pay for that which includes seafood.. 
I came for lunch at half the price and there was plenty to choose from salad bar, main courses to desert all there.. 
Not sure why Brampton always charges an extra $1 per person tho..
