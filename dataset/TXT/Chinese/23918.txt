6z-T_jIFrRQ4c6-BIvVBvA - legit Chinese joint in a very odd neighborhood.
- am consistently surprised to see this place full of chinese folks - which confirms the legit-ness
- their house congee (salmon, shrimp. surf clam, grouper, and other seafood) is a steal at 5.95 for a bowl that can serve at least 2 people.
