5PcW2QipC23t_g71rdCCcw I'm really unimpressed with this place and not just because of decor. 

Service here is the typical no frills type. Not a problem if you're used to it.
Prices are average for a Chinese restaurant. What irks me is that their portion sizes are smaller than what I would find at other restaurants (if we were to compare to the other Chinese restaurant in this plaza, that one would have bigger portions). Maybe it's the fact that they put the food on such huge plates that it makes the food seem minuscule, but it just seemed off to me. Despite the size though, most of the food was tasty. 

I wish I could give this place a three star, but honestly, there are better places around.
