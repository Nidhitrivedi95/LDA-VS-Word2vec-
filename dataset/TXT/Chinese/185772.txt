Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw Tried this last night with the fam w/ a Groupon. Was pleasantly surprised. Mongolian beef, orange chicken and king pao chicken were very good!! Definitely would order those again. The lo mein and egg foo young were ehh... not the best but NOT the worse. Was VERY pricey though. Would go back but not without another coupon.
