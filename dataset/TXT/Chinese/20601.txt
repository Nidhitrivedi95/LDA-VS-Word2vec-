6_7_aSycZlRsfKENFiIi6g Best Chinese food in the area and they have a pretty wide delivery range.  They are always super friendly.  Food has never been anything less than piping hot. The restaurant is super clean and you can see into the back clean, well organized kitchen.  They also have a drive thru. 
I love that you can order a lunch portion even though it's dinner time.  They always have deals going on to get free add on's with your order.  
I gladly drive past a dozen other Chinese restaurants to come to this one.
