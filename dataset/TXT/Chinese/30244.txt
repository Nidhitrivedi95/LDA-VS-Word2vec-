98gLNkYYJCg4f_uJ7o2wBg The only reason I'm giving this a bad review is because of the woman who took my order and remained on her phone the entire time she was talking to me, taking my credit card, running it and handing it back to me. I've been in the service industry my entire life, and nothing annoys me more than someone who couldn't care less about their guest/customer. You give full attention to the person with whom you're doing business. Staying on your phone sends the clear message that you can't really be bothered with anything else. It's incredibly rude and insensitive. AND, she missed out on a good tip, which I always leave. 

However, the service up to this point has always been great. Everyone else I've had dealings with has been respectful and courteous. The food is also good, and I'll be back...just not when the lady in bright pink is there. Thanks to the rest of the staff for knowing what good service is about.
