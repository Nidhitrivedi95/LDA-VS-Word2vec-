qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A The only reason I'm giving PF Changs a 2 star is because of their egg drop soup. It was the only good thing my hubby and I ate. My husband ordered the Beef with Broccoli and said it was WAY too salty. I was excited to finally find a place that did lemon chicken the way I like it, but the lemon sauce was absolutely overpowering! The lemon sauce shouldn't be the only thing I taste, it should only enhance the taste of the chicken and broccoli. My husband and I didn't feel well after eating here, and will not be returning.
