ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ It's been two years since I've written a review about New City, and man... something has definitely changed about this place. 

I don't know if the chefs changed or if my taste buds have altered over the years, but they don't make their baked rice as good as I remember them to be! I usually get the baked rice with steak in tomato sauce. The sauce tasted bland and it didn't even taste like tomato at all??? Rather, it had a distinct taste to it that made me lose my appetite after the first bite. 

I also got the steak with rice in black pepper sauce. I understand I don't except some A-grade Wagyu beef quality steak, but I didn't expect to be served something surrounded with 90% fat & almost impossible to cut. (My hands were cramping by the end)

Of course, the prices have always stayed at a reasonable price & has been my main reason for coming back repeatedly.
