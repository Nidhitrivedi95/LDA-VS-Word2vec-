2BuiyGL0JbNjnc88fYH39Q I came here with my cousin for some winter hot pot action last night.

The first thing I noticed was how quick the service was, which is great. Especially since we ordered two rounds and needed that second round in, cooked and eaten before my stomach knew what was happening. 

The food itself was not bad, but not the best I've had. I liked their variety of vegetables and the fact that the servings were appropriate considering how many people we were. I've been to a couple of other places where they give you a giant order, no matter who's there. Then you end up eating a pound of beef, when I'd rather have just a small portion of many of things. 

I agree with Karl, the lamb was the best item we had. The hot chilli soup was deliciously spicy and flavourful, though I was missing the Szechuan peppercorns.

The place filled up by about 7pm, so be there early. 

Being that it seems to be the only Chinese hot pot restaurant in North York, I'm happy that it's decent. We'll be back again.
