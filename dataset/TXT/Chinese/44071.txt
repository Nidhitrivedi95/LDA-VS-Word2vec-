BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg Excellent food, something to suit a lot of taste buds!
Been here multiple times. Went for the classics, orange chicken and Kung Pao chicken as well as some of their signature dishes, loved them all!
Very conveniently located and great prices for the food. The portion is good and I generally end up taking some back for later
