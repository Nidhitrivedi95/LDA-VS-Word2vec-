B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA Awesome americanized Chinese food (which is what I like - guess i'm not a real foodie). Lunch has it: big portion, hot, quick and cheap ($6). The owner and waitress is super sweet and efficient.   Best of all this place is consistent - good every time ( I have been over 10x)! Not sure why consistency is always an issue when looking for good asian but this place is def the best!
