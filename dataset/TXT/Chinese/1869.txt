The staff is usually super friendly. Recently I was in there during the dinner rush and they gave my roll to another table, and then gave me their roll. The rolls were similar so my table ate it. The waiter got an attitude with us because we ate it, and kept glaring at my table for their mistake. Other than that isolated experience they are pretty good.
