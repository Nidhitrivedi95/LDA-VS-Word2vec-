osvcl7Fh_J5VwUikh5Vskg Worst HK style cafe in Toronto that I have visited thus far. Why did I go? Because it was conveniently located at the side of market village.

Service is minimal here. Sometimes they would even glance your way.. And then walk the opposite direction. Food here is also .. Meh. We were given french toast made out of DAYYYYSSS old bread. It was basically hard and had no fluff to it. They had to deep fry it so much to cover up the oldness as crunchiness.. It just tasted like something soggy that was deep fried. Was pretty disappointed. I've seen cheaper, older looking HK cafes do a whole lot better.

Noodles just had a ton of MSG. It took forever for us to ask for and for the waitress to bring us hot sauce. 

Don't think I will be coming back here.
