NMQb_TvWEOGkaZDrNC03wA I'm a regular customer here, because the food is quite good. But maybe not anymore.

But the tableware needs major improvements, both on the dishware themselves and the maintenance of them.

1) A lot of the dishes and cups are rusted. Literally, rust particles float around the water cup. And the dishes are so rusted away that I was afraid to put any food in it.

2) Most of their tableware are enamel-based. The cups/dishes were rusted probably because the enamel layer was taken off/broken/ melted away or whatever during the heavy commercial use. That's fine if they swiftly replace them with new ones. But they aren't doing so. 
It's well known that damaged enamel-based dishes release heavy metal elements, such as lead, based on what they're  made of (it's usually some kind of metal). They are potentially carcinogenic, and also cause Alzheimer's and dementia. 

And at this stage , it's obvious that  their cups and dishes are so heavily damaged to the point of being rusty. You don't want to ruin your good food with such terrible dishware.

3) The cups and dishes were filthy. I was horrified to see such a lot of dried food particles stuck on the dishes.

And what made me write this review? I mentioned all these to the cashier and what I heard was: 
"So what? That's the way it is". With a shrug.

Well ok, you just lost a regular customer.
