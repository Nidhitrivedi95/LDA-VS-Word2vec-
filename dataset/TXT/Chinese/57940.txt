D9bf5U0y_0MnL9wMFc4bKQ Decent. Nice. Asian-Jewish fusion.

Best part: the 45 day aged Australian wagyu. Meat succulent, super tender and flavorful on the inside with a great tasting seat on top. Impressed by the accompanying tempura too. Well done.

Worst part: rancid mildew smell that soaked through the menus. Very off-putting.

Everything else: pretty decent, from the ambiance to the fried tongue sandwich, Peking duck, tofu, and whitefish salad dish.

Then why a meh review? Because our share for two came out to $127. I get that price shouldn't drive reviews, but at the same time, this was just a bridge too far.
