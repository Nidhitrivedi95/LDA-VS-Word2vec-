dCX6CvWGn8oiPSD_yxrm0Q Yummy in short.  We ordered egg rolls, steamed dumplings, chicken fried rice and beef and broccoli using the grubhub app.  The food arrived at our hotel quickly, hot and with all the sauces and silverware.  I was surprised on how good the food was, it was actually good.  Next time I'm visiting Tempe and too tired to eat out this will definitely be my first choice!
