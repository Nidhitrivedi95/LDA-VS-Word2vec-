OIw3415Pgh2_5eNPCiIN8A We (inclusive of myself, my mother and husband) sat in a booth and were promptly greeted by a male server. We ordered beverages followed by some dinner items. About 10 minutes into our meals my husband received a phone call and needed to step out, he returned approximately 40 minutes later and was unimpressed to find us sitting with the same plates we had when he left. Our server had not returned to our table although he had walked by on at least 2 occasions. On the third I called to him and asked if we could order again, to which he obliged. Our food was brought out to us by a young woman, who refrained from taking the dirty plates piled on our table. About 15 minutes passes and our drinks are empty and servers are again nowhere to be found. I walked to the back of house area and asked for someone to come to our table. A young girl then came out, took our dessert order and removed the plates from our table as per our request. I then asked if there was a manager on duty that I could speak with regarding our lackluster dining experience. The 'manager' who presented herself was the same young woman who had brought us entrees earlier without clearing our used plates. I asked her if there was a manager I could speak with and her response was a catty, rude and obnoxious, "WHY?" . I explained to her that the service we received was less than acceptable and she shrugged. When I explained my dismay for an Asian inspired restaurant playing an hour and a half of Miley Cyrus music containing offensive language (did you know she has a song called "bitch"? I can only assume that is the name of the song considering how many times it came up), the restaurant representative then retorted with, "So? we always play the top 40. Who cares?" *** Side note here, top 40 has censorship rules about offensive language and I find it hard to believe since at one point we heard the music being shuffled through.                  I finalized my invigorating conversation with the server by requesting contact information for your manager to which i was told he/she has none. No phone number, email or name. Interesting.                       Feeling frustrated and annoyed, we handed the server 120$ cash for our 106$ bill and she stomped off. After waiting yet another 15 minutes we realized that she was not returning with our change and left. I do not have a copy of our receipt since it was not returned to us. Horrible experience, will not be returning or recommending this restaurant.... And I'm still waiting for response from them regarding our dinner and change that wasn't returned.
