JDWhkcJHNGX-KY0bOLcodQ On my second quest of the day, finding the best Singapore noodles in this mall.

I used to come to the mall as a kid and that's when I first started loving Singapore noodles/vermicelli.

I ordered Singapore style vermicelli (who would've guessed). It took a bit longer than most places to get my food, but that was ok. They weren't particularly friendly either, but we probably look like gweilo in an Asian mall.

Overall in flavour it was good, just a bit spicy, curry throughout and salty enough. The bbq pork bits were good and so was the egg. The downside was the pepper strips, as I'm not a fan of that in singapore noodles and the bell pepper flavour that it adds to the dish. Big portion though, so I can't complain that much.

I wouldn't go back, it was good, but not the best.
