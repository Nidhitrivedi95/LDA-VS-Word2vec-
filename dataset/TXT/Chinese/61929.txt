dvbcUnKv2awsIxog7dO4vw I've been here before and after the renovation and this place got a huge face lift in the terms of looks and cleanliness. 

Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a typical HK style cafe that is located in Chinatown. I usually eat here for lunch and everyday, they usually have a three different daily specials. For the price you pay for the daily special, you definitely get a lot to eat.  It comes with a drink, soup and the main entree. The HK milk tea is pretty good at this place. The soup is just ok and the daily special entrees usually come with meat (beef, chicken, pork), a side of pasta or rice, and vegetables.
 
Overall, after the renovation, this place looks a lot more appealing in terms of decor and cleanliness on the outside. Cheap and good.
