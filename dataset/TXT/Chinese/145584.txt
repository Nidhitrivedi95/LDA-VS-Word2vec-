S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ I do believe this is my second review for Hue Thai. Well at least maybe this one can be for their new sign that they put up. Although, it may not matter much.. I do like the old sign better..

Anyway.. The point of this review was mainly because I made a new discovery here. You can prolly say I'm the last to know, but all that matters is that I.. Got to experience it for myself. 

Here goes the BIG news! I ordered my usual grilled pork sandwich. It's been cold lately so, I've been thinking soup all week long.. I discovered, what is making my heart race at this very moment, THE CHICKEN COCONUT SOUP!! And here's the best part... Dipping my sandwich into the soup!

So, there it is... FIVE MORE gleaming stars for this place. That should be enough bling for you to try it already.
