hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA WORST buffet we have ever been to.  

We originally went here for the AYCE crab legs, but the crabs are a joke.  They're basically the crab shell and if you're lucky you will get a little crab meat if you search inside.  The rest of the food available in the buffet was nothing to talk about.

There are TWO main reasons we will NEVER EVER EVER go back here!

1)  There was a long, black hair found in my friend's house steak.  Neither of us have black hair, so obviously couldn't have been ours after we received our plates.  My friend was a little more compassionate to this, since she does work with food as well and we do have to consider it's a buffet with lots of people hovering over food throughout our visit, but still.

2)  After we found the hair in her food, she told the server about it.  His response was 'Ok.'  That was it!  Not an 'I'm sorry,' or 'Let me take the food away for you.'  This is what made the experience worse than the food.  The service is AWFUL.  Worst server I've ever had.  Even when he took our plates away before it seems like he was annoyed he even had to do his job and was rushing us to get out of there, which after we found the hair I didn't mind doing just that.

At the cashier, my friend complained about the hair in her food and the cashier was a little more apologetic for it and offered her a $3 discount.  I didn't get a discount at all.  I guess we were better off taking what we could get and getting out of there and never looking back!!

If you're looking for a good buffet with crab legs, don't waste your time here.  Pay the little bit of extra money and go to Palms or Rio
