qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w I grew up in NYC and have had the best Chinese food in NYC's Chinatown, as well as SF and LA.  This place is nothing like NY Chinese food, whose focus is on Cantonese or Hunan cuisine.

We had our food delivered.  We ordered 4 main dishes.  It was TERRIBLE.  One of our orders was a Shrimp dish, and the shrimp tasted really off.  Two other people who tasted it agreed, so we didn't eat it.  

As a result of the shrimp tasting bad, I called the restaurant and asked to speak to the manager.  He was immediately defensive, saying there was NOTHING wrong with the shrimp and that he had served hundreds of dishes that day.  He continued to argue.  I told him that I wanted to let him know just in case he had a bad batch.  He did not offer any kind of apology or anything else.  I had to insist that he refund our money for the Shrimp dish, which after 10 minutes of wrangling, he did reluctantly.  The beef dishes were bad as well with thin and stringy beef.  The Fried Rice was really greasy.

I do not understand another reviewer saying this is the best East Coast Chinese, when it is NOTHING like it.  The only thing good about this restaurant was that it was close and delivered.

I found a restaurant that is more like East Coast Chinese and it is "Food Express Chinese Restaurant".  The name doesn't say it, but the food DEFINITELY does.  

It is not in Summerlin, but it is not far.  I will go anywhere for quality Chinese food.  95 to Decatur to just past Oakey on the East side of Decatur.
