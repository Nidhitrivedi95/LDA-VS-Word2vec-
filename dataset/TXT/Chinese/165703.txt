v630GIZJUVlggrMSDLGclQ Horrible food and rude staff. It's so bad there that they out signs out saying if you fun the food is cold or not fresh to ask the waitress for a plate of new food to be brought to your table. Except none of the waitresses speak enough English for this. Our food was cold so we asked for a new serving as per the sign--the cook came out and said there was nothing wrong and that he didn't care. We asked to speak to a manager or owner, and were denied. If you want bad food and crazy staff, go here for sure.
