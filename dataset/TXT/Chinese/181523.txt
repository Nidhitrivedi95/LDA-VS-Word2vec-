xdphjWZymq-3dqOWmA_wwA Pretty good! It is more of a diner than a restaurant, and actually that is what it is supposed to be...they offer those great Taiwanese diner foods here. When it is filled with tons of Chinese speaking ASU students, you know the food is priced reasonably and is authentic. Will be back.
