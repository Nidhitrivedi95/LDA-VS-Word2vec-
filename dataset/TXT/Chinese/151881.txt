T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ Not a big fan of asian buffets but my mother wanted to try this place, it just opened near our house. 

Upon arriving, it seemed like a pretty clean place unlike a lot of buffets near our home. There's even a soothing little man made pond/fountain to the right once you walk in. The decor was pleasant on the eyes. 

It's pretty cheap price. We came on a Sunday for dinner which was roughly about 14$. It seemed pretty busy but got seated right away. I was surprised by how much food they had. They even had crab legs and crawfish that night! For the price of 14$ you can get AYCE crabs? I think that's quite a steal. 

I rated this place 2 stars because unfortunately the crabs was all that was appealing to me. The other foods all seemed bland and no flavor. The food looked like it was sitting there for a bit. The sushi I tried was all rice no fish in it.. And I'm not exaggerating, there literally was NO fish in it! One sushi I tried tasted like the fish they used was canned tuna.. YES, canned tuna! There was a place where you can pick veggies you wanted and the chef would satay it for you which I thought was pretty cool. 

My water didn't get refilled not once while I was there. The empty plates did get picked up right away. We only saw our server once and that was to bring out our waters. It's a buffet so I never expect to see the server a lot BUT at least check on our waters or see how we're doing.

Probably won't be returning. I think my mom liked the place. Unfortunately I wish I can say the same for my myself, but I can't.
