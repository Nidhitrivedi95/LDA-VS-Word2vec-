q_KQbgnaYDlPx8EHTydcBQ I would give it a 3.5 stars as the food quality and service has gone down the past year but since my boyfriend loves their deep fried chicken leg (as such, I do frequent quite often), I'll bump up my rating. 

This is a great place to go for their afternoon tea (11:00am - 5:30pm) as their food is quite reasonably priced especially for the quality you get. I would recommend you try: Baked Salted Chicken with Vegetable Rice in Bowl, Fish Cutlet Potato Salad, Tom Yum Noodle, Kiko Club Sandwich, and the Deep Fried Chicken Leg on Rice with Peppercorn Sauce. 

The downside is that it's a cash only place so it makes it more difficult for those who rely heavily on their credit/debit cards.
