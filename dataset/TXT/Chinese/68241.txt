eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ Very good lunch specials with unlimited egg rolls and soup when you dine in. The soup is always a bit too salty for my liking but the egg rolls are excellent. The other dishes, however, can be hit or miss. Tried the non lunch special beef pad see ew, which tastes pretty much the same no matter where you go, but it was overly greasy and I did not care for it. The service is always awesome though! But it can be a bit slow as they can be short staffed.
