xEIqG7Rq8ydAT9LxCVBOOg I go here often and really enjoy the blend of japanese and chinese cuisine. The food is excellent, but the service can be sketchy depending on who you get. Also, don't order an expensive bottle of wine. We did, and it tasted like vinegar. The manager would not provide us with a different bottle so it just sat there full. I've asked to return a bottle of wine perhaps twice in my entire lifetime, so I don't make a habit of doing so. Was very disappointed with the response we got that night.
