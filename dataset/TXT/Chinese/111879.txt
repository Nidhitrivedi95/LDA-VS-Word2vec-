I go back every time I'm in Oakland, and I get the tofu and broccoli with garlic sauce, and I am content. Yes, it's a ton and a half of rice, but the sauce is delicious, and you get plenty of tofu and broccoli for, you know, a week. Food comes quickly and it's always hot.
There's a cooler with cans and bottles of everything, there's plenty of seating, and the same dependable crappy music is always playing. And for all these bad reviews, there are always people there. Like I said, whenever I visit Pgh, I stop at Szechuan Express for a solid block of Chinese food.
