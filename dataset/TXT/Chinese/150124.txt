SRYM6FaIF6LuXldcC1PY8w Can't go wrong with PF! I'm weird when it comes to Asian and this place is consistently good! 

For apps I love the chicken lettuce wraps and the green beans ( small size is enough for two)! Main dish I always bounce between the veggie lo mein ( LOTS of veggies good crunch) and the crispy honey chicken! Main entree portions are big so my BF and I usually always split! 

For drinks I tried the red sangria, eh it was ok I tasted a weird after taste that my BF said was prob the orange in it --for 9.50$ eh I wouldn't get it again personally.  What I like best about PF Chang Is the constancy in my dishes and I have always gotten great service!
