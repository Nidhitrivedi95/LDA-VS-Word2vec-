iddR-Z7pwpp90Cu8SFJ3QA The dim sum here is the cleanest and least oily I've ever had. The food does take a little time to arrive since you mark down the items you want, and it's not the carts-style. The food is not greasy and not overly salted. Some would say it tastes plain, but they somehow made it flavourful without all the extra salt and grease. They also don't seem to use garlic in the dishes you would always find garlic in all other dim sum restaurants. Now I love garlic, but they were able to make the dim sum so good without it. Dishes like steamed tripe, beef and pork short ribs, etc. Their siumai however, isn't the greatest, it is too plain. The taste of siumai practically lives on the fat that is put in it, so the siu mai here, although very clean tasting, isn't very flavourful. The hargow is one of the best I've had in recent memory.
Service is pretty good. Since it is a very small place, you get what you ask for almost immediately. No women work here though, which is odd considering you mainly see women in other dim sum restaurants. I guess it's because it's family-owned? It's not a bad thing, just something I noticed. Maybe it was just that day we went.

CON: The variety here isn't great. They were missing staples like egg tarts and mango pudding. Dim Sum without egg tarts? The atmosphere here is not great either. It's almost soulless feeling inside. Not dirty, just not a lively place you would usually feel in other dim sum restaurants. I think maybe because it wasn't really packed. The prices aren't cheap either, but somewhat reasonable.
