EbgUkmDxPUa2fr0rc8EFJQ Not a big fan of American Chinese cuisine, but this makes the cut.

Place - hip, Asian fusion venue, that is classy yet hip in a way that gives the place a warm and inviting atmosphere. Definitely a crowd for family/friends outing. Bar is fun for friendly gathering for some sake bombs! Bartender very attentive and awesome!

Service - as mentioned, the bartender was attentive and I would def come back with my girls/guys for some fun drinks. The waiters/waitress was alright -- not bad, above average. They do tend to cater to my needs. On a busy night, it is harder for them. Also when it late towards closing, I don't see them being as attentive long. 

Food - ummm... Ok. I am biased. But being very nice, it is average. They do serve a large portion, and there is a wide selection of entrees! So anyone can find something that they want, whether its seafood, poultry, meat, veggie -- etc!

Yes, as I am such a fan of authentic Chinese restaurant, I'd come back. I like the atmosphere, the location, and the bartendering service!
