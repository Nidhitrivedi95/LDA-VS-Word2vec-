jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg Best kept secret in town. The Booming pot has new owners. They make you feel right at home. The food is excellent , the Beef Noodle soup , Marked Pork Wonton Soup and the Box Leek fried vermicelli dumpling is my absolute favorite. I eat Chinese food all the time and I recommend this place to anyone who wants great authentic Chinese food.
