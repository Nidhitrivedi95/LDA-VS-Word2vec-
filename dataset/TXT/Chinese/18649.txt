5FiuxRWs-indyk2Y9imkSg LOVE this place!!! Tho we may not understand what they are talking to each other they are usually very nice to us :) Its a small place with a few tables. We usually get our food to go and have had them deliver to us to.
This time we ordered the lunch specials of orange chicken spicey with pork fried rice and egg roll. My husband got the cashew chicken with pork fried rice and egg roll. No complaints freshly made, very tasteful with flavors and filling. The cashew chicken has some vegies cooked with it (zucchini, carrots and celery)
By the way they do have restrooms for customers and they are clean..
We will be back!!!
