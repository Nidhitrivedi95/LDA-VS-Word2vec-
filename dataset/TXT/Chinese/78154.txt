GIlFumyLyrKu-3xA_xZNQg Price was $11 per person, kids under 9 were $6. As soon as we approached the food you could tell the quality was poor. The counters were dirty and had been that way a while because it was dried and baked on the counter. The food was all mixed in with old, I'll just stop it was terrible. The flavor was terrible. The best part of this place was the soda with its taste of dirty tap water. Should have just gone to panda! I feel ripped off. Oh drinks are extra. I'm about to leave, I hope I don't get food poisoning, some seafood tasted off.
