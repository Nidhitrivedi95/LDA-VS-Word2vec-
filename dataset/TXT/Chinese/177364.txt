WWZgzuTn1k7Yn9bJ_Pr0Kg This has to be one of the worst chinese restaurants I have eaten at period.  As a sushi restaurant it is horrible as well.  The dishes come out with way too much sauce.  The sauce is not even a good flavor.  The shrimp has been cooked to the consistancy of a rubber tire.  Avoid this place at all costs.  If you want sushi and are thinking of coming here do yourself a huge favor and got to Yen Sushi Bar on 43rd and Bell Rd.  I have only had sushi as good as theirs on the east coast.
