aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg My favorite place for roast duck and crispy roasted pork in Vegas, better than SamWoo.  Cash only.

Cleaner than SamWoo but not by much.  The parking here is a little crazy since there is an unusual number of excellent restaurant in this little Plaza  (Hachi izakaya, China Mama, HK Star Cantonese food, District One Vietnamese to name a few).

You can either select items from the heated pre-made bins (with street style food) or order plates off the menu.  Again, the star here is the BBQ, so while there are fried rice and noodle plates, those are 3-4star dishes compared to the BBQ.
