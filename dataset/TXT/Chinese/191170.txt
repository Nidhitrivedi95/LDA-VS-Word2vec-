YSaf1x4Ik6nH2GsIa2DCvg South Sea is exactly what you expect and hope for in a North Americanized Chinese restaurant. All of the similar items are there on the menu. Though the General Tao chicken I'd say is above average. The chicken was moist and it wasn't tuff or overcooked. The Cantonese Chow Mein noodles had some crispness and weren't overly sauced. The tofu and vegetables seemed to have a hint of lemon. Overall the food tastes very clean and light compared to other Chinese restaurants with the same dishes. It's definitely not as  salty as other places I've experienced and I don't feel like I was hit by a truck of MSG.

Bonus points for also having reasonably priced combo plates. Which I have yet to try as we got take out. The delivery also arrived when they said it would and the food was nice and hot. Great to have a go to Chinese restaurant in the area.
