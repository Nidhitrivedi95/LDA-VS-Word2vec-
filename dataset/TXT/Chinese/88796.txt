i0u5CzG81LrEwAI0X5OVkQ The food was good and the prices were equally as good but nothing really spectacular about this place. We were able to pick two soups one appetizer three entrées and two desserts and this was called the two people can eat for $30 deal. It honestly was not bad it was nice that we got to pick between so many items but nothing was really spectacular. The soup was good and the appetizers were yummy, but the main courses were OK. Kung pow chicken is supposed to be breaded and fried but it was just thin strips of meat in a peanut type sauce. It was super spicy and didn't taste anything like the original. General tso's chicken was good but I felt like the breading was too much and it really made it quite chewy. We got some noodles and they were good but they barely had a taste there was chicken but it was almost tasteless I had to put my other chicken on this noodle to make it tasty.

Overall the meal was not bad and there was plenty of food maybe even enough for three or four people to eat. The dessert was decent but everything about this meal was just OK nothing spectacular. I could go back another time because the prices were so minimal
