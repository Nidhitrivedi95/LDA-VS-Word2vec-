SbwUKzeMlSZs-mQt0lOGQw We hosted a baby shower here and had a horrible experience. Poor service our table had no ice, no beer or soda and when we asked them for it them literally threw it at our table. The way staffs handled food was a hot mess..  didn't clean our plate on time and it kept piling up.
