KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ This place has been here for years, Im usually afraid to try new chinese places. Good size portions, lots of options, but food lacks flavor. The crab puffs should just be called cheese puffs no crab no flavor, sweet sour pork and teriyaki chicken same no flavor. One thing that was great was the service, the waitress was awesome. Dont think we'll be back
