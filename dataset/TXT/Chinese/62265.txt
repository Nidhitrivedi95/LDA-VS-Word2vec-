DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA This place was not bad in my opinion, but it was not that good compared to the Van Nuys one in Los Angeles. The prices were more expensive and the food quality was lower, and the chicken lo mein dish I got was just too greasy.

I guess this is a main part of the small Chinatown in Las Vegas, which is essentially just a strip mall. However, it really is nothing special.

Oh yeah, and this place is cash only.
