Ly48L1qSRdLpCSWcs_DWIw My family and I have been patrons of this place for countless years now, coming in several times a week. Throughout the years there have been many changes, both good and not-so-good, but they've still managed to keep the charm of a modern, wide-offering Hong Kong-nese cafe. 

The food quality itself is excellent and fairly consistent, though they've significantly cut down on their portions over the years - pork chops and fish cutlets are around 60% the size they used to be ten years ago. Price-wise, they're definitely on the upper-end of price ranges as far as Hong Kong cafes go, but my undying loyalty to them keeps me coming back every week. I swear they put something addictive in their Hainan Chicken and Teriyaki Sauce Fried Pork Cutlet Rice. If you're looking for late-night dessert options, they've also got nice variations on the Hong Kong egg waffles (with ice cream and whipped cream).

Service is, as you can and would expect, Hong Kong-nese. Though their waitresses are from a variety of regions, they're all fairly courteous but sometimes forgetful or misplace an order. Wouldn't be too good of a first impression for new customers, but I'm a 10-year guy at this place and just shake it off. The food quality helps me forget any errors. 

Don't expect a quick seating if you're coming for lunch - this place is PACKED! A small cafe located near several office parks and buildings means you're going to get their early, or take a late lunch.
