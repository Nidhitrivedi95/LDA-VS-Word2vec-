ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ My fiance, his family, and I came here for a quick breakfast before we started on our trip back home to NYC. The restaurant was pretty crowded with limited seats. Our family had to sit in separate tables, since there was no large table to accommodate for a party of eight. 

The breakfast menu was very basic and with options like congee, butter toast, macaroni noodle soup, instant noodle soup and etc. They also had HK Style  Coffee/Milk Tea, regular hot coffee and etc. The food was priced well and super affordable! All of the customers around the restaurant just had their breakfast quickly and than left.

I shared a table with my fiance, his brother and sister in-law. I ordered the instant noodles with spam and a fried egg - super simple, basic and light. I haven't had a breakfast like this in ages. The broth was very simple and basic. The instant noodles was cooked just right, not overcooked. The HK Style Coffee/Milk Tea was very fresh and filled with just the right amount of caffeine.

Overall, the service was very quick and on point. Decor could be improved. Breakfast was easy, simple and affordable. I would definitely recommend this place if you want a quick fix for a breakfast. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're looking to enjoy breakfast with a big group. There's not much space or tables available for a large group. I saw some of their baked dishes for lunch, so I would definitely want to come back and try out their afternoon meals.
