URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg Food is typical of Phoenix Chinese food, very boring. After everything I'd heard of the place, I was expecting alot more.  Was hoping for  along the lines of San Fran, or NYC, , but no such luck. Will not be back. I agree that portions were big and food was delivered fast, but doesn't make a difference if the food isn't good.
