PV1lnCp6_OVsR93El679BQ my favorite chinese restaurant in montreal. lots of specialties u can't find in typical chinese restaurants. chinese style bimbimbap. sea food fried rice in a bicket. giant king crabs and lobsters mountain on special requests.
don't come here to order sweet n sour n wonton soup .
