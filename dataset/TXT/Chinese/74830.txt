Fu5rL-dPs-VNW0k315xMbw Pictures look a lot better than it tastes...beef brisket noodle had tough brisket, tomato and cream sauce rice had under cooked rice, ice quake sweet & sour pork was just ok - I didn't really get the ice part but it looked cool.  Some item on the menu they ran out of - no tofu at all and no vegetable spring rolls at all.   Tung Cho vegetable was good.
