BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg My husband and I came across How Lee restaurant by accident and I wasn't sure what to expect of it at first. I am pretty skeptical about any Asian restaurant in Pittsburgh since I haven't found any 'real' ones like those in New York, Boston and Maryland. 

However, when seeing big bowls with 'nothing' but chilies, we thought, "Hey this must be good!" We got even more excited when we saw the menu--a ton of Sichuan food to choose from. 

Despite the long wait time, we got our table as soon as patrons left and ordered the Chongqing chicken, which turned out to be very popular, and a slightly milder fish dish. It didn't take too long for the food to come despite the busy time. And the food were delicious! We have been to several Sichuan restaurants, and we have to say that How Lee is one of those that we would go back to again and again. :) 

So if you're looking for GREAT Chinese food, check out How Lee! My husband and I look forward to trying other stuff on their menu (oh yeah, they also have non-Sichuan food which seem to be the 'non-spicy' ones.)
