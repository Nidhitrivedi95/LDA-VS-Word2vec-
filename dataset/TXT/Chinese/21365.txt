68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw I've been coming here for years. It's got good food. It's nice & clean. The service staff is fast and polite as well. The menu here is pretty large. The food is authentic. And if you have a large group, there's a private room downstairs (two actually I think) to accommodate the number. I come here for the dimsum a lot (try their soup dumplings). But their dishes for lunch and dinner are good too. I like the chow mein and any of their veggie dishes.
