MhnihE0alud0ereVInSt8Q LOVED this place!  I ordered takeout - tofu veggie soup & tofu w/ brown rice and vegetables dinner.  SO GOOD!  The veggies were very fresh and I have enough to last me for 3-4 meals... huge portions.  The delivery was very quick - within 30 minutes of me placing the order.  I'm happy and satisfied!
