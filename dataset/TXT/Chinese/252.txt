-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg Vegan friendly!!! A great restaurant that seems to be overlooked by the more flashy restaurants on East 4th st. You know the food is good when you look forward to going back to further explore the menu. The tofu fried rice is amazing! I have been twice and never had to wait. The service is great and the food is better!! A great place to go on a date before head to the more obnoxious bars down the street.
