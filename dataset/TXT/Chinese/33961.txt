AbadN65irz8uSL8z6fkoBg This place has ridiculous good and authentic Chinese food.  It starts at some dishes being around $4, I mean full size dishes!  Like the Pan fried noodles I got.  Not half portions, more than enough to eat and then take home for tomorrow.

The servers though really don't speak all that much English.  The establishment is tiny and family owned, so they will recognize their locals and regulars.  Down side for me is that they don't take credit cards, cash only. :-(
