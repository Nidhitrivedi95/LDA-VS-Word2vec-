-hec2e0Kj9yIVfOQKoFG6Q So, there have been so many Asian restaurants in this location over there years, some good, some bad. We stopped in today for lunch (Saturday) since we were in the area.
The place is dingy. Small tables. Set with some packets of sweet and sour and mustard. The soy sauce container had dried soy sauce crusted all over it. Not really enticing. They brought out appetizer plates to the table for our spring rolls. My plate had some sort of residue on it. I asked for a new one and got a teacup saucer. But at least it looked clean. 

There were kids hanging out in the dining room, I'm assuming the cook/owner's kids? They were very cute, but it was kind of strange. 

I admittedly ordered something from the "diet" menu so I'm not going to critique the food today.  The other people I was with seemed to enjoy their meals. 

All told, lunch for 4 people was $17, so I guess I can't complain that much... but I don't think I'll be back... at least while JUMBO II is on the sign.  Maybe I'll try again when the next Asian restaurant comes to the location.
