We ordered 5 appetizers: egg rolls, crab rangoons, fried shrimp, crispy quail, and chicken lettuce wraps. Food came out in stages, the first 3 arriving quickly, served with pots of sweet and sour, spicy mustard, and pepper flakes in oil. The pots were dirty. The egg rolls were overcooked but were otherwise pretty standard. The shrimp was cook right. The rangoons were also fine, as far as plain and uninspired rangoons go. The quail came out next, completely dry. But crispy, anyway. The chicken for the lettuce wraps had almost no flavor; you had to pour on plum sauce for it to taste like anything. The lettuce cups were full of water; I shook one off for a minute or 2 and it was still dripping on me. 

Service is fast and friendly; prices are decent. Basically a totally average Chinese place.
