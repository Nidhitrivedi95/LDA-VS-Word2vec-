Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg I'll start out by saying that because of how great we were treated, this specific restaurant is now our favorite. We walked in on Valentine's Day, because our original restaurant plans didn't work out, and we were skeptical of getting a table seeing as what day it was. We ended up only waiting a couple of minutes, and we were able to get a table! It was towards the back not near anybody, in a booth, which was great! It was our first time ever stepping into one of these restaurants before, so we didn't know what to expect. It was shockingly quiet and elegant. We had a server, which I don't remember what his name was, but he was the best service we've ever received on our night out restaurant trips! He listened to our every need and he was constantly coming by at exactly the right times  to fill our drinks, get us a to go box, etc. The food we got was just amazing. We were skeptical because we don't really eat that type of food, but our meals definitely changed our minds. We ended our night here and it was a great ending. I definitely would go back here again, and this is our go to place every Valentine's Day.
