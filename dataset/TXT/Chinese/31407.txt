9q8V8KCLbIStR-Pj3vM7qg Crispy Peking duck finally so much closer than Markham. This place is the same as the old one with more space and a few more tables. Menus and prices are the same. It's already pretty busy during dinner hours, but basically empty during close. They still seated a group of 6 half an hour before close. 

Came here as a group of 4. The tables for four is definitely not enough table space for the three-course Peking duck. Peking duck is made to order, so expect it to take some time. Skin is super crispy and meat itself is ok. ~$50 for the set.
