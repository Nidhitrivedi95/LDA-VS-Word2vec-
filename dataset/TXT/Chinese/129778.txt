pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I had their brunch menu and I wasn't too excited about it.  Pictures does say a thousand words but it doesn't describe the taste of the food.  That being said, their food presentation is awesome but food is only so-so.  The steak and eggs is more on the salty side and the best thing on the plate was the onion rings.  Their eggs benedict replaces the ham with smoked salmon.  I was imaging the smoked salmon as thick as the canadian ham but boy was I wrong.  The paper thin slice of smoked salmon just blended in with the slice of toast.  My napkin was thicker than the smoked salmon.  

I did enjoy the ambience of the place, they had cool drawings all over their walls, like some brazilian ninja went in there one night and tagged up the place.
