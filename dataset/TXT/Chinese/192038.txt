yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw China Gourmet is a solid option for some fast service Chinese! The highlights were friendly service and the fact that the lunch specials currently come with a free beverage (not sure if that will last forever). We stopped in for lunch, and I ordered chicken and broccoli in a hot garlic sauce. All of the lunch specials are served with fried rice (no extra charge) and lo mein. Alas, they do not have brown rice. The dish itself was generous, and I appreciated that they don't overload the sauce with corn starch, so it wasn't gloopy. However, it was a bit too sweet for my personal taste. Even so, I ate it all, and washed it all down with freshly brewed iced tea. The spot is fresh and clean, and the service was all smiles. A solid option for some Chinese on the run.
