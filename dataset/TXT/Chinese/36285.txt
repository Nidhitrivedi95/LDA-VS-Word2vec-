Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg We are just now leaving the restaurant, and it was such a great experience. The food was great, large portions for a good price. And Niqi, our waitress, was excellent. She was running around helping all of the tables in the bar area and was efficient and friendly. She is a great asset! We will be back.
