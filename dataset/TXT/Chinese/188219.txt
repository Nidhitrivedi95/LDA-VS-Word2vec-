yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA NOT COMING BACK!  Went to Las Vegas.  We came here for lunch.  I know this place through a friend referral.  My family ordered 2 bowls of Pho, shaken beef with rice, grilled pork with rice and crystal noodles.  They taste okay, still edible but not terrible.  The beef is very very small portion.  The quality need to improve.  The quality is tasteless.  Fail big on customer service.  The guy bring out ours Pho slam the 2 bowls down the table which make a really loud noise.  In addition, the lady bring us the bill point out the tip amounts there are on the receipt.  This is not very polite.  She keep asking me if she can charge the tips on my credit cards.
