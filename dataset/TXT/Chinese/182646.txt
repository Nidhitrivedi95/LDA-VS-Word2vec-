xjlMlnxWqMd3FGODA_z1NA Last time the food was excellent. This time it is dry and lukewarm.  The service staff is worse than the food. All they want is your money and then they dont help you after you place an order in togo. My food was sitting at the counter for 7 minutes while the staff just stare at you in aw. Not a smile in site from 6 employees. With that said, it felt unwelcoming, almost to the point where you are bothering the employees. And the kid that took my order was very effortless that had no energy to lift his fingers to help out. I was the only one in the restaurant at the time. I give this place one more chance before I stop coming here.
