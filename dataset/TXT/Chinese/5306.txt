Crab wontons actually have crab in them and they're the best I've ever tasted! 

Got the chow mein with chicken, shrimp, and scallops -- delicious. 

Minus one star as it's probably one of the more expensive Chinese restaurants and the portions are comparable to other, lower-priced alternatives. However, the quality of the food is top notch. We'll be back!
