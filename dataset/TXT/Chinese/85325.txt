hjDCsuzS_yU60FFffqpt-w Lunch is sometimes the best time to eat at restaurants, and at this buffet that is no different. The weekly price for lunch is $7.99 and M-Th you can eat in for 20% off that price. 

There's the standard Chinese buffet fare spread out over 8 buffet stands, and then there's a sushi bar and a hibachi grill bar. They have four types of soup including wonton, hot and sour, and egg drop. 

Lots of seafood options and options for vegetarians as well.


There's a little ice chest with individual ice cream cups in different flavored. Unfortunately if you want to "take it out" it's an extra $.75.

They serve pretty cheap beer and wine, for under $5.

The staff cleaning the tables are pretty attentive and clean your plates out regularly and refill your water cups often.

When we first tried to come in this past Tuesday, they had dinner pricing ($10.99, no drink) supposedly in honor of the Mexican Mother's Day holiday. I honestly think they were doing that to just up charge and make more money. 

Besides for that, it was a pretty decent buffet and the food was tasty enough that I would go back for a weekday lunch.
