Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg This is more of a three star review but I gave it an extra star because of how much of a sweet heart the waiter was. We had just gotten into Vegas and this location is not ideal because of all the people outside of P Hollywood trying to get u to join things and what not. We asked him how the hell can we get out of here and not pass the people out front? And he gave us directions to go out the side door Hahaha. 

Anyways, the food was so so. It's a PF changs. Not terrible but not great. Dan Dan noodles kind of watery. If you're hungry and have a coupon like we did it's worth stopping
