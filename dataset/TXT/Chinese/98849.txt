JtSNHDRRZffnHBEsJudW-g I don't know why this location is so bad!  The tables are filthy with bugs walking on the tabletop.  
How can they screw up standard items on their menu that have no modifications?  The music was ear ringing loud and I asked for it to be turned down three times after someone else that worked there kept turning it back up.  The baby's screams a few tables down ended, too!  Yay!  The fourth item at our table was delivered 20 minutes after the other three entrees.  So much for eating together.   
I like Noodles & Company.  In spite of this location being within walking distance of my home, I will frequent other locations.
