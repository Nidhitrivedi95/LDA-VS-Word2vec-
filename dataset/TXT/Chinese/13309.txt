2UFl9gLOQrSGY2sPu6U-kA After having a not so great experience at their downtown location, one of the managers of Little Sheep reached out to me to apologize for my experience and suggest that I try out their Scarborough location which is presented in a different way. A way I was hoping for from their downtown location.

All of my former criticisms were washed away after visiting Little Sheep's Scarborough location. The soup brother was more flavourful and they have a refrigerated wall of raw ingredients that you can self-serve from that they don't have downtown. Meat is still brought out to you as requested which was just fine by my standards.

Also important was that the service uptown was WAY faster, courteous, and everyone here had a big smile. It looked like the staff uptown were all having fun with their jobs rather than simply grinding out customers. :)

I can confidently say that Little Sheep up in Scarborough is now one of my top choices for AYCE hot pot! One word of warning, their spicy soup is SUPER SUPER spicy so you should only get it if you can handle the heat. ;)
