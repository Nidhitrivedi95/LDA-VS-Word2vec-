J_btDyZbIv0hZNjrw56zlA My family have been coming here for years and every time I visit, my parents still take me there once. 

The place is a bit crammed, service can be a bit slow but the servers has never oversold us food. This one lady who has worked there for years would always tell us that a soup and 3 dishes are more than enough for our family of 3 but we are always happy to take some home.

I have had so many things there that I can't name them all, but most of them are very decent Cantonese style dishes. Basically I don't remember anything being bad.

The duck with taro is definitely my favourite here. The fatty duck coated by mashed taro, crispily fried has the prefect texture and taste!
