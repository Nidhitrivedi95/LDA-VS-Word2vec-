U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q I was ravenous when I got off the plane at the Vegas Airport. Being starving late at night in Vegas when you need to wake up early and not break your bank is a rough place! So, when I checked into Caesar's I walked a few steps towards the palace tower, saw this joint and committed. 
I asked for the bar, which she suggested I do a table (weird) so table it was! My waiter was prompt and my food came quickly as well. The food looked like it was going to taste greasey and bland. It lived up to my expectations. The tofu was prepared okay, but this claimed vegetarian dish has a sauce that reminda me of the congealed fat when you store pot roast at a cold temperature. 
Everyone in the restaurant seemed about just enthused as me. 
Had I not been starving and had this meal not been $25 pre tip, I may have just nibbled. I would not really suggest anyone try it.
