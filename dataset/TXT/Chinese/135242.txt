qaJ-HewyVAQCQ8C_KveZ4g China Cafe used to be my go to for delivery, but I just can't any more. The food is ok and they're pretty quick with the delivery. My issue is with the delivery driver.

I always order through an app and tip at least 20%, one day I had cash on hand and selected the cash option for my tip. First of all the driver knocked on my door like the police non stop until I opened it (as he always did which was annoying), then he handed me my food then thrust the receipt at me almost yelling "Tip, tip!" He didn't even give me time to give him the cash I had on hand. And that wasn't the only time that's happened, the last time I just forgot to select a tip option for my card on the app and planned on just adding a tip to the receipt. The same thing happened, the guy demanded a tip. I'm very easy going and it takes a lot to annoy me but that really did it for me. That was the last time I ordered from them. It's always the older guy that delivers that I had issue with.
