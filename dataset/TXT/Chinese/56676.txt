czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA RnN used(!) to be my go-to place.   Great Hot & Sour soup.   FANTASTIC moo shu.   That was until yesterday when I stopped to pick up an order and saw one of the food prep guys pick something up off the floor and (what looked like) throw it back into one of the food bowls.   Even if it didnt go back into the bowl, he had clearly touched the floor before resuming his food prep.

"Gross" isn't a normal word in my vernacular; but that made me throw up in my mouth a little.

Very saddened by this.
