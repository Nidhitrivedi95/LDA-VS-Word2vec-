pofDmHoIsdvPcSKzb2iMag Back in the 90s and early 2000's, I used to really like Sky Dragon. For a while, it was my go-to Dim Sum place downtown. They have always had decent service and good prices and back in the day, the food was pretty good.

They also had one old serving woman who didn't know English but had the brightest smile that would light up the room every time we went.

Unfortunately, over time, the quality of the food slowly dropped and dropped. The food got greasier, not quite as fresh tasting, etc. I'm pretty shocked to see high ratings written up in 2016 so perhaps I should give them a shot again. I'm just doubtful that they have bounced back to their old glory or that they are comparable to a number of other Dim Sum places right in the area that are much better!

Just browse my reviews to find out the better alternatives. :)
