rEAFZFziiOWxSLsOLohccQ Ehhh.  It was 5:15pm and we were the only people in the restaurant...for the entire time we were there.  Food was unimpressive.  We were excited about the dollar appetizers for happy hour which were good and the egg drop soup was very tasty, but the entrees were only ok.  The garlic noodles were weird with Parmesan cheese on them, and the happy family was way salty.  My dining partner had a glass of wine and for 5 dollars she got half of a small glass.  
Disappointing because we need good, not chain restaurants on the west side!
