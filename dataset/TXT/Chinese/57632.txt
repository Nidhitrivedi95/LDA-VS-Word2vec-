D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA I wish I listened to the reviews because it's true...was ridiculously overpriced for mediocre food. 4 pieces of shumai cost about $7! I ordered the roast duck over rice which cost me $17. I was so underwhelmed, I had lots more rice compared to duck and my duck was all bone with little meat. The skin was soft and not crispy like a roast duck should be :(. My plate had loads of nappa cabbage on it, looks like a filler for the lack of duck. I also tried the wonton noodle soup which again disappointed me. It cost about $17 also. The broth was so bland I felt cheated. I had 4 pieces of wonton with heaps of nappa cabbage.
