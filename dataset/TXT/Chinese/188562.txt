yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA we ordered the chicken and rice, they used chicken breast which is very un typical..so dry........im not sure which peice of the chicken other Viet restaurants use but its not the breast , its a piece thats juicy and yummy ! and than aftwards a few of us got a stomach after.Lol. Went here cuz our white cab driver told us it was good. lols I think the food here leaning a tiny bit towards fusion. Anyways it is the nicest Pho restaurant I've seen compared to Vancouver.
