jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw Been here a couple times as I was starving and really would really not go back if I could help it just because their decor is unpleasant and they were out of egg tarts by 12:30 and did not have any beef balls! Both times the same cart lady completely avoided me altogether! I even called her and another cart lady had to tell her to come over; twice in two separate visits after going round and round seemed like too much of a coincidence. The place is poorly lit, not ideal for cart traffic and just grungy in general. I only like their beef roll, leaf wrapped rice and their baked custard buns which are my favorite nice and hot. Their steamed BBQ buns are not very good but their Har Gow was huge and decent.
