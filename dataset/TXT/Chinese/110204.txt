lv3h7WwuxPyJNLTeWeL5LQ Haven't been here for a while, but decided to come here with a few Caucasian colleagues who haven't really had dim sum for a while either.

This is a weekday afternoon so it may be different than weekends.

Anyway the system had change from the push cart to the more efficient "just tick off the list".  They still had pushcarts for some food though.

The good part about doing this tick off style is the food comes to you warmer.  However, it does lose its "quick" appeal.  So I was waiting a bit for the food rather than just picking it off like a vulture :)

However if you have an hour plus for lunch break it is still doable, just order everything as quickly as possible.

So what we ordered as Chrysanthemum tea (ko-fa cha if they ask) to start.   We then started picking off our orders.  I got the beef tripe in ginger soup (simple staple but still tastes good).  My colleagues got beef ribs (I didn't really like it too much),  BBQ Pork bun (yummy), mushroom with chicken (not really too good for me and note mushroom is singular), Chicken bun (not too keen on it).

We also ordered the deep fried sesame ball with pork inside (yummy) and was from the cart.  I also got tofu-fa to share with the rest of my guests which they liked.

IBM discount applies here and all three of us got the meal for $25.66 taxes and tip included.
