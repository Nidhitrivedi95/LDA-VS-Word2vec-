2FImjoBv0qvq9NumhcVOyA My favourite dishes in this restaurant are: any curry with roti, hainanese chicken, lemongrass pork chop on rice, satay skewers.

I came again today with a group of 23 people, yes, a very large group of people.  And they helped us a lot, like moving around chairs and table, ordering, etc.  I'm very appreciated for their help.

I can't take spicy food, but I can't stop having their curry.  And I need their Teh Tarik to cool down the heat.  Their Teh Tarik still very good.
