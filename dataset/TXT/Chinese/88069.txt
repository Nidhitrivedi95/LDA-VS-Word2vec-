I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Normally I love this place, but tonight was a different story. We came in ten minutes before closing and noticed the TV menus were off. I asked the cashier if they were still open because I didn't want to order and be rude knowing it was close to closing. She rolled her eyes and replied, "Um, I guess." She turns the menus back on since she knew she was trying to close early. I asked what kind of milk they used and the chubby girl making snow acted like we were doing her a disservice by asking about ingredients and replied, "Um it's non-dairy milk." She acted very condescending after we were nothing but polite. When we walked out I was about to say "good night" but the chubby girl rolled her eyes at me because I ordered close to closing. All I ordered were two boba teas. I highly doubt my friends and I will be coming back solely on the principle of their terrible customer service and rude attitude. I understand it was ten minutes before closing, but our orders weren't complicated.
