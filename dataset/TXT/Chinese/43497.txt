bfF90MspMbqLWdcEU9JLcg My husband and I came here for Valentine's Day and the service was terrible! It appeared that they were understaffed, and our waitress was dripping sweat and musty smelling. It took approximately 20 minutes to just get water once we sat down. It was 1/2 price sushi night, which was a great perk, but when we asked for a box to take home our leftovers we were told that we couldn't take home the 1/2 price sushi. We complained and said that we were unaware of this policy, as it wasn't stated anywhere in the menu. The waitress who was apparently terrified of the manager threw a plastic bag on our table and asked us to put the sushi in there and hide it, so she wouldn't get in trouble (yes she literally threw the bag on our table as she ran past!). My husband had also ordered an entree, but cancelled the order because by now we were already done eating, and had been waiting another 20+ minutes for the check. The waitress actually tried to bribe us by saying that if we still got this entree she would let us take the sushi home. Although the sushi was good....I don't think I'd recommend this place to anyone!
