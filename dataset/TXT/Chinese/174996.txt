wFTUOOJ_0quggjgXOpP7DA This is my FAVOURITE place for a fun, laid-back party vibe with good music and good food. Make reservations. 

Food - amazing portions, prices, flavours. I've only tried the appetizers so far (calamari, garlic shrimp, jerk chicken, fries), and I highly recommend them. 

Drinks - great prices. I especially love the Sa-Fire House Mojito. Order it early as it can run out. 

Music - hip hop, rnb, reggae, chutney, soca, bollywood music. I've been on Friday and Saturday and both times the DJ's played the crowd well. Got a dance floor too - depends on how many reservations there are. 

Crowd - A little bit of an older crowd, unless you bring 10 of your younger friends. Everyone is laid back. I could even see my family loving this place.
