MBirSnTW4pt2k7Ny6KC72w Try the authentic menu!

I have to admit, the first time I tried this place, I didn't like it.  The huge portions and low price was great, but the food was mediocre. But that's because I ordered from the americanized menu.  

If you want great General Tso's chicken, go elsewhere. If you want more authentic chinese food, turn your head to the left and read the fine print English translation of their authentic menu. It is absolutely fantastic, and hard to find this type of food in the Burgh.
