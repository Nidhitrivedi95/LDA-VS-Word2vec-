HJ928N6c5Hh2KD3lYCuabA Spring Rolls is a chain, and everyone should know that when it comes to chains:

1. The food quality and flavour isn't something a chef can really dictate over, its up to headquarters and;
2. The usually get super busy on weekends, especially if located near a movie theatre. Movies + 30 minutes to down a dish = busy restaurant.

That being said, going to this restaurant lunches, brunches and weeknight dinners is a pleasant experience. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and it can cater for all age groups and group sizes. I think that's fantastic.

A few weddings have actually been held here (receptions, of course), and no wonder, the place at night with the votive candles looks better than any other restaurant I've seen north of Bloor.

I think the reason why this restaurant has so many low ratings is because those with an 'asian palate' (those more experienced with Asian cuisine) expect too much from a pad thai from this restaurant.
It IS a fusion restaurant, NOT a thai restaurant  - the mango salad will be different to the hole in the wall you ate mango salad at every day in college!!!!

A Pad Thai in my eyes has always been an unworthy dish of carbs on carbs with a handful of protein to save it's sorry ass, so I hold no sympathy for those who order it in a fusion chain restaurant. A pad thai to me will always be bad, so pad thai complaints I don't think should be held against this restaurant.

Why not try the delicious Chicken and Vegetable dumplings? They are definitely one of the best appetizers (the other contender being the Calamari).

Also, the coconut icecream is the BEST, and I NEVER liked coconut before trying it. It has real pieces of coconut flesh in it, so when the ice cream melts in your mouth you get to chew on the coconut flesh. 

The server named Mark (Marc?) is cute and awesome, give him a wink from me!
