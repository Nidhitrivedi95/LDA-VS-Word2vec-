asCPMMAA1wW3GJvrPA4fTA I was taken here recently for my going-away dinner, and I was BLOWN AWAY. The food is incredible! It is in the same price-range as Golden Harbor (which I love), but in my opinion the food here is even better.

We were a party of 13, and were seated comfortably in the large table in the side room. The owner of the place took our orders, and she was wonderfully fun/sassy about it. She gave great recommendations, and would tell us if she thought we were making an unsuitable selection.

Cuisine highlights:
- GARLIC SAUCE, anything in garlic sauce was delicious (beef, eggplant, etc)
- Beijing duck (wraps had good texture, duck was cooked well, good sauces)
- Crispy tofu (crispier coating than from Golden Harbor)
- Fish with pine nuts (fish was battered and fried, and drizzled with a sweet sauce)
- Steamed tilapia (very tender)
- Scallion pancakes (owner served us two orders for free)
- Kung Pao Tofu (all-around delicious)

I had been skeptical of the place because of its location in the eerily-deserted Lincoln Square mall, but they renovated the place a few months back, and the ambience is great!

My only regret is, having left the area, I can no longer partake in this sumptuousness :(

NOTE: Older reviews (pre-2011) for this place are likely dated, as management has since changed and they've renovated the interior. This place is definitely worth a try.
