EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ Hands down the best Thai place in LV, probably because Tom is the best cook. Been coming here for over 8 years. They also have great service. They always have enough staff to make sure that all customers are taking care of in a timely manner, even if there's a private party going on.
