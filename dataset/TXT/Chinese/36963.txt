AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw We discovered this little gem a couple months ago and always have a great time there.  When we go for lunch and get their lunch specials, whether we've sat at the bar or a table, the service was fantastic.  The food is plentiful, tasty, and compares to other great Chinese food that's out there.

Yes, it's more of a bar than a Chinese restaurant, but that  makes it so fun and DIFFERENT; something Scottsdale lacks lately.  (you know, tiny portions for exorbitant prices because they add the words 'craft' or hipster to it).  The manager Jamie is friendly and genuinely cares about this customers and staff.  Going there at night is a diff. experience, saw some stand-up comedians last week on our anniversary which was a total treat!

I like everything about it, incl. all the music memorabilia on the walls.  We'll look forward to returning for years! :)
