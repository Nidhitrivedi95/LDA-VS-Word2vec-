3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug We came here for a birthday dinner on Sunday and as a seafood fan, I was not disappointed. We ordered king crab and the 8 dishes that followed, lobster noodles, vegetables, soup and a chicken dish. The king crab meat was sweet and cooked in many different ways - one simply steamed, cooked with garlic, fried etc..Nothing beats fresh seafood. The service was very attentive and I believe the owner comes and talks to every table. He is very persuasive and could probably sell you anything! They also changed our plates very often and came and checked in on us to ensure that we had everything that we needed. The desserts that came after our meal was also a lovely gesture, there was steamed egg buns with red bean paste, rice balls with sesame paste and mango coconut balls. Please note that they do not have an English menu so I would recommend going with someone who speaks Chinese or you may be stuck with American Chinese foods (spring rolls etc..) and they also offer take out. They also provide a 5% discount if you pay with cash.
