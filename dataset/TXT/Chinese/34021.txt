* Staff: nice ppl, trained and fast

* FOOD: very good and tasty. Ordered the steak with mustard sauce, is excellent and I'll recommend it. The other signature dish was their fried rice in a baked loaf of bread and we ordered it with tomato sauce and pork. So, the dish is good, but not amazing, i guess i was expecting too much from the picture and reading the content. All because the dish is not new at all, is fried rice with tomato sauce (the Chinese style pork-fried-rice you would fine anywhere else), the bread looks mainly like a decoration. But don't get me wrong, the dish is good looking... That's it lol. If you are Chinese it won't surprise you.

Definitely going back to try other chef recommendation.
