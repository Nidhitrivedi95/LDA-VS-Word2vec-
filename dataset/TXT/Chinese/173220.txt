W9JHcg3YTWo2-gfLSS4Wlw I've been seeing different acupuncturists for the past six years, and I'm quite happy with the service and support I got from Paul at Above & Beyond.

The private rooms and personal approach were amazing.  Paul is a great listener and clearly cared for my health.  The ambience of the room was quite special.

I trust Paul Kerzner for acupuncture, and would come back again.
