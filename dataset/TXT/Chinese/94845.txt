jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg Was here about midnite on a weeknight:
- Went with the $18(?) bbq combo platter app.  Options were pork, duck and jellfish and I went with the first two.  Don't know how they do it, but the pork & duck were flavorful.  
- It's a nice restaurant and an upgrade from the typical Chinese restaurant service/decor, and the menu prices seemed to reflect that.
- Definitely a good choice to eat a nice Chinese restaurant off-Strip.
