6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ Everything on my plate was old. The rice was obviously kept in the fridge for a couple of days. Some of it was hard and crunchy. The chicken was dry and vegetables were mushy. I didn't like the radish either.... It didn't seem fresh. My friend and I didn't drink the water since the cups were dirty and had residue on the bottom. Overall, horrible experience. There weren't any customers and we should've just left.
