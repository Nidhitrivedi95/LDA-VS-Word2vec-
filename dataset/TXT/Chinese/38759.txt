Dishes are slightly sweet which the servers inform me is to appeal to the American palate. So if you like food a bit more authentic make sure you let them know that.

We got the stir fried water spinach - it was plentiful and fresh. Delicious

We also ordered the jiao yan tofu - this was good, but could have been improved by jalapeños instead of bell peppers. Also could have used a bit more spicy. The dipping sauce at first was weird as it is not standard offering - plus it was a little sweet. It after a while the flavor grew on us and it was very tasty.
