Z4MvEVylnZPW_vddQc2Ihg If there is one thing I have had lots of in my life it's buffets; as a child, my parents had a quantity not quality approach to restaurants which resulted in lots of mediocre meals. Perhaps this is why I am choosing to be a little kinder to Genghis Khan... because as a buffet it's pretty good! 

As previously mentioned mom and dad love buffets so I decided to treat them to lunch for father's day. At $13 a person (and $11 for my mom because she's a senior) I thought we got good value for a Buffet (I am in no way rating this compared to a conventional restaurant...) 

To reiterate on the concept mentioned by my fellow yelpers the main focus of this buffet is the DIY dish. Pick your meats, veggies, noodles and sauces and watch while it all gets cooked on a huge flat grill while you wait (about 30 seconds). 

It should be noted that there is only one cooking area so if you are a vegetarian and you are concerned about cross contamination with cooking areas this is NOT the place for you! 

The second piece of this restaurant is a traditional buffet. 
Although I wouldn't say the buffet part is terrible I definitely think it's forgettable and as Lan pointed out the dinner price points are a rip off (at $22 a person) especially when you consider that it's the same food! 

In any case my meal was good and I liked the do it yourself options.
