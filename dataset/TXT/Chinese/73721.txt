fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw Ok let's say, the food here is actually good. But it's overpriced for sure. I'm a Taiwanese, and I'm actually happy for the food we ordered. We ordered Taiwanese beef noodle soup(16.99), BBQ combination(24.99)and garlic sautéed vegetables(12.99), oh and Fugu miso corny burger. It all taste good, just not cheap at all. 

And just a reminder, CHECK UR BILL BEFORE U PAY! coz I got charge for$28.99 for BBQ combo, and I made sure they correct it. (there goes some tips u could have earned..)
