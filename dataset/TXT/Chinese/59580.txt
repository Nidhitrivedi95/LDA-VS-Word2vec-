dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw There are 101 reasons why I love Great Bao, and I'll share 10 reasons first: Tastes delicious, quality ingredients used, patient chef, creative dishes, clean, amazing value (if that is even the right word to use - I'm trying to say tastes far more expensive than what it actually costs), attentive service, interesting smoothie combos, fresh greens in salad, and finally, delicious (oh, did I mention that already?).

Pork belly and duck baos are a must. I wish they deliver around the world. I heard that they are moving to a food truck, which means what? They just might be in around the corner!

Looking forward to coming back for more, and also to watch the business grow! Well done!!
