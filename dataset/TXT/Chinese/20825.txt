67sq73gTdgHN0atGtIgDtA I thought I'd try this place out again since it was pretty good the first time around.  This time I was pretty disappointing.  Last time I went it was after 12 noon.  This time I came in just after 11am.  What a difference an hour makes.  Almost all of the food wasn't hot at all.  Fries, wings and some of the other stuff was cold.  Some of the other was lukewarm.  I'm not an expert by any means but food has to stay at a certain temp to keep from making you sick.  I had my first plate and was very hesitant to go back for more.  I waited until the kitchen guys brought out the fresh hot food before trying anything else.  The place opens at 10am so there's plenty of time to get the warmers going.  If they don't fix it and continue to serve food that temp than someone will get sick.
