88TztTRS7K80OvWpolm4sQ We came here on family day with my family, but after we arrive they told us we never reserve, but I definitely remember that we called in for reservation a day before and they also double confirm our reservation and also ask us if we should order some foods ahead of time. Also, I have my phone history saying that I did call in for reservation. They just push all the fault on us, that make us so mad. And that is not the only thing, after we  sit down to order food, they never let us finish our lines when we want to say something they always turn around and walk away. We called for ice water more than 3 time and never come. I just think we will never come back again, just bad service, very bad service.
