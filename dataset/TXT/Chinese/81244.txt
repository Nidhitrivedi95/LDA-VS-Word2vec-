GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg My experience with Seksun was just ok. It was Friday night at 6pm the place was dead. I saw the conveyor belt, probably a 2 minutes loop compared with what we had before a 6 minutes loop in Oregon this belt felt short. The same 10 dishes were going around and around. I ordered some hamachi sashimi, fried veggie spring rolls and 2 spicy hand rolls because the belt selection was very limited.
