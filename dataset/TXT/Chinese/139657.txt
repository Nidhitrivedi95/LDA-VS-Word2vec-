QxngAo1AnfcihXqdk3IA-g This place should be shut down. I used to order delivery from here and it was my go to place for Chinese food. In my last order there was a giant cockroach in my food. I was completely disgusted. I called the restaurant about it and had some woman screaming at me that it couldn't be proven where the cockroach came from. DO NOT order from here. They need to be inspected.
