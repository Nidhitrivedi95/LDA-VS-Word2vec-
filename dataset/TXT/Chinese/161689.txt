uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw Oh wow! Did not think it would be this busy at 3 in the morning. Was kinda hungry super early morning the other day, but didn't know where to go. Eventually made our way here as they are open 24/7, but was definitely surprised with the amount of people around. 

Always nice to get some nice noodles at any time of the day, but this definitely hit the spot. Had been to the Richmond Hill location before, so knew what to order.

Service was a bit slow, and they were quite busy. They definitely did NOT want to be there, so wasn't the most pleasant service received. Did get everything we needed, and everything worked out though. 

Nice to know that this location is open all the time, so when in doubt, you can always head here for a late night meal!
