rf8x3ZTUwzmRUyJgoIZllQ I ordered the spicy stir fry. The lady at the counter didn't speak much English but nonetheless was very nice, and the owner told me that they do not use MSG (a rarity for any Chinese restaurant)! My food arrived in a cute black pot with a plate of white rice. However, my rice was ice cold, and the stir fry was lukewarm. While the stir fry's flavor was good, the vegetables were undercooked. This place could do very well, they just need to cook the food through and serve it hot!
