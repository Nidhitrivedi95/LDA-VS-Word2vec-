mQCT1psNh2pJT38ohSQDHA Had a great experience at Japan 49!

My wife and I stopped by on the way back from the airport and we're so happy we did. We live in Columbia SC, but will definitely be back as frequently as possible. 

Jason, the sushi master, was incredible. He was very friendly and created a special appetizer based off or favorite fish right when we were seated at his sushi bar. He was kind, professional, and took great pride in his work!

The manager, KC, was also kind and made sure we had everything we needed for a great evening.
