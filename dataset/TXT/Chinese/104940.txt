kS_xANADJil_EGX6gmMa5A Sooooo mediocre. To start I ordered the crab rangoons , almond cookies, the general tso's combination dinner w/ shrimp fried rice and a shrimp egg roll. They do give a lot of sweet and sour sauce for the Rangoon's but its not sweet and sour sauce....its more like sour and bland sauce. It was just disgusting. I have never had nasty tasting sweet and sour sauce, but this was awful. 

The crab Rangoon's were no better. I only ate 1 out of the 8 because it was so disgusting. No flavor what so ever. The almond cookies were really good, you get 3 cookies for 50cent which is really good, but I don't think the restaurant makes them, their store bought. The egg roll tasted bland as well and like it had been in a freezer or some thing too long. The general tso's chicken and shrimp fried rice was good.

 I definitely won't be back though there was nothing that made me feel like it was wowzers or even really yummy. Big disappointment.
