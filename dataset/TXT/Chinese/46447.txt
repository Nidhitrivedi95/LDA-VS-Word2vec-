BvrG8XMpTtlJYWhOCbnpaQ Last Friday was my first time in. Amazed by all the pictures on Yelp I figured I needed to stop by and give this place a try. I am glad I did. Besides the variety of tasty options on the menu, they do build your own stir fry bowls. That is the option I went with. I loaded my bowl with a variety of veggies (bell pepper, red peppers, bean sprouts, spinach, onions, carrots, tomatoes) and paid $2.00 extra for noodles. The sauce I chose was a spicy ginger sauce and meat choice was chicken. My food was cooked fresh to order and came out piping hot. My friends meals were off the menu. I stabbed my fork in theirs which was good but not as good as mine.

Easy process at this restaurant. You walk in and pay for the items you choose. Then you sit down and they call your name. There is a server to check in on you once your seated.   I will be back this place is great.
