jCg6MSfu3fgXxO2QrpDV7w Stopped in here today based on a friend's positive appraisal. The place was very clean, easy to find, and smelled delicious. We've been hankering for a local place that serves up some old-school Chinese food that's fresh, hot, and doesn't turn our stomachs. I think we found it. Everything we ordered was piping hot and fresh. Crunchy veggies, flavorful chicken and beef, tons of eggs in the soup. Service was quick too. Will definitely be back, hope they stick around!!
