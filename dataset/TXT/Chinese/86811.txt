hQMx2ZbGAa_oxJNpnTZf8Q Went to this diner after my bike ride and I have to say I was splendidly surprised. My boyfriend and I shared a basket of boneless wings and I ordered the bacon burger. The bacon was supposed to be a dollar more but I got it for free! The burger was a bit dry but still a very good meal. Prices are very good and the atmosphere is like every other diner: homey.
