xSplhd6mlpQzbjUAq3rP6w We have ordered delivery from Max Asia several times now and have never been disappointed. Some other reviewers have complained about delivery times but we have never waited longer than they said it would be. Plus, I like knowing that my food is made to order so I'm willing to wait a few extra minutes for that. We have never had stale food that has obviously been sitting in a pan all day. Our food always comes hot, fresh, and we have never had missing or wrong items. 

I am personally less of a fan of their more Americanized items (though those aren't bad, just what you'd typically expect from any Chinese take-out place). Their more authentic dishes are definitely on point. 

My favorites from here are the pepper calamari, wonton wor soup, indonesian curry noodles and the indonesian fried rice. I'm always tempted to branch out and try their duck or egg foo young but my current go-to's are so freaking good that I hate to mess with a good thing.
