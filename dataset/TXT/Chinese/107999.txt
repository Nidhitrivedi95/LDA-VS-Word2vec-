LG6vpg5Qx_DstY2aT8-O4Q Asian Kitchen is a classic I'll be sad to leave. Their tofu is often perfectly chewy & crispy (although sometimes overlooked or burned, not enough to lower my rating). as a vegetarian i appreciate the options.

most importantly, the staff are endlessly patient and polite. Tina, who is often there when i go, is so patient even when dealing with the worst customers. she is so sweet and patient and deserves all the best. 

the lo mein is excellent. highly recommend mixed veggies with tofu and sesame tofu.
