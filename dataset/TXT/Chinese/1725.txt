-rx-9Ra2OHfmD1yaUS-CMg My sister and I went to this restaurant a couple weeks ago. The place is quite big with ample seating so we were seated almost immediately. 

My rating is based exclusively on the food served at this place. My sister got a bento box and I ordered a golden curry. The bento box was quite typical in its contents-sushi, chicken cutlet, tempura, etc. which all tasted good. However, my golden curry was mediocre. The sauce was quite tasty, but it was nowhere near fresh. It tasted old (like it was made many hours prior) and the chicken was just added to the sauce and heated at the time of the order. Also, it contained zero vegetables-only chicken. I have ate at many thai restaurants before and never came across a thai curry that didn't contain any vegetables!! I told the waitress that I found it odd that there were no vegetables in my curry but she just shrugged it off and said it is what it is. I didn't feel like pushing so I left it and continued eating. 

If you are considering this place, I would highly suggest staying away from the curries-they are not fresh and do not have vegetables. Other items like sushi rolls and bento boxes can be tolerated.
