JftoP9r6TT98v83hfY9RZw Ordered the vegetable curry, was not impressed or happy. The mushroom egg foo young was killer though, really enjoyed  my moms meal. The waitresses were pleasant and attentive. Egg rolls were delicious as well!

Probably wont go back, there's nothing special to me about this place.
