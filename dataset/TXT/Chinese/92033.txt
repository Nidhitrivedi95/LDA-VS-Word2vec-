Iov02yUKZVj-Z3A3u37ExA Stepping into this restaurant is like stepping back in time.  Nothing has changed since the 1990s.  Even the prices are still the same (or at least very close).  Heck even the take-out menu is literally exactly the same, recognizable by the fact that the printed phone number predates Toronto's 10-digit dialing.

As for the food, I honestly have no complaints.  It's not gourmet level food, but it's well worth the price and bottom line is it tastes good.  Exactly what you'd expect from a small family run business like this.  The Day Specials at $3.99 are the best deal.  I particularly like the BBQ Pork Fried Rice.

So if you're in the mood for some good cheap Chinese food, I highly recommend this place.
