0ebavvJVXAzKKQ8C9cOt6g Currently scarfing this for lunch, and I couldn't be happier. They offer an extensive tofu selection, and it's not just bland tofu with veggies.

I almost always get it delivered - yes, the Gods have smiled upon us.

I'm eating the orange tofu with white rice. And it's pretty good. I got the combo, mainly because they don't offer the tofu with the lunch specials, but for those who eat meat, you can get a huge portion of food for $5. Yes, this is a true statement.

As far as the actual location, it's reminicent of any other New York chinese food place, and that's why Chopsticks holds a special place in my heart. You can really never go wrong.

Service is nice, and the delivery people are always so nice.  Amen, Chopsticks.

P.s. They're located right next door to an excellent dive bar. Stop by Chopsticks for dinner, and then drinks to the bar. Make a night of it. Invite me, though.
P.p.s.  The fortune cookies are pretty tasty. This time my fortune was, "A sense of humor is one of your greatest assets." I  dig it.
