XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA I work close by so this is pretty convenient location for lunch.  It's a small place so if you're going for lunch on a weekday, go before 1145 unless you like lining up for things...

There are so many hand pull noodle stores around now and this one doesn't disappoint.  Not the best as the service was mediocre but the food held up to a good standard.  Customizable noodle thickness is nice, except you really don't know what tastes better without having tried it before lol...so maybe the choice isn't that great of an idea?  But flat noodles are cool.

I'd come back because i'm so close by, but maybe not a plate I'd go out of the way to eat at.  I have my fave place for hand pull noodles heh...sorry
