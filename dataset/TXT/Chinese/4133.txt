_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg New ownership since 7/1/15. Ignore all previous photos, reviews and anyone trying to get egg rolls for takeout. 
This is legit Northern Chinese food so do some research before coming otherwise it can be overwhelming. Check out my photos for ideas. 
Food is not overly spicy, very well balanced, with great use of acid, expertly executed, big portions for an extremely fair price. Some servers speak limited English so do your research before going. 
It can get packed during peak hours so try going off hours but not during their 2:30-4:30 break. BBQ is only served after 4:30.
There are a few noodle dishes under Restaurant Dishes that use gluten free bean thread (42, 58, 60).
Vegetarians can request most of the noodle dishes to be made without meat or choose from the following: 6-10, 12, 14, 15, 26, 38, 40, 41, 51, 52, 55, 56, 62, 63. Please double check with server to make sure there's no meat.
