68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw What a great find by my hubby!  This is a hole-in-the-wall in somewhat of a seedy strip mall less than 10 minutes by car from the strip.  It's small with 6 tables.  They do their signature Hainan Chicken rice incredibly well.  We both got the original and I paid $2 extra for the dark meat only.  The chicken is fresh, juicy, flavorful and did I say FRESH?  A chat with the friendly owner told me that the chicken has never been frozen and in fact they don't even have a freezer in the restaurant.  The chicken wings with Thai sauce were to die for!!! I saw a couple having the chicken buns and they look yummy.  Gotta try next time!
