rx1AEnleVRWMNz6vB-YhfQ I have lunch here once or twice a month, and I love it because they offer brown rice (something the China One on Tropicana should do!)

I always get the Chicken Lettuce Wrap or the Chicken Teryaki Bowl. They're both excellent value for the price. The Chicken Lettuce Wrap is always enough for 2 meals, and the Teryaki bowl is usually enough for one dinner or two smaller lunches (for ~$5, that's not bad).

Quality is consistently good. Service is quick and friendly. I'm never disappointed, here.
