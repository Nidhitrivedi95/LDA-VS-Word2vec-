I've only been here once before & I thought I'd be back many times... but, when I returned (a couple months later = today) it was sorely disappointing.

The noodles tasted .. chemically.  The noodles were a little undercooked, the soup bland, and the wontons were a turn-off after the soup and noodles.  I had to douse my noodles in (pink) vinegar before I could eat anything.

I'm still a little nauseous half an hour later.

Sorry, can't be/won't be back.
