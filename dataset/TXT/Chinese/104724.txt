kpxUsRQ7i65ipQ4wLeZKeQ Horrible. Overcooked reheated buffet items in sticky congealed sauces, pedestrian offerings, flat and exploitative of the lunchtime crowd. 

The attempt at a sushi bar was miserable. The kitchen should tick to stir fry.

Go elsewhere, avoid this dive at all costs. Not even worth an attempt to make this review funny.
