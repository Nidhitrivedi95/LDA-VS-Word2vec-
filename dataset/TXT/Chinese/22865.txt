6qkNhpgMYE6y3eHurFq6yw As a local Chinese restaurant I would say this place serves the best Chinese food in this area for the price. All their dishes are a reasonably priced and the portions they serve are just the right amount. I have tried many of the combination plates that cost less than $10 dollars, and many signature dishes such as Chicken balls, General Tsao Chicken and Cantonese chow me in that is very worth my money! All the dishes I have tried so far are very tasty and delicious! 
I would recommend this place is anyone who is in this area who wants affordable Chinese food! Their customer service is great and the restaurant is very clean!
