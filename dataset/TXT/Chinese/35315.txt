ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ It's been quite awhile since I ventured to this side of town, but had to give this place a try.

Prior to eating here, the only other buffet I have eaten at was Mandarin or Imperial Buffet. I'm not really a buffet type of guy, but it had been awhile, and i read good things about this place so why not.

First impression was holy red!! This colour really dominated. I really liked the ambience of this place, it wasn't as crowded as I expected on a Friday night which was a welcome relief. We got seated right away. 

The server explained to us exactly what was special on the buffet today, and Peking Duck and Noodle Soup & Oysters!

I always believe in pacing yourself when at a buffet, but that soon went out the window. The food was very flavourful, loved the Peking duck, Beef, BBQ Pork. i also had some Oysters! Food was better quality then the Mandarin and Imperial Buffet by far.

After about 4 plates I was done! Great place will surely come again. It is a bit on the pricey side $35 per person, but other than that, great place to eat.
