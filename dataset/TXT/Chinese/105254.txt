KVGdRDCXOPbcDH_3HC1jfA In the hotel for a business meet and was stuck inside due to weather conditions. I don't normally eat in hotel restaurants but this one was life changing. 

I ordered their Peking duck and chicken fried rice and it was absolutely amazing.

They could use some English speaking waiters though. I guess that adds to the experience for a Chinese restaurant ;)
