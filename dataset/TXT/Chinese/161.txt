-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg Came to Saigon on Wednesday before the Cavs game with a group of friends. The place was pretty packed, but our food came out fast and delicious. Our waitress Vam (!?) was extremely attentive, eloquent and smart! She made appropriate recommendations based on our specific tastes.  I was impressed with how she memorized everything from drinks to food at once without writing anything down, and even asked careful questions on how we want our drinks tailored. This isn't something you would typically see from other Asian restaurants. The owner also seemed to be friendly and nice. 

I would definitely recommend the Chicken Soup (H1), crispy pork rolls, or the pho. The broth here is so flavorful! However, the curry stir fry isn't that outstanding, needs some extra kick. Overall, it was an excellent experience. Will come back to try the salt and pepper seafood.
