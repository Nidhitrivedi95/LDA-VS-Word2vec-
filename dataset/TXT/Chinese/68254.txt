eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ Yum this is one of my favorite Thai places on the east side! It's pretty much the only one. The food is super authentic and they always give you veggie egg rolls with whatever you order! The Pad Thai is fantastic. I suggest the Shrimp or vegetable Pad Thai. They have vegetarian options which I really enjoy! I suggest this place to anyone on the east side who wants real authentic good Thai food from a nice friendly staff!
