heLF99lVDRf2Z-1kCWpHdQ One of the best Chinese food places in Scarborough. They have a great selection of food items from pork, to chicken, to beef and lots of veggie choices. 
Takeout/Pickup is the easiest. Order is ready usually in 25 minutes or less. 
Skip delivery, in my experience it took almost 50 minutes to an hour for delivery, and our house is no more than 10 minutes away. 
A dinner for 4 costs just over $60 for multiple items, but there is always left overs.
