JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw Shang Artisan Noodle gets down to business. The food is affordable, delicious, and quick. And, huge plus, their portions are generous. Even when I'm ravenously hungry, I always leave satisfied. Depending on how much self-control I have that day, I either end up with leftovers or slightly uncomfortable from eating too much.

Additionally, they do have vegetarian options: Tomato & Egg Noodle and their Tomato & Egg Rice, which is essentially one flavor option, but boy, do they do it well. The flavors are simple, yet harmonious. The sweetness from the tomato, the savoriness of the egg, the fresh component from the bok choy, and the great texture from their hand-pulled noodles work amazing together. A+ veggie option for my non-meat eating homies. 

Lastly, while they do have a smaller menu, it's broad enough to offer something for everyone. And I can attest that Shang Artisan Noodle may do less, but they definitely do it well.
