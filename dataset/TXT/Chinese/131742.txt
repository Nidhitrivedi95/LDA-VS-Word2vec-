PlP0c_u3g-3LiWHpb2XnOQ Didn't feel like cooking, so I stopped by Lee Café for a carry-out of Shrimp Fried Rice.  While I was not wowed by the fried rice, I was not disappointed with it.  The portion size was good and there was enough to have the next day.

The ambiance was nice and the staff was friendly.  If I am in the area and want Chinese food, I may stop by again.
