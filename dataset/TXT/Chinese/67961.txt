It is very affordable for famiy dinners for a casual night out, especially when you don't feel like cooking.  We've been here many many times, such that it's become one of the staple restaurants we go to.  At least once a month, probably more, that we end up here.
For the purpose of this review, I will recall the meal with a party of 15 (yes, they had to put 6 tables together to fit us) that we ate tonight.

Service is average, but for price you pay, I'd overlook it and just focus on the food :)
Price varies but you're looking at $7-10 per dish. We ordered around 10 or 11 dishes to share between everyone.  But here are my thoughts on some of them:

1. Mushrooms with Beef (and onions)
- Saucy, the beef is bit chewy, but the mushrooms make up for it

2. Sweet and Sour Pork - quite dry actually, they are usually better

3. Corn sauce over deep fried filets of fish - crispy and fresh filets, covered in sweet corn sauce, always a winner

4. Chicken (whole) - this is one of their staples, and sometimes they even run out!  Order this one for sure!  It's very very good.

5. Lemon Chicken - sauce was a bit too diluted, but the chicken itself was flavourful as it was deep fried a bit, kind of like a cutlet

6. Vermicelli + Cucumbers - one of their veggie dishes, a bit bland but good to go with your steamed rice

7. Fish + Potatoes - saucy dish, good with rice, fish is soft and easy to eat. Potato is a weird mix but it works.

8. Shrimps + Scrambled eggs - another signature chinese dish, eggs were done perfectly. I'd say this is another favourite

Decor is average, nothing special, you walk in, tell them how big your party is, they sit you down.  They have posters with chinese menus all over the walls, they also have english menus if you ask.

Overall, it's worth every buck you pay.  Check it out when you're in the area!
