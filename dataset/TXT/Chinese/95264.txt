JhEtJbGjAqKDHCZ11i3qoQ I was first introduced to this original YC's by my boss when our office was on Broadway Rd. Now my wife and I frequent this business. The staff is always super nice with an inviting attitude. The food is spot on and they provide wax paper to mash down food/sauce into your bowl. By now you're probably aware that the key is to get as much food in your bowl as possible. If you're not planning on eating much, get the small bowl--you'll still be filled by the end of the meal. ;)

I definitely recommend dinnertime over lunch. For a couple dollars more you get the Alaskan cod option with the other meats, and ice cream (cone or cup, soft-serve vanilla/chocolate). If you are unable to finish your meal, to-go containers are only 50 cents each, quite a deal in my opinion! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves large portions of healthy food.
