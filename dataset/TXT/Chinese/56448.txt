czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA I have been to this place countless times now and all I can say is wow, yessss, delicious, consistent!!!! The chow mien is ALWAYS sooooo good!!!!!!!!!! The employees are so nice and their customer service is ON POINT!!! I've had some other things and they have all been good as well... especially the Crab Rangoon  I'll continue to go here and recommend to other as well!
