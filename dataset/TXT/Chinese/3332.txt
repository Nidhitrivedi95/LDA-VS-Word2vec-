_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Had the Cha Tsai noodle soup bowl. Description was 'spicy szechuan vegetables with pork'. Not spicy at all, tasted like chicken broth, needed more flavor. Only a few vegetables; bean sprouts, pickled cabbage and a few rehydrated mushrooms. Pork was in tiny tidbits, it looked like chicken, but apparently it was pork. Little to no flavor. Added soy sauce and chili paste for taste.
Boyfriend had the Szechuan beef noodle soup which was extremely too hot. Beef was tasty, but broth had too much chili oil. Mixed some of my soup with his to cool his down and spice mine up!
Overall it was fine. Maybe the other entrees are tastier?
