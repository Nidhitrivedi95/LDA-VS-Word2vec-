ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw I can see why this restaurant has such a low rating of two and a half stars.  I'm giving it one star.  I'm talking about this particular location that continuously has messed up my order.  They either don't care what, or how an order comes out of the kitchen for take out.  I feel like they take advantage of the fact that chances are slim you're going to bring back an order once you're home.  I was so hungry, I just decided to eat what I had even though it's no where near what I expected, or am used to.    I feel like either the cooks are new, or extremely incompetent!!  Tonight I ordered the Pei Wei spicy chicken with fried rice.  I've been ordering this dish for over a decade at other locations, as it's my favorite Pei Wei dish.  The chicken did not have the usual fried coating, or the sweet spicy sauce.  It's like I got an order of fried rice with chicken.  That's it.  So disappointed!
