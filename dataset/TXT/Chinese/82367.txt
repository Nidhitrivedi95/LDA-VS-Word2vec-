H94fBucKEuNKsjbSy7WODg This is really great food, great location right by the college, really affordable awesome authentic cuisine! The Kung Pau beef is my favorite along with the orange chicken... If your are vegetarian this is also the place for you with so many dishes ranging from noodles to soups to vegetable stir fry using only the most fresh ingredients.. Also my waiter Eddie request him awesome guy with a great sense of humor... Kept my drinks full and my food was hot and ready to eat in no time...this is family owned restaurant and they do only the best Chinese food in town!
