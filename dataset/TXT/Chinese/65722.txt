ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw New decor but something is missing!  

Not so upscale Asian fast food any longer.  You order at the counter and wait to hear your number shouted out for you to pickup.  Sort of like McDonalds.

Servers who deliver your food to the table are no longer. No one  is clearing off empty dishes or asking if they can get you anything.  Heck, even Dairy Queen will bring out the Blizzard to your table on occasion.  At Pei Wei's you're on your own now, buddy!    

What happened to the nice china plates and silverware.  Now it is plastic boats for the food and cardboard (huh) boxes for the salads. 

Menu has changed to what seems like smaller portions. My buddy's favorite sweet and sour soup is gone.  In fact Pei Wei's has no soups now.  The Pei Wei spicy beef was still good if somewhat vinegary.  Difficult to eat the side salad from the small cardboard box.

Granted the remodel makes for an attractive space!  But it's now just open seating, sort of like mall eateries.  Music was irritating too.  

I don't think this place will appeal to older folks. Previously Pei Wei was 5 star for me but now I'll think twice about eating here.  I like Sauce, down the street a whole lot better, as in better caring service!
