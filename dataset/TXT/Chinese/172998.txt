W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ If you're into authentic Japanese ramen, DO NOT come here. You will be very disappointed. The prices are ridiculous for the quality of food that you get. The ramen has too much going on. I got the Logan Poser Ramen and was not one bit satisfied. The cucumber and fish (or whatever it was) was unnecessary, the crispy pork had no taste, and the amount of noodles given were not enough. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're staying at the Monte Carlo or passing by. 
If you're looking for great Japanese ramen, I'd go to Monta.
