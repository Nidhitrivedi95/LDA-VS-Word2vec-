Gv2F-f0mUYhCCUKOshpj3A First visit. I am not going to go into bloated details because everyone has expressed it already for the most part. 

I purchased 3 dishes from the authentic menu, and two plates of fried rice. $49.xx 

2 dishes, extremely oily, but on the bland side in flavor. Spicy yes but not really bad, flavorful no.

The other dish was pretty good. 

I came in about 9:15 pm for take out, so I can't speak to the service side as others have. 

The portions were on the average side at best. For the money I spent I was waiting to be wowed by the food and portion size but I was not. 

This is the type of restaurant where you are either going to love it, or find it so so and really no in between.
