EGJb8zZPlAfRzj9rg2KwqQ Chinese food in Cleveland, wasn't expecting much, just needed some kung pao anything, hot & sour soup, and white rice to cleanse my Asian pallet from all the meat & potatoes I consumed in the midwest.

Came across this place on Yelp, 4 stars, 10 reviews, $7 bucks, buffet. That's 3 out of 4 green lights (10 reviews is a little light, but it's Cleveland)

White rice, baked salmon, roast beef, chow mein, veg fried rice, egg rolls, BBQ pork, sauteed mushrooms, sushi, dessert, all the greasy American-Chinese food you can imagine.  Three plates later, I walked out of China Buffet with a brick in my stomach (insert happy face emoji)

It got the job done, I suppose it's a 4-star Clevelander. I would return if I ever visit Cleveland again, but definitely skip if this place was elsewhere.
