U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q don't come here!! It's not worth to spend any of your money here. We were going to the buffet, but wait time is to long since we have 2 babies with us, so we just pick the restaurant  next to it. I should have read the review first, so I won't choice here. 
When we were waiting to be seat, and finally 2 girls come, but they are too busy at chating, and just ignore us. when I tell one of the girl we have 2 babies, she show me a look that she dosen't want us to eat in this restaurant, and tell me there's no table for us while there are all empty tables. I don't understand, my babies are super quite, not make any noise, even if customer's baby is loud, don't you think her attitude is still not appropriate. When we asking a high chairs, 1 of the high chair is oily and have some food in there, we ask if she can help us clean it, and she told me it's already clean, OMG, are you blind, I don't want to say something like this, but this girl really ruin my dinner. She also forgot to give us menu...OMG, manager, or owner, can you train your employee?  
for its taste, and service their prices are way to high.
