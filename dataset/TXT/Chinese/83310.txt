hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA This is probably a place to go to when you are craving good chinese food. I recommend coming at 4pm to closing or weekends because they have more seafood. I mean fried calamari with jalapeño?! Yasss!!! 

The only con for this place is the bathroom. They could be more cleaner and nice smell of air freshener would help because one of the greatest key to a successful restaurant is a clean environment.
