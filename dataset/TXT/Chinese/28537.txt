8MXjK1lhVRhU3yGCUv9qsA So happy to have Mean Bao for a neighbour. 

All the Bao are good and no two taste the same. Just returned from a trip to NYC where we tried the famous Bao House. Happy to report, they don't hold a candle to our local Mean Bao bros!!

Everything here is delicious and you can tell they put a tonne of effort and heart into all of their items.
