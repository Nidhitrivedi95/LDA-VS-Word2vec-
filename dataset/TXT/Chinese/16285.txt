44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix valley, have been to Nee House for a few years now and the food has been consistently delicious. Always come here to fill up the little homesickness. Took a few different groups of friends over and no one has disappointed. Some of our most ordered dishes are French styled beef, garlic crabs and stir-fried A vegetables. Of course there are many other good ones, just be a bit adventurous and give it a try :-)
