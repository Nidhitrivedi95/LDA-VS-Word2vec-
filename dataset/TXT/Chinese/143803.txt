I had been ordering their shrimp wonton soup via delivery, which was totally solid, but last night we decided to try a full meal. We ordered the combo with wonton soup, egg rolls and upgraded from white rice to chicken fried, Cantonese Chow Mein and Kung Pao Chicken.

The egg rolls were so greasy that they were inedible. When you can drain a tablespoon of liquid grease from the paper bag holding the egrolls, you question actually eating them. I'm not joking, I turned the little paper bag upside down in the sink and a full tablespoon of oil ran out. I tried to squeeze the grease soaked egg rolls in a paper towel, but nothing was helping these poor puppies. They went in the garbage.

Cantonese Chow mein had ok veggies, but the noodles were soggy and broke apart. The Kung Pao Chicken was flavourless and gloopy. Even the peanuts were soggy. Fried rice tasted like they has just mixed some peas, cubed chicken and egg in with regular steamed rice. No flavour.

It wasn't all that pricey: $43 including a $5 tip, but considering that the generous portions were mostly inedible, not a great deal. We didn't even get fortune cookies.
