ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ The Clever Koi serves great noodle dishes that are not as heavy as its traditional counterparts. The broth served at the Clever Koi is not the traditional Tonkotsu broth one might expect at a noodle establishment, but that is what sets The Clever Koi apart. A feature worth writing home about is the Build-Your-Own-Bowl. Here, TKC allows diners to customize his or her noodle or rice bowls. Diners can choose noodle, broth, protein, and vegetable fixings to create his or her own magical Clever-Koi-Creation. The end creation is filling but, by no means, heavy. The veggies are crisp, the broth is light, which when combined allowed me to enjoy a bowl of udon/ramen noodles without having to sacrifice 30 minutes of my afternoon to nap. 

Have a hankering for asian soup noodles but want to feel a little healthy while consuming it? COME HERE.

Although I usually don't include notes on atmosphere, TKC has great scene. I would sum it up as Zen vibe with modern fixtures. I enjoy the dark metals and wood pieces. I feel like West Elm outfitted the establishment. Additionally, its worth to note that parking is located behind the building. If you are coming down Central Ave,turn into the street right before TKC and you should see a parking lot. 

4 stars = I'm a fan. I refrained from giving 5 stars because the service was sub-par. Did I come at an off time? Was the girl who served my party our dishes having a bad day?? IDK, but icky vibes can really affect one's dining experience.
