3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug Since everybody seems to be invading Canada (i.e. writing generic short paragraphed circa pre-Elite 2005 Yelp reviews, now that Yelp has officially crossed the northern border) I'm gonna hop on the Maple Leaf bandwagon and start off with one too.

Omei, or more accurately, pronounced Er Mei in Mandarin, is actually a the name of a mountainous region in Sichuan province, China

The last time I was at Omei restaurant was probably close to 13 years ago. Unless things have changed, this is/was a Shanghainese style restaurant, and is in a strip mall that also has a pharmacy and a supermarket.

There were a few decent items here for lunch/brunch, particularly soymilk, sticky rice rolls (fan tuan) and a nicely done ja jiang mien (brothless noodle in bean sauce) although the noodles were not made in house. My grandma loved coming here as it was close by and they did those favorites of hers fairly consistently.

But circa 2003, family members (those who hold Canadian passports) felt this place went down the slopes and have not returned as much. There are arguably better and newer places that do better Shanghainese fare within driving distance.
