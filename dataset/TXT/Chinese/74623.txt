FscCtUIsAL8cBL-S-A4FEQ They aren't the nicest here but their food is super good. I'm from the east coast and they have the most authentic east coast Asian cuisine. My favorite is the pork fried rice which never disappoints. I saw that some people had issues ordering from Grubhub. I usually use eat24 and my experience is always great. Usually about a 20 minute time for me to pick up my food and it's always hot and ready for me when I arrive. I am seriously confused as to why this place has such a low rating.
