WuQZ5iesON7NWTDWgwWlbQ My soon to be father in law hosts his semi-annual company banquet here so he knows all the staff well. My first time dining in Premiere was my first meal of 2013 with my fiance's family aka the morning I got engaged. We returned on this holiday visit and I was reminded of how awesome the customer service was and creative/yummy the dim sums were. The dim sum menu had the traditional shrimp dumplings (but the size of your fist), tripe, chicken feet, beef rice rolls - but also the non so traditional crab dumplings, almond custard buns, egg tarts with birds nest, pumpkin with black sesame, unagi rice roll, tapioca soup with rambutan, and durian puffs. They constantly introduce new items on their menu too so I can never get tired of their dim sums!  I'm sure we will continue to return for many future visits!
