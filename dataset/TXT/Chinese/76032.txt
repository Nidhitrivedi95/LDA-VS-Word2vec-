g-Q3rLkyGT-TtiRgE-PvgA Discovered this gem on my peds rotation. Usually have 45 minutes for my lunch and cannot be late! This place is super speedy. Between being seated and walking out the door- done in 30 min, BOOM!

The lunch specials are definitely the best deal. Most food and variety for the best dollars spent.

They have all of your favorite Chinese classics. Casual. Dependable.
