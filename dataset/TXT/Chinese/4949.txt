0-jZq2P4eN7fRdt4Ls1QZQ Awesome place for breakfast! From 7-11:30 AM they feature a breakfast menu. Ordered beef brisket rice noodle ($6.50) and oatmeal with egg sandwich ($5.99). It's a sweet little Hong Kong style cafe with the standard menu items and an HK tea or coffee that comes with the entree.

The beef brisket was quite good. Satisfying and met expectations adequately. The oatmeal is very milky - exactly how I love to eat it. HK milk tea is perfectly strong and flavored.

Nothing notable about the service. Common to most cafes of this style, the news is on in the background. Its also located at Kennedy/Hwy 7 plaza - can be packed depending on time of day.
