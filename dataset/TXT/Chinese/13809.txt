With that said though, I am a huge fan of this place.  The menu is large with Chinese and Japanese options.  I have only tried the Chinese options and really think that VIP may be the best Asian restaurant that I have been to in Madison.

On both visits I have been able to try many different items and a few items definitely stand out.  The cumin beef, seasoned with cumin of course and veggies is amazing!  I also tried the beef heel which is thinly sliced pieces in a chili sauce is also really great.  I have also loved the duck on both visits.  We also tried the fish, the exact type escapes me now but it is served scored with a chili sauce.  That dish was also very good.

Not only is the food good here though but the service as well.  Our waiter was very helpful and gave great recommendations.  VIP has a great drink menu as well.  I should also mention that this place is sort of deceiving from the outside.  I say that because upon walking in the atmosphere is that of a sort of upscale restaurant in a really big city.  This is a great place to host a large group or for date night.  My fiance and I were here a few days ago and we are really looking forward to going back!
