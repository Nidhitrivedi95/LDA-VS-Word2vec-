BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ I can only write a review on the sushi because that's all I've ever gotten here. I've been on a temporary assignment in East Liberty for work for about 5 months now. One day I was craving sushi so I used Yelp to find nearby places that have sushi for lunch. I've always heard great things about Plum, but have never been, so I decided to try it. I ordered the Lucky 7 Maki Combo for lunch. I got the spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura roll. I believe the other options are California, avocado and cucumber and maybe one other roll. You can choose the two that you want. It also came with a side of miso soup. I seriously love their sushi! I get the exact same thing every time I order lunch. Every time I go, I've had experienced great customer service. My sushi is so fresh and delicious! I get sushi there every couple weeks and it never disappoints. One day I would love to actually sit in the restaurant because it looks so beautiful inside the dining area. I've only ever gotten take out for lunch. I'm definitely a fan of Plum and will keep going back! :)
