vsi_PMRgyFy4_vVfQErtCA Good Olde fashion dim sum with cart service. Brings back the memories.  Cleaner than most Chinese restaurants in Toronto.  Cart women were friendly and quick.  Food was good but I was famished and craving dim sum so it could've been a 3 star on another day.  Pretty pricey but I do eat like a pig and was extremely full after.
