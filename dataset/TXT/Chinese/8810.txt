1MGhb6z2XSTsyLvQgylXiA We have gone to Wang's Delight a few times now.  I am not aware of its previous location, and only know of this place due to its proximity.  Unfortunately, there is better Chinese food within a few blocks of this restaurant.  Namely, the four corners of Warner and Dobson, in the Lee Lee Supermarket shopping complex is quite a bit better.

In the beginning, Wang's contained some great food, and the food tasted fresh, well-prepared.  Each time we've gone, though, the food seems to have become more bland.  The last time, the food tasted almost as though it had been pre-prepared, perhaps even frozen and then reheated or recooked.  

The restaurant was empty at 5:30pm on a Saturday.  It was very quiet.  We were shown our table quickly, and our orders were taken quickly as well.  We had General Tso's chicken, Orange Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and a stir fry dish.  Overall, the food was bland and didn't taste fresh at all.  Service was rapid and friendly, and the restaurant was very clean. 

I think if you're looking for general American-Chinese fare, a lot of food, at a decent price, then it's okay.  I emphasize though that there are much better choices around.
