-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ We went last night for a late dinner.  We were seated immediately and were timely greeted by our server.  He was on top of things, and even let me sample some of the N/A drinks before committing.  

We ordered the Vietnamese rolls (awesome, very fresh) the edamame (on the sweeter side) the pad thai (my husband enjoyed it, but I did not) and I got the ramen. 

The ramen was amazing, flavorful and filled with a large section of pork belly and bursts of fresh ginger. The best part, the ramen was MSG free! I hesitated when they assured me it was because it's so hard to find ramen without it, but they were telling the truth because I would have broken into hives. The server pointed out specific items that contained MSG. 

So happy to have a quality place nearby.  We also enjoyed the portion size and are eating leftovers for breakfast as I write this.  After 1 beer, 3 N/A beverages, 2 apps, and 2 entrees we paid just under $60 with tip.
