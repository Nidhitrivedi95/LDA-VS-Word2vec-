U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Review # 36/100 yelp challenge

* Price: expensive but big portion. $16 for a bowl of soup, $18 for fried rice. 3 star.
* Ambiance: nice decor but casual. 3 star.
* Location: Casear Palace Casino. Easy to access and free parking in Colisseum way. 4 star.
* Meals: not bad. The flavor is more mild than Chinese dishes in chinatown but presentation is lacking. 3 star.
* Service: pleasant; food coming out very fast. 3+ star.

Averaged to about 3 star.

After a long night, we just wanted to have a bowl of soup! We came here even though they have many bad reviews but they also have good reviews from the yelp elite folks... So we tried it out.
We got seated right away. The severs came to get our order right away, drinks and meals coming at fast pace. 
We ordered Lanzhou beef soup, beef brisket soup and shrimp fried rice.
- Lanzhou beef soup with hand pulled noodle: thick-base broth with anise, peppercorn and cinnamon. The noodle is hand-pulled so it maybe chewy. Overall, it is tasty but not spicy as traditional Lanzhou noodles.
- beef brisket soup: pretty good. It is spicy, thick stew beef stock. 
- fried rice: light flavor, perfectly cooked fried rice.

Overall, food is decent (not comparing to restaurants in LA, SF or NY Chinatowns) but pricey! Food presentation is lacking. However, it opens 24/7 and offers decent comfort food, we just have to bite the bullet!
