cI7k9zqs_pl3byUDE4cpdA Most disappointing. I had been here many years ago and I remembered the food to be quite tasty. Both the service AND the food left much to be desired. I would consider the food itself to be average at best and comparable to a greasy take-out place. The lo mein was on par with a frozen TV dinner. The sesame chicken was better but not by much. The hot and sour soup was average, as well. The service was rushed. I doubt I'll be back.
