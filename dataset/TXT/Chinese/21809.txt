6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q red 8, ive been my first time about 2 years ago with a group of family and the food was excellent a bit pricey but very good but thats vegas for ya, the beef was mouth melting and most fusion places and chinese places the beef is chewy but not this one i enjoyed every piece and so did my family, they usually have a long wait so get there early an put your name down if you are in vegas you must try!
