DXP3MbE8srQITLlAuS45aQ THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD. My friend and I got the hotpot bowls (I got beef and she got fish); they're so good and so worth it!!! A huge bowl of hot broth, filled with a bunch of different veggies, a lot of meat, and noodles! Perfect for a cold Pittsburgh winter day!! Food came out fast, the service was okay, good prices, and it was definitely worth the money. I will definitely be coming here again.
