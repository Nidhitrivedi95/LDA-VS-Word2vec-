uAPMb111euz5jJF8_VeO2A This is my new go-to restaurant in Chinatown.  I've been here twice during my 2-week vacation, once for lunch and once for dinner.

It's a nice setting, with table cloths instead of plastic sheets.  The food both times were delicious and the price reasonable.  The service was outstanding by the lady owner and her youthful son, but i think i know the waitress which some of the negative reviewers commented about.  She has a grouchy face, so just ask the boss lady or her son for service.

We had many dishes here, but i recommend the soup base pea sprouts, salt and spicy prawns, the steamed fish and the ginger onion lobster.

I really hope this place survives so that i can visit it the next time I'm in town!
