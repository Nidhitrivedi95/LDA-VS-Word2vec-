6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ Las Vegas restaurants are so expensive that we were thrilled to find somewhere with great food and reasonable prices.

We ordered the General's Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice.  See a trend here?????   Anyway, everything came out hot and fresh and not in a "hurry and eat so we can turn your table kind of way".  The General's Chicken was somewhat similar to General Tso's but it wasn't deep fried, but skinless.   Great sauce and the right temperature.   King Pao was the same way, very tasty and the right heat.   If anything, the rice might have been a little bland but they give you two sauces (hot and hotter) which added a punch.

Our server was great and the prices were what we see at home so we were pleasantly surprised.

Would go back.
