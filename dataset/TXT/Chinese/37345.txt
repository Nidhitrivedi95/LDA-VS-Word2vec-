anGYRueZJKYCJefKFccfjA If I could give this place a no-star. I certainly would. 

My friends and I came here on a sunday evening around 5pm for an early dinner. We came here on my friend's suggestion. At a first glance, It looked good. But as time went on, I became more unimpressed. 

For 5pm on a sunday, this place was EMPTY. Considering that, you'd expect that the employees be a little more attentive, since they have no one else to attend to. Wrong. They were only helpful when we called for them. Typical for an Asian place right? I guess. Keep reading if you want the real knitty gritty. It get's worse.

Their selection of food is not bad, they have all the typical staples of a AYCE hot pot place, the quality wasn't bad. Not the best though. Ordering is through a form, and the servers brought you the food. So you're thinking, okay, sounds like a mediocre Asian place? Correct.

It wasn't until we saw a COCKROACH on the wall next to our booth, where I completely lost my appetite. It went from hungry, to zero.
So it wasn't in our food, or in our soup. But who knows? That cockroach must've came from somewhere?

This cockroach hid in the crack of the wall during our entire meal. It eventually came out, and one of the people in the party were were in, killed it.

Please keep in mind, a waiter full saw this happening. And shrugged it off, as if it were nothing.

So...if you want to have a meal with a cockroach by your side. I highly suggest this place.
Otherwise. Stay away.
I'm honestly surprised this place hasn't had the red safety food regulation posted on the outside of their door.
