3TRgD3KLVis61eGvMZrykA In our short 5-day stay in Vegas, we came here 3 times. That must tell you something about how good the food is here. The service is good too. Each time the servers were very attentive and gave us something (broth and/or dessert soup) on the house. I especially recommend the last two beef dishes in the beef section on the menu, very succulent and tender.
