OlSpcJY_nXqWbdwdg4SNvA I normally enjoy going to this restaurant for dim sum. One of my favorite items is this baked BBQ pork pineapple bun. I ordered two of them but got very different ones. It seemed like two different dim sum chefs. After complaining to the staff, they exchanged the smaller sized dish. What they exchanged was still the same.   I  wanted to upload proof of this but don't know how
