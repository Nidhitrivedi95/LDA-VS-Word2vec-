JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA Cool idea for a restaurant. You decide what size bowl you want and pay, then go through a buffet of frozen/chilled veggies, meats, noodles, etc. you then add sauce (the chalkboard has different recipes you can try). While they're cooking your bowl, you can decide if you want rice, additional garnishes, soup, etc. A drink is included, too! The staff is nice and accommodating, even during rushes. You get a ton of food if you stuff your bowl full, and can take some home for leftovers.

The food was good, but not crazy amazing. It was similar to other Mongolian BBQ places.

Tips: 
-use the parchment paper to squash your food down so you can fit more!
-even if the line stretches out the door, don't run away! The line moves fast, and the wait is worth it!
