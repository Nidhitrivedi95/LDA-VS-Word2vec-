MxGk2Pxy2M0fQUV0t4bsbQ I have enjoyed Rose Wong's restaurants most of my life here on Earth...vs outer space!

Her early spot "Amethyst Grill" was classy but short lived.  Too bad, so sad. It was elegant.

Her long, long time spot across the street  "Pearl of the Orient" was a tried and true local spot for authentic Chinese Cuisine.  The staff was always polite and efficient, but the atmosphere and ambiance left something to be desired. Quite honestly, it had none.  A tiny lil bar for the rejects in the neighborhood to pour over a poorly made drink and a dark and dismal restaurant where you could hear every conversation of the dry and busy body crowd. It was ...well... MEH...

Now, onto the next chapter in her life, "Pearl"!!!!!!!
The atmosphere is Pretty, Chic and Inviting!  
The beautiful vibrant Red walls, artwork and furniture is another world from the Pearl of the Orient!  Thankful for the City rearranging the shopping center, this place is the New place to hang!

A long bar for the regulars or newbies to hang out! 
Happy Hour 7 days a week!
The menu has even been enhanced!

Managed by Jason, a long time friend and awesome young fella, Rose is back on her game!
Stop in, you will likely see me at some point.
This place is just wonderful and a Welcoming new spot in Shaker Heights!
