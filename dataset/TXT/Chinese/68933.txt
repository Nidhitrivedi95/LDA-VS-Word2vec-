EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ SUPER friendly people!!! Came about an hour before closing on a Saturday night and they still were able to take my take out order. Ordered a pad see ew and a side of rice after a long day on the strip. Totally fulfilling and it was enough to feed me and another friend. Thai tea was ace but there was just a little too much ice. Also, the check in offer is only good for dine in customers. 

Definitely coming back here during my next trip to Vegas!
