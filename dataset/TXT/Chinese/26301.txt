7Ry-hEfZwaDXe8u-n6v15A Terrible service and staff doesn't even speak English or Cantonese.  I didn't understand a word they were saying and it was even harder to ask for an extra bowl and chopstick. the staff were slow and show them chatting with each other and cracking jokes now and than when everyone is looking for them.  Food itself was bland and presentation was terrible.  Don't think i will come back for a 2nd visit with this bad service and subpar food.
