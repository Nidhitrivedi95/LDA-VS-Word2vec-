ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ I was very impressed. This is high quality food at very reasonable prices.  The Peking duck bun is amazing, and only $3. We entered the restaurant not knowing much about it, and left knowing that we'll definitely be coming back again. I should mention that the staff is exceptionally welcoming too!
