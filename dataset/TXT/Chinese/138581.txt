QpOAv584eb-ecG4TLEm95g Love this place. We always order from them every Thanksgiving and Christmas, and the experience with them is always outstanding. The food is always ready on time for me to easily pick it up. They always bag it up perfectly so that nothing ever leaks in my car. I always get the beef chow fun and it's always been created with the perfect amount of sauce and seasoning. Another favorite is the eggplant tofu. It comes covered in sauce but do not be afraid; they've added the perfect amount of seasoning so it's not too salty at all. I also ordered the Singapore noodles today. Definitely recommend if you've ever tried it before, it was just a little dry today since I picked up the food a little late. TLDR: I'm a regular at this place and will continue ordering from here since the food is always outstanding and fast.
