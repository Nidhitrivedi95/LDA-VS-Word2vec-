-rx-9Ra2OHfmD1yaUS-CMg Months ago, I headed out to grab a quick lunch and decided it would be a good idea to Google the area and find a new restaurant I've yet to try.  I picked Axia Restaurant & Bar in Mississauga.  This restaurant serves a variety of Asian cuisine - Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Malaysian, Singaporean, and Indonesian.  What appealed to me in particular were the photographs of the décor and the 'Incedible' lunch menus that they display on their website.  I just hope they don't compromise quality by offering variety.

I ordered the chirashi sushi from their 'Incredible $10.88' lunch menu thinking it would be appropriate for a quick lunch.  Including our table, there was only one other table that was occupied by customers.  I haven't been back since to know how the crowd stands today, but seeing they have a fair amount of reviews on Urbanspoon, they've probably raked in steady waves of customers.  The chirashi was beautifully made and the fish tasted fresh which is my main concern when eating raw seafood.  They also gave a decent amount of fish.
