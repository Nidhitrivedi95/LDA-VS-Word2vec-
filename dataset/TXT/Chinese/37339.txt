anGYRueZJKYCJefKFccfjA We visited today Tuesday Jan 26, 2016 at ~7 pm. Outdoor temp minus 2. Only 2 tables were occupied. By the time we left at 9, there were 5 tables full.

2/5 - Quality of the ingredients
Neutral on service
4/5 - Ventilation
No raw eggs on the menu :(

# of items on the ingredients is kinda skimpy.

$17.99 + tax 
Unlike some AYCE, tip is not automatically included.

Will definitely come back again ... in 2026.
