EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ Worth for you cost, food is tasty and I like spicy as I am from South India and as I asked for extra spicy they really cooked chicken fried rice and Penang curry as I was expecting to eat. Definitely good place for Togo style, restaurant ambiance is not good. Very near to stratosphere hotel and casino.
