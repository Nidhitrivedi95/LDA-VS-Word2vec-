Kw06PxDkF8gNMVWntmBKTw By far, the best wonton noodles I've ever had. Used to go to this place as a kid with the family. Went back to it recently and now I really understand what an outstanding bowl of noodles they serve. The wontons are the size of a child's fist. The noodles are firm and not soggy. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.
