0VtWeDkqzj9CE3MF0geWYA My goto places to eat Chinese are at Asian Legend and Congee Queen.  I wanted to try a new place.  Google gave it 3.8/5 stars and facebook 4.9/5.  My fiance and a friend accompanied me on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  The food at this place has been the worst Chinese food since I've lived here for 18 months.  I can only recall that I ordered rice and an entree of soya chicken and char su pork.  Like a previous reviewer, I didnt find the rice fresh.   The tea was not very good. The chicken and char su were nothing special.  I can't recall my fiancee's or friend's dishes but they agreed that we wouldnt be coming back.  On the plus side, I can say that the wait staff was attentive that day.
