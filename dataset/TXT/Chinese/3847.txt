_ONkRPvpIYdCuj9u6cIPeA Came for dim sum on an early Saturday and just got in before the lines started.  A not very large dim sum place in Market Village.  They were having a special while we were in town, with all dim sum only costing 2.50 on wkends (and lower still on wkdays).  Dim sum came off rolling food carts, and there seemed to be a reasonably decent variety available.

We had the pig's blood (excellent), spinach in broth (very good), seafood dumpling in soup (very good), steamed beef rice rolls (very good), beef tripe and offal with turnip (so-so).

Overall, seems a solid spot for dim sum, with a really great price tag.
