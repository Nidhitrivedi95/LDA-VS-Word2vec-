tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw Went on a Friday night to order a Togo order here. The staff was very friendly as well as helpful. Had a glass of wine while we waited. Wish I would've gotten the servers name because he was very kind. We ordered pork chow mien as well as spicy shrimp with vegetables. Both were very good, much better than we've had before in Phoenix. Both dishes were prepared to perfection. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some tasty Chinese.
