CZzRtq0HQKwbBaJJi-Xpnw Been back a couple more times. Still provided with prompt and courteous service by the owners, the kids not so much.

Still think the chicken could be better. The shrimp and broccoli is a good alternative, could use a few more shrimp though. 

General Tso could be a lot better. While the sauce is awesome and has a good balance of the sweet and spicy, it is far from crispy as General Tso usually is. I attribute this to being served in a plastic with no ventilation. It just makes the saucy chicken soften up an cook in all the heat compacted in. Usually it's crispier when served in styrofoam containers. I don't live more than 5 minutes away and have always showed up while my orders will still being made...just not sure while the general Tso chicken is more soggier.

Whatever, I like china cafe for the most part, despite it just being typical Amercanized fare.
