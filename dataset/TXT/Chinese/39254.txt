Av5toUG7wweXfiX6FW4F0A I am super obsessed with spring rolls and have had them from just about every Vietnamese restaurant near me. I tried this place a couple weeks ago and the rolls were thin and small and the sauce just didn't taste right. I also had the beef Pho which was good but I would rather go elsewhere for my cravings.
