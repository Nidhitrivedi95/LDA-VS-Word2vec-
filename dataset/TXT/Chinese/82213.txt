h7As2jB8bhfFxCMCvdssWA If you are looking for a cheap, large portioned, greasy, fast lunch.....well then this is your place. If you decide to eat here, do yourself a favor and use their restroom. I guarantee you will have an authentic third world experience. The service here is Amazing. Everyone is friendly and the food comes out lightning fast. The egg drop soup is good, the rest, not so much. 

I ordered the combo Chicken Lo Mein. This plate comes with a decent tasting egg roll, and fried rice. When I say fried rice, I mean just that. It's brown colored flavorless rice. Nothing more, nothing less. Just rice. Everything was bland and coated in oil. Way too much oil. I spat out one oddly flavored bite of chicken and reluctantly continued eating. I was hungry, so I covered everything in soy sauce and continued my mission. 

I also ordered the Crab Puffs. I love crab puffs. These are not CRAB puffs. They are CHEESE puffs. Greasy, bland cream cheese wontons. I only ate two. The rest went into the trash. 

I can say with great certainty that the service is nice and welcoming, but the facility and the food seem to be out to kill you. The fortune cookie was the best part of my meal. Well, the polite staff was nice too. Not nice enough to get me back in the door though. Soooo, thanks for the let down Yelpers. 4 stars? I think not.
