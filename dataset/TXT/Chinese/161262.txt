UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ Pineapple curry was really good!  I got a 7 out of 10 as far as heat, and it was just a slight tingle to enhance flavor but not a serious spice. Will bump up to 8 next time. Most Thai places I go to don't even have it, so this is going to be my got to Thai place.  

Service was fast and friendly; despite a slight language barrier.  Good food, good tea.  It's been over a month since came in here so I can't remember too many specifics.  I just realized I hadn't left a review and I felt like I should since I liked this place so much.

*Went back again.  Just realized that they don't spice their curry at all if you don't make it a point to tell them to. Came out really bland, I asked them and they brought me a cup full of the spices they use. Problem solved
