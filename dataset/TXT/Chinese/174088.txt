WbQOuI7mVST8XrJotWq9fA Went back for the first time in a while and wondered why I didn't see that gruff old guy at the counter hacking pork and being all surly. (It didn't bother me at all, he was part of the appeal of this place to me.)

Then the food came and I realized something weird is going on here. The place is under new management and the food was terrible. Noodles were barely cooked and everything was drenched in salt. I got that weird thing you get sometimes at cheap Chinese buffets that load up the food with MSG and too much sauce where you break into a bit of a sweat and you feel dizzy afterwards.

Too bad. Same thing happened to one of my other favorites, San Francesco Foods, looks like the old people are cashing out their businesses as rents in downtown are getting just too steep to justify continued operation.
