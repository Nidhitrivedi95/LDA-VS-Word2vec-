aeROhG8M_G-W5L6XhD3TXA Used to come for dim sum but will NEVER RETURN AGAIN after today's worst restaurant experience. 

1. We ordered a large congee but got a small. Asked the waiter nicely & Instead of acknowledging their mistake the first thing they did was to blame us for not writing it on the order sheet (which we did). After double checking they realized it was their mistake and changed the order.

2. The beef rice roll was served to us with RAW BEEF, I accidentally swallowed a piece before realizing it was 90% raw. Waiter took it away with no apology and came back to tell us to order something else instead because "the beef one is no good".. Are you kidding me?!??!?

3. Wrong items being delivered to our table which we did not order 

4. Items that we did order never came. After waiting for 30 min AFTER we finished our meal, we were fed up and got the bill. They refused to remove the items that never came because "you can't cancel the orders!" ??!?!?!?

5. Food quality has gone way downhill but nowhere comparable to the most awful service we have received. 

If you're looking for a place to spend money to ruin your day and possibly get food poisoning while being served by rude waiters with attitude problems, then LOOK NO FURTHER.
