IBNWrN1k9E0E_bMcRD-GwA Was referred to try this place out and was greatly surprised! At first walking by no one was inside so I was hesitant about going in...but when I first walked in I greeted by a friendly staff. The food is amazing and fresh! They make the noodles from scratch in the back so it's fresh right when you get it. You definitely are getting more than what you paid for with the portions compared to some other restaurants. All in all I can say my experience here at this restaurant was a great one and would definitely refer this place to a friend!
