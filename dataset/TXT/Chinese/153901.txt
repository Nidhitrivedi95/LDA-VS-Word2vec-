TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ we live in the area but always had to travel to Frederik in Scarborough for descent Hakka. we ordered the crispy beef, chicken pakora and other Hakka staples. we were very pleasantly surprised! the food was fresh, tasty and a great blend of spice and heat. the price was reasonable. strongly recommend this family owned eatery if Hakka is your craving.
