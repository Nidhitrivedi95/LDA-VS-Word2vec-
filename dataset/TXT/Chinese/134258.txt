q_Oe5sLa138EA-AY6nggeQ Really authentic Asian food. Granted they have the basic American-Chinese dishes, but in this area they would not survive without. That being said i've never had bad food from this restaurant. Lo-mein noodles actually have a great chew to them and feel house made. All the proteins, including the shrimp have great flavor. Having eaten inside more than once, while you might be the only table in the restaurant as I have more than once, still phenomenal service and quality. I feel bad that more people aren't packed in this restaurant. Very bright and clean inside with authentic Asian artwork, tv programs, and great high ceilings. Just overall a great place, with incredible food quality and friendly, honest service.
