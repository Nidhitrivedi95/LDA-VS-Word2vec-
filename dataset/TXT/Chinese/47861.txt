Unfortunately we rolled in early evening and stone cold sober. The waiter barely spoke but I believe that was because of a language barrier, and the service was very sloooooow. I got the ham and cheese sandwich. It was really simple but actually pretty good. My friend's meal on the other hand...not so much.  She wasn't very happy with the portion or the taste.  My other friend was equally as dissatisfied with her meal.  If we ever go back, it'll definitely be after a late night of partying when we won't care as much.
