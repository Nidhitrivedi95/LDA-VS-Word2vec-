OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Just got back from a trip to Vegas for my husbands BDay.  My husband loves dim sum so I  searched yelp for a decent dim sum place to take him.  This was my first official dim sum experience (with the carts).We both loved it.  We went on a Saturday right at 10:30 when they opened, the place is nice ,nothing fancy  but didn't notice anything dirty about it.  We had one of the first tables in the middle right by where the carts come out of the kitchen and they would all stop by us first with all of the fresh food.  Service was actually good (maybe because it was at the beginning of the day!) Both myself and my husband commented that it was some of the best service that we have had in a Chinese restaurant.   There were probably 6 carts and all of the women were nice and opened the dishes to show us what they had and tried their hardest to explain what each dish was.  Luckily my husband and myself kind of knew what we were looking for, you may have a hard time figuring out what is what if you don't know dim sum.  The women are usually only able to tell you what meat or filling a dish had, however, they do have quite a few pictures on their website if you need help.
 
Some dishes we had: shrimp har gow (good), sil myl (very good), pork dumpling (good) baked BBQ pork bao (very good) , veggie egg roll (good), meatball (very good) sesame ball (good) baked egg bao(good)  beef rice noodle roll (least favorite, not a lot of flavor, the only dish we didn't finish) and my favorite the baked sweet bun (very good, like a Hawaiian sweet roll with sugar crumb coating....OH YUM!).   

Our total came to $25 and we were stuffed.  We loved it and will definitely come back when we visit Vegas again.  My husband even mentioned stopping by on Sunday  on our way out of town!
