IFXL6wMLBgBSGSiLBjtViA Date night with the lady. Very good! Had chicken/beef and spicy broth. Spicy is very spicy - be cautious! Very tasty sauces to accompany the meat, veggie and seafood. Meat/fish balls was too soft/mushy - sliced beef was above average. Everything else was average. Drinks were very good. Our server was very friendly - he recommended us sauces that go great with each food and how we should cook our meat. Overall great experience!

Went a second time and took my family - group of 7! Busy restaurant understaffed. Servers were nice. The soup orders came out wrong and the kitchen staff kept messing up the orders. We were all frustrated at the service. The owner gave me a 10% discount on the bill. Don't think I'd go back again with a big group - small groups only.
