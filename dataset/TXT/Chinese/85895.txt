hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q Don't know why we waiting so long to eat here...but well worth the wait. We had a Groupon, which is what prompted us to try Kawaii Sushi. We came for lunch, and the restaurant was about 1/3 full. Looks like a lot of people were ordering the lunch specials, which looked amazing. Big portions for a reasonable price. The restaurant remained busy while we were there with lots of take out orders as well. The restaurant is clean and modern....and strangely enough, I really enjoyed the music they were playing. They have a good size sushi bar as well as inside and patio seating. Owner said that it gets busy during weekend dinner time, but good news! They take reservations.

We wanted to taste a lot of different things on the menu. The menu is diverse and has something for everyone. We started with the pan fried dumplings which were big and tasty, served with a mild dipping sauce. Then we had an avocado salad which was sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and came with a mild sweet and sour ( and maybe ginger) dipping sauce. Then we had had an order of California rolls and veggie rolls. Both were delicious! Very fresh and perfectly seasoned. The rolls come with a side of wasabi and pickled ginger. Then came the veggie tempura. Super light, not greasy at all. Totally hit the spot. 

While we could have stopped there, we really wanted to try the Mongolian beef and pork fried rice. The Mongolian beef was abundant with well seasoned and tender beef, and a proportionate amount of yellow onions and scallions. We loved the pork fried rice...full of fresh veggies and great taste!

And again, we could have stopped there, but we ended this really delicious lunch with a sweet treat of tempura green tea ice cream! Yummo!

Looks like we found our new favorite place. Fresh and tasty food, versatile menu, great sushi, very nice atmosphere, and super nice staff and owners. Next time we go, we're bringing our friends! You won't be disappointed!
