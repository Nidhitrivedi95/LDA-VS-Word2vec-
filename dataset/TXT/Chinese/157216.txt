TTLDDEeUyOkM4JEsGkIYmw All the times I have been here, always ordered a la carte. That's the only reason I like made to orders as I request no/little oil, no meats or fish sauces and sometimes a bit more spice. 

Ordered a veggie noodle soup with whole wheat noodles, a fried rice and Schewan Noodles. 

The soup is the best as it does not have any fat, no spice, no meats and healthy. I add spice to it and the soup is the best diet food I can get. Tons of veggies and good quantity of noodles. 

The rice and noodles were amazing as we request no oil a bit of garlic and a bit of spice. Very healthy and quantity fairly good. 

Love that they take special request. Some cooks probably don't talk fluent English, but they do what we request them. The food is vegan and love them for that.
