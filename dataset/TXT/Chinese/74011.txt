FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ This is by far top notch quality dim sum. Everything was fresh and melt in your mouth goodness! The ambience is beautiful and highly decorated.  Chandaliers, projector screens, and tons of Lobsters, Crabs, Eels, and Tilapia surround you.  The service in this place is AMAZING.  Yes...even for a busy Chinese dim sum restaurant all of the staff were polite, courteous, and they even smiled. All of our requests for more water, hot sauce, and napkins came so quickly along with our food.

The utensils, plates, and even table cloths were all high end.  Needless to say you can tell right away that this place means business.  I went here at prime time lunch hour and the staff works like one smooth flowing unit.  Everything about their food, service, and decor is exceptional!

We ordered the usual dim sum staple dishes such as hai gow, siu mai, tripe, duck feet, shrimp crepes, deep fried shrimp wonton, and also got buck wild and added some hot and sour soup, snow peas, gai lun, veal ribs, and a lot of other things I am probably missing but every dish was FRESH and just so friggin good!

Next time I will be back for Lobster and King Crab because they look so so so scrumptious!
