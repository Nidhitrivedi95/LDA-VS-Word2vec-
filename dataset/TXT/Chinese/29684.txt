966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA Bookmarked this place a while back ago for soup dumplings. I love soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao)!! Also, after reading reviews here, I had to try their Tom Yum Goong Fried Rice.
Wow, good thing I ordered Tom Yum Goong Fried Rice! Thanks to the Yelpers :-) It was so delicious and had a lot of tasty shrimps in it. It wasn't spicy at all so next time I order this, I'll tell them to make mine spicy. 
Waited more than 20 minutes for the soup dumplings to come out. It was good but I've had better at Red in Wynn. Just a little better tasting than Trader Joe's soup dumplings. I would still rather have Trader Joe's ones for the convenience (done in 3 minutes! Nice item to have in your freezer!).
The service and nice and attentive.
Can't wait to come back here for the Tom Yum Fried Rice!
