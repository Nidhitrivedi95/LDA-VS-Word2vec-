Axd4Ggd3H9dLAWD__UHYVQ Came here after dinner on a Friday.  When we walked in, we were just blown away by the smell of oil.  The place is pretty low key, with lots of seating.  Menu was pretty extensive, but overpriced compared to other bbt stores.  I ordered the sesame milk tea with tapioca.  They had run out of the large tapioca balls, and tapioca noodles when I ordered.  The drink was good, but nothing special.  I think I may have been put off by the lingering smell of fried foods while drinking it.  There were some games available to play, but many of them had missing pieces.  Towards the end, the smell of oil was suddenly gone, and was replaced by a floral scent.  Overall, large BBT shop with mediocre ventilation with overpriced drinks.
