We arrived at around 2pm, and we were the only ones there by the time it was 2:30. Some of the stuff we ordered include veggie dumplings, har gow, siu mai, and two rice noodle rolls. The rice noodle rolls were probably some of the best I've ever had; it was not too thin and not too thick, and smooth as well. Everything else ranged from standard to decent.

In addition, we ordered the milky custard buns, which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND for every single person visiting. This is exactly how custard buns should be done: Hot (of course, cool it down before you eat it), yellow milky, and full of flavour. It was so good we ordered two dishes of it for a total of 6 buns.

Service was, well, not much better than dinner, but at least we were attended to this time.
