cxq_iu2Zl5jm6qLGfff5eA at first i thought this place was decent and cheap chinese food that delivered. but, the last two times i have ordered they just never delivered it!

the first time they no showed i had ordered online, after an hour i called and spoke with a women who had no idea what i was talking about. they still never sent it.

the second time i decided to order by phone to make sure there wasnt just an internet ordering system error. i spoke with one of the younger people who speaks english quite well. he assured me the food would be delivered with in half an hour. after more than an hour it never showed and i didnt think calling would solve anything this time either, so i didnt bother. 

waste of time and disappointing.
