AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA (We were a mixed party of two veggies and one omni)
     Service was friendly, with Chef Ken stopping periodically at tables to check on the customers. Very polite and cheerful staff. 
     The atmosphere inside the restaurant was pleasant with a small waterfall and some little electronic chirping birds (which, upon first hearing, led me to believe some real birds got stuck inside. But no worries they're not real ;). 
     We ordered: crispy eggplant, walnut shrimp, general tzo chicken, and spicy fried beef as well as their hot-and-sour soup. 
     Each dish was delicious although I wouldn't recommend ordering the eggplant and beef together due to their seasoning similarities. Soup had a little too much thickener, but was still tasty. 
     I did not order the Thai iced tea, but sampled some from my party. It was tasty as well. 
     I would definitely recommend the place for vegetarians as well as curious carnivores. 
      With our order we had to box quite a bit, entree portions were larger and I would have  dropped maybe 2. 
     One thing though, be prepared for a small strip mall parking lot and a dirty elevator.
