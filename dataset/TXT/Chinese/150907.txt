SxjNgkzAlUG-wt2rSbc2HQ I ordered their Deboned Sliced Grouper with Sweet and Sour Sauce. BIG MISTAKE. The sauce was overly sweet and I felt sick after a few bites. Their fish was just ok. The portion is large (it took me 3 meals to finished this one dish), but because the food was horrible, I had to suffer longer.

Also, the cashier aka whom I placed my order to, was not friendly and quite rude, even. He saw me entering the restaurant clueless (I didn't know whether to wait for a greeting or go straight to the cash register for a take-out), but he ignored me. This went on even when I was right in front of him. I had to take the menu myself. 

Tl:dr ordered a take-out, cashier was quite rude, and food was horrible. I will never come to this restaurant ever again.
