X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I'll make this short and sweet. May the owner of this bar forever burn in hell for charging $40 a shot for a  basic kamikaze it's bs! They kept packing the venue like crazy for Tiesto as well. So, even if I had the $ to spend for the absurd bar costs I would have no room at all to move. It was way too crowded for the venue size, and it's kind of alarming that they kept letting a ton of people in. I've been to much better & bigger  venues in LA & paid half the price. I realize it's vegas and that's how it is out here, but $10 a beer for domestic  bottles and $40 shots are absolutely ridiculous! Lesson learned though I should have pre gamed before going.

Please consider adjusting your prices or at least offer a happy hour option, I'ld gladly pay $10 for shots & $6-$9 for beers.
