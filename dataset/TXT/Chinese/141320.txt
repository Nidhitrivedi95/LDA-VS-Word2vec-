rEAFZFziiOWxSLsOLohccQ Ate dinner here with a friend last night for the first time. Great food and friendly service! I had the Mongolian Beef and they added extra veggies for me. It was great! My friend had a special fried rice with shrimp and pork. We shared the two dishes and had some to take home. I'll definitely be back. They also offer cooking classes on Saturdays. Sounds like fun!!
