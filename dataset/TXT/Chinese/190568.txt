yKuAM6kL5sSKtfoe9a3GpQ I love their hot pot very much.  We got half lobster, one giant oyster, shrimp, salmon each for our seafood dish.  We love their Japanese fish balls, lamb balls and also dumplings.  Their chicken and crispy beef are fantastic, esp beef, super tender and juicy. Their seafood menu options are very limited, hope they can add something more into their menu in the future.
