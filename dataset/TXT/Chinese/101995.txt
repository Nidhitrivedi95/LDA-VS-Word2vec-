The batter had some reminiscence of a cornmeal and had spice built in. One very nice thing was that it wasn't dripping in oil, hence it retained its crisp. Service was fine but the prices are way higher than they should be. Avoid any non-Sichuanese food here, as it is far too pricey for the quality or quantity, but since they nearly have a monopoly on authentic and tasty Sichuanese cuisine in Madison, they deserve a visit for their specialty dishes.
