taXKuFldSoerm9SXrckh_w I really liked it!  We wanted to try something new are so decided to give this a try.  The Orange Chicken was five start to me...really good.  The chicken lo mein looked awesome but lacked a little flavor..still pretty good..four stars.  I'll give this place a 4.5!  Give a try and support a new business in our neighborhood.
