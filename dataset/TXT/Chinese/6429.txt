0It4d0eFPJ5UnQqe6g2Z3w We used to love this place! It has good down hill. Sad as the owner is very nice. As others say, it is clear stuff has been sitting too long as many dishes are dried out. Worse yet most of the food is ice cold! unacceptable!! 12$ and all that I could eat was the icecream. At least that was supposed to be cold
