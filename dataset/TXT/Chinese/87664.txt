HVpwpXneaCWMeEBF7H8jpQ First Taiwanese restaurant in Madison.  Surprisingly it was good.  The food was not Americanized.  It was made to the original taste of Taiwanese food.   I love their fried chicken fillet. The bubble tea was good.  Their tea was not as sweet as Kong Fu tea (healthier). The black tapioca ball was chewy and  it was just right.  People were very friendly.  They came out to chat to us. 

We ordered the food at the cashier and put away our dishes when we were done.  Love this place. Definitely I am going back.
