yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I mainly go here for the Vietnamese spring rolls. They are so yummy and healthy. I've tried to make the peanut sauce at home but it just isn't the same. I also love the charcoaled chicken and rice dish. 


They get very busy so leave extra time to wait. Also the parking lot is terrible so avoid extra busy times.
