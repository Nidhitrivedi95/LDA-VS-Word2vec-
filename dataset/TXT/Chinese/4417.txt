_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Today we went there for lunch with a group of 10 people. TERRIBLE SERVICE! Will
Not return.  The restaurant was not busy and still no one helped us. They sat us down and didn't give us menus. We asked three different people for menu. Our main waitress had an unhappy face and very rude. She gave us menus then no one brought tea. They force you to accept very large lobster with very tough meat. We ordered extra friend rice and noodles to eat with the lobster but they never came until the end. No one offered water, waitress was never found. We had their congee - bland and watery. We asked for soy sauce and it was brought out in rice bowls, 10 bowls of soy sauce!!  Never before have we seen such thoughtless service. We brought a family of friends there for Father's Day lunch and were so embarrassed that we chose this restaurant.  Our food took too long to come. Not going back there.
