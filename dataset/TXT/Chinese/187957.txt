yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA The food was alright, but the service...not so much AT ALL.

We came in here with a group of 7 (they add on 17%  gratuity to the bill for groups of 5 or more). They sat us at a big round table and we had to wait about 20 minutes just to get our orders taken. We got the food pretty fast, but we were completely ignored after that. One of the girls in the group literally had to walk up to one of the workers just so she could order another order of eggrolls since no one was going back to our table. That second order of eggrolls probably took about 30 minutes to get to the table, which made no sense at all considering the first order only took like 5 minutes. After we were all done and waiting there for a longtime for someone to give us our check, we had to go up and ask the cashier for it, so they finally dropped it off at our table. Even after we put the money down on it, we still had to walk up to the cashier to give it to him.

I have no idea wth was up with this place. We were the biggest group there and not one server was attending to us. This place wasn't exactly full either. 

Again, the food was okay, but the service was pretty bad. 

Will not come again.
