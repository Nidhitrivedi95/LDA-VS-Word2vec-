The Won Ton soup is very simple but very good. From the Moo Shu to the Amazing Chicken if is all wonderful. 

The ownership has always been very welcoming and aside from one or two unhappy servers the overall service is very good. The atmosphere is not the greatest but it is welcoming. It is the best Chinese in the Robinson/airport area.
