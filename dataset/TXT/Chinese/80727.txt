GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g Had a fantastic 3-course $29 meal here the other night.
The portions were huge, which was a bit surprising to me. 
Everything tasted great and wasn't overly greasy. I had the potstickers, Kung Pao chicken, and the fried bananas. The chicken was nicely spiced and had great crisp veggies. The cream that came with the bananas was enough to be a dessert itself. It was so good, I scraping the bowl clean.
The decor is GORGEOUS! I liked how it actually felt like you were in a restaurant and not in Vegas, watching people gamble and oogle at your food. I appreciated that aspect of the place. The "bubble" decor is so cool, and the glass partitions are visually appealing.
Service was spot on and very polite.
