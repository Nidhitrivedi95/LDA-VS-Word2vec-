CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I feel bad giving this only 3 stars. Usually everything in Vegas is either 4 or 5 stars, and this was at the Bellagio!, but this place was eh. Good noodles but nothing special. I've had better noodles and Asian food elsewhere for much much cheaper. Definitely do not recommend. I feel like anyone who gives this place 5 stars has not tried REAL good noodles. Sorry...
