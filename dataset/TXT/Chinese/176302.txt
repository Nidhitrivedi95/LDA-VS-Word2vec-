wNlpUnbCwAsMAu9Z1wc2nw over priced for deliver

i ordered two items and it came out to almost $30.00. delivery charge is $5.00 when usually its around $2.00. they also push an automatic $5.00 tip on you when you order. 

do not order online - you will be paying $10 just for them to get it to you. also, more money for whatever price they make up.

stay away.
