ruHEkBY2ysclSFIcai4tfg Went with my girlfriend there since we were on the toronto zoo and were looking for a chinese place to eat. I ordered chicken with broccoli, vegetable fried rice and my girlfriend got chicken fried rice, chicken chow mein and egg roll. The vegetable rice was decent. Was the thing I ate the most because the chicken with broccoli was tasteless. Usually, this what I use to decide if ill ever to back somewhere. My girlfriend's food was mostly decent based on what she said but the egg roll was disgusting and smell weird. The place is on a ok location and looks clean. If you are in a hurry for a chinese place and you are near it, go ahead but remember to tell them exactly how you want the food. In my case I would have said add more soy sauce and some extra flavor.
