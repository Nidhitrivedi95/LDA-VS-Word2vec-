BA13Ogw1hQV8hx376j-B-w After reading the first review for this restaurant, I was convinced enough to try them out at least once. The restaurant ambience is well enough, the staff was courteous. Though this place does seem family owned and run. I ordered the Lollipop chicken which were delicious, and the same goes for the Chilli Chicken & Chicken fried rice. But the only item that thoroughly disappointed me was the house special soup, it was chicken corn soup with shrimp added. 

I think in the future soups will never be in my order. Anyways I hope to go back again & try other item's in the menu. Let's hope i'am pleasantly surprised and not shocked.
