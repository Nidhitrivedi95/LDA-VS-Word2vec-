And I don't feel all dehydrated and thirsty after I dine here lol (cus some places use a lot of msg) the beef stew is just okay... I wasn't impressed but maybe they just don't get that many orders of it. But the pho and vermicelli dishes are great! My son loves the fried rice also. Food comes out pretty quick and the stuff is friendly :)
