ylDv7nEgpzTTqecYDOTEVA I cannot share enough great things about Isthmus Wellness and Lisa Littel specifically. I have two chronic health issues that have taken years to diagnose and seeing Lisa routinely is the only treatment I can reliably count on to manage and even improve my symptoms. On top of that, my husband and I are trying to conceive and Lisa has been incredibly supportive and helpful throughout our fertility journey. 

I used to love getting massages but my illness prevents me from getting those any longer - they became quite painful. Acupuncture with Lisa is a much needed opportunity for relaxation and stress relief and I could not live without it! She is the best and I would recommend her to anyone, anytime.
