However, there's still a range of vegetarian options which include the green-onion pancake (do try), some vege filled dumplings and fried tofu.  The Har Gow is a bit pricey (at more than a dollar a piece), but they come in such huge quantities that you feel quite full after.

Service wasn't horrible, but we noticed that our servers kept accidentally spilling the parts of the dishes, both when they were bringing them to our table and also when they were taking it away.  They left messy stains on their own white tablecloths and just gave off a sense of incompetence as this happens.
