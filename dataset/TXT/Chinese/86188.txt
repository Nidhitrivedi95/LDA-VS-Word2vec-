HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA This is a hole in the wall place that I found from Diners Drive-ins and Dives. Its literally in a small casino called Eureka

Foodwise, this is place is a pleasant surprise. The pork belly baos are amazing. The grandma's potstickers were just average and nothing to rave about but not bad.  The sesame noodles were a tad over cooked and a little soggy but overall pretty good. The shortrib grilled cheese were quite tasty with the short rib definitely the star of the dish. The duck rice was approved by my sister who loves duck. She said it was more a duck confit than a typical Asian duck but still pretty good.

We had no problems with the service. Tammy was attentive and gave recommendations to our dishes. 

The biggest issue I had was the cigarette smoke. Now keep in mind I'm from Boston and definitely not used to smelling cigarette smoke at all nonetheless inside.  The smell was very apparent and definitely affected the environment and didn't make it a great place to sit and eat. I know this isn't the restaurant's fault persay but regardless I still think it should be included/noted.

I would definitely recommend this place

8.7/10 would recommend
