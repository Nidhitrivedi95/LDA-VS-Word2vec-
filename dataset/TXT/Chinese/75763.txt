we came here for dinner last night . xiao long bao is AMAZING here . ive tried them at a couple of different places now and this is the best ive had so far . it has the most meat & soup in the dumpling AND its not scorching, tongue burning hot when it just comes out . just perfect :) so make sure you eat it right away when it comes out . mmm i can have 20 of these ! 

everything else we got (spicy peanut soup noodle, onion pancake, some porkbelly dish my bf ordered) they were okay . not bad, not excellent . we had some leftovers and im munching away on the onion pancake as i type . nomnomnom . heh :)
