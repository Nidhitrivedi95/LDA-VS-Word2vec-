Growing up, holidays and birthdays were always celebrated at Chinese restaurants around the Phoenix area -- it was the only food my (Chinese) grandmother would eat. After moving away from Phoenix to a place without good Chinese food, I started craving it again. After reading the review for Miu's in the New Times online, I went to check it out.

This is a place where I want to eat through the entire menu, but I'm having trouble because the dishes I've already gotten are SO GOOD. I'm pretty sure I've never had real kung pao chicken until I had it here. The flavor is so complex and it has a lot of depth to it. We also ordered an eggplant dish recommended by our waitress. 

This restaurant hits all the marks: AMAZING food, FAST service (our dishes probably came out in about 5-10 minutes), and very reasonable prices. It's a total win. I visit Phoenix often and Miu's is one of the first things to cross my mind when I do. It's my go-to Chinese spot, hands down.
