jYF7PNnYcn3fWejv0ZE1-w Well, it took me long enough! I ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken, and used their on-line coupon for the dumplings. I enjoyed both, nice large entre servings. The pan fried noodles were delightfully crispy, but softened-up nicely after soaking in the light yet savoury brown sauce the chicken and veggies came in. The dumplings were perfectly cooked. The gal at the counter was very friendly and helpful. Will be back!
