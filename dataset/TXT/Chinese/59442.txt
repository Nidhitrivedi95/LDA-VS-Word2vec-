Whenever we have large family gatherings and we're in a pinch for some quick take-out, Pei Wei is our go-to restaurant.  The food is consistently good, the portions are big, and there's something  on the menu to please everybody, even my picky nephews.  I also really like their hearty brown rice, it's yummy and it makes for a nice alternative to the same ol' boring white rice most places offer.

The take out service is better than most too.  The staff is super friendly and they always make sure we have plenty of extra sauces and fortune cookies.  Maybe it's because my family are regulars, but the staff at Pei Wei couldn't be nicer.  This last weekend we ordered food for 12+ people and they got everything right. 

Lastly, there's the value.  Considering how much food we carted away for take-out, we were surprised at how reasonable our tab was. Although we've never sat down for a meal in the restaurant, I highly recommend Pei Wei for take-out.
