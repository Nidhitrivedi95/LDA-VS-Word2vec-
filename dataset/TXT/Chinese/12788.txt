2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg We went here for a late night snack.  Let me just tell you, the salted fish fried rice here was hands down the best I've ever eaten.  The rice grain was cooked to perfection and just a look at it sold us because the rice was covered with a lot of egg.  You would think that would make the rice mushy but it was the total opposite.  The flavor and salted fish portion was just perfect.  I licked every grain of rice off the plate.  It's insane because you can see all the grease dripping with the massive amounts of oil being used.  So bad for you but sooo good at the same time.  The ung choi was decent, would of been better if there was more bean curd flavor.  Apparently the congee was delicious too.  

I don't give 5 stars often but this one truly deserves it!
