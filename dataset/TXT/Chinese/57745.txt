D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA Stayed at the Paris hotel and decided to give this cute Chinese place a try. 

Atmosphere was great; we've got Asian lanterns, wallpapers, and music playing (sometimes).
The food, however, was lacking. I expected as much due to Yelp reviews and the location. 

The selection isn't bad at all. 
You've got a dim sum cart that comes very often with common dim sum plates. I got the juicy pork dumplings (siu long bao). Of the 4, one was only juicy and 3 was dried up. It wasn't very flavorful and leaned more towards the salty side. I also got the bean curd roll that was very good.

Out of curiosity, I also ordered their lunch special which was the Singapore rice noodles with BBQ pork. I've had these noodles in different Chinese restaurants and I gotta say Yong Kang's version was the worst I've ever had. The BBQ pork was OK. The noodles were too wet (not soggy, just wet). The chunks of vegetables were too big. To finish, it was too salty (salt and soy sauce) with very little flavor that resembles what Singapore noodles should taste like.

Oh, if you like Thai iced tea, I recommend it. It's pretty average.

Lastly, the service was very good probably because there weren't many customers. They greeted me, smiled a lot, and constantly (almost on the aggressive side) asked if everything was OK.

Overall, if you're craving for some Chinese food and you don't have the means of transportation, head over here. If not, you've better off going to Chinatown.
