k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA I stayed at te Palms resort and was excited try the new resturant... Walk by it late one night and ask if they were open, girl up front said yes for a soft opening and not a full menu, great a new place to try intro by the eater. It is now 9/8 1 pm and said told to try again at 5? Seriously I mean come on,you opened at 11 am and your closed at 1pm in the afternoon. GOODLUCK with that kind of soft opening and service!!!! Hope do dont close up shop and head back to Chicago, eater LV was all wrong all hype. I can PASS on this place
