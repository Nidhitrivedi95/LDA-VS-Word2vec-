Having dinner there is nothing special. Honestly, not great food but it'll get by. I do have super high standards as my father was a chef in a Chinese restaurant and makes superb food. 

Best times to go are for early morning dim sum, between 9:30am-11:30am, where prices are cheap as hell (usually $1.60/dish) or if that's too early lunch is always an option as well.
