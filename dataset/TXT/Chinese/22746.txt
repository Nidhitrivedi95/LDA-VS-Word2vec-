6PdHFAW72p0sSrMCX0mmbw Came in for a lunch date with my wife, we were hesitant to dine here but thought that we would at least look at the menu. The minute we walked in we were intoxicated with this delicious smell that I knew we had to explore further! Unlike many Chinese restaurants the service is good and friendly. The menu is very well put together. We ordered the hand pulled Ramen w/braised beef, sliced noodle with beef and a sesame pancake w/sliced  beef. The food was delicious and very well priced; nothing fancy but it sure matched all the wonderful smells. I would definitely come back and suggest you try this place, it's cozy ,the food is great, priced right and it's one of those places you must try. Enjoy!!!
