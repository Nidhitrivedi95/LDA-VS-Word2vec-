OV1zto9E3Nu0ht_f4QtFbg will NEVER come here!! Walked in today with a friend who was also interested in the center. No one was at the desk. We sat there for 10 minutes and still no one came. We opened the door a couple times for the bell to ring and finally Tanya came out. Hoping to get some information, instead she told us "I'm in the middle of a massage. You guys need to leave." Needless to say, put her business cards back. I and my friend will NEVER come back here and make sure none of my friends or colleagues will come here. So unprofessional, I was amazed. Felt like I was being reprimanded and I am a grown adult. Never coming here.
