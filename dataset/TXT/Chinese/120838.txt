Was in town for a weekend and had a lot of places to get to so got the food to go at 9am. Friend went in and ordered so i never got to see decor or experience the service. 

but the food was really delicious. We got har gao (2 orders), shu mai (love), some kind of pork steamed dumpling, har chong, chicken buns, fried salty sticky ball (with ground pork inside), radish cakes. This was enough for 2 Asian girls for both breakfast + lunch and a total of $35CAD.  

Even when we had the semi-cold food at lunch time, the fried salty sticky balls was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. radish cake was outstanding with the right firmness of texture and lots of radishes and meat bits that you can actually discern.  

Would definitely go back when I go back to Toronto next time. Friend mentioned that a lot of regulars were there when it opened at 9am on Sunday.
