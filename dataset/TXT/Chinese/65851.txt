eDtxNY64sFYGjeFPJYlZ6w Came here with a few friends for dinner, it was pretty late and as we were in the area we decided to try the place out as it was still open. 

The food? Uhm, yeah never coming back here again. I've been to so many Chinese restaurants in Scarborough, and this one was probably one of the worst.. we got their fried rice, which was okay (even though we asked for spicy, it was not spicy at all), the chilli chicken, which was DISGUSTING.. it literally tasted like squid (disgusting because it was "chicken") and I didn't want to take another bite. We ordered dry shrimp, however, she brang chilli shrimp with gravy? As we told the waitress, she just started going on about how we ordered this, and we just gave up. We ended up eating it, and thank god we kept it, probably the best dish we got that night!

The service was okay, the waiters were attentive, however they could be a bit more friendly.
