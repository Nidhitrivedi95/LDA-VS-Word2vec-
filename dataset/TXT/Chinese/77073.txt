GdnLwnezKcZwoP-fnVtPNg 16 customers in line the managers washing windows on the front doors, another young lady stocking the drink station, young gentlemen mopping the kitchen floor only one counter person working the counter and also working the register, extremely poor service as usual here. I know why he was calling in the windows I guess the owner district manager is coming into Mr. Lee I made mention to Mr. Lee about the poor service and all he did was smile Vegas sorry for the wait.
