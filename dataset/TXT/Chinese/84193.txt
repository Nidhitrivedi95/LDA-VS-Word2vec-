HG9m9eldYtnX_UeMt4Yy2w This restaurant has been around for many years now and I like to come here when I'm craving for Shanghai food. I like that it's never too busy (at least when I go) and the homely vibe it gives.

In general, love their food. I haven't been too adventurous with their menu and usually stick to signature Shanghai dishes (pictures below). For the peanut noodle, you can ask them to make it less spicy  depending on your tolerance. Rich peanut sauce but not too heavy/thick. 

In conclusion, it's honestly cooking so nothing is too strongly flavored (no MSG/salt overload). Would recommend everyone to give it a try :)
