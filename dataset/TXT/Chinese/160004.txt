U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q A negative experience was that we came by and the restaurant was 50% full, so the hostess tells us that is a 25 minute wait until I complained and she accepted to give us the table... happened to two other white couples, because we are not Asian... we felt like racist and this is a free country, must fix that ASAP. 
As a noodle lover I really recommend this restaurant, their variety of noodles is great and their beef brisket is awesome.
