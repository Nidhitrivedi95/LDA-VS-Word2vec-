YpnvKqeVD7dqZ9Mr0SGw6A Once again, Pei Wei deserves a 1-star rating.

In the past, I've had a recurring problem with the rice being served at room temperature, likely because they put the rice on the plate ahead of the main dish being ready to add to the plate.

Tonight my wife and I returned to Pei Wei, about 6-7 weeks after our last cold-rice experience.  I ordered my usual Mongolian Beef and asked for hot rice when I ordered the food.  I explained that the rice is usually served room temperature and that I wanted it hot this time.

Well, they served me my Mongolian Beef.  The rice is warm, the beef is hot, but he mushrooms are refrigerator cold.  What?  It's like they cook the beef first and throw the mushrooms in at the last moment just so they get mixed with the beef and sauce.  Nope, doesn't work.

Why is the food always served with some part of it being cold?  It's just poor quality.  Actually, I have come to the conclusion that Panda Express is higher quality.  True!

My wife and I have given Pei Wei so many opportunities to fix their problems.  We've been more than generous in giving Pei Wei the opportunity to fix their problems.  We've simply given up.  We won't be eating at Pei Wei again.
