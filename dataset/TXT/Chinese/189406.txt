yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Honestly, came here around 2am on a Monday night and was very disappointed. The wait was not too bad but the service was terrible. I tried to order fresh coconut juice but our waiter said it was sold out. Then I chose the thai ice tea. We got our pho orders. I then asked about my drink that hadn't come, and another server said it was sold out. THEN I see the table next to us and they got fresh coconut juice. If you're going to be lazy with your service, you better make sure it is not obvious.

The egg rolls we ordered were completely bland as well. The pho was decent.
