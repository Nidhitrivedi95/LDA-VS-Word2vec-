KHEkVJ7j0cqoMPFBqBHN7A I saw the dirty dining story on 19 Action News for the former Long-Yuns that was open in this spot a couple of years ago, so I was very skeptical when I saw this place open. We gave it a couple of months and see that they have consistent traffic during lunch time. So we gave it a try and I have to say we will definitely go back. The food was great and plentiful. For $6.95 at lunchtime, you get 4 islands of food to chose from. Granted, this food is not on the PF Changs level, but neither is the price. Dinner buffet was only $11.95, and you can order steak and they will cook it for you. The place is very clean, wait staff is very attentive, and hours later, I still feel fine.
