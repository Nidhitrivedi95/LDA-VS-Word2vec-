bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Loved it! Food was great! First time there and didn't expect the fabulous entertainment. Pianist is unbelievable and the dude who sings and changes his outfit to match the artist is over the top awesome! All wrapped up together it was a great experience. I plan to go back very soon and this time I'm bringing the family!
