What a mistake! We go here for the Seafood/sushi and it definitely wasnt fresh. I tried to explain it was a Monday and they were serving their "c" level dishes in order to boost their profit margin for the day. I said "seriously, dont eat the seafood or the Sushi tonight" but that didnt stop either one from getting a dish of Sushi and a plate of Oysters. 

From my side of the table I could see colors and shades that didn't belong on seafood and the musky Sea smell was over powering. 

After my warning I went back to my plate of spring rolls and spare ribs which were average and most likely past their time on the line.

The girls had stomach and digestive problems the rest of the night but me and my safe food had a great night. We only have two bathrooms so it worked out that we didnt need to fight for them.

If you want to play "buffet roulette" this is a fun gamble. Just make sure you have a clear shot to the bathroom.
