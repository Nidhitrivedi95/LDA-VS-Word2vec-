CbsS6VvPsIvpytUbLAu71Q At the end of my esophagus is a bottomless black hole.  

Sometimes regular meals will temporarily do the job of filling the endless vacuum, but sometimes it calls for something more drastic.

I've been coming to Oriental Palace for several years when I have an uncontrollable need to gorge myself, and in that time it has been pretty amazingly consistent as far as the food and service go, which is to say pretty good to better than expected.

The selection of items at both lunch and dinner is generally a little better than most Chinese buffets.  Lots of American-Chinese items, as well as some more pedestrian items (pizza, roast beef, etc.) for those that are scared of a little sweet and sour sauce.  

They also have a small sushi selection, and in the evenings for the dinner buffet, there will also be some more authentic items for the more adventurous (salt and pepper frog legs, anyone?).  

If you're in the mood for a Chinese buffet, it's probably safe to say you already know what it is you're getting into.  As far as these types of places go, Oriental Palace has been consistently good for years, and is worth your time to check out.
