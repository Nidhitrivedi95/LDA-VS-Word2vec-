VGZ_MJ7P3vSQMYyQf-mNjw Cheapie cheapie dim sum. So ridiculously cheap! Even if you go after the early bird dim sum, the deals here are still good. The food is decent but the service is rushed, and it definitely feels cramped (like too many tables?) so comfort isn't really high on their importance list.

They've got some really great lunch deals include $20 for a braised lobster noodle, a lobster fried rice, and a plate of vegetables. Seriously, $20. Or if you're one of the first twenty (?) tables, you can order a rice pot for $1 (but they choose which type of rice pot you get). So I mean, how can you go wrong?

This place is busy once 11am hits, and the staff are... nice enough, considering how rushed they are. It certainly feels cramped though, so be prepared to elbow it up at your table or to bump chairs with your neighbour. 

Worth it? I say yes. And their winning dish (besides the $20 set meal)? the egg yolk sesame ball dessert. Okay, now I want dim sum.
