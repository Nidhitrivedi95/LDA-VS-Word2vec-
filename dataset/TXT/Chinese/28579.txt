8PNXDkWz3hyZFi7E4tYhjw Solid American Chinese food. Did the take-out option and got moo shu veggie with brown rice. Came with "pancakes" (thinner tortilla-like wrappers) to wrap the moo shu in. My order was very tasty (a bit drenched in sauce, but that's a good thing when your eating it with a bunch of rice), and the portion was huge, been able to stretch it into 3 meals. Also got to try the lo mein which was good with broccoli and baby corn. Vegetables are fresh, didn't taste msg-ed up, and everything was cooked decently. 

Waitress was friendly, decor was nice and modern (will have to do a dine in experience one of these days), and take out was ready in 10 minutes!

Def one of the better American Chinese food restaurants I've had in the QC!
