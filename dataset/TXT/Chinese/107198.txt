L7iOEZLuvd3vHoX8Efi_hw If I could give negative stars I would. This was one of the worst and most disgusting culinary experiences I've ever had. 

We got there for breakfast, and we ordered a large range of items including the dou jiang (soy milk), you tiao, shanghai chow mein, xiaolongbao, etc. The waitress told us to order the Drunken Chicken which she said was particularly good, so we gave in and ordered it as per her suggestion. 

Everything was absolutely disgusting. The drunken chicken was stale and obviously bad, it was completely unedible. The only reason why she kept pushing it was because they didn't want to throw it away. 

The porridge was clumpy and tasteless. I could make better porridge at home, it definitely was not fresh. 

Worst of all, when we poured sugar into the soy milk, there was a DEAD FLY IN THE SUGAR!! She took back the bowl, and we told her to make sure to give us a new bowl. She said yeah, but it came back out steaming hot, much hotter than when she first brought out the soy milk. Which made us think that they microwaved that same bowl!

The xiaolongbao was the only edible thing but it was obviously from a frozen package purchased next door. 

When we got our bill, I asked her to take the drunken chicken off because it was inedible, stale and not fresh at all. Plus, she had been the one who recommended it. They insisted that that's the way it was supposed to be made and refused to take it off the bill. They were obviously hustling us, did not give a damn about the quality of the food and were only about taking our money. 

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.
