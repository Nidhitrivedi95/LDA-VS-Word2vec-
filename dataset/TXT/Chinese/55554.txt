cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw I have never written a review of a restaurant before but felt compelled to after eating the worst food I have ever had. I ordered egg drop soup and moo goo gai pan for carryout.  I got home and thought that they had given me the wrong order.  The egg drop soup had mushrooms in it that I am positive they did not clean before putting them in the soup. It was like eating dirt. The same thing with the moo goo gai pan. I had a couple bites of each and threw the rest in the garbage. Absolutely awful!  I had to give this restaurant a star because it wouldn't let me give zero stars....
