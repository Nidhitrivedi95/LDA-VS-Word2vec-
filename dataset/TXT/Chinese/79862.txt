gnkyosoOepBUqog7iDdggQ Been here a few times for lunch and dinner!

I like the food here and the service is not bad. I come here usually because it's a convenient location but if I really wanted to go eat vermicelli then Phoenix is still the best!

I love how you get to customize your own noodles and also how you get Presto Tea! Bubble tea ftw~^^

I also really like their soup bases~ my personal favourite is the tomato and egg super yum~^^

The service is ok, nothing special but some staff only speak mandarin so I had a little trouble communicating :$

Their prices are actually quite high compared to other restaurants, it was over $30 plus tips for 2 which is expensive for just two bowls of noodles :(

Anyways, this place has 3.5 stars from me and its not bad so give it a try! Will probably only come when I'm too lazy to go anywhere far :P
