TGslJNYtjNGIHWOjXe_6Ag I have been going to Dr. Kim for over a month now and have found him to be a very good acupuncturist and a very good person.  As I enter, I receive a warm hello from the receptionist, and sit in a comfortable waiting area for very little time, and most of the time, I am immediately greeted by Dr. Kim and walked back to a room.  Each of the rooms are quiet, clean, and have light music playing to help me relax.  Dr. Kim takes the time to talk with me and gladly answers any questions I have.   I feel very comfortable recommending him to others, as he was recommended to me by a friend who also goes there.  The office is shared with one (maybe two) other acupuncturists who seem to be as nice as Dr. Kim.  I give this place a thumbs up!
