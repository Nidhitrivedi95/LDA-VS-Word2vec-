_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w This place is completely overrated and people don't come here for the food quality but rather to take souvenir pictures of the the lobster and crab. We ordered the salty-egg yolk lobster 3 person combo. The menu says 5lb but they push you to upsize and charge you more. When the food came the lobster was bland and dry. After completing most of our meal we realized they had forgotten to serve the fish. When we notified them that if it wasn't already cooked we would rather not have it they insisted that we needed to pay for it as it was part of the set menu price. At that point, we were full and having to wait an extra 20 mins to take home unwanted fish that would just get cold sounded ridiculous. Eventually after having to put up a bit of a dispute he took it off the bill but charged a 10% tip without our consent. Ultimately the experience was not worth the money and our party was extremely disappointed and unsatisfied with the lack of honesty from the service.
