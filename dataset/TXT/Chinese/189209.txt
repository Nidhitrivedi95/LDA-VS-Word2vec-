yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Pho Kim Long is my go-to for Pho and Bun. I live in Henderson - which is a road trip to Spring Mountain but the food is so good and every Sunday after basketball games at Tark, my family heads to PKL to get our Vietnamese fix. I can't get my boys (2 &6 yrs old)  to eat anything but burgers or pizza but they LOVE, LOVE , LOVE the Pho. The only downer is the customer service. Asian establishments are notorious for horrible service and each time we go this is the case. The past Sunday was the worst. My son dropped his toy and when he went to go pick it up -  what looked like the Manager came over and scolded my son and then told me not to let my children run around! He was up for 2 seconds! It was really rude and could have been addressed in a more professional manner. Because of this incident I might have to look for a new Pho spot.... .
