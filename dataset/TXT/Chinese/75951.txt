g-ftCJsLjDZgYzrjUf7gng I ordered from this place because the yelp reviews were higher than the other one I've ordered from. Big mistake. The egg rolls are disgustingly soggy, my wonton soup came with 3 wontons and I had to throw my chicken and broccoli away. It's just not fresh ingredients, everything tastes like it went bad and the chicken was chewy. Very nice people but never again.
