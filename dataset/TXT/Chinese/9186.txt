1pZk5sw5m8kPTMdvIp6UVA Very disappoint how quickly downhill the quality has gone in 1 year.

The food and servive is now very bad.

Food wise, 

1) I found  fish bone in my sushi, which should never happen if they got their salmon sourced from a licensed manufacture (I worked at a sushi restaurant before) some restaurants cut cost and buy unsafe NOT sushi-grade brined fish for sushi.

2) the tetaki tasted of a chemical, and not like the first time I tried it.

3) we ordered 8 pieces of sashimi, apparently nobody can count in the kitchen as our whole table only received 4

4) the kungpow shrimp, had about 3 pieces of tiny shrimp and the rest of the dish was ALL VEGETABLE just for filler

5) we ordered rolls but constantly they brought extra rolls that we didn't order, if you don't finish them they charge you extra

6) we waited an hour for our desserts to come, we ended up leaving because it took too long.

7) they spent no effort plating our food, most of it was just arranged normally with no garnish, we spent 35 dollars on each person.

SERVICE

was also horrid, most of the staff could not speak English, the buffet seafood area was rarely stocked with crab legs we had to wait the whole meal just for someone to restock it! 

I will not come back to Ye's sushi anymore and would not recommend it to my friends/family.
