TTVXY5vOJDqC0_Je8UhK8A Whenever I want great carry out this is where I go. Highly recommended. The food is always prepared fresh and have never had a bad meal. Located a little out of the way the extra turns are always well worth it. I love their crab rangoons and the chow mei fun is a great alternative to fried rice.
