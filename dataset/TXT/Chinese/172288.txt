W_nU2qtu1AEDDCgkCo0gJg The curry chicken or curry lamb are good , same with Hainanese Chicken rice. A few of my friend don't like the curry cause the curry style are more south East Asian like Malaysian / Singaporean style with coconut  milk  in the curry.

Their fish soup noddles pretty good too so do Hong Kong styles bake (chicken/ Pork) rice. 

Lunch menu are awesome but dinner seem a little expensive consider the portion are the same as lunch but with higher price. 

Try to avoid the student crowed around noon to 1 pm. We usually there by 11.45 or later like 1.10pm.

The only draw back is parking.  Staff service depend on her mood or month of the day. Sometimes I got excellent service and sometimes I got sour face service ( I based on gut feeling and observation )
