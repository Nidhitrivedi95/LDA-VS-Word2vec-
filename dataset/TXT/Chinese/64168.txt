E4T1Z08kU1QmrYj8xh-Y0Q We have been coming to this restaurant since before it was even this restaurant.  The old owner went on to open A La Kitchen in Markham.

We come primarily for the lunch specials, but have dinner once in a while too, and they deliver to the immediate area which is nice. 

We have tried most of the menu and keep going back.  The quality of food is definitely there.  Definitely have the soup filled pan-fried pork dumplings.
