I am a big fan of the porkbelly that is sandwiched between white buns and of course the fried chicken. I can attest to the fact that the size of the porkbelly sandwiches used to much bigger and have recently not only become smaller, but more expensive. Yes, I am quite bitter about that.

The fried chicken is quite delicious and continues to be generous in size. There are also spices available in the restaurant to give the chicken that extra kick of flavour if desired.

However, let me just warn you, the service is very slow. You will need to be prepared to wait on average 10-15 minutes before any food arrives at the table.
