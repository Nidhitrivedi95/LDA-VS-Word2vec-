q_Oe5sLa138EA-AY6nggeQ It's getting "autumny" so we decided to give China go go's hot pots (all you can eat) a try. It's as good as their other Taiwanese food! We had the house bone broth and Tom yum broth twin base, together with a bunch of goodies of our choice (seafood/meat/veggie/tofu). Both soup bases are flavorful. And you can tell that they do not start to thaw the seafood or meat until they receive your order, so you can really taste the freshness (and the food does not take long to get to your table). If you frequently eat hot pots, you know the success of the hot pots depends on the soup base and the freshness of the ingredients. If any of the meat/seafood/veggie/tofu is spoiled, the hot pot would be ruined. But I'm happy to announce that this is not the case here. Everything is fresh and we thoroughly enjoyed it! Next time we might try their miso broth and Szchuan spicy broth.
