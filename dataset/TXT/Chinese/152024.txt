t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA You really have to know your way around a restaurant like Golden Harbor to experience it in full.  It probably has over 2000 dishes, and some of them just aren't up to par.

I went here for the first time 4 years ago when I first came to campus with my family.  I believe we ordered soup noodle dishes and porridge, all of which were severely underwhelming.  So I didn't go back again for at least 2 years.

After being riled into a large group of friends and people visiting campus, I went to Golden Harbor again and enjoyed a completely different experience.  After that meal, I converted into a proponent for Golden Harbor.

Make sure to try their three cup chicken and crispy tofu!!
