qy6RM3qsgXTanVH-TlJaXQ This place had TERRIBLE service. Each plate was set out one at a time. The food was not even that good and it took forever for our drinks to even get ordered. There wasn't very many people in the restaurant at the time but it still took forever to get our food. I would never recommend this restaurant unless you like "ok" food, bad service, and waiting a long time.
