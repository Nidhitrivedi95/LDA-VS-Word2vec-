1qTx9z8RMz7RIYKAfnpZ0A A group of 10 of us had a very mediocre meal here on a late Saturday night.  First of all, the waiter refused to acknowledge a simple modification on one of the orders.  We asked for the manager twice, and the waiter said "I don't know his name".  Huh?

The food was overpriced (this is downtown, not the Strip).  This would have been fine with us, but the quality was not good.  The Hot N Sour soup had a syrupy taste to it.  I asked for my Cashew Chicken dish to be very spicy, and it had no spice at all.  

On the plus side, it did have a nice atmosphere and decor.
