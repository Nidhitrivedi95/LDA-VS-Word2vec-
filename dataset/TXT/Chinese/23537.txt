6vV13vQlpcDtfOIVyDruvQ Ended up at this cha-chang tang with my family at the mall after finding out the shanghai restaurant was shut down. 

Food: Cheap prices, cheap food, but huge ass portions. I ordered roast duck vermicelli during high tea time. Aside from the soup and hot drink that comes with your meal, you really get what you paid for cause I literally got a huge bowl of noodles in soup with one duck leg. Taste wise, it really isnt anything special. Bring someone who can read Chinese cause deals are posted on the wall. 

Service: Pretty much non-existent and lacking even for a chinese cafe. Waitresses were either sassy or ignoring our table when we called for them?? Dirty dishes are practically thrown and wheeled around into a cart in the already cramped space. Yikes. 

Decor: small space means long wait times. Also very noisy. Very typical of a chinese cafe. Could be revamped and cleaned up.
