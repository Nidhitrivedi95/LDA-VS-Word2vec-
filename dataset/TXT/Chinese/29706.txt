966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA Normally I try to stay away from the Las Vegas Chinatown, because the atmosphere is old and a bit unsafe. I was told about a "newer" section with better Chinese food and was recommended this restaurant.

We had the:
1. Chicken wings: 6 wings that were favored pretty well. Size was pretty small compared to other wing places.
2. House chow mein: Pretty small for the price and didn't have too much taste.
3. Pan fried rice cake with egg: An extra $1 for a cracked egg on top. The egg on top was worth the extra $1. This was the best dish we had here. It was something different and had good taste.
4. Shrimp chow fun: Pretty small but tasted pretty good.

The four of us were still a bit hungry afterwards and the bill was a bit pricey for what we ate. We didn't want to get the dessert and preferred to go elsewhere. They has shaved ice, but after seeing their dishes we didn't want to take a chance.The workers were friendly but a bit clumsy. All in all, I don't see myself going off the strip to this place again. There were some restaurants across the street that seem to have more people and I rather go try something else if I leave the strip.
