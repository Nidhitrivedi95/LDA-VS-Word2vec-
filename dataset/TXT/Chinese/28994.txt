The restaurant is part of a commercial plaza building with very little parking and all of the parking spaces are reserved for each of the commercial units there.
Finding parking is next to impossible and even though the parking lot across the street is empty, a parking attendant who stands around there will give you a hard time. The attendant will guide to you another parking lot just down the road, but no parking spaces that are not reserved exists there.
I'd guess it's best to drop off a member of your party to get a table as the wait could be very long which is almost enough time to find an illusive parking space.

If you must go and don't want to go through the maddening hunt for a parking space, drive onto the parking lot across the street from the south side, far from the restaurant and park closer to the north side but not too close to the restaurant. Be sure to park next to other cars so it looks like you are there to go to the office building for the parking lot and not the restaurant -- it may seem strange on a weekend when most of the offices are closed there. And make sure the parking attendant doesn't see you.

I don't know why they ticket cars when the lot is mostly empty and you are not taking parking spaces away from the office building which is at the other end of the lot.
If this restaurant is smart enough they should work out an agreement with the office building across the street to use their northern portion of their lot.
This is no way to subject their customers to this kind of nonsense!
Parking is such a turn off and I don't want to go through this experience again, especially for an ok dim sum meal with very slow service.
