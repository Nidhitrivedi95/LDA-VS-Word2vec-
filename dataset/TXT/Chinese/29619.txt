966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA First time here and read decent reviews. Food was enjoyable. Ordered the chef chicken wings and wonton soup as appetizers and ribeye and rice omelet along with chicken chow mein as entrees. Highly recommend the wings, will order again. All the food came out at once even though we requested appetizers first. 
You won't be disappointed as everything was fresh and full of flavor! 
 $40 dinner not bad. :)
