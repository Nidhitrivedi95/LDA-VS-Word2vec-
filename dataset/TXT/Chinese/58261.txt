dblGQtHAzNy1ACis1m2shw I don't know why this place doesn't have more 4 and 5 star reviews.  The food is awesome.  I live in Socal and always make it a point to eat here when I'm in town.  The food is made fresh and the price is right.  This was my first time at this location and it was as good as the other location( in Henderson).   My wife and I each chose a dinner combo.  It comes with soup( we got won ton, very flavorful broth), egg roll, rangoon( skipped), rice( brown, white or pork fried) and an entree.  I wanted Moo Goo Gai pan.  It was not an option, but the server said " No problem).  My wife ordered orange chicken made with white meat( 1.00 extra).  The food was hot and fresh and I had plenty for lunch the next day.
