If I ever told my mom I ordered this and passed it off as Chinese food, she would disown me.  

Pros: They have a huge menu.  Not too expensive
Cons: Full of grease, meat seems over tenderized, and the actual decor of the restaurant is very sketch.  Each time I step in here, I feel like I'm in a basement or a really old restaurant kitchen and I want to leave right away.

Verdict: If you are looking for fake Asian food, with plenty of grease and MSG - go ahead, come here (but please don't call it Chinese food, at least have the decency to call it Westernized Chinese), but if you want authentic, don't bother.
