cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg Came to this place because of YELPs high rankings. When you first enter there is no hostess station or any area so you're left standing with everyone awkwardly looking at you since the door faces the dining area. When we were finally seated we got the beef pie, beef and broccoli stir fry and sezechuan chicken. The beef cakes were really good, but the beef and broccoli and the chicken was mediocre. I'd come here to try their dumplings and other small dishes that they are making in the window, but otherwise I wouldn't come here again... Especially with the service.
