uxSL4FHWiO-fr2iae_d3Bw I am not sure why they were having people to wait to be seated but they had at least 18 of us waiting for over 15 minutes. There were only 2 in our party. We left, so not sure how much longer it would have been. I could easily see 9 tables open. Maybe not enough staff. The speed they were seating the ones that eventually got seated was uncalled for. The manager stood near the front podium and never once helped to seat or check in people. Maybe slipping them money would have helped but they are far from being that type of restaurant. We weren't the only ones who left, too many better options around worth waiting for.
