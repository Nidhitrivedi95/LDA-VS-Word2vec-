ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ Really good milk tea. The banana milk tea with pearls is good. Get it half sweet and no ice. I also have had the roasted milk tea with grass jelly (also half sweet and no ice). I wasn't sure if I would like the grass jelly, but it's great. One thing is that it floats so you don't get much of it until some of the liquid is gone. Next time I will get the pearls and the grass jelly since the pearls sink, that way I'll have yummy extras throughout the whole drink.
