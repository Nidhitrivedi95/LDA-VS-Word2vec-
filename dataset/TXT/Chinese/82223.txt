H7rUNMLOYNWKXTLx9poRXg There's not a whole lot of choices for dim sum in Etobicoke/Mississauga besides Sam Woo, Emerald, Tremendous, and the restaurant formerly known as Sun Sun. So when we get tired of those ones, we cycle back to Happy Jade.

We hadn't been to back to Happy Jade for at least a year.  We were turned off previously because one of dim sum dishes (rice rolls with shrimps) had a very chemically taste.

We decided to give Happy Jade another chance for dim sum.  Arrived around 11:30am on a Saturday.  Restaurant was almost full and we were able to snag the last available table.  

They have cart service so a few things that we got were cold by the time they arrived at our table (spring rolls, shrimp won tons, egg plants w/ shrimp).  But everything that passed in the steam carts were hot and fresh.  We didn't see congee so we ordered it directly from a waitress.

They have most of the standard dim sum fare except mango pudding.  They did have fresh wife cookies (lo po beng) that were amazing...still a bit warm, fluffy layers and a nice filling.  

Cart ladies are quite friendly and most speak a bit of English but wait staff can be a bit difficult to flag down.  Also, they did not ask what kind of tea we would like.  Maybe because I was with the gwai lo they didn't think it would matter?

The dim sum is classified as S, M, L but not sure what the pricing was.  Most of the dishes fell into the M category.  Pricing for 2 smalls, 7 mediums and 2 large, plus the congee came to roughly $40.  So average pricing, not outrageous.

We will be back for those fresh lo po beng!
