U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Awesome!  Food extra yummy. Service was incredibly prompt and courteous. The waitress was very helpful in choosing food, and with advice on how to eat it most appropriately.  I had the duck noodle soup which was incredible. My friend had lamb "pancakes" which were just amazing.
