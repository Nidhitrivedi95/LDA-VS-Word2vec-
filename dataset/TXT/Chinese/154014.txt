They had lunch specials at the time we came so we decided to order a chicken and broccoli entree which comes with soup, rice, a fried wonton. I decided to get my wonton noodle soup which was also available on their lunch specials for $6.95. There were a lot of reviews raving about their dumplings as well so we had to order some beef and onion pan fried dumplings. Everything came out shortly except the dumplings since they took a bit longer. I really enjoyed our meal especially the wonton noodle soup. They used a slightly thicker noodle than I'm used to but it was still delicious. I'm sure they can substitute for different noodles if asked. Our overall total came out to be less than $20 which is not bad at all! We left full and ready for the long drive home.
