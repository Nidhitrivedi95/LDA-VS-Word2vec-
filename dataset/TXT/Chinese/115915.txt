N3kBSwTiplhiCSyhEdrXrg I caught this place on my way home from a GoRuck event. It was a cold and rainy Saturday night and their food was perfect! While my order was very simple, shrimp lo mein and crab rangoon, both items were executed perfectly. The lo mein had plenty of shrimp and vegetables in a very well-sized serving. My only complaint was that the crab rangoon were not as crispy as I like but that could be from the rain in the air and it being a takeout order. I will definitely be checking this place out again.
