3PsmvwxetLz1Tzb-6mNhgA I love PF Changs, but this location doesn't have the same quality of food as other PF Changs, like South Park and others. I've been to this location twice and the food is like it was made the day before. Server was very good, it's just the food here is not up to par as other PF Changs that I've been to
