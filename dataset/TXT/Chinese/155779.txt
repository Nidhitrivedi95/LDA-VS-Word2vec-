Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w I have been coming to Siam for years. This place is a hit or miss. I noticed the food quality can decrease when the restaurant is at full capacity. Even with that said, this probably is one of the few good quality Chinese restaurants in "Chinatown". 

I actually have not dined at Siam for a few months, so when a group of friends wanted to meet up for dinner, I was looking forward to the meal. We had a group of 9, so we thought it was easier and more economical to order from the already prepared family style dinner menu.  

It was a good combination of pork, chicken, seafood and beef. The simple noodle dish had stir fry thin noodles and some bean sprouts. Yum. I enjoyed the seafood the most. Seafood included a soup, lobster and a seafood hot pot. Dessert was tapioca with taro, unfortunately my bowl lacked the taro. Dessert is normally free, but sometimes you have to ask for it! 

My other all time favorite dishes is the snow pea pods, clams with black bean sauce, beef with wide rice noodles and the ground basil chicken. 

Come with a group of friends, so you can enjoy a little of everything! :)
