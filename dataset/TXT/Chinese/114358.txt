MWJg4LxOm9c7VGi1KrL5Ug Soooooo horrible. Ming City is Ming Shitty! Their chicken chow mein was absolutely awful. The only redeeming quality of my meal was the spring rolls, and even then they were pretty horrendous. It was also overpriced and barely hot when it arrived. I threw out 70% of my Cantonese Chow Mein, and my boyfriend nearly finished his -- only based on the simple fact that he was THAT hungry.

Absolutely disgusting.
