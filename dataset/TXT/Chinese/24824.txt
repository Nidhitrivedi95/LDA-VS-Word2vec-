6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ I came here as a group of 4, the food there was decent, I ordered unagi don, and it was good dinner portion, flavorful; however we were not fond of their service.

As we finished ordering our food, it wasn't busy around that hour, there was only about another table there aside from us. we asked the waiter some pricing questions regarding their beer choices; just as we lifted up our heads about a minute later, half way through our decision, the waiter turned around and left to stand by the cash. We tried to wave him down several times to order but he seemed rather impatient and did not want to communicate. The other waitress there was very friendly, came over and offered us to check in on Yelp to get free icecream, we all showed her our check in's and she kindly accepted it. However, when the waiter came back to our table, he did not believe that one of my friend had the coupon, we tried to explain we showed the other staff already, if he could just go communicate to the other staff about it. But he insisted that my friend did not check in, and refused to clarify with the other staff member.

All these miscommunication between the staff/customers have made our group experience not as good. We just wanted a place to eat food and chat.
