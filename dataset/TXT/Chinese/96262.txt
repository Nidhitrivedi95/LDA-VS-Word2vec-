JkzqS4JDOpoHrj534rzvAA Wow! This place is unassuming from the outside, but the inside is super clean, the staff is so friendly and the food is amazing! We had carne asada huaraches, and a chorizo breakfast burrito. The hurraches were so flavorful and not something you can find anywhere. Highly recommend them. They also put hash browns in the breakfast burritos and that was delicious as well. We also had a strawberry and a watermelon fruit water. They are not overly sweet and very refreshing. Prices are great. I can't want to go back!
