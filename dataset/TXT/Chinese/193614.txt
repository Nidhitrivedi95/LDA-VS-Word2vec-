ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ First visit n had no idea the lunch menu was significantly scaled down from the dinner menu .. It's basically ramen, chow mein or a few apps (4) to be exact. Tried the ramen w chkn broth, tofu, broccoli, mushrooms , egg n kimchi. The seasoning in the broth was weak n that sets the tone for ramen; the kimchi was good but the tofu slightly burnt (grilled) n other veg wasn't memorable. Started w the black bean n celery root pancakes n honestly those were legit real tasty! Waiter was also friendly but def disappointed in the ramen. On the fence about returning ...
