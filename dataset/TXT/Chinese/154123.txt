td-NOo-k4xhfVmO5X92uAg Teri's ROTD for this place made me want to go and try some of the yummy dishes she had mentioned. I tried:
Szechuan eggplant and noodles-YUM AND YUM
Pork dumplings in chilli sauce-pretty good
vegetable pancake-kind of dry but ok
D had the Szechuan chicken which was probably the least tasty dish here(we asked them to limit the sugar in this dish so that may have caused the taste to be different)

They also brought us a small bowl filled with fried flat noodles and a dipping sauce on the side after we had ordered. The place looked super clean....

Overall pretty good! I would give the place 3.5 stars but rounding it off to 4.
