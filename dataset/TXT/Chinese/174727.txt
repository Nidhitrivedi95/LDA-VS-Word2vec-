WfgupKdYx1h0mKBmOmNQ3g This is a hard review their food is actually good, it's better if its delivery and you don't see how the place looks it's kind of dump and not in a great or charming way.   The delivery is fairly quick and it's pretty good in the very limited role of east valley Chinese food.   The problem is there service is rotten and check your order because chances are good something critical has been forgotten!   We like the sweet and sour shrimp it's good and hard to mess up but at least half the time they forget to bring the sweet and sour sauce and there shrimp is not good enough to eat not covered in there tasty sweet and sour sauce.   So the verdict if your trying to get Chinese food delivered in Gilbert give them a try but don't expect great service and check your order carefully before the driver leaves because they won't come back if you let them leave!
