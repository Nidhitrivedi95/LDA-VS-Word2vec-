PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg This is my second trip here. Came for lunch because I came a month or so ago for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. I'm even more surprised with the lunch. For $8 I got a lunch special that was chicken chow mein that comes with soup, egg roll, and fried rice. To top it all off, the food (with exception of the fried rice which is hit or miss) was all amazing!
