spDZkD6cp0JUUm6ghIWHzA Braised beef noodle failed as they use instant udon noodles, hate the after taste. 2 stars. 

Also had sirloin steak spaghetti, steak is marinated Hk style so it doesn't quite taste like beef anymore, but ok it's tasty. 3.5 stars. 

Grouper spaghetti... It's ok. 3.5 stars. 

Milk tea is actually quite decent.
