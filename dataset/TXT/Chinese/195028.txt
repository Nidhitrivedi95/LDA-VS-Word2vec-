I personally didn't find their food "wow". Ramen portion was small, soup wasn't hot, and ramen itself was kina soggy. The tsukemen soup was only warm. Not too impressed with the quality and price. However, in my lamb tsukemen; the lamb was really tender and juicy. Aside the lamb... I think other stuff was a-ok meh to me. 

There is fried chicken platter which we saw people/family ordering.. but it was a big portion and I think it was over $100. We didn't get that. 

The milk bar basically is cereal with milk soft serve. I wouldn't mind it, but again for pricing.. I think I wouldn't purposely come here for their dessert or picking up cookies. 
They have a milk bar fridge upstairs on the 2nd floor where customers can freely go up, pick their cookies and stuff then pay for it on the main floor cashier just before you go out the door. 

I don't crave it and I don't recommend it. I've experience a lot better.
