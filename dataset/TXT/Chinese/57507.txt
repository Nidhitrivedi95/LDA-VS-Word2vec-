D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw The review is strictly for food.  We didn't dine in.  We had to go.  We were worried at first because the menu offers Malaysian dishes as well as Chinese.   Too much of a hotch potch.  To our delight, the food was really good.  Basil Fried Rice was flavorful with a good amount of various vegetables.  You may opt for chicken, beef or shrimp instead.  Hubby's Pad See Eew more than met expectations.  The Thai Tea easily passed the test.  Price is reasonable.  If we're back in the area, we'll definitely stop by.  It's off the main road, but not too far away, in a strip mall.
