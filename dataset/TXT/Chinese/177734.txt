WzrMNz9eUF78RgZGDTS8xg I do love Chinese food, and for such a big city I find that Phoenix (or at least Scottsdale) lacks in options, either because they aren't the most welcoming of places, or simply because there aren't that many (compared to sushi restaurants for example. I've been to this location maybe 3 times since moving to Phoenix (8 years ago) and must say that I usually go because a friend as a "Pei Wei" craving. I found the food to be ok, but I'm typically one who doesn't like spicy food as I find it takes away instead of enhances the flavor. I wasn't too hungry and decided to take the chicken fried rice. I have to say that my favorite chicken fried rice is the one from Tottie's in Scottsdale that not only is delicious but always gives me left overs for lunch the next day. Portion was ok though the fried rice was a little sweet and the person I was dining with had the chicken lettuce wrap which wasn't too bad either. Service was disappointing as our food took about 10 minutes to come, but I must say the staff was helpful when I was asked where to get takeaway boxes as well as a takeaway cup. I'd give it 4 stars if after a handful of experiences I had Pei-Wei on my "must have" list but with Pita Jungle, Sack's , Subway, Rubio's, etc. nearby, the competition for "fast casual" is stiff and Pei Wei just doesn't cut it for me unless I really had a craving for Asian food that day.
