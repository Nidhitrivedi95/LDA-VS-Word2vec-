YKImxc9VimLbDl2sQN1BBQ YUM!! Very happy with this place. Now a days it's hard to find good Chinese places that don't make you sick, or are a chain and have the same generic flavors. This place was amazing. Service was great, very polite and attentive. Food came out fast, and serving sizes were huge!!!! I will definitely return many times!
