n72smZw1iVORdnjGfFT0FQ This place has been around for decades. The food is pretty average so I'll make this review short. 

We ordered the pork chop casserole with tomato sauce and the curry braised beef and tendon. The curry beef came out in a flash, around 5 minutes. The flavour was typical of  hk style curry and doesn't warrant any accolades. At 14.99 a pop though, the price is steep and isn't reflective of the quality. 

The pork chop with tomato sauce was better. But it took substantially longer for it to come out, almost 20 minutes.  The fried rice underneath the pork chop had the perfect al dente consistency , and wasn't soggy from the sauce. The porkchop also had a nice crisp to it.

The service is surprisingly very good , the waiters always seem to be on the lookout to refill tea and always managed to refill our glasses before it was empty. Pretty speedy and attentive. 

Overall, this place is fine for a quick bite to eat for hk favourites but food quality isn't top notch. For the price, you can find better elsewhere.
