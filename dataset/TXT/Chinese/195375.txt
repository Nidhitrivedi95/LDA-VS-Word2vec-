zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ We visited on a Saturday afternoon. We have been here a few times and enjoyed it despite the pretentious service you receive. 

This time was less than enjoyable. The menu seems to miss a lot of the regular items like the wings and the rice cakes. They had a summerlicious menu.  My wife ordered the kimchi with her lunch.  After taking one bite she found a hair wedged in the cabbage. 

Now I know this can happen at any restaurant but when the waitress was told about it she almost seemed bothered by the request to have it replaced.

Not for nothing but if you are going to act and charge like a top restaurant your service better match.
