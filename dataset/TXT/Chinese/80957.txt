GWNmYFQw3WitfTPt5uGMvQ Best Chinese food in Las Vegas.  I've tried many Chinese food restaurants and this is the only one I have found to call home.

Five stars for the following:

A) Food is absolutely delicious.  Always have to have my bbq spare ribs, shrimp fried rice, and chicken low mein.  Oh yeah and beef and broccoli.

B) They deliver!  I live in the southwest part of Las Vegas and they still come service me.  I always tip the driver good for making the long trip.

C) The restaurant is sit down full service and a place for a perfect date after a movie.  Taken the wife here quite a few times.

D) Always courteous and fast service.  I've ordered for delivery and literally gotten the order within 20 minutes before.

E) Accuracy.  I have never had an issue with my order and every time it's cooked exactly the way I remember it.  A great quality to have for any good restaurant.

If you enjoy quality cuisine and gourmet style Chinese, you won't be disappointed!
