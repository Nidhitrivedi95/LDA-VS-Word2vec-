_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w This place is expensive as hell but damn, it's good. The atmosphere is awesome - you see the giant crabs and lobsters in tanks around the restaurant, the staff brings the crab and lobsters out for you to look at and take pictures with before preparing it in several ways. 

We selected a 5-person dinner and they prepared the famous lobster tower, crab fried rice, crab legs, lobster leg tower, etc. 

Honestly, it was overall a great experience and I would recommend everyone try it at least once for a special occasion!

TIP: Pay with cash for a slight discount!
