vTlIUtYXdPxCk6UB746w8w For a Saturday late night hangout, it's a pretty good place. Tons of boardgames to keep you busy all night. 
This bubble tea joint is mostly for rich chinese kids that drive expensive nice cars. Therefore a lot of the boardgames are Chinese games I've never seen. Thank 
goodness they have Monopoly and Jenga! 

Parking is ok. It's always packed at night. 

Haven't tried their food but so far, the drinks were only ok. It tasted very powdery and sweet. 

I ordered the large Rose Milk Tea and by the end of the night my drink was still 3/4 full. (That's how bad it tasted..LOL) 

We came here as a group of 5. Each person is required to order at least one drink. We ended up staying for 3-4hrs. 

Overall, I would definitely go back - it's a fun way to spend a Saturday night :) but next time I'll order a small drink or food instead.
