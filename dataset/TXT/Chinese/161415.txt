UELnOgcu9BBUcHv8cqEq_A Came in to get fried rice to go. Was told the fried rice was hard. It was a half an hour before closing time and they had already closed the kitchen. Won't be coming back for this one. The girl in front of me was trying to get fried rice too and asked if someone could make a new batch. The girls at the front said it was not an option.
