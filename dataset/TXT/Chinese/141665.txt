rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g The crispy duck is probably one of the grossest meals I've ever tried. It was dry, overcooked pieces of duck with bones in it. It comes with dipping sauce on the side which was also gross. Seriously terrible.
My husband tried the Yui-Shan chicken. He also hated this. He said the sauce was bland and while the description stated cucumbers, they actually used pickles.
I've eaten there before and it was ok, but this time was sooo bad.
