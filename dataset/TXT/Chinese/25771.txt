7i32mNu8SRlZwLjSnV4Kpw A very typical Chinese restaurant with all the typical Chinese menu items. Do not order the peaking duck. The wraps were dry and the duck was mediocre and just as dry. It took us days to finish the rest of the chopped BBQ duck which we had to take home. Was also disappointed with the jellyfish appetizer which was so tough to chew we just left it, such a waste. The only thing I would recommend is the fried tofu which has a nice crispy texture and the 139B ho fun noodles with beef. I would only go here if I was really craving some comfort Chinese food that wasn't too far of a drive. Should also note that the interior is very clean and nicely decorated.
