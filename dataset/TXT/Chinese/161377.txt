UED302E-B2OyVr0mssARnA I was contacted by someone from panda after we got sick from under heated food suggesting I contact guest relations.  It would seem to me that upon learning this.. he would contact the necessary parties and make sure the cooks are doing what they are supposed to..to be sure no one else gets sick...it's not my job to correct the restaurant problems.  There was no assurance this is being done.  We are not interested in a free meal from a place that made us sick. And it's not the 1st time from this location where food is not hot or where freshly cooked food is dumped in w older food.  We took the time to write...most wont.. so it's lost business.  Getting people sick is not good for any eatery.  It's obvious they think a free meal is a remedy. ..it is NOT.  Your restaurant made us sick..ruined our night...it's not acceptable!
