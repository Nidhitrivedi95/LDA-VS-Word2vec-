CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I love these noodle type places in the larger Vegas hotels.  This one stays open a bit later than all the other restaurants at the Bellagio so that's a bit plus.  The food was excellent and the atmosphere VERY casual.  Just my type of place.

The small pairings are my favorite.  We had something called "Double Happiness" and you pick 2 of the 4 small a-la-carte items.  We chose BBQ Pork & Duck with a side of white rice.  Wonderful and easily enough for 2 on a casual late night dinner.

Give them a try, you'll like it.
