We came here after dinner, so there were some parking spots available, but it does fill up at other times. 

We decided to to go for Mango Sago Pudding and Fruit, Ice Cream, Boba, and Bitter Jelly in Coconut Milk. 
Both were typical of where you'd get it elsewhere, but the fruit mix was quite different, with lots of different tastes coming together. The bitter and sweet together was quite good. 

The only down side to this shop is that it is very small. Has about 6 tables that seat at most 6 people. Not the best place to go with a larger group, or when its busy.
