tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg I was trying to wait till I tried this place again, but decided eh, why not just write it now. The restaurant is located inside the Wild Horse Pass. The food is delicious too bad the service SUCKS big time! We had a plethora of appetizers and not one of them let me down. Our party was big so the service sucked at the worst time. They took our orders in order, then when serving the entire meal; each dish was yelled out by the servers deli style and then handed to our guests to place on the table themselves (if we wanted to serve ourselves we would have done a buffet). They did it very rude too. My plate was supposed to be served sizzling, but somehow the waiter forgot to serve it, as it sat on the table next to us for 5 minutes, then served lukewarm. On our way out (to dance) I witnessed the bartender reach into the ice bin with the actual glass she was serving the drink in (isn't this a violation?). I wonder if the service sucks because the menu is so affordable and delicious they are counting on return business? non the less I won't be back.
