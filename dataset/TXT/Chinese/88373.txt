I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg I went here on a hot February Sunday afternoon after a leisurely walk at a parkand ordered their Lychee Fruit Tea, which definitely hit the spot. My friend got their Thai Ice Milk Tea, which was equally as refreshing. Next time, I would definitely come back to try their shaved ice desserts. They have a very neat decorative wall with cute ornaments and figurines such as Batman & Robin.
