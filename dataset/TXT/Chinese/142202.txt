RJKbewB0SzRZpIvQmiF-dQ Wow. Seriously wow! You would never guess food so good comes from such a bad looking location.

Trusted my fellow reviewers and stopped by for lunch. Boy, am I glad I did. Ordered the chicken with vegetables lunch combo. The dish was near perfect. The veggies were crisp and tasted fresh, just the right amount of tender chicken, and the sauce was exactly what it good chinese should be... light, not salty, not syrupy, not sweet... just right. The rice was also perfect. I detected no MSG flavor. When you order a dish with vegetables, you should be able to taste their sweet freshness, and that's exactly how my dish was prepared.

If you put this meal on a fancy plate, you would gladly pay $20 and enjoy every bite.

I took off one star because the dining room is not much to look at. A little dark, a little cluttered, but clean. Obviously, the bulk of their business is take-out and delivery.

Note the name change: New North China Restaurant. Employees were friendly and my food arrived quickly. Without a doubt, I will be back.
