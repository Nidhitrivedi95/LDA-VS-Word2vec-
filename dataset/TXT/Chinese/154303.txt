TdjydrOFUSMUsTKdlXW6aQ Life is about decisions, whether they be right or wrong you will ultimately have to make them. I made the decision to try out this chinese restaurant and it was life altering. I will never forget that day. It's like witnessing the birth of your first child. The food was so good that it truly is unexplainable. The food is like your favorite cereal consistently good every time. I love this place and everything about it. You know on black friday when people camp outside to get the good deals on tv's and stuff? I am surprised that their wasn't a string of tents outside of this place.The people are some of the nicest people I have ever met. They are always playing oldies on the radio. Try this place out and you will definitely be a repeat customer.
