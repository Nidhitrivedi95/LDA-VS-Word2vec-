cGQKUOAZm_VHcQOJWbatog My girlfriend and I just ate here this was my first time eating at PF Changs but I had heard very good things about this restaurant. Starting with the service the server did not ever tell me his name I am also a waitress so I expected good service to begin with he was very quiet and when we did receive our food he never came back to ask how it was he was not very attentive at all however we both work in the service industry so we decided to give the food a chance since that's what we had come here for. My girlfriend got an appetizer of the edamame and the fried green beans the edamame was very Bland and needed seasoning the green beans were not spectacular although she did say that she enjoyed the sauce. for entrees I had the sweet and sour chicken I have had sweet and sour chicken from several other Chinese restaurants including take out and I was very displeased with the sauce and the poportion I've had better for cheaper. My girlfriend had the chicken fried rice which was fine but it's also a very easy dish overall we rated this restaurant with one star because we did not even care to stay for dessert even though the desert did look appetizing. I am pretty disappointed in my first experience I don't think that I will return again but you never know
