7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA THEY HAVE HOT POT!!! I mean honest to god, authentic Szechuan hot pot. 

It's not on the normal menu, or it wasn't when last I was there, but if you ask for it, they'll haul out the Chinese menu and there you go. Ever since returning from china a long time ago, I have really craved this dish. And hot pot's not the end of it! 

This lovely, spacious restaurant features a bevy of authentic Szechuan dishes. The wait staff speak heavily accented English, but they are so friendly and inviting that it isn't uncomfortable. Once they realize you're into the good stuff, they're full of recommendations and suggested meal alterations. 

There's lots of room, but every time I've been there the tables are pretty much full. I believe there is also a big area in the back for large parties. I know where I'm going for any big shindig I have in the future!!  

I highly recommend this place for the more adventurous of you all. Enjoy!
