_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA I was really craving Chinese food after a long weekend in Vegas filled with drinking, gambling, and general debauchery. In comes Noodle Asia. 

What I ended up experiencing was a) poor service (even though the restaurant was half full) b) bland food c) high prices 

Our server forgot our waters for about 15 minutes, brought all our meals out at separate times, and took 20 minutes to pick up our check after she brought it to the tabe. Talk about mind being elsewhere. Actually, let me reprase: Our server never came back to get our check, we had to flag the manager down after 20 minutes of waiting. 

In terms of food... bleh. I had the broccoli and beef with spring rolls on the side. I can safely say I've had $5.99 Chinese takeout meals that have been way better. The food really had no flavor to it, and I had to douse it with duck sauce and other spices to coax any sort of taste out of the dish. 

 Maybe it's my strictly American palette, but I think I've become accustomed to Americanized Asian food and get really thrown off when authentic Asian food is put in front of me. Who knows? 

What I do know is that I wouldn't be back, and would recommend all Vegas-goers to skip over Noodle Asia in favor of the food court nearby.
