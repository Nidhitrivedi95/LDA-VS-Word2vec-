SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ My family and I were in Ling & Louie's this past week.  We have always liked it as it is fast and can get us through in a quick time- which is good with kids.  This week was off though.  Not sure what happened.  We did not see our waitress very often and kept trying to order.  She did get the kids meals in early at my request.  But when they came out- they just didn't give my son the French fries he ordered and left an open container in his bento box.  

The Surf and turf was my favorite by far and the first time I have tried it.  I will get this again.  I will go back but we were trying to get through quicker and everything was very slow that evening.  It made for a late night on my daughter's birthday.
