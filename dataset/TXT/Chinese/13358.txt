2UFl9gLOQrSGY2sPu6U-kA Absolutely my FAVOURITE hotpot place in Toronto by far! The food is fresh, service is fast & great (compared to most hotpot places I've been too), and I love the buffet-style setup which allows customers to just grab what they want and how much they want without having to holler servers and write on those pesky papers.
