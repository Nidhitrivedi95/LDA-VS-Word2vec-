BvrG8XMpTtlJYWhOCbnpaQ Best Chinese food in town! I order take out here often with my boyfriend. 

The Mu Shu burrito is huge, we often share the burrito with another dish. The ingredients all fresh and the dishes aren't too oily. 

The service is always kind and friendly. The food is evens better!
