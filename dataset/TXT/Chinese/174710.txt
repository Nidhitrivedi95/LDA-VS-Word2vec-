WfgupKdYx1h0mKBmOmNQ3g I can't review the food because we only stayed for a bit.  We were not impressed.  The decor is tacky and the restaurant was not clean.  I could see remnants of food on the walls.  The biggest most disgusting thing for me was that the menus were sticky.  We decided to leave.  There was one other couple there.  Hopefully, they fared better.
