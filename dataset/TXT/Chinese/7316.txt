We had the pork hock noodles and the spicy beef noodle soup. The pork hocks were definitely better but both would have been improved with hand pulled noodles. It's understandable though, hand pulled noodles are a luxury and this place is good for what it is.

They have a special for $3.99 noodles and tea between 2 and 5 pm - sweet.
