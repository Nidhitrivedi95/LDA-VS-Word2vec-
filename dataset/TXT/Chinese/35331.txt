ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ This is probably one of the best asian buffets I've ever been to. The whole restaurant was very nice and large. The decor was fantastic. 

Lots of selections of food. There is a soup station which I loved. I got spicy beef soup with wontons. It was sooooooooooooo good!! 

They also had a sushi bar. Everything I got from it was fresh which is pretty surprising for a sushi bar. 

Lots of shumai and dim sum to choose from. Great selections of everything else too!! They also had a grill bar where they grilled items like lotus chicken, udon noodles in spicy sauce and scallion pancakes.

Tons of desserts and there is also a ice cream station! 

Next time I go to Canada I will definitely go back here!
