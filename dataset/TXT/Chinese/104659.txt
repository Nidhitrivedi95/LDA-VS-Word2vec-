kP2wC0luve3mT5fcdrA3nQ I cannot I haven't reviewed this restaurant before. The chef is one of the mainstays in Chinese cooking here in Phoenix (from what I have been told & read); I have had over the past 20+ years several different dishes here. I haven't been there to eat in a while; and usually get take out on occasion. My favorite dishes have been the soups, all of them. Egg Rolls, Fried Wontons, basic dishes like Mu-Shu Chicken or Pork; Kung Pao Shrimp or Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken or Pork. Last takeout order; got the Pho which was very good and extremely great value.
