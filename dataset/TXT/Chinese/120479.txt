O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw The food was pretty good although pretty pricey ($3/$4 for each dish) One thing though that urked me was their service. 
 
The food took quite awhile to come and it was a bit of a wait with each dish. They forgot some of our orders and at the end ASKED for a tip. When asking they mumbled and just kept saying that we owe them a certain amount for tip. 

I'd go to this place for a last resort. It's a bit sketchy and they have horrible service.

I do recommend their black bean ribs, shrimp roll, sesame ball, rice roll, and xiu mai(I think that's how its spelled)
