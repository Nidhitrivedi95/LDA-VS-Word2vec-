A6lKCuTrDSJ_eFKyumZCJQ Panda Express meets PF Chang.. 
Located inside silverton Casino(open July 3,2015).
You go to the register and order what you want, they give you a # and then find yourself a table (the table here are very high, I'm a shorty and I've a hard time getting up..hehe )and they'll bring the food to you..Made to order..
I've been here a few times and I really like the chinese food here. Affordable price and good amount of food.
Small and contemporary decor..
Their starter are not worth ordering bc it's over price so little food.. 
My fav. By far are their Tom yum chicken, beef stew noodle and pork belly bun.
