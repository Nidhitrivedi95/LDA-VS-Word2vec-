O7_rXHN_-cFp0TgiMaNulw 2nd visit. Got the "surprise me" sushi roll based on reviews...OMG. They know what they're doing. No one told us what was in it once it arrived,  but that's okay because we like everything and it was fantastic. It was fried shrimp and roe and other things I'm not sure of. The curry kick soup was awesome but the chicken in it was nothing special. I wonder if they'd let me sub that out next time (or leave it out completely. doesn't need it!). Fantastic service as usual. Love kung foo.
