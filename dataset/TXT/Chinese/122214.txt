OfqTPtPSQfCVxaSlY4qAxg Best Hong Kong Dining is the most authentic Chinese food I've found in the Phoenix area so far... in a restaurant anyway.  It's a chop shop... meaning you can eat at their restaurant or buy meat by the pound and they'll 'chop' it up for you.  You can often hear the sound of their cleaver working... chopchopchopchop. lol  It's reassuring to me.  It's sounding out authentic Chinese bbq pork, duck, etc.  

That being said, I haven't ordered out of the chop shop yet.  They have my favorite Chinese dish, cod (or random fish filet) in black bean sauce.  It is delicious here... fresh and sure to please any fish lovers pallet.  

I'll definitely be back and though it's not a fancy place for a 1st date, I'd take a group of friends here.

See ya there!
