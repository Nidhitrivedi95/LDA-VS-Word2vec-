yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA One of my go to places for Pho and vietnamese/chinese food in Las Vegas. This place is well known by locals to Las Vegas and visitors. During the weekends, Pho Kim Long will be packed especially during the lunch hour (as most people will come for the pho after a long night of drinking). I usually like to get the special pho with everything in it. The other items that you have to get are the fried egg rolls, the fried salty/spicy chicken wings (these are the best in the area), and of course the ice coffee.
