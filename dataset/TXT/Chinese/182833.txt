Prosperity and good fortune x 3?! Couldn't pass up one of these specials. 
Had the Chicken Pad Thai which came with a veggie springroll. Springroll was very fresh and crispy. The Pad Thai, well it was a fusion between Japanese flavours and Thai flavours. Yep, so the chicken had been marinated in Teriyaki sauce then grilled and then tossed with the Pad Thai which is what made the dish a tad too sweet. The seemingly odd combo was pretty good though. 
To be honest, I wasn't expecting much. I mean, think about it. Its a menu that serves Chinese, Japanese, Mongolian, Vietnamese and Thai. It's a chain restuarant throughout America and the interior is just way too stylish. (!) Its probably not going to be "authentic", so you gotta think outside of the box when you walk into places like Stir Crazy and P.F. Changs. These places are not targeting Asian clients who are looking for good old fashioned grub from their childhood days. Think of this as "Fusion". haha!

Now the issue of service that some other reviewers seemed to have...I don't know if we were just lucky that day or what, but we got really good service. We were seated immediately, our waiter came and checked on us numerous times and even the manager came over and chatted with us. 

First visit, I give it 4 stars. Cheap fusion, good service.
