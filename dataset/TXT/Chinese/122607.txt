OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Dim sun Heaven!!!!. There were carts after carts of dim sum goodness! There were things I love....har gow, shu mi, dumplings.....things I never seen...Chinese churro, cucumber salad, seaweed salad , tendon salad...and much more.

It for sure gets busy but I will be back time and time again.
