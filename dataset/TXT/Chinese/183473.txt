XPtDU14nu36LWt7_UagI9Q Happy Dim Sum is my favourite place in Mississauga to get dim sum. Although it might not be visually appealing the food they serve is better than those fancy dim sums. 

Most of the dishes are between $1.00-$3.50 which is super cheap for dim sum. I've been here many times with my family and the workers/owner can speak Chinese and Vietnamese and they always remember us because we became their regulars. 

Like they say, don't judge a book by it's cover. Though it might not look the best, it serves the best dim sum.
