QHZw2L6LV1qmExNJbfhIsQ Came here for my Aunt's 30th Wedding anniversary and there was about 6 tables of 10. We got here right at 6:30 and we didn't start eating till 7:30. Each of the dishes came out in 15 minute intervals and we were clearing the plates fast in 5 minutes because we were so hungry! The service was extremely slow for a Chinese restaurant and on top of that the food wasn't even that good for the wait time. Most of the dishes tasted bland and the portion sizes were pretty small. I think the only dish that tasted good was the lobster. I was planning to come here for dim sum on another occasion but I think I changed my mind as the food prolly tastes the same and hearing that it's overpriced, I don't think it's worth it.
