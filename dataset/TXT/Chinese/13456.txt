2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q Good solid authentic and tasty dishes at reasonable prices. Noodle Exchange in the Gold Coast Casino is our "go to" place when we are staying at the Casino. It's the place to get a bowl of porridge after a long flight, you are feeling a little queasy and want your comfort food.

It's not your "fancy" restaurant but more like your local corner restaurant where the service can be hit or miss but the food has never disappointed. Come here for your bowl of noodles, congee, BBQ and rice dish. 

The hotpot meals in the evening is a recent addition (I also understand it went away but then came back again) - and it is a good value with a broth base (too many hotpot places give you hot water instead of a broth). For anyone who has never had a Chinese hotpot - you put in the vegetables to cook and give the broth flavor, then add your meats, taking them out and dipping them in sauces to eat them, then after all the food is gone, you drink the wonderfully flavorful soup.

Noodle Exchange has the usual beef / chicken / seafood hotpots and the bases are regular, spicy and herbal. If you have several people eating the hotpot, you can ask for two broths - they bring out a divided bowl. But do give the herbal broth a try. Let it boil a few minutes for the herbs and spices to release their fragrance before you start cooking your meats.

I will have to make special mention of the sauces. The Hoisin sauce for the Peking duck, the Sate sauce for hotpots - they are exceptionally good.

Once again, a good solid choice for authentic Chinese food. Not fancy, just good.

P.S. If service was top notch, they'd get a five star from me.
