X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg This review is entirely based on my experience BEFORE even seeing the inside of the club.  Basically, super early into the evening, we found a promotor that put us on the VIP list to get in, (It was my best friends Bachelorette party) and he said that if we get in line by 9:30. we should be in by 10:15, because they open their doors at 10:00.  We got into line at 9!  And we were not that far back into the already pretty hefty line. 10PM  around and they are literally letting in about 2 people at a time, the line would move maybe a group of 5 every 20 or so minutes.  Basically we thought we were now at the front of the line, at 11PM, but turns out we were in line for ANOTHER line.  So just to get in the club we would have been waiting until close to midnight to get in, and WE WERE IN THE FRONT.  Overtime we left the line, called bull shit on the bouncers and hung out at other places, coming back two hours later only to see that the line was completely stretched across the entire casino.  Still barely moving.  I call complete bull shit.  I refuse to go into this club at this point ever unless someone personally walks me to the entrance doors.  WASTE OF THREE HOURS IN VEGAS!
We actually ended up going to BEACHER'S MADHOUSE and only waited in line for about 10 minutes before we got it, and damnit, that club was so gawd damn fun, best club I think I've been to thus far, and the people running it were actually decent, non money hungry people. :)
