E0zjBNt4_giYtJqUjugskw Had groupon deal and never would've tried this place otherwise. We went for lunch and enjoyed plenty of food for two plus boba drinks. General Tao was only mildy hot but nicely crispy and nice chunks of chicken. Fried rice was seasoned right without being too salty or too greasy. I'm not a fan of veggie egg rolls but I did like theirs. Love their Thai tea. Nice people and service for a casual Chinese restaurant.
