LjxuUvIQ-tWNHyGNfJ6UzA Warning Danger DO NOT ENTER! Gross! This place is nasty! If I could give it less than a star yea I would have. 

While out running errands over the weekend I decided to be adventurous, & try a new place I had never tried. So I find myself driving down Indian School rd and see the Chinese buffet sign. I thought great because I was not sure what I wanted and with a buffet there are so many choices right? WRONG! 

The choices were not many and the food was not good. The rice tasted like dirt. I had some mushrooms that were good. Everything was labeled wrong. They had fried chicken wings the size of my pinky. If these came off a chicken it must have been a chick. The egg foo young looked like scrambled eggs with mushrooms. This place is gross. We took one bite of everything on our plates and when nothing tasted good we left! 

We told them your buffet is garbage and we left. BTW we did not pay for it either.
