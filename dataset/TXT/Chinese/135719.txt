QdganL5AW9E_fNoRVroLig all three stars go to the delivery guy. My phone was dead when he tried to call me and so he had to wait outside the gate until someone else came in. He was super nice and kind. 
About the food, i ordered the shrimp tom yum goong, As soon as I opened the delivery soup cup it was so covered with mushroom. I like mushroom the ones in the soup tasted so bad. And the soup was just tooo weirdly sweet for me. I guess I ordered the wrong thing, but think twice before you order the tom yom goong.
