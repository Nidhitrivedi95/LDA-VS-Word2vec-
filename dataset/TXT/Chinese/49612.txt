CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Get the Duck Fried Rice. Rice? At a noodle joint? Just do it and you won't regret it! Everyone in my party of six, except for me, got it and licked their plates clean. The duck meat is juicy, tender and so flavorful.

Otherwise, the food seems mediocre. I got the Wonton Noodle Soup and it was just okay. The cuisine does lean more towards Hong Kong-style, so that may be why, as I prefer Taiwanese food more. I did want Xiao Long Bao but they stop serving it at 3pm. If you want XLBs or any dim sum, come before then.

Service was great. Great restaurant, but wouldn't go out of my way unless a friend wants it or I happen to already be at Bellagio.
