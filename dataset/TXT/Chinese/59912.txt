DL7V1_chkWkZtyG4_xNYfw Haven't eaten here in quite a while. I had the displeasure of eating at the one near the Phx/Scottsdale border over on Indian School and 44th Street, (BAD service from jump street, wrong order, remade it, still wrong, etc. and bitchy girl working the counter with attitude.) SO...thought I would come back and try this one and get take-out. Yeah...not impressed. Ordered the larger portion of Mongolian Beef. This portion seemed like a smaller one to me, and most of the beef had a ton of fat on it, and I ended up throwing most of it in the trash. Nearly $10 for fatty, inedible beef and a few veggies over rice?  Nah...I think I'm done. This location has gone really downhill. I'm inclined to think the entire chain just sucks anymore.
