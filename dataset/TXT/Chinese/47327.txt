bzMO8LJmJtgo3KuyWGKUxA A noodle place that is a favourite amongst UT students and a place my co-workers say I should frequent whenever I'm in the area. I finally made an effort to dine-in at Homemade Ramen and it did not disappoint. 

Ordered the famous non-spicy sliced beef noodles. Portions are huge and the beef is delicious but definitely not as chewy as I imagined. You can easily share 2 bowls of noodles amongst 3 individuals because I barely finished my bowl. Soup is not bad but you can taste a little MSG in there. $10-11 all-in for a bowl of delicious handmade noodles is pretty fab.

Ever so often you will be able to hear the sound of the chef slamming the handmade noodles onto the table so don't be startled by the loud thuds!
