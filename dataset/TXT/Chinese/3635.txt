_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA It was after 11:30 pm and there weren't many options for my Fried Rice cravings because everyone else was closed on a Thursday night. I was on the strip in the Linq area. I read the reviews and it was 50/50. I ordered the chicken fried rice and have to say that the portion was a good size!  It wasn't bad so I'll say It tasted great!  It satisfied my cravings. I mean nothing to complain about except maybe the price? I'd go back!
