wfWcE4K7vQX1Fjao9Q-12Q This place is not that great for the price. Me and my husband went here during the 4th of July and ordered vietnamese pho, friedrice, vegetable spring roll for appetizer and their thai soup. The pho taste bland and the meat is overcooked. The fried rice was amazing. The vegetable spring roll has a kicked to eat and taste fresh. The soup is horrible. The red soup and seafood just didn't connect. Their customer service is decent. Overall 3 stars
