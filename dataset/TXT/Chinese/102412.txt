KhYA1VGwy1naIiIAvPfolw The absolute BEST Egg Foo Yung in town!  I went here on a friend's recommendation of their noodles, unfortunately only so-so in my opinion, but was completely blown away by their Egg Foo Yung. It was a huge, thick, egg patty that was deep fried to doneness, and served with an unbelievably killer gravy that was rich and dense and heaven in a cup. No, it was not the watery brown sauce normally served around town, this gravy had a substance that would be home to Thanksgiving turkey! 
Unfortunately, the rest of the food was barely marginal. Their Mongolian Beef had green peppers and other vegies, and was a complete disappointment, and was perhaps the worst version of this dish I have ever had, almost enough to keep me away from this restaurant forever.
I also tried the Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, and it was pleasing overall,  as good as most places in town.
Their Hong Kong style noodles were bland and undistinguished, with a strange little sweetness that I didn't care for at all. 
Stop by this place for an Egg Foo Yung that you will crave in the middle of your sleep, but pick up other items elsewhere.
