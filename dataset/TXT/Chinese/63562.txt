Dzm3_K2lnLLcGPVLZBZtog We loved this place.  My wife and I love Chinese food and have tried many restaurants across the valley. The Egg Foo Young and General Tso's Chicken were excellent.  Presentation was attractive, service was efficient and friendly, and the restaurant was clean.  Family style dining.  Worthy of many rerturn visits and delivery orders.
