t_SvwKRaMyNHj2NOMvMv1Q Very good fresh sushi. Very clean restaurant. At first glance it looked like a stereotypical Chinese spot but indeed it did had more style. The friendly service was excellent. The prices were very very fair. I had the Out of Control Roll, the Godzilla Roll, tuna sashimi and crab Rangoon. For the price and the service and the taste, unless you're the type that has a stick up your nose- go! Go! Go!!
