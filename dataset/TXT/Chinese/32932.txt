a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg I was craving some quality Chinese food and after searching through yelp for 15 minutes, I decided to come to Jade Palace. It's so hard to choose a Chinese food restaurant when their reviews are all over the place. So anyways, I had a party of 5. Our waitress was super sweet and very attentive to us. My boyfriend ordered the szechawan chicken (he said that's how it's spelled but I'm sketch....) and he thought it was delicious. I ordered the orange chicken. The flavor was good but some of the pieces were too dry to even swallow. This may sound weird but their soy sauce had a "tap water" taste if that makes sense to anyone.. I ordered the chicken lo mein for my kids and they tore it up.. I tried it and it was a little too bland for me. Overall, the food was alright. I'm still in a desperate search for the perfect orange chicken.
