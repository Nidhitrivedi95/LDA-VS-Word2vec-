The critic raved about ginger-scallion is passable to anyone who actually grew up with the stuff, as is the Chinese sausage, and there are better examples of both around town if you're willing to look.  It is nice to see chicken rice available in town but not so much so to justify going to that location.  The one standout thing is the de-boning of the chicken, it is a nice change of pace from the traditional presentation, especially if you're feeling lazy.

Oh, by the way, they don't have chopsticks, which makes for a very odd experience considering this is chopstick food.

Service is friendly but hectic, not surprising considering the small staff.

Overall, not bad and I don't regret going but I'm not going to make an effort to go again.
