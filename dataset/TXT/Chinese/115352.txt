n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A Total disaster. From the food to the service, it was amateur at best. The food was terrible. The duck was a greasy mess, and the fiery beef was cold and fatty. In no way was it worth the high price tag. The service was chaotic, the menu was a laminated piece of paper that was extremely hard to follow, and absolutely no effort was made to explain the menu or engage us in any way. The decor was trying way too hard to be cool and the staff was clearly lacking good management and adequate training. Save your time and money, don't go.
