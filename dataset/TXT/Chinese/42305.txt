It is a small plate for $8, but it was a great dish.  The chicken wings were fairly good for what they were, but the pork belly was below average if you are a pork belly regular.

The space was great, we sat at a large "communal table" in the front and watched people scurry by in the rain. No one else was at the big table, so no shortage of elbow space. Cozy ambiance, and great place to have a conversation.
