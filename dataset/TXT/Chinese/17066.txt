Drinks (bubble teas, hot teas, coffee), Appetizers, Taiwanese snacks, Asian desserts, Ramen, Stone Pot Rice, Main dishes with rice... the problem is when you try to do too much, you can't do anything well. 

I find the menu here is a hit and miss. Some items are good, like the fried fish cakes (deep fried, piping hot, good order size, sitting on a bed of pickled radish and so delicious), and some items are not so good like the bimbimbap (missing egg, seaweed, bean sprouts, kimchi... when asked the waitress why the dish did not have half the items shown in the picture, she said the menu is old and they haven't changed it yet. So for $9, my friend got a really big bowl of rice and some carrots, some beef.. and I'm not sure what else there was.....). 

My order came out pretty decent. I got the satay beef with rice. The plate of beef was huge, and the dish was overflowing with onions. good value for $10. The flavour wasn't immersed in the meat though, and some pieces tasted pretty bland. I also got the soy tofu with ginger for dessert. It was very gingery and hot which made it perfect for winter. The syrup was served on the side so you can choose how sweet you want it to taste. 

Overall, I think this place is good for desserts or snacks and to chat in (the setting and environment is perfect to catch up with friends) but this is NOT the place to eat a good meal. My friend ranted about her meal for the next few hours.. and she also told our other friends, her parents and maybe even some strangers on the road. Like I said, the food is hit or miss. You've been warned.
