w3RH9W99ZIKvw0Qgibdn4w THE BEST CHINESE FOOD IN MY AREA!!!! 
I highly recommend the lettuce wraps! They changed the recipe to a more healthier recipe and it is TO DIE FOR. 
I also really enjoyed the hawaiian caramel chicken plate and the mandarin orange chicken plate!

I WILL DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK!!! 
HOLY YUMMY!!!
