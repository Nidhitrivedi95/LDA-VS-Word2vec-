HgL6gGEGoAUBKGrT6BXU4Q I have been hearing about this place for quite a while and was really curious to try it - I showed up around 7pm on a Wednesday and was told there would be a 30-minute wait.  Not entirely surprising considering the place is quite small.  We waited across the street at People's Eatery and had some nice cocktails.  The wait turned out to be closer to 45 minutes, but no big deal.

The servers were all very friendly, and we ordered pretty quickly, but the food took a very long time to arrive, and the pace it arrived at was a bit slow for my liking.  The crispy chicken skins were a bit too greasy and served at room temperature (not sure if this was deliberate) and even though it said there was Sriracha salt I couldn't detect anything other than just salt.  The soy sauce eggs and the winter melon soup were good to start with.  The tempura broccoli was very good (particularly with the keffir lime mayo) and the pot stickers were decent.

For mains, we had the traditional soft chicken and the prawns.  The chicken was a really good attempt at traditional Hainanese chicken rice (of which the best I think I've experienced is in Singapore, and what I'm comparing it to).  The hot sauce and garlic sauce were delicious, and I appreciated that they de-boned the chicken since usually the tiny bones just get in the way of the experience, in my view.  The rice was very, very good, and it compares very closely to the best I've had, and the prawns were very good, too.

The price point was in line with any other trendy restaurant like this, but of course it doesn't compare to a traditional Chinese restaurant, but of course that's not what this is.

Was I blown away?  No.  Would I go again?  Likely.  I like that they at least want to experiment with this style of food, which is more than can be said for most joints serving this type of food.
