LQ-gMAQLbPVxjrBYCJ1ApQ This is my go to spot for chinese food.  It's right around the corner and can always be counted on when I need my curry shrimp fix!  I also really enjoy the won ton soup and combo fried rice.  The pepper steak is another good one.  Everything always seems to be really fresh and the prices are reasonable!  If you're in the area and have a taste for Chinese, Little Dragon is the place for you!
