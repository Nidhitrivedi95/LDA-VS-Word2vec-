2gI7dlktBQXPZiuOW-HWvw Not too shabby, reasonable prices, and ready within 10 minutes of calling.
We went to town and sampled a little bit of everything:
Pork dumpling appetizer was delicious!
Shrimp tempura roll was good, but nothing special. This roll seems to taste the same no matter where you get it?!
Garlic chicken was ok, although kinda sparse on the chicken.
Sesame chicken seemed to be the overall winner.
General Tso's chicken was ok, but no spice at all.
The fried rice is like regular rice with some brown food coloring--disappointing for sure.
Will continue to try and find a good chinese place on the westside of town!
