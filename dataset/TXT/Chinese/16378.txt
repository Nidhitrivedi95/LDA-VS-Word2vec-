44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw The most authentic chinese food I have found in the area.  Being chinese , I have been searching for real chinese food and am so glad I tried this place thanks to yelp reviewers.
 The rock cod in black bean sauce was very good. They have four tanks of fish/lobster  on their back wall and always have specials- i will have to try the lobster when i come with a bigger group. The service has been fine when I went.
