I would always go with curry fish ball and spicy beef soup. Plus spicy beef noodle soup is the best beef noodle soup that I've ever had in my life. I had a lot of beef noodle soups in my hometown. They were good, but when I got here I had it which made me feel grateful for how delicious the noodle soup is. Completely amazing! My another favorite in beef rolls, it's really popular and customers loved it.
