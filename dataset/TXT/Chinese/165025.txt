UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw It was not that busy on a Friday night at 9ish during spring restaurant week,  Food was ok.  First few bites of calamari app were good but the rest was doused in the sweet glaze that ruined it.  Scallops were good but were served with a crispy seaweed side that was terrible and inedible.  Server said the dessert was some kind of fried cheesecake but there was a server switch twice during the dinner and the other server brought us some choc cake that was fine.  Nothing special.  The wine was brought in a nice sturdy tall wine glass but the second glass was brought in a smaller one.  Upon tasting it I realized it was the wrong wine.  Serving staff was nice but seemed unorganized and unfocused, food was a little disappointing.
