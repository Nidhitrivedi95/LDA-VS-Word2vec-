emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw SEVERAL years ago, this was the place to grab dim sum.  But much better have popped up and the crowds moved on, and this fell to the wayside.  You can tell easily by the lack of (Asian) customers.

On a whim, tried it again.  Meh.  Egg tarts were the best part, but there is so much better dim sum not much farther away.
