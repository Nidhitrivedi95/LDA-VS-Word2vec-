pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA OVERPRICED!!!!

This place is waaay overpriced. Appetizer size plates for $20 with barely enough food on them to feed a fish. Sushi was nothing to rave about....I have had much better at my local sushi joint. Spent a lot of money for an empty stomach in the end. Sure the place is beautiful with nice decor but would I really pay all that for that food. I think NOT! 

Sea bass was the best dish I had...it almost melted in your mouth. I perhaps would return for this dish but at $20 for two kebabs....I would have to think about it. Filet Mignon was about the size of half your palm for $20...ridiculous if you ask me. Some good flavor but too expensive for me to return. You definitely do not get what you pay for here.
