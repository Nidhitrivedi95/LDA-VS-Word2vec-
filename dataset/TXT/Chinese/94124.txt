JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A My party of 7, including 3 kids, came here for a late night dinner.  From the outside, we couldn't see through the windows and we thought maybe it was a bar and stayed by our car, but after letting the men go inside, they came back out to get us.  Being from Hawaii, I felt pretty much at home here because there was a flat screen TV showing Korean dramas and it made me think of my mom back home who watches them all the time.  One thing that my party wanted was meat jun/chun, but there wasn't any one the menu.  We ordered galbi and a soup to share with the table that had octopus and beef.  After we put in our order, it took a while for us to get any food and I didn't even expect the banchan side dishes to come out before our entrees came out.  The galbi tasted good and it came with the huge bones that my husband likes to gnaw on.  The soup was spicy but chock full of octopus, clams, mussels, shrimp, and beef.  It had to cook on the propane portable stove for a few minutes to cook the raw octopus and beef that was visible on top of the soup.  I didn't have room for dessert, but everyone else wanted to eat their mochi ice cream but the lone lady serving us said there was no mochi so everyone opted to eat the red bean ice cream.  This place was a lifesaver for us Hawaii people visiting Phoenix as we were dying to eat rice and at a place that was open late.
