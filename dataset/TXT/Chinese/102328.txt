khwoDxH5p-D9pLjCvV_Y6A DELICIOUS, Chinese Take-out!!!! I've eaten here with my family, maybe 20 times last couple of years & its ALWAYS been GREAT!!! I also, like to use COUPONS and they usually have several good ones,right on the takeout menu. Its just OK, to sit in and eat(kinda bland decor, with simple booths) we just mainly, do the TAKEOUT, & once again,its ALWAYS been DELICIOUS & I highly recommend!!!
