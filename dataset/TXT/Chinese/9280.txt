1QgN7EG1HF9aIDdIc7gU-w I was very excited for late night Chinese, this place closes at 9:30, we got there at 8:45 and from the moment we got there till the moment we left no fresh food was brought out even with more customers walking in. There was none of the food that I wanted out and the food that was there when we got there was not fresh or full In anyway. Have been there a couple times the food is good but it made me extremely mad that I payed $20 to beg for scraps at the end of the night. Employees acted like they were closing an hour early while customers where still coming in. It was an all you can eat buffet but I was barely fool when I left.
