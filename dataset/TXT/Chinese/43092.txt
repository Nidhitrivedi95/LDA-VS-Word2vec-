beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw You know, I can't say that I hate Chubby Cattle but I also can't say that I love it either. It was very middle of the road for me. I'm not even sure I would recommend it to friends to try out. Meh. 

The food was good and everything but boy, your bill really adds up quickly and very sneakily. The restaurant is still quite busy so be prepared to wait if you come at peak dinner time or are just unlucky :P They have a conveyor belt options of items for hot pot or you can just order ala carte off the menu. From what I saw, most people order off the menu. A few people here and there would grab things from the belt, but not many. 

You first order your broth, I opted for the mushroom broth but also tried the house broth. Then you start ordering everything you want to cook in your broth. I will say that their menu is very very extensive. From veggies to dumplings to noodles to all slices and cuts of meat, there will be something to tickle your fancy!

Everything tasted fine and I will say the food quality is there but nothing blew me out of the water. There is also a walk-up make your own sauce bar to mix and match your own flavors to make a dipping sauce. 

Well to each their own on this one. I was left a little underwhelmed with a bigger hole in my wallet than I would think for hot pot.
