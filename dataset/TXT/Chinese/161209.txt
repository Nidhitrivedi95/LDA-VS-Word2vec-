UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ Chicken satay was breaded, pad Thai had no scallions or bean sprouts & was yellow- I would not even bother tasting it.. Not even the normal pad thai noodles, these looked like vermicelli. The server tried telling me those were the noodles all Thai restaurants in Vegas used, not what I remember from when I lived there & not what is used in the rest of this country. 
Will never be returning here.
