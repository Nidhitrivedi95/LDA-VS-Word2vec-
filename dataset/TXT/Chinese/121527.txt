o9k4l0uD02EdsbVio_XbGQ We are traveling from out of town, and thought we were going to the previous restaurant, which is no longer there.  This was a delicious and wonderful surprise.  The wontons were homemade, everything was fresh, and they were very flexible.  I added baby bok choy to everything and they moved ingredients from one of our entrees, to another to appease our son.  The staff was very friendly and the food arrived quickly and it was very hot, plus  there was no msg! If we were local, we would definitely return again and again. . .
