yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Table for 10, I think. We roll deep. 

I forgot that Vegas clubs differ from San Diego. (i.e. They don't close at 2am)

My friend who lives in Vegas was an awesome host and showed me and LT a great time and how/where the locals party. After poppin bottles, dancing for four hours, throwing napkins into the air we were ready to go eat. 

I recall going to a pho place on Spring Mtn a few years ago, but this one was different. I think it was Pho Little Saigon and I had broth spilled all over my legs and they gypped us on the bill.

#1 Rule: if you want the Pho Tai Chin order it by it's number. When they bring your order out the pretty much ask Who got #_, #_, #_?!
Heck, I don't know what number it was, I just know it has well done brisket and rare steak... LOL but you can't see the meat under all the broth.

Another guy at the table ordered the same thing. He gave me his, but it didn't have the brisket! :( lame sauce. 

The pho was alright, for being open 24 hours and having to deal with a bunch of drunkards they do a good job. 

Anyhow, we were pretty much sober by 5am and my friend happily dropped us off at our hotel room. 

Woot less than 24 hour trip to vegas was a success, and yes we did go to the buffet the following morning (5 hours later).
