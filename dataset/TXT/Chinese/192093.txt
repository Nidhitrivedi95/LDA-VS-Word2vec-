yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw I'm a frequent visitor to Las Vegas, usually once a month.  I like the Summerlin area and North Las Vegas because... well it's nothing like The Strip.

This Chinese restaurant is freakin' awesome.  Service is prompt, courteous, and they only came by THREE TIMES to ask if everything was ok.  Try and get that somewhere else... where you're ignored and lack for even water refills.

The hot tea was steaming.  The egg-flower soup was steaming. The steamed dumplings were ... um... steaming!  The beef&broc were fresh.  [Ok, they could have cut the humongous beef pieces into bite-sizes].  The fried rice and noodles were scrumptious.  

I asked for chili paste... got offered that or Sriracha (how can you go wrong when you offer both?)  Also the chili paste in the egg-flower soup made it deliciously hot and hot[spicy].  Killer combination.  Next time I'll try the hot&sour soup and hold off on the chili.

Food was HOT and FRESH and DAMN DELICIOUS.  Would go back in a heartbeat.  Took a delivery-menu so I can repeat the process without going there.  [Eating there was fine... just delivery is sometimes easier.]

While I was there I did not see Chinese people eating... which is at times a bad sign... but not in this case.  I saw four other people having a great meal.  

What could they improve: not much.  It's all good.  When you walk in it's very 'small town' when they ask you if you've pre-ordered... if it's takeout or dine here...  so on the one side they could "polish" that process up, but on the other side it's down-home-style.

GO EAT THERE.
