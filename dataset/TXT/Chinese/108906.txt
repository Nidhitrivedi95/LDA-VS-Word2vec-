Lku_keJf44D0LxbRAIZOcg Great place for a really quick lunch and in my opinion MUCH better than Subway next-door. I work nearby, and I often go here because in 2 minutes and for $6 I get a rather  large portion of tasty Americanese food. I also like that the default isn't steamed rice but you can choose from a base of steamed rice OR lo mein or fried rice in case you're not overly interested in the healthiest possible lunch... Which BTW, if you want healthy, maybe don't come here because it's pretty greasy - I'm a fan!

I'd give it 5 stars because it lives up to what it is - quick and cheap Americanese food. However, I think it could have more flavor and some of the dishes could be more spicy. After the first few bites it does tend to get a little one-dimensional. A little soy sauce and some sriracha goes a long way though :).
