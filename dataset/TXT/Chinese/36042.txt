aJR1iUWwNVBM692gq7adBA Finally I have found a good Chinese food place that is delicious and inexpensive :) went in on a Sunday yes they are open Sunday's even though yelp says closed when brining up on phone 12-9. I ordered 2 lunch combos to go an order of sesame
chicken and sweat and Sour chicken yum yum and yum !!! They are very generous portions and come with 2 won tons fried rice and egg drop soup & spring roll per order I ordered a egg roll too honestly
Their spring rolls where better but for $15 bucks you can't go wrong and it kept me and my husband and daughter full till dinner unlike most Chinese places where you feel
Hungry a few hrs later . This will be our new place it was very clean inside and the lady running the front was super sweet and friendly. My only regret is that I didn't find this gem sooner.
