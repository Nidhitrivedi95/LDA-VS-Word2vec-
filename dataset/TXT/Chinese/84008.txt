heyU2rq-K2soH-V0SVMHVQ Great spot for family's! Kids eat for .99 Wed and Sat nights! We love Mama Fu's and have been eating here weekly for over a year now! We have 3 kids and there is no where that we can all eat for under $30 except at Mama Fu's! The food is wonderful, service is GREAT and it's a family type atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend if you like Chinese and have kids to feed.
