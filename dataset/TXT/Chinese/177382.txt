wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA This hidden gem is amazing. I found this place searching for a tapas place and saw it was Japanese tapas. So why not give it a try. I am so glad I did!! I went for my birthday on a Sunday night. We were the only patrons there but started to pick up by the middle of our meal. Slightly disappointed at first because they were out of all the uni dishes! Really wanted to try the squid ink and uni fried rice. We were there at 5 so took advantage of their happy hour specials.

Pork rinds with honey- how can pork rinds ever be bad? Good combination with salty, spicy, and sweet.

Brussel sports- they had a nice crunch too it. Flavors were clean and let the Brussels sprout flavor shine through 

Japanese street corn- perfectly charred, seasoned well, really tasty 

Tempura- standard tempura fare, but they used different veggies, not sure what I was eating for some of the tempura 

Oxtail fried rice- good sized portion, not too salty, right amount of meat and egg

Yari ika squid- the squid melted in your mouth! Not too chewy, very fresh tasting, and the butter sauce was so good.

Bone marrow and milk toast- this dish alone would keep me coming back. So perfectly cooked, nice fatty meat that melts in your mouth. The toast was toasted just enough without being too crunchy when biting into it. Definitely must get this dish.

Smoke Kurobuta pulled pork- sweet and tangy flavor, the pork pulled apart easily

Octo-cargot - rich flavor with the butter/garlic/miso sauce, but the Pablo breadcrumbs overpowered the octopus 

Writing this review and remembering all the food makes me want to go back again! Definitely try this place out! Service was attentive, restaurant and restrooms clean, fair priced food items.
