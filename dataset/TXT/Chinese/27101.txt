7zQejWAhY4v4LXHR6bY7dg This establishment is a very disappointment even though the service is better than average Chinese restaurants.  The Shredded Pork and Salted Mustard with Noodles in Soup (<U+70B8><U+83DC><U+8089><U+7D72><U+9EB5>) is served very cold, I have to ask them to reheat the dish.  The Onion Pancake filled with Beef (<U+725B><U+8089><U+5927><U+9905>) tastes more like Cantonese BBQ Buns rolled in pancakes
