2GtIC6u4hVneccWfTlOxHQ My friend was raving about this place so my family decided one Saturday to venture here instead of our usual. 

We were...disappointed to say the least.

Well, first of all the restaurant itself was very clean, which was nice. And the service was okay. I mean it is a buffet though.

There was not a lot of choices like I'm used to. Which sucked because the price of this place is only less than my regular buffet and they have sooooo many more choices. But I'm giving them 2 stars since some of the food I had were decent in flavor so they didn't totally suck. The sushi station, I did not like because you have to order every time you want something. And when you did, the pieces were so tiny! It's like they are conserving the fish..definitely dissatisfied with that. 

At this point, really can't remember much except for great disappointment with this place.

Definitely will stick to my regular buffet.
