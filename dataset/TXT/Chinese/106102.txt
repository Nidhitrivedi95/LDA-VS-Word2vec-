KzLjbXEDH1e1WrfzrrzZKw I stopped in with a friend who came downtown specifically to have lunch. We decided on Mandarin Gourmet and were seated immediately. A young gentleman came to our table with placemats, water and tea - but no tea cups. The tea cups were eventually placed in front of us and he asked if we were ready to order. I ordered the Sesame chicken with white meat and my friend ordered the General Tso's chicken also with white meat. Both were lunch specials and were served with an egg roll. 

The egg roll came out warm, but not hot - like it was sitting under a heat lamp. I TRIED to lift the lid on the sauce at the table, but it was stuck to the jar. I wondered when it was last cleaned. We skipped the sauce and ate plain egg rolls that weren't great, but they weren't awful either. 

Our meals came piping hot. I ate two pieces of chicken and then the third piece that I put in my mouth was chewy. I spit it out in my napkin and realized that it was all fat or skin. I took another bite and the chicken tasted old - reheated or something. It just didn't taste right. I decided to work on the rice and wait for a server. One came by and dropped the check off so quickly that I didn't have a chance to say anything. I thought surely someone would notice a full plate and at the very least offer a box. 20 minutes went by and my friend was finished, so we decided to leave. 

I told the cashier of my experience and she ARGUED with me that the chicken is fresh. I said that may be the case, but it tasted AWFUL. She said she would be right back. She came back 2 minutes later and with a line of 5 people waited to be seated, she offered us 20% off of the check. I said I ate 3 pieces of chicken, an egg roll and some rice. That is hardly 20%! I was finally so frustrated that I paid - and did not leave a tip. I rarely do that, but I felt that the service failed miserably.

Needless to say, we will not be back.
