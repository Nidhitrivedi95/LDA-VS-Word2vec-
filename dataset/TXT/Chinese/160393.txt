U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q When ordering our entrees, they asked "would you like rice with that?". Both me and my husband answered yes. We were shocked when we received the bill and each tiny bowl of white rice was $7 - apparently, rice is charged a la carte. After ordering, receiving your food takes an unexpectedly long time. The service was great, though.

For $18, the portion size of the the General Tso's was insultingly small and looked/tasted like they just dumped hoisin sauce on it. However, The Mongolian Beef ($23.99) was delicious. Robust and flavorful with tender slices of beef and a portion size worthy of the price. 

Overall, a decent experience, but nothing to write home about. WAY more expensive than I would have liked. Could have eaten at the famous all you can eat Bachannal Buffet right next door for the very same cost, if only I'd had the patience to wait in line for an hour.
