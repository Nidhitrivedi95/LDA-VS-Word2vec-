p2RqycIW2jzjbQnkEw5lkA I have eaten there several times now in the past few months. Consistency has picked up, though I see the staff has changed again. 

I feel comfortable eating there that i will receive a ok meal.

Noodles has changed their chicken again, to chicken breast, which is much tastier. (company wide)
