cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ Stopped in here for lunch one day as we were feeling the itch for Thai food and searched for the closest place. 

Service was prompt and friendly. I ordered a Thai iced tea and it was standard. Our waters came with no ice in them which was a little strange. 

Shrimp pad thai was very mediocre. Maybe I caught them on and off day but the noodles were super mushy and the plate came with the hugest mound of bean sprouts. My plate was split 1/2 pad thai noodles, 1/4 bean sprouts, and 1/4 crushed peanuts. The garnish proportion was way off and there were no limes! 

I also asked for a 3 out of 5 spiciness because I always tell myself that I can add some heat rather than having my tongue burn off and just suffer through it because there was no way to take away the heat. But the container for hot stuffs were basically empty. It also worried me that they sit out for too long without anyone checking them for their levels and/or cleanliness. 

Again, maybe it was an off day, and we only had pad thai, but it was a disappointing dish--mushy, bland, and overpowered by sprouts and crushed peanuts. I hope that other dishes are much better.
