lEtpTFWetCf6xnzeImLiHg I visited this place once or twice based on reviews by some of the folks at work and the fact that it was close by.  I can appreciate the fact that the heavy window shades help keep the A/C bill down, but it's pretty dark in there!  

I normally choose some of my staples when sizing up a new Chinese / Asian restaurant.  That would be won ton soup and chow mein.  Wow.  Very salty!  I'm not sure what was up with the broth in the soup but it was the darkest brew I've ever seen.  Not too fond of the fact that a lot of the chicken dishes feature dark meat either.  On the other hand, it wasn't super greasy but that's not enough to win me over.  Co-worker Dave wasn't impressed either so we didn't go back after the 2nd try.
