Literally my favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte. I've been to many and I keep gravitating towards Ginbu 401. The location itself is great, free parking and plenty of space to park your car so you don't have to walk blocks just to eat.

Friendly staff, they know me by name and exactly what I want every time I walk in the door, something I appreciate for sure. 

The sushi is to die for. Busting with flavor, it's innovative and well worth what you pay. I love their lunch special, it's one of the best deals in Charlotte. 

Family owned and ran, it definitely makes it worth your time coming here for your lunch or dinner
