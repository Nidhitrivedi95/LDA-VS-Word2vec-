lmfyEVKm3CDGWg18LeRhgA Hi- new to yelp and to Phoenix- but wanted to put a plug in for Pink Pepper.   While relocating here and living out of hotels, I found myself going back to this place at least twice a week- both for the food and the friendly people.  The service is great, the prices are reasonable, and the food is fresh and very authentic.  Of course, being new to the area, I haven't really checked out many other places!  But I have been to Thailand and Pink Pepper's food is very authentic.  If you're looking for trendy decor or a place to be seen, this is probably not the place for you.  But if you want good Thai- go here, ask for the seafood salad- and if you like it really hot, say "pet mahk mahk!" and be prepared!
