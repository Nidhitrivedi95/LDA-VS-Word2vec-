AQ-zSfkO1gHjKC7w5vjJBw This was my first time back after 5 years.  At another location I got food poisoning, and then I waited a year to try and again at a different location only to get grossed out by a bone I found in my boneless sweet and sour pork.   So my opinion was not high of Panda after that although I did love their food I was rather scared.  

So my husband finally talked me into going back.  I reluctantly agreed.... but I did go.

The food was not as yummy as I remember it 5 years ago but this is my first time at this location.    It was good don't get me wrong but once you have a certain quality of taste and service and you don't get that its always a bit disappointing.

The experience was better then my last 2 but I am still afraid and sat there kinda picking through the food in fear of something going wrong again.  

I am just not sure I can get over my past fears.  For everyone else I would say go ahead and try it.  My husband and friends love it and have never had a bad experience.  I just seem to be the one prone to finding the hair in my food of something else awful.  

Overall the food did taste good it's just no longer a place I am comfortable at.... nothing against this location.
