cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg My update: I give this restaurant five stars only because I can't give it six stars.

The service is personable, quick, and fun. Professional, but never cold. I've been here more than thirty times, so I'm both biased and experienced in their service. Francis is an amazing server, and he's one of a crew that is terrific. (If it's your first time, asking for Francis is a pro tip. :) )

The kitchen is absolutely the best Chinese in Phoenix. From the egg rolls to the egg drop soup (which still deserves a paragraph all for itself) to the festival shrimp and the three seas special, Ive samples a dozen main dishes and never had a bad meal. Seriously, the egg drop soup is out of this world. 

On Saturday there is a great band, so much so that you want a reservation to get a seat at 6 or 7. Totally worth it. 

The owner is a riot. George is pleasant, generous and very charming, and you'll meet the guy who owns the restaurant if you're here near closing. 

From soup to fortune cookie, this is the place for great Chinese. 

Also, great wine and great Scotch. It's funny - the Scotch is great at the end of the night.
