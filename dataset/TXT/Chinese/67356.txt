emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw I've been coming here for dim sum for years, and while it's had its ups and downs, it still remains my favorite dim sum spot in Phoenix, mostly because of their selection. My favorites are the taro, crispy shrimp balls, shrimp balls on the sugar cane, ha cao and xiu mai. Yea it's a little greasy, but what do you expect when you're going for dim sum?
