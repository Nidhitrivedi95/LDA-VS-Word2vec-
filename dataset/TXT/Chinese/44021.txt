BIMICEFM917JQwi5l4q6Gw Super fan of Chef Panda! I've eaten here about 3 times (take out) and have always been happy with my order! I know they recently went through some management/chef changes so there are some differences but it is still my favorite Chinese take-out in the area. The owner and employees are always friendly and give you that "small business" feeling. Food it always quick and delicious. I can only vouch for the Chicken/Broccoli and General Tso's Chicken - Both delicious!
