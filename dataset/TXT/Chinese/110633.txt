Lw49aJ96ntO_4ddZA-NtDw A couple of us crazies were in need of our daily Medicine and Taste of Heaven was the choice of the day.  It is Chinese Herbal Medicine prepared as part of the meal.  That might sound weird to most of you but Chinese Medicine is all natural/herbal as in the most basic form of the ingredients and some can be consumed on a regular basis.

Herbal Medicine is usually boiled/extracted for hours to be consumed in a Soup rather than in Pill format  you're so used to.   I would still HIGHLY suggest that if you're not sure if you can consume such items, then this might not be for you.  Either that or CONSULT your Family Doctor.   2.5 *Star*

The reason the store is so tiny and barely reasonable for dining-in might be due to the fact they distribute their Herbal items(Chicken, Beef, Pig Ear, etc...) to Chinese Grocer T&T Supermarket, therefore there's a limited few that will come to this barely visible plaza for a meal.

Herbal Chicken on Steam Rice($4.99) is probably the go-to item as Herbal Chicken is the popular item they distribute.  1/2 Small Chicken which seemed to be the Free-range variety.  The Herbal flavour wasn't intense so I was happy to consume it but be prepared to wait for this item as much as 20 minutes.

Herbal Beef Noodle($4.99) had lovely Shank meat I believe as some pieces had some tender gelatinous to it.  The Noodle was perfectly cooked to chewiness.  As noted from previous review, the Soup Base was Salty/Oily but that didn't bother the 3 youths next to us from picking up the entire bowl and drinking it all.

Salty to the point that I thirst for Juice although I noticed they had drinks for $1.00 each or as you eat facing the Convenience Store, I just went elsewhere for Fresh Juice.  You might have to ask in Mandarin for Water as the only Gentleman(Cook, Waiter, Cashier, Washer) didn't bring any to us.
