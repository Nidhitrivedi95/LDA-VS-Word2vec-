VGxJbglGlx-a7Gdc55Q6jQ I was not a fan of Katana. My husband & I had a Groupon for Katana so we thought we would give them a try. First off the menu is WAY too large. It's like 8 pages or so, then they have about 12 additional specials listed on the table PLUS more specials listed on the blackboard on the wall. Too many options, it's overwhelming..stick to one style of food and master that style. 
I could pretty much tell the food was going to be so so from the appetizer. We ordered the vegetable spring rolls. Very basic & the dipping sauce was not so great. Bland & not much flavor. 
My husband & I ordered a bunch of different sushi pieces to split. We tried about 6 different ones & none of them stood out. Pretty basic, none of them had a flavor that popped. 
Our waitress was nice & helpful when we had questions. 
I would not go back too many other way better sushi places in Pittsburgh to go to.
