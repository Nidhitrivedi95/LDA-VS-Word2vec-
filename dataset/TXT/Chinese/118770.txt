They do NOT violate child labor laws (occasionally the owner's children have manned the counter before, they are courteous, whip-smart and accurate to a fault).  Lastly, the portions are NOT tiny.  Anyone thinking their portions are tiny, well I imagine they have one heck of an appetite. 

This is a takeout only place that I have frequented since they opened in the early 90s.  It has been run by the same people since day one.  The one or 2 times there was any mix up with my order they happily corrected it.  Speak up politely, politeness works both ways you know.

The area has declined since the days when there was a Wal-Mart right there and the strip mall the Fortune Garden was in was pretty much fully occupied.  So, it is a little sketchy looking area at night.  Otherwise it is clean, and they are very quick.

The food and portions are very good.   I am a big guy and I love to eat.  That said, I can always get 2 meals out of one of their dinner combos, which generally run $7.99. And, if you've ordered several items for multiple people they throw in some freebies (extra fried rice, soda, etc).

So don't be deterred by the couple of negative reviews.  If you like Chinese food, and want to take out, and are in the area give it a try.  My family has been eating from there for over 20 years.
