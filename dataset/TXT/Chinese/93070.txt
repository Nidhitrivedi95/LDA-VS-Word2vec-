iyoym9B8gU_YPXSb3m31LA I don't know how I feel about this place. The waiter and busboy really creeped us out. They were making strange comments to us, almost being pushy and over friendly when they did not need to be. When you walk in you would think for the price they really need to modernize this restaurant. Carpet looks typical Vegas buffet, decorations look boring and restaurant looks as if you are eating at some cafe in Vegas (you know the ones they have in every casino that are open 24 hours where people go in the middle of the night). Also the restaurant is a pain to find. We parked in valet and walked around forever until we found it. We were dressed up to go to MIX and def got alot of stares (overall this casino seems very family oriented and alot of older people unlike at other casinos we would look fine-such as Planet Hollywood, Palms, etc.)  I would not go here before going to a club, you will feel out of place. This is more of a restaurant you would go to if you are staying at the Luxor and really don't want to go anywhere else. 

Anyway on to the food. I ordered chilean sea bass. It was good-not the best I've ever had. I don't know if they flavored it with anything. It was very plain. For me it was ok, but it was around $30 just for the fish. I would think for that price they should do something special with it (like at Little Buddha-they fancy up the fish).

Dessert was the best part of the meal. I would come back for the dessert-it was that good. The 3 stars are simply for the dessert!! mmmmm cinnamon monkey bread!!!!  It is baked cinnamon crusted brioche with macerated fruits, bourbon caramel and chocolate sauce (which you pour over the dessert--heavenly!). We asked for it a la mode.
