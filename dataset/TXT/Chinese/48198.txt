c4CKIYAeV7O0UKHsYuzkwQ I don't get the hype. 

The good: The little taster of general tao when you are first sitting was nice. The cute water pitchers mean that you're not waiting for service on refills. Their won-ton soup was quite sweet, although I wouldn't regularly eat it, it was a nice change of pace on the classic soup. The place scores an extra star for being BYOB.

The not so good: our waitress wasn't on her game. I get the flow of service, but she really was nowhere to be found the few times she was needed.  The fried dumplings were unlike I had anywhere before, and their texture kept saying "churro" rather than peanut butter dumpling. The main dishes themselves were.. ok. Their classic combos are 3 options, chicken brochette, ginger chicken, or spicy chicken stir fry. My date and I had the ginger chicken and spicy stir fry which ended up being what really bugged me out. The spicy stirfry was literally the ginger chicken dish but with a spoonful of Chiu Chow (chili) sauce on the top, not like it was actually put in during the cooking process to seep. The food was lackluster to say the least, and the decor of the place was a mix of traditional and tiki, then covered in hockey Philadelphia Flyers Christmas themed hockey paraphernalia which just made it an eye sore and removed any possible sense of atmosphere.Overall I don't get why people are so into this place, doubt I'll be back even if I am in the area, Americanized in the worst kind of way.
