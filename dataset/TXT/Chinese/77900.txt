GhWMl0J2gOOH61BhBMTAAA We frequent this location often on Tuesdays because kids eat free which is wonderful. They also have $1 domestic beers which we appreciate with our meal choices. The food is always abundant and clean. The wait staff is the only downfall of this location and the tables and booths are not always clean which is such a turn off. We will keep going back for the food not the atmosphere.
