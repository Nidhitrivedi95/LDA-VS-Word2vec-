The different ingredients are mixed into each other sometimes there are drippings all over and the sneeze guard was built inadequately it's not helpful the sauces are in such an awkward place it's ridiculous.  Normally understaffed but the staff always top notch friendly! Been back several times but I don't think will return anymore because the last 2 times the cook has been questionable he uses too much oil even when asked not to and uses the same utensils for all the food and doesn't scrape the grill between cooking.  I had only veggies and tofu but because of the way he cooks the food there were pieces of chicken and the flavor of chicken in my food.  Used to be good and has gone downhill pretty bad recently
