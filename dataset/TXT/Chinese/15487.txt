3pYZMSbOKh6rBo_DapMlyw Great food! My fiancé and I definitely under estimated how cooking everything was. I order noodle ribs stone pot, plain noodle roll, fresh shrimp noodle roll, and pork blood congee. After the congee and two rolls we were stuffed! The noodles are all freshly made, very chewy and bouncy. The ribs were so tender the meat fell off the bones. The congee was so flavorful as well! The success they use for all dishes were perfect!

I was thirsty after eating but I think it was on the stone pot sauce cause the congee and the noodles I was fine.
Overall I enjoyed the food ND would definitely. come back cause I heard the rice stone pot is delish!
