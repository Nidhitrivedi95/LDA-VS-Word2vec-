bzMO8LJmJtgo3KuyWGKUxA It's  a very disappointed place! They do not accept credit card, or debit card without a chip. As a visitor from U.S, we don't have any cash either. So we have to pay US dollars. After we paid 50 US dollars for a 40 Canada dollars dinner, the waitress still ASK tips for the dinner. The service and the manner really bad, I never met this before in my entire life. DO NOT GO THERE!
