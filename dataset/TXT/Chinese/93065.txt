iyoym9B8gU_YPXSb3m31LA A name like "Fusia" may be a literal "fusion" between the words "Fusion" and "Asia" and whenever those two aspects come together for food, expect an additional two words:  pricey and fancy (priancy).  Despite the fine-dining atmosphere, sophisticated menu design, one will see the occasional beach short toutin tourist walk in here and dine like its no big deal (which it probably isn't).  Service has never been a problem here, despite the hostess' pretentiousness during my first visit.  The staff has been courteous and very well trained on the contents of the menu and overall restaurant conduct.

Sushi is prepared extremely well here, where the rolls are beautifully presented and taste nearly as good as they look.  However, should a dragon roll really cost $17.95?  I don't know, but at least it was a good dragon roll.  The Chinese fusion here is ridiculously overpriced as one of their specials would suggest:  baby bok choy over cod filet marinated in oyster/cranberry sauce with a side of asparagus and jasmin rice = $31.95.  The drinks are killer here, even with the prices they're extremely well made and make for a good precursor to late night Vegas events.
