fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA WORST restaurant experience ever. The female owner of the restaurant flipped out at a couple for cancelling an order. She made a scene in front of the entire restaurant, and verbally assault the couple in Chinese. She proceeded to humiliate the couple and herself for another 10 minutes, then insisted on them paying for their canceled meal. As they were leaving, she cursed and ran after them as they didn't pay for their canceled meal. The husband of the restaurant had to physically stop her. This is unacceptable behaviour and I will never eat here again.
