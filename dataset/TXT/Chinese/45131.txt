Bp7Qj64Qr8jvj3r7WBtmSg Authentic Chinese food (not the Americanized version). The roast pork is amazing with its crispy skin and hoisin sauce. The BBQ pork is tender and delicious, but can occasionally be a little dry if too lean. Also incredible is the soy chicken and BBQ duck. From the kitchen consider ordering pork spring rolls. Crispy and flavorful.

The place is usually extremely busy and the overly cramped takeout area is a hectic mess, but they'll get you through there without much trouble.
