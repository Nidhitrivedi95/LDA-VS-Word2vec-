yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I was visiting from out of town and I gotta say, this is the worst Vietnamese food I ever had. If you eat here while you're really drunk, of course you'd probably think it's good and you probably won't notice how dirty the dishes are. The broth is trash, the summer rolls and the sauce it comes with are terrible (even sriracha couldn't save it) and the limes were old and dried up.
