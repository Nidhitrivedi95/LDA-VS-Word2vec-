BbPVtY7hzBPnpRrZMBElIg If you want gourmet type food & service this ain't it. If you want good food @ a great price with modest surroundings THIS IS IT! I eat here often and have never had a bad experience. Love the food it's fresh and well flavored. I don't know how they can charge so little for their buffet. I'm a Senior - they always give me a Senior discount which really helps. The place including the restrooms are always clean. My favorites are: Walnut Shrimp, Crab Legs, Mongolian Beef, & Seafood Casserole Try it you won't be sorry..
