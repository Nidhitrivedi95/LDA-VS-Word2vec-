kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A Just finished eating here for the first time.  The waitress saw that I ordered the spicy soup and asked if I wanted to try a spicy apatizer for half price.  Of course! The cold chicken was amazing.  I wouldn't have ordered it if she has not of suggested it,  since it was cold.  It was great.  The nice waitress showed us how to eat it,  and even served my wife and I.  The hand pulled noodles were also very very good.  Watching the dude make the noodles was pretty fun too.  They make their own drinks by hand.  No soda here, or at least it wasn't on the menu.  Over all if you have a chance to go here definitely do!
