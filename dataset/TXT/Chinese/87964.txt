HzGeL_H3rkm5W9DkN9FQBw Now honestly, I don't know how I feel about this meal. Was it nasty? No. It was just different. I'm a creature of habit and always order the same thing; chicken and broccoli with pork fried rice. A positive thing is that they use real chunks of white meat chicken. They don't use cornstarch in their "gravy", it wasn't thick at all, just a broth. This place was out the way, but I always drive by it and wanted to try it out. I don't think I will dry back for it. Nothing out of this world to convince me. They don't take cards only cash.
