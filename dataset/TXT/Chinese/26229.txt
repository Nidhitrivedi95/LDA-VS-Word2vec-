7rh29SPJMkyeI2BJcjqzLQ Due to location (convenience factor) I decided to check out Beijing instead of my usual fave Ho Ho Cherry House.

I ordered the Sesame chicken (extra crispy) and was pleasantly surprised that for 8 and change you receive a generous portion of chicken, fried rice, egg roll, choice of soup - I went won-ton, and even a little steamed broccoli. Ho ho cherry house doesn't offer soup or broccoli- so I was really pleased.

My order took only 10 minutes - and it tasted cook-to-order. 

I really enjoyed their egg-roll's - definitely better than Ho-Ho's.They use more than just cabbage which is key. The rice was tasty- and the soup was awesome! I actually gave some to the girls that I was babysitting and lets say Ive never seen a 4 year old  down won-ton soup broth versus the chocolate ice cream in front of her! 

Where they fell off the wagon was the crispiness factor. Unfortunately, that is kind of my main test for Chinese and the chicken just wasn't crispy at all. I would hate to see what it would be like if I didn't order extra crispy- it would have been mush! I also didn't care for the sauce as much as Ho-Ho's.

The sides were all cooked so well- and you can't beat the price or the location so I think id try it again and really stress the EXTRA crispy part!
