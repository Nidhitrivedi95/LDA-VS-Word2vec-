DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ I eat at this chain pretty frequently.  I've fallen in love with their pineapple chicken option and will usually make two, sometimes three meals when I pair it with a few spam musubis ( you can make pineapple spam musubi ).
    Now thanks to yelpers today I gave their garlic shrimp a shot.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and tasted great, only downfall being the amount of shrimp provided.  Needless to say, for the most part you get a lot of good food when you order anything from here, but today's shrimp plate left me thinking, "damn that's good, but that's it?".  6 shrimp was all i got, now maybe if they were H&J or Boiling Crab size shrimp it'd be cool but that wasn't the case.  They were on the smaller side.
    Hence the 4 out of 5.  I still love the place though and know whenever a kanak attack lurks this place most often than not satisfies.  Food is ono, service good, portions tend to be ample... just not today, but yeah lol
