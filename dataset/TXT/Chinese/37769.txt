AR1w3ragHgRvnU71A7aaZA This was my first time at this restaurant and having shabu shabu. I went w 2 friends. We got the lamb and pork combo and added waygu beef. We got half the pot spicy, half regular, and we added the thick type noodles. There was plenty of food for all 3 of us. We paid $12 something before tip, very reasonable for the amount and quality of food. The vegetable selection that came with it was good, also included some fish and pork balls. I had mostly spicy, and added some chili paste. When I had the noodles at the end I had to add a little regular to cool it off, but it was an enjoyable spicy flavor. The taste was phenomenal, I will definitely be back.
