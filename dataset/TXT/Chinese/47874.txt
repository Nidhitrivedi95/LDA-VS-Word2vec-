c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ Had breakfast here since it was just across the street from where I stayed. Decor was pretty old fashion. I ordered the Eggs & corned beef... portions come out looking small but it was enough to make me full (or I got sick of it and didn't want to eat anymore). Nothing really special about the place. Except they have $5 bloody Mary and Mimosas. They have steak and eggs special from 11pm to 6am for $6.99.
