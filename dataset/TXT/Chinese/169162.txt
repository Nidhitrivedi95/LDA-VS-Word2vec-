Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Over indulgence on spectacular food is easy at Pan Asian. My sister is back in town and I have my eating partner back. We share the same philosophy of sharing food to maximize our chances of trying multiple dishes and sometimes to cut back on calories. We will even order one dish at one restaurant and move to another to try something else.

Not here at Pan Asian. We sat down and ordered enough to keep us full the whole day. They are running a special with Yelp, a $10 for $20. This is steal because you can get a whole lot of food for twenty. We started off with their famous chicken wings. 7 or 8 large meaty wings came out, fried to perfection, and NON-BREADED. I hate breaded wings because they get soggy fast. These were some of the best wings I have ever had. They come with a side of thousand island. My sister and I normally don't like mayo, but we lightly smeared on a bit. If that was not enough, I had ordered the level 7 Tofu Massaman Curry. It was no inferno, but it had the creep up on you heat. There is a genuine point to their scale. I am tired of ordering a ten and wondering where the spice is. The sweet potato were soft, the avocado creamy, and the tofu lightly fried. In the end, the sauce was all that was left and I ended up spooning that on top of the Fried Clear Noodles. My sister even ate a full bowl of rice because the curry was just that good. Most of the time she eats half a bowl and feigns being full. I am beginning to learn that usual habits will go out the window when you enter the door.

It was cool because we witnessed them filming a segment on local eats. Look for Doreen Fang's blog to watch the spot on Pan Asian. There were some delays in order being made because of it, but it was like being in the audience of a cooking show. Speaking with Doreen after was awesome because she is putting a lot of emphasis on local mom and pop shops.
