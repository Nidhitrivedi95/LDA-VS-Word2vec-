Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA The BEST Thai in town. Not just in my hood, but the best period. I'm not usually regretful but I'm seriously upset that I just recently discovered this gem. 

The Massaman curry is amazing. With big chunks of sweet potato and buttery avocado, "It's the best Jerry, the best!" Spicy #7 is ALL I can handle. They do 1-10 on the spicy scale and we're talking serious heat here. If my Thai food doesn't cause a runny nose, I don't wanna eat it. David Wong's does the trick every time. If you order spicy #5 at your usual Thai joint, you probably wanna cut that down to about a #2 at Pan Asia. 

If you LIKE Thai food, try David Wong's, and you will LOVE Thai food.
