e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg i visited R&D this past week for the first time after hearing all the craze about it. I don't follow Masterchef Canada (only one I've seen is Masterchef Junior because come on, who doesn't like kids cooking?)

This restaurant is beautifully decorated with very rustic yet modern tones. Great for casual business encounters or a nice dinner for a small group. 

To make this review quick, here are some highlights: 
- If you go, you MUST get the CSB (cha siu bao) - these are made fresh every hour.
- The Lobster Chow Mein was good but I thought it should've been a bit warmer 
- Crab bibimbap is bombtastic - definitely a different spin to your traditional bibimbap. It's also pretty filling
- The General Sanders (which is basically their spin on chicken and waffles) is a lot bigger than it looks - please share this with at least one more person unless you want to go into a food coma at the table. It comes with the kung pao sauce as well as a slightly sweeter sauce. The HK egg waffles were good but a bit hard. The chicken was do delicious - the flavour seeped from the crispy skin deep into the actual meat of the chicken and the chicken was cooked just perfect - no dryness!
- The dumplings were a bit soggy - they weren't one of our favourites 

For dessert, I tried the creme brulee with the sour cherry - note that the sour cherry tastes more like a sour plum sorbet? I would pick the smoked milk with malted ice cream over that.

Expect to spend a bit more here but it's definitely worth a try!
