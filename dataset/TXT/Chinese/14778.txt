3HrT5IcO3sd4pSBCFP4OYw I am a fan of Chiense Cuisine, in fact Chiense food is one of my favorites. We might not have a Chinatown in this city, however, that doesn't mean we don't have delicious and authentic Chinese food in Arizona.

The entrée's at China Grill are absolutely delicious.  Without a doubt, one of the best meals that I  have had in a Chinese restaurant.  You won't find stodgy batter, or red dye stained food at China Grill, what you will find is fresh, tasty, made to order delicious meals.

On my first visit I went with the Honey chicken, fried rice, egg drop soup, and eggroll. The Honey Chicken was crispy, plump fresh white meat chicken, perfectly seasoned not drowned in sauce. The Honey chicken was probably some of the best honey chicken I have had. The eggroll were crispy, full of flavorful vegetables, and the rice was cooked perfectly.

When I finished my meal and pushed my plates away, my check was brought out immediately, along with take-out containers for my leftovers.  a perfect meal, great service, and delicious food.  I'll be going back very soon.
