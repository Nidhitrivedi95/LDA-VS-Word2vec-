Rg4FHrDOD2DJeDY_khy-0w I like their Caramel Chicken. I think its the slivers of cucumber that make me enjoy this dish. It's a little freshness and crunch that adds nice contrast to the sweet fried chicken. Mongolian Beef is pretty tasty also but can be a bit heavy. I've tried a few of their lettuce wraps also which were just okay.
