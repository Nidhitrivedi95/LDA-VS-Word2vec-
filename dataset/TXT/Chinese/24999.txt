75SBuDApJU5ca9tGC1Pw3Q Our group of 18 was actually first at their other location on Woodbine.  It being the Sunday lunch hour, it wasn't much of a stretch of the imagination that they wouldn't have room for us!  A quick thinking member of our group got the Woodbine location to call this location to see if they had room for our unruly crew.  As luck would have it, they did and off went our little car-cade up north.

The table was ready for us right away.  Imagine!  There was a line up of regulars who didn't call ahead and must have thought that their time has come for a seat, when our group strolled in and claimed the tables dead in the centre of the restaurant all to ourselves.  The envy!

The food... very delicious almost Hong Kong Cafe style food, but not quite.  The red curry chicken chop on rice was ok... nothing special really.  It didn't have any greens other than onions, but it will satisfy any cravings for HK style chicken chops.  I had their well-known special of noodles in fish broth with super soft fish balls, tofu and winter melon.  Not much to look at, but oh, so good!  It's very different from most of the other items on their menu.  They are also known for their Hai Nan Chicken Rice.

To finish off, we had a surprise dessert for the birthday girl.  The Napoleon confection with puff pastry, strawberries, cream and a gigantic dollop of black sesame ice cream was well worth it for the visual excitement alone.

Cash only, surprisingly less busy (though there were still steady line ups the entire time we were there) than other Chinese places of this caliber probably due to their far off location in a strip plaza.  A good worthwhile place to try out.
