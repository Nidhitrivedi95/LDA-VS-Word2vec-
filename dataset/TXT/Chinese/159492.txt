U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ Hands down one of the best phó places I've ever eaten at. In this area at least. Their food is always fresh. Service is great and the staff is one of the friendliest I've seen. We go so often, they know our order without us even saying a word. I love the food and the atmosphere.  Spring rolls are also very delicious!
