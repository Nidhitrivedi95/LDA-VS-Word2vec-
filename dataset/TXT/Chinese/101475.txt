kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A This is my first yelp rate and review, and it's going to be for the Noodle Man. This place is amazing. I was craving noodles, upon searching for a good sit down resturaunt, my SO found this place. Our first impression was that it's busy and small and quaint joint, and these are all good signs. We sat at the bar where we were able to spectate the staff preparing and cooking their guests meals. They took a minute to Take our order, but we came in during a rush take out order. The length it took from when we ordered to when our food was placed in front of us was no more than 5 minutes; Acceptable! Better yet, everything was delicious. From the Hot tea to the freshly made dumplings to the filling bowls of Noodles we ordered. The Mongolian Pork Pancakes are definitely worth coming back for. I loved everything about this place: the authenticity of the food; the giant  glass window where we can watch them work with efficiency, and for them to see the state of their restaurant. Garunteed Regular visits from me.
