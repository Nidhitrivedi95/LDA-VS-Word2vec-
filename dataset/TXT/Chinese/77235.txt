This is becoming one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Cleveland. If you care for spicy food, I would definitely recommend the new spicy dry pot that just came out. 

Aside from that, my personal favorites include: Gan Guo Ji (spicy dry pot chicken, make sure you ask for the chicken to be boneless), Fu Qi Fei Pian, Shui Zhu Yu Pian (spicy fish filet), and Taro & Chicken (again, make sure you ask for boneless).
