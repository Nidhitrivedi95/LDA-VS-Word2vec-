He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw Alright alright alright. Petit potato is pretty swell. The staff is on point here. I've been here once before, and I asked for warm water rather than the usual cold water. This time, the waiter remembered my order and immediately gave me warm water right as I sat down. 

Good service. 

Today, I ordered a sliced pork ramen--and let me tell you--it was alright. Definitely not as good as other restaurants I've been to in Toronto or Montreal, but it was decent. Portion was good, broth was a little salty for my taste, and although the meat was tender, it didn't melt in my mouth. 

I also had a condensed milk red bean slush, and it was in 1/2 liter glass, filled to the brim, and a good portion of red bean. It was served as cold as the most frigid of Montreal winters, and it wasn't too sweet.

Would definitely recommend. They played top 40 music, and it seems that the general age of the customers were from 20-35 years old. 

Trendy, but not overbearingly so.
