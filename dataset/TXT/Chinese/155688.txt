Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w Went to Siam last night (and many times in the past) and it was surprisingly slow, which was fine by us.  The food was on point as usual.  The service is very good.  We've never tried their thai food, but the Chinese is our favorite in the city.  The sichuan fish (flounder?) is amazing.  Eric's favorite and the pan fried noodles are also superb.
