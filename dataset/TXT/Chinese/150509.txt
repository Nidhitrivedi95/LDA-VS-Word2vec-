SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA I used to live right around the corner from this restaurant, so it was a frequent destination for my wife and myself.  We went to their grand opening way back when. Alas now we live too far away, but we make a special trip to dine or take out when we can. (Sorry Kam!)

My wife and I lived in the SF Bay area for 14 years so we have made our way around a Chinese menu or two. I try to stay away from the obvious Americanized menu items and take suggestions from our server as to what is fresh and special.  I have never been disappointed with their suggestions off the Chinese menu and regular menu. Sometimes you will get lucky and they have fresh mushrooms, clams, crab, whole fish etc...I have a soft spot for anything noodle and their "dry" chow fun is one of my favorites.

I have found this place to be one of the better Chinese restaurants in town.
