cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ I have had dinner buffet many times here and the food quality and selection is decent based on the price. They do Birthday specials here (free for the birthday person if there are 4 more guests?). I recently held a baby shower lunch here and was disappointed about the service. We made a reservation for 1:45pm so we would not be rushed since there are 2 seating (11:30am and 1:45pm). First of all the room was supposed to accommodate up to 25 people. Instead, they used one of the tables outside the room. The manager also said we could stay until 4pm but all of the servers rushed us to get out. I understand the buffet stops at 3:30pm but they could let us just chat at the tables. In the end I found out why because everyone was taking their afternoon naps in between the lunch and dinner service. Anyways, it was horrible and I felt bad for my guests. Never would I book a party here again. However, it is ok if you are coming with a few family and friends.
