yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA This place is NO BUENO. The only good thing here is the young coconut... Slurp that one up and it's delicious. Next time I come here I will only get that...

Ok but to be brief, the service is sloppy. We ordered a beer and never got it. Still was on the bill. We had to flag our waiter down to order. Once our food was at the table, no one ever came to check up on us. 

The pho i overpriced, the broth is not very well flavored. I was not satisfied. To pull a restaurant name like this, much more is expected.
