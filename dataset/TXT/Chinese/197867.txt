zUL2Fo6Bz9KQxDIw_r-qTw Thank you Dr. Noborikawa! I have had neck pain on and off for years from an old athletic injury. Recently, the pain returned. Went to see Dr. Noborikawa for help. I AM SO HAPPY! My pain has abated after a series of sessions. Not only did she help me with my pain, but she was helpful with suggestions to keep me pain free as much as possible too. Dr. Noborikawa was professional, gentle, caring, all that you could want with a practitioner. I was impressed with her passion about her craft. She truly cares. I will undoubtedly return when the need arises. Highly recommend her to anyone who can benefit from her services.
