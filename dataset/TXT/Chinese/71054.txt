fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ ok, i wouldn't necessarily say i'm a fan but what i ate was pretty damn good food. authentic or not, this place is above average if you're okay spending $$$$ for chinese food. 

i'm chinese. so for me, paying more than $40 on chinese dinner is really ridiculous. but i was in vegas for business and since the client loves chinese food, here we were. all 16 of us.

we started off with an array of appetizers. the highlights? the mu-shu vegetable wraps. the hoisin sauce it came with was NOT hoisin. maybe a hoisin imitator but i guess i shouldnt be too surprised. the vegetable egg rolls weren't too bad either but definitely nothing special.

next we all ordered our own entrees. i got the three cup black cod. HIGHLY recommend this dish. the fish was so good...think miso black cod but chinese style. i also tried the lobster, sweet and sour shrimp, and vegetable fried rice. everything was pretty tasty.

for dessert, i got the pineapple/coconut ice cream concoction. it was OK. 

overall, this place is fine. honestly, i don't think asian people would ever think to come here. only tourists and westerners would pay top money to eat chinese food. this wouldn't be my first choice for dinner but hey, i wasn't paying! 

if you want to find where the asian people congregate, check the buffet lines! ;)
