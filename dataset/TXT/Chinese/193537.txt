ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Really cool trendy space, tons of interesting drink options with a friendly staff. Thought the food was mediocre at best. Nothing knocked me off my feet as I was expecting. Tried the shrimp dumplings, tuna chips (actually very delicious with the guac) duck croquettes were over cooked and rocky. pork bun and chicken and waffle bun were decent. The restaurant has a cool vibe however I would return for that reason
