eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ Well we ordered from an online company and the order was confirmed. An hour later I called no one answered. I emailed the online company who I ordered from and they too did not get ahold of them. My order had to be cancelled because nobody answered the phone. Got my money back and for my inconvenience I was awarded $15 for my next order online. 
I still craved Thai food and ordered from another place. This place answers their phone and delivered my food pretty much on time. 
BEWARE IF YOU ORDER ONLINE, YOU MIGHT GO HUNGRY IF THIS PLACE DECIDES NOT TO ANSWER THE PHONE EVEN IF THEY ACCEPT YOUR ORDER ONLINE!!!
