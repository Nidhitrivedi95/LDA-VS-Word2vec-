BCga5CbMqcZLCpxAuln57w I get takeout from here when I don't feel like cooking! They have an awesome extensive Asian bistro menu and a sushi menu. I recently ordered the chicken and shrimp pad thai. Overall it tastes great, had chopped up carrots,peppers, and onions and a good amount of meat and shrimp. I ordered medium, I didn't think it was spicy tasting at all. If you like spice I'd go with the spicy! I also ordered the Dragon roll, the shrimp tempura was perfect along w he avocado and eel sauce drizzle! My favorite if you love avocado and a little crunch! The restaurant itself is also a very nice atmosphere, clean and modern.
