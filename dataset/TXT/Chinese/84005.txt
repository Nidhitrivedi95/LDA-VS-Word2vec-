heyU2rq-K2soH-V0SVMHVQ Well I only go here because of Mimi and her husband.  They use to own Thai Cuisine on Independence. The best Thai food in Charlotte.  If you go to Mama Fu's you can get the husband to fix some items like he use to fix in his restaurant.  The best sticky-rice and Mango in Charlotte.  But you also have to get to know the asst manager Bridgette.  What a sweet girl and she is on top of her game when it comes to customer service.
