_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Noodle Asia was my Vegas hero. After blacking out at a pool club and waking up at midnight with a hangover that I can't believe, we were starving and in need of sustenance. Noodle Asia was there for us   While I was still too hungover at the restaurant to eat, I cannot express the excitement I had when I ate those leftovers later that evening. Thank you Noodle Asia. 

We went back to Vegas a couple years later and couldn't find Noodle Asia. I believe that it only appears when it's truly needed.
