VGxJbglGlx-a7Gdc55Q6jQ In walking distance to my castle, and I love a good sushi.  The sushi was average at best.  I would go back to try the hot menu, but not just for sushi.  It was a random Thursday night around 7PM and it was pleasantly not crowded but the service confused and the atmosphere was just disoriented.
