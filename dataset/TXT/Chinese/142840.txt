RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw Congee(chicken, duck and egg Super Bowl $10) my go-to sore throat remedy. 
Very meaty and never lacking flavor like other congee places. 

Today we ended up with a $35 food trip, tips and taxes in and still lotsa take-out left.
The meal included the Super Bowl congee, half crispy chicken, chinese donut in noodle roll, deep fried shrimp dumpling! Stuffed and satisfied!!
