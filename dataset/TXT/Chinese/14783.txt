3HrT5IcO3sd4pSBCFP4OYw Close to our home and had never tried!  Wow... great Chinese food and awesome service.  Friendly, family owned restaurant with an eye towards service and great food.  Pot stickers homemade and Mongolian Beef was great.  The menu is pretty diverse so can't wait to try some other options. Enjoyed the atmosphere and neighborhood feel.  Definitely will be back here again.
