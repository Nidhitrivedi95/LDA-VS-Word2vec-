aqszoKRB4Ol9bpemt0_-GQ Went here for lunch and we were the only ones in there. We got great service because of it, but I wondered why no one else was in there? I got the eggplant special, as I always order eggplant in a Chinese restaurant.   The food was pretty good although the portions were small compared to some. I will likely return sometime.
