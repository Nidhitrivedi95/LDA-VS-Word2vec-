EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw I really get annoyed that so many "YELP ELITES" seem to have an issue giving 5 stars. Even regular Yelpers do it-if it is great it is great. 

My review as I come after my massage (medical massage next door at Body Kinetics). I've been twice and I'm a major lover of Chinese food. This did not disappoint. For quite literally next to nothing you can eat a whole lot of dim sum. They are quick and terse (not really service with a smile) but when they are that busy and running around you can't blame them-especially with these prices. 

A few tips-don't rely on photos as they aren't always the same as the food served-for the most part yes but if you don't do dim sum ask, also the spare ribs are quite nasty, not the red long spare ribs seasoned as you may be accustomed to but a little bowl of fatty, very little actual meat and embedded bone (got it twice so I vouch for this). Also TIP-an egg roll is a SPRING ROLL. I knew this and they clearly show it but if you are looking for good old fashioned DEEP FRIED, CRISPY, PORK AND VEGETABLE EGG ROLL-go to a Hunan restaurant.

All said I really think for $20 to get beyond full is a bargain-especially when the food is good.
