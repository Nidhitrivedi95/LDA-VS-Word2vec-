GL7tuUyuCPsz1L0L81MpUA The food is tasty, the price is great and the waiters always try to make you smile 

It is definitely not the fanciest restaurant in Montreal but if you are hungry their lunch special included a soup of your choice and a healthy portion of the dish you chose. You definitely can have leftovers for dinner!
