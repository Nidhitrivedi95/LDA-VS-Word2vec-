I came here for dim sum on a weekday.  I've been to many dim sum places in various parts of the world, and who knew that the worse was located in Las Vegas?

I ordered a plate of custard buns and it was... cold.  Then I pointed to a plate of stuffed eggplants on the cart, then the lady immediately ran off with it, and I thought, "Huh?  What?  I just ordered that!"

It turns out she had gone to microwave it.  In plain sight.  Classy.

Microwave dim sum.  Need I say more?
