yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA If you're looking for something off-strip, cheap and to cure your hangover, COME HERE. Pho is the perfect remedy the day after a night of partying and drinking on the strip and this place HITS THE SPOT. 

It's not too far from the strip, maybe a 5-10 minute lyft ride over and this is exactly what I needed to end my weekend. There's really not much to complain about the Pho, the broth is great and they give you a hefty portion of meat on the side. For $9 a bowl, I'd eat this over anything else on the strip on any given day. 

Another thing that is very necessary is the Vietnamese Coffee, it's sweet but also packs a punch, so it does give you the jitters.
