Y1wzvTTI_rSAJOF1224LCQ I'm totally surprised that many people dislike this restaurant. But I've never had dimsum there, and always had dinner there.

Dinner is great there. The food is prepared well, very tasty and the ingredients are fresh. And best of all, the price is fantastic.

We can have a family dinner there, order 10 dishes, including lobster, peking duck and fish, and the total comes to under $200.

Each dish is very good, there's are not very many dishes that are considered bad. Veggie dishes are cooked to perfection. For example, its easy to overcook snow pea leafs or have it stringy. But not only do they cook it to perfection, they add abalone mushrooms. Terrific.

The duck may not be as good as say Chung King, but every other dish outshines that restaurant.

Overall, it's great value for great food.
