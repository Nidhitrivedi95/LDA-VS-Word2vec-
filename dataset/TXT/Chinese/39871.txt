ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ Very good place to go if you are looking for Hk cafe style food. I always come to this place because the food is decently priced, food comes super fast, and service is pretty good. 

My favorite is their baked spinach and fish rice. Unlike other places, they actually give you fried rice instead of white rice. The fried rice just makes the dish that much better. 

The other food that I also love are:
- French toast (I think they make the best in Toronto)
- fish ball noodles
- honey garlic wings
- garlic sauce with chicken and rice 

Highly recommend this place!

Ps: they have very good  chili oil
