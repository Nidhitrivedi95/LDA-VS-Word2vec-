f-ookZOX4pBNldaOHMkJ4A This place is a racist joint. We ordered a cold HK milk tea but requested less sugar and ice (a completely reasonable order). They gave us a watered down version of "tea" with no ice and too much water. Then when we requested to change it, they started speaking in Cantonese to each other complaining about how we didn't know what to order. Unfortunately for them, I was with my Hong Kong Cantonese speaking friend. Thus, this review. Don't go here if you have some dignity to protect. go to chatime instead for bubble tea.
