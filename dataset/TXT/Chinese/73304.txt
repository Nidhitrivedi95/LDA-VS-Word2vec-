Fj0zObYm5McHcbtE6MSU0A We were not sure at first of the distance outside of downtown Las Vegas. But we took the time to go the 9 miles and were wonderfully rewarded. The food was the best Asian food we have had, maybe ever. Everything was so authentic, and the service was superb. The restaurant, while small, was very clean and well worth the trip
