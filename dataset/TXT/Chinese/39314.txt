Av5toUG7wweXfiX6FW4F0A I have been here for a couple of times, but they have blown my mind in every single way. I ordered Pho Dac Biet and my company got the Pho Ga.
- presentation: side dishes are perfectly presented, with bean sprout, basils, some slides of jalapeño and lime.
-  size and portion: good enough to fill you up. They use the thermal bowls, which helps to keep the broth hot at all time.
- taste: flavorful, delicious.
- decoration: the cafe ground is always clean.
- bathroom: many stocked up goods and they take care of it pretty well, no diaper changing area.
- customer service: very friendly, family style.

I will try something else next time besides the soup.
