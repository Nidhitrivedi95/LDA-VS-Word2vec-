DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA food  was pretty good. would like to give it a 4 but dont really think it's 4 star, 3.5 would be more accurate. the food is tasty. the staff is very unfriendly. the bathrooms were gross. but it's the food i care most about. service and cleanliness is important, but i dont expect great service and a clean bathroom in a chinese restaurant.
