yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I love this place so don't get me wrong about the rest of this review but honestly a lot of their new workers are rude; at least the night shift people are. I understand you're having a bad day but the way the cashier who worked tonight spoke to my boyfriend in the rudest manner and didn't even make eye contact.
I only rated so low cuz of how the service has been lately. I work in an area with clients and customers and I understand it can be annoying and difficult but that doesn't give anyone the right to give rude service unless they are being ridiculously difficult.
