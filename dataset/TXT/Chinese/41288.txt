b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag This review is more for the bar in the front. I don't really care for the food. If you are feeling adventurous and you love fruity drinks as much as I do, then this is the place for you. They have all sort of exotic fruit drinks. My favorite came with mango. They even have some with pomegranate. SUPER YUMMY! Also, the bartender was super cool about making you a new one if you didn't like it, BUT I LOVED THEM ALL!!!
