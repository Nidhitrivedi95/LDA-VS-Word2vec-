lv3h7WwuxPyJNLTeWeL5LQ I've had dimsum in Hong Kong. It was loud and boisterous and absofricking fantabulously delicious. Dumplings to weep over. Sticky rice bundles filled with tasty delights. Delicate and tantalizing desserts. Service so efficient that you're never wanting for food or variety and your tea pot is always fresh and full. Tables full of families with at least 3 generations representing. 

I found something similar at Century Palace. This cavernous restaurant fits a LOT of people. And every weekend it's packed to the brim. If you're lucky, you get a seat where the carts always pass by. If not, make sure you stand as they pass and get yourself noticed. CP has way more dimsum selection than most places I've been to. And it's gooooooooood. Make sure you get the staples of Har Gow (shrimp in rice wrapper), Siu Mai (pork in egg wrapper topped with shrimp), Cheung Fun with Shrimp (rice noodle filled with shrimp with sweet soya sauce), Pork Dumplings, Deep Fried Squid Tentacles and Bao (steamed rice bun filled with bbq pork). Bonus points for having Tofu-fan (hot tofu with sugar syrup). 

Sunday is THE day for dimsum. Be prepared to wait. I guarantee that it's worth it.
