lcSsIw_oC-OT2veksCtRwg China Way was my absolute favorite...and I grew up in the Chinese food industry just outside of NYC so I am picky. Sadly, I had not been by for a number of months and went back last week for my usual: house fried rice with extra shrimp, crab angels, wonton soup, and whatever else my husband wants. We also got lemon chicken. Drove through and took it home and was VERY disappointed. Realized there had been a major change and contemplated calling the restaurant to find out if the cook had called in sick. Checked out yelp and found out I'm not the only one dismayed by the changes. The chicken dishes were dry and hard...nearly choked my chiweenie (dog) to death. Wonton soup was cloudy/pasty. We hardly ate any of the food and threw the leftovers away. I'm in mourning.
