hwe7f0QthkND-H4Ekg37qw I don't know how they do it but this place has some of the fastest delivery times.  Even living in greenfield it would still get there in 30. Love their vegetarian options and I'm not even a vegetarian anymore ha.  Crab rangoons are the best ever and the fake orange beef is amazing.
