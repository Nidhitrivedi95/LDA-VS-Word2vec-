3fw2X5bZYeW9xCz_zGhOHg What is up with First Markham Place stealing the names of well-established restaurants? First Din Tai Fung, now Hui Lau Shan?

Tracy Dessert should not even be allowed SAY the words "Hui Lau Shan," because they are FAR from being the dessert wonderland that is the real Hui Lau Shan in Hong Kong.

We tried the Mango Pomelo Pudding, Black Sesame Tong Yuan, Green Bean Soup, Walnut Soup, Almond Soup, Black Sesame Soup, Tong Yuan in Ginger Soup, and Matcha Green Tea Shaved Ice. 

You would think that out of all the things we tried, at least one would be great-- but all were subpar. The dessert soups tasted like they were made from a powder, and on top of that the Black Sesame Soup was burnt! No thanks! Someone get me back to Hong Kong!
