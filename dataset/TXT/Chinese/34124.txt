TCJ : Thai Chinese Japanese AYCE 

Interesting concept .. really straight to the point. Very surprised .. They had sashimi .. very good quality salmon. They have a very solid menu , a great selection of items. I liked that they gave you the premium vegetables along with all the proteins , flavours were clean & delicious. Portion size was great .. You could always order more anyways , service was prompt .. food came relatively fast & very fresh. decor inside is refreshing compared to outside .. Facing a mcdicks ( eww ) but what can you do bout that , good location , but inside is nice and clean. price was very good for Japanese .. Let alone Chinese and Thai included .. That's legit ... & .. 10% off if you pay by cash !! That's amazing ! honestly I never thought id find a place like this downtown toronto , very reasonable pricing .. Sapporo beers 5 BUCKS , I would highly recommend you order the short ribs , so god damn BOMB DIGGITY.. !! 

real talk : id come again ..
