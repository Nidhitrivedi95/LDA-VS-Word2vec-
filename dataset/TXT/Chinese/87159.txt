Hrbwae-MS_7JlS27uoigIA Came today for lunch. Tiny little place. Some tables are quite close together. Very little space to wait inside. We did have to wait for about 10 minutes. Our party ended up being seated in a booth with an extra two person table pushed together with it. 

I had the fortune stone special chicken with rice ($8.25). According to my receipt, it was chicken with sweet soy sauce. It came with soup and a drink. Soy milk was an option, so I got that one. I got mine cold. We wondered whether I'd get an upcharge that usually comes with making drinks cold. Didn't end up paying that charge, which was nice. Had the Russian borscht as my soup option. Uneven boels. Quirky. Other than that, fairly standard soup. Chicken was juicy. Rice was a tad dry. The few really long pieces of veggie added a nice bit of color as well as veggie content. Sauce was almost like a seafood soy sauce, so slightly sweet, and had sauteed onions and garlic in it, as well as a layer of oil. Tasty with everything else on the plate.

Not bad food, but the prices are a tad higher than I'd expect from a place like this.

Logos note: debit accepted and they're willing to separate bills.
