yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA To preface: My review is based only on the pho.

Pho Kim Long is a Las Vegas culinary mystery to me. The restaurant is always busy, which is generally a good sign, and following the masses, I went to sample the pho. I was simply not impressed, and I am not alone, just visit this Yelp discussion: http://www.yelp.com/topic/las-vegas-ok-gimme-the-best-pho-in-vegas

No mention of Pho Kim Long as the best pho, and even the 24-hour convenience does not merit more stars, as Pho So 1 is open until 3am, and after that you should really just be eating Korean BBQ. No need to go to bed on a stomach of noodles; you need protein to repair your party body!

Why didn't the pho impress me? Good question. The pho did not impress me because the broth lacked complexity. My favorite thing about pho is the deep sweet but savory flavor of a good broth-- the magic of anise, cloves and beefy bits-- but at Kim Long, the broth had the taste of a glorified, salty chicken broth. Without the broth, you might as well get the chicken noodle soup at Marie Callender's.

I think that Pho Kim Long gets overrated by hungry, sometimes drunkish visitors because it is close to the strip. I love visitors, I do, but we should try to get you some different late night dining options.
