0oSWfLMJZnl2HhOc2lQb2g I've been coming here for years great customer service and generous portions for good prices it's tasty but not omg slap your mother tasty. It will get you by all day on a lazy Sunday as one to go plate will last you all day. It's family owned so that's nice. They definitely have me and family as a regular here no complaints here.
