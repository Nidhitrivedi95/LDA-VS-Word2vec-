ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Got seated right away on a Friday night. Wonderful customer service and atmosphere. Our waitress was very attentive and thanked us for coming. We each got a steamed pork bun that was delicious. I got the spicy Thai beef rice with tempura scallions. I ate the entire bowl. The steak was delicious and perfectly cooked. My husband loved his pork ramen. We'll be back again soon.
