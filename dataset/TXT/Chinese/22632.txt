6nRbHreAZzP_RDqUyD1FPg We have been coming back to Pong Pong for years; so that is saying something.  I do find that their fried chicken dishes seem to be over fried, but everything else is great.  You do get a hugenamount of food for what you pay.  Do wish they opened a smidge earlier on weekends, but it is what it is.
