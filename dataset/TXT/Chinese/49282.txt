CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Way, way overpriced. Sure Vegas is expensive but this place goes beyond overpriced to obscenely overpriced and for just ok food. Not much in way of veggie options and if you ask, it's a flat no, you can't make any changes. 

Tried to ask whether or not the vegetable roll had any meat or seafood in it. I was met with "vegetable roll" and a weird totally fake smile. But does it have any meat in it? "vegetable roll" only a little louder with the fake smile. There's no meat in it? "vegetable roll!" Well, that was helpful. Never mind, I don't need to be eating fried food anyways. Food is also very salty, I was dying of thirst for the rest of the day.
