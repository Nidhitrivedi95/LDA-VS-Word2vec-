2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w I have not been to this restaurant for a few months and tonight I was disappointed with my take out order.  The lo Mein was dry and tasteless and the pork in my pork fried rice was totally dried out.  It will be quite a long time before I return to this restaurant.  It is so frustrating to get home with dinner when you have been working all day and your dinner is not good.
