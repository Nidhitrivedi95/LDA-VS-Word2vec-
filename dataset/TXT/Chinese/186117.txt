y5OFXka4tt7zHQB6KkFYjQ I had a craving for noodles so we stumbled upon this place. I found the restaurant to be small and a bit run down looking. Workers are Mandarin so we had to communicate with half broken Cantonese and English. 

Started off with a onion flavoured pancake for $2.99

You can choose the noodle of your liking. The name of the restaurant is "Hand Pulled Noodle" and I did not hear no one smashing dough on a table like I usually do so I'm questioning whether its truly fresh hand pulled noodles or maybe they just and a batch made already. 

Got a chance to try the beef brisket noodle $7.99 (large), pork rib with noodle $7.99 (large), seafood noodle $12.99 (large). Went with what they call "slightly thin noodle" which is the thickest noodles they serve. The noodles had a nice chew to them, the soup was very plain tasting and the meat was a bit on the chewy side and was decent in quantity. 

I would only recommend coming here if you want some quick noodles to munch on. Nothing impressive that stood out.
