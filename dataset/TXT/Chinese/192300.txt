Z0_qLqeFwOQGhBd_aC9s6w A decent place to dine-in but alot of folks were also doing takeouts. I went in with some office colleges for lunch. Plenty of seating, the server was very friendly, food came out in a decent time and was hot!

Lunch pricing was friendly on the pocket but even the regular pricing was good. I ordered the chilli chicken with egg fried rice and hot & sour soup, which was decent but I have had better. We also ordered some spring roll, which weren't the best. 

Overall the restaurant & tables were clean . Parking is not a problem as its part of a plaza. 

For my muslim folks - they had a sign full halal menu.
