9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw I've never ate at the restaurant but have ordered for delivery quite a few times.  The lady taking my order is well understood compared to other chinese restaurants.  The broccoli beef, combination chowmein, and shrimp in lobster sauce are our faves here.  Very delicious.  Delivery is quick too.
