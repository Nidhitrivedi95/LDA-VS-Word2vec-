The proportions are massive so come here with an appetite or be prepared to bring home some leftovers.  I loved how it was cozy inside with only a few people.  Somebody recently opened up a new Chinese restaurant a block away so less people are eating here now.  Before that this Establishment used to be a lot more packed.  It's still the same great food but now without the long lines to wait in.  So it can be pretty advantageous for folks who are in a hurry to go somewhere and they just want to grab a bite to eat.
