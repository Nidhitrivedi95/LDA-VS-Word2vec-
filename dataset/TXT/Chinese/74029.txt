FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ I ventured to this restaurant based on pictures on Yelp.  This place is more than just good food.  It's situated in this large plaza constructed with Chinese design that includes a large Chinese structured entrance and other similar style buildings around the plaza.  A small taste of being in China.  

The restaurant is in the back.  Today was a 20 minute wait while me and my kids viewed the 15 or so large tanks which held huge lobsters, lively  Alaskan king crab, eel and geoduck.  

My son loves the table side Peking duck so we went for that, but I'll surely be back with a group for the seafood.  In addition to the duck, we had the fried veal ribs which were some of the best Asian style ribs I've had.

Finally we were surprised by the sudden entrance of a dancing dragon crew.  Three of these costumes dancing dragons flew through the dining area, interacting with the patrons, as drums were played by the entrance.

A more than expected experience.
