VvSmE1NnTjnaTPHT0WrCaQ I haven't been to this place in ages - simple decor and clean - a decent place to bring your date.  Pumpkin with "meat" and coconut milk and a bean curd dish that tasted "fishy".  Both were good.

Food was well presented and tasty but portions you can get bigger at other Asian restaurants.
