The authentic Sichuan menu is pretty decent. You won't get mind-blowing Spicy Boiled Fish for example, but it's definitely tasty. They have a pretty complete menu, and you'll have an opportunity good amount of variety every time you go.

Admittedly though, their food lies more on the wet side, which means they don't make crispy things as crispy as they should, and when they fry some of their veggies, it comes out to tasting steamed rather than stir-fried. For example, the string beans I ordered, some beans were crunchy but most were soggy.

The food is tasty, and to reiterate that point, some dishes I've ordered, such as the cumin lamb and beef noodle soup all have good all around flavor and an okay amount of spicy. 

The foods I would watch out for are the non-Sichuan dishes, namely the Cantonese style dishes that come out to be really bland and miss the mark.

Boba was also decent, so I'll give that a plus too. Overall, decent restaurant for semi-authentic Sichuan cuisine.
