Oi-u4KqrcZbIWSYKnh7mJA Worst Chinese food experience I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. This restaurant ought to be titled "Fortune Cookie - The Deuce" because the quality of the food, atmosphere, and service belong in a dimly lit bathroom stall. 

The server made it to the table one time to take our order, I was out of water through half of my meal. The food was bland, chicken full of cartilage, and nauseating. Asked for my chicken spicy, yet cannot taste any flavor whatsoever. 

No one should ever go here... like ever again. Ever.
