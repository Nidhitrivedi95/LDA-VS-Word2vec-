U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ I was scheduling a pho-date with my girlfriend, and she suggested that we needed to go to Pho Chandler.  I live all the way up in Central Phoenix and a 38-minute-drive to Chandler did not sound appealing at all, but she swore that it was the best pho place in the valley.  My friend, boyfriend, and I sat down and the waitress remembered my friend well, and I thought that was cool.  It is always a nice touch when the people working in an establishment try to remember you. 

I ordered a Vietnamese coffee and the others ordered glasses of orange juice.  My coffee came out quickly, but the juice took awhile.  I felt bad drinking my coffee and joked that they must be picking out oranges from a grove and freshly squeezing them.  And guess what?  They really came out FRESHLY SQUEEZED.  The sweetness from fresh oranges was worth the wait.  My friend and boyfriend were quite impressed and happy.  

As for the food, we ordered a plate of pan-fried potstickers (tasted very fresh as well), and all of us ordered their seafood pho which is their specialty.  The broth is made from snow crabs, and you do get pieces of the crab in your soup.  The crab is actually REAL in an ACTUAL SHELL and not the imitation kind.  The crab not only makes the soup more flavorful, but it adds a sweetness to the dish.  My boyfriend wanted to add an assortment of veggies to his pho, and the waitress made it happen with a giant heap of green vegetables.  

I would seriously recommend this place to everyone.  I have been dreaming about their seafood pho for the last three days and can't wait to go back.
