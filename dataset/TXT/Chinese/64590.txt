If I hadn't gone with someone who liked the place I would not have parked and gone inside. I will say this, it DOES feel very authentically Vietnamese in that when you step inside the restaurant it feels like you've been transported straight to Vietnam because all the furniture is old and a little dirty and all the decor on the walls has been there since the 80s and is faded and peeling.

I am willing to look beyond ambiance if food is amazing, but the food here was only okay. I ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien and there was nothing that great about it. I will say that the size of portions in relation to the price was fair.

I really wanted to give this place 4 stars because I know it's locally owned by a family with two sweet daughters that are often sitting in the restaurant after school doing their homework, but I couldn't because the food didn't stand out as anything special to me.
