sSrPEj6v9XXHxybYbepnMA Disclaimer: I'm just visiting Montreal - from Vancouver - where I eat various Chinese cuisine a couple times a week on average.  

I ordered from Fang Chi from the good reviews on Yelp and its the first time Yelp has disappointed.  Perhaps it is an interpretation of how ethnic foods are cooked - West coast from here - I have noticed this before, and was prepared to make allowances.

I had my food delivered - it arrived quickly, was decent sized for the price and it was hot.  That is the good.

The bad is simply the taste, or lack of taste.  

The worst was the Won Ton Soup - flavourless broth, I added soy and pepper to make it better, but one bite of the won ton and I spit it out.  I'm not sure if it was a big ball of dough or if it just tasted that way.  It was tasteless, rubbery and disgusting.  No clue if it even had meat.  Seriously bad.

Next was the Chow Mein.  It was the rare kind of chow mein without noodles - first time I've encountered this and had to look it up (on Wikipedia) to confirm that was indeed a type available only in parts of Eastern Canada.  Sorry, I prefer the noodles.  It was pretty much tasteless, too much bean sprouts, chicken was cooked fine but really could not taste it.  There could have been more vegetables within as well.

Chicken Fried Rice was fine - tasteless though.  Ditto on the Breaded Shrimps.

Funny, the Dry Honey Garlic Spareribs were anything but dry - it was floating in sauce.  Oddly, this was the favourite of my wife's, I thought the meat too chewy.

I looked on the Fang Chi site to see if they were one of the non-MSG or organic/healthy restaurants (you can find in Vancouver) - which would help explain the lack of flavour - but saw little evidence of that.  It was just a bad meal.
