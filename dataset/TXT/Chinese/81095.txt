Gx3mxDNDd4XX897CgsAYNQ Update: I always try to give a second chance...so I decided to try the takeout.  

I used the Beyond Menu app...which you can access on the website. It made ordering a breeze.

I ordered the shumai, orange chicken and crab Rangoon. The website said 45 min...it took only 30 and she was really really nice.

The shumai was tiny...I was expecting a little bigger
..but they tasted fine.

The crab Rangoon was tasty...but the orange chicken...that was the bomb. Spicy...but not too much...just enough heat. 

Well done.
