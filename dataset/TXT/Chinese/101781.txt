kD05qsPROIFoEhgQIp_Vig I've been to gohyang many times and I must say this is by far my favourite restaurant in the area. They have recently renovated and added some delicious new item to their menu. Their pad Thai is to die for and the chilli chicken is just devine. Their sushi menu is extensive and they serve really fresh fish. I also like the new wine menu, which has a lot of great wines that pair really well with their food. The staff is very friendly and service has always been excellent. I have also ordered delivery a few times and must say they are always on time and the food was always great. A must try is their secret dipping sauce for calamari and spring rolls. Most delicious sauce I have ever tasted. I always ask for extra to go. Thank you gohyang and look forward to visit again.
