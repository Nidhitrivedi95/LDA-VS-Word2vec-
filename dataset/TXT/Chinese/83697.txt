HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ I was actually a dine in customer. Our server was not only slow but the food c p ming out was slow. It took a full ten minutes for someone to greet us, and another 10 for us to even get our drinks. Soda not cocktails. Had it been takeout or delivery I probably would have had a better review. Regardless the food was just okay.
