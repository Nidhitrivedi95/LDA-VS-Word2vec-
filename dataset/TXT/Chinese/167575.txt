This is the second time in five years that I return here. The food is good and the service is quick and pleasant. Their soupes are really good in particular the hot and spicy. 

One thing that's changed since the last time is the price to portion ratio. A la carte nothing seems worth it. The combos for two are a decent value with the prices ranging from 20 to 30$ per person

They make good general tau chicken with a nice slightly spicy sauce.
