The food was quite delicious, especially as I had no idea what to expect. For a group of people with varying tastes, and who are all quite picky, we all enjoyed our shared platters. 

We had: 

Fried chicken wings
General tsaos chicken
beef pho
shrimp curry
sizzling chicken
steamed rice bowls 

Other than the only dish that was really vietnamese, the Pho, the dishes were all delicious. 
The Pho was okay-not great. 

Overall a decent place to check out, if for nothing else than the atmosphere. 
Prices are reasonable, but dont go expecting to get a great bargain-we had a $20 off voucher and with no drinks it still came to $50.
