czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA This restaurant is so close to home and been telling myself to try it, every time I would pass by. Finally tired of the last couple horrible meals at my usual Chinese joint I gave it a try.
I got the General Tso's Chicken, order of Spring Rolls, and Singapore Rice Noodle.
The prices are about the same as other Chinese places around. Your food is woked fresh in front of you. The staff was friendly, service was fast. The restaurant was clean.
The General Chicken was delicious, best I've had in a while. The Singapore Noodles were a bit dry as well as the shrimp and pork seemed over cooked but it had nice heat and was tasty. The Spring rolls were very good, not greasy, nice thick sweet and sour sauce. 
I will go back again especially for some General Chicken and Spring Rolls.
