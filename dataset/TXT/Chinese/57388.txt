D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw I came here while working in Vegas.  

I ordered the Nasi Goreng which was great for lunch and great for dinner that night when I got home to California.

My girlfriend got the cha gu theow which she liked but complained that it was too spicy.  She ordered a level 3 spiciness and I ordered a level 7 but hers was spicier than mine.  

I would recommend this place if you're in the area.
