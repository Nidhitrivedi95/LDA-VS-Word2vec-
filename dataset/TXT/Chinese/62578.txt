dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw I normally come here because the food is great and authentic, but the service is lacking. Ordered some food to go and the price was a little higher then expected. My issue happened when I asked for an extra plate for my to-go items. I was told to use the lids to my containers with a serious look lol. Anyway, I'll come back because the food is great hahaha
