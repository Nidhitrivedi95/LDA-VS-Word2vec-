iyPtSR0s6EkvaQFbdJ_jVA Went here Easter Sunday so the place was dead, very personalized attention. It's not really a traditional dim sum restaurant because they are missing a bunch of amazing Chinese dim sum dishes (Phoenix buns, xiaolong bao, etc). 

I ordered the pork buns and the beef noodle soup. The pork buns were actually amazing, top quality. The soup was good as well, but I would try something else if I went back. Overall decent spot, I give it a four for my experience.
