t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg The one thing we need in Vegas is better Chinese food delivery.  It's hard to find good Chinese food, unless you live near at Chinatown.  We were craving Chinese but were too lazy to drive, so we turned to yelp to find the best delivery in our area.  

The food here was pretty good.  Menu seems simple.  Delivery was fast.  We ordered 4 dishes which came out to $37.  Portions were huge.  

The orange chicken was the best thing we ordered.  Big chunks of chicken that was seasoned and cooked well.

The kung pao chicken was okay.  Huge portion but a tiny amount of meat.  It was basically kung pao veggies.

The Mongolian beef was okay.  Same problem.  Very little meat buried in a huge pile of onions.  

The last dish was a thin white noodle dish in a clear sauce.  This would've been better but the noodles were soggy. 

Maybe next time I'll pay extra and ask for double protein.
