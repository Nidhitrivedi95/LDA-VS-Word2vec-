fvnaLCkyIyCw7vQuO8-H3g 3.5 stars. Ate here for dim sum lunch. Small, low-profile restaurant but nicer decor. Service was had that day was very engaging (treated you like a friend). That day they offered a special: home-made "joong"  (sticky rice in bamboo leaf) made by the owner, $6 each, but delicious. In a Chinese shopping plaza with a parking lot.
