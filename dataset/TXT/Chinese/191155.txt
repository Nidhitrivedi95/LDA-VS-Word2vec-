yrwKibiXRrTUnGKj7io5ag This was my first experience. The workers were polite when seating us and we received our drinks quickly. The buffet had a few different kinds of pork and chicken along with some sushi, fruit, soups and more. The flavor of the food was nice, however, some of the items I chose were not fresh. The pot stickers were cold and the shrimp tempura was quite stale. When it came to dessert I was excited for the tapioca pudding along with some macaroons. The banana cream pie would of been better if the bananas were not brown. Overall this place could be nice if the food was freshly prepared. As far as employees, two of my friends had to ask for a water refill and the girl at one point stood at a table booth with her head down. Also I noticed while grabbing desert, a chef behind the sushi counter was staring at me uncomfortably...
