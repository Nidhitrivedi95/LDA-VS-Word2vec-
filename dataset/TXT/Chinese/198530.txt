zZ-1hJKJAc_zG6X8_uLbcA It's a dark day...
When this is the best Chinese restaurant in the area, simply because the chicken taste like actual chicken and not some "mystery" meat.  Don't act like you don't know what I am getting at either.  

The food...
Is not seasoned all that wonderfully. Come here for a no frills dining experience at its most expensive!  You do not get free fortune cookies or chopsticks with your food either.  They have barely closed the gravy so it will spill all over your lap too.  

Atmosphere: 
This place has a mid level sanitation rating, I think a 94, and visible water, brown stains in the ceiling.  A lighted sign where the lights are blown, and no one has bothered to replace them.  There is silver duct tape conspicuously covering certain defunct menu items.

The staff:
A step up from "cold," The staff is just short of rude...  No one goes out of their way to be especially friendly, helpful or nice.  

The bottom line is, it's slim pickings from decent Chinese eats.   The two stars are relative.  The "best" one is only the best because they actually provide real chicken, under seasoned food, mechanical dispositions and gummy noodles!
