xYe-LX3lSKlNS3Wp29_YyA Absolutely disgusting service! The food was horrible! So called Chinese food; the orange chicken tasted like nacho cheese sauce with chicken, and they refused to take it back! And we complained they swamped out one clementine and said it was an orange! ALL the food was disgusting! Later the people behind me had the same problem, so this isn't a bias opinion! please don't waste your money and come here!
