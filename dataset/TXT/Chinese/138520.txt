QOmojzu24dTI2coPjOtu2Q Sadly after 3 late night tries I'm pulling the plug on Good Taste...weak name, weaker taste and service. Each time an order was placed ( i saw it written down and taken inside) and paid for, it was slooooow or lost requiring me to re-give my order. 3X. Yes, each visit I made I needed to re-give my order after waiting and waiting or seeing new customers come and go. On my last visit they also gave me wrong items. After taking the order twice. Unfathomable how communication can get so derailed in a place the size of a walk in closet. Sealing the deal for me was "the owner" (clutching a bag of factory sealed frozen egg rolls) stepping up to the plate admirably by stating "I hire people and some don't work too good".I had different order takers each time however. No apology given for their mistake. WEAK SERVICE! FACTORY FROZEN EGGROLLS...WEAK TASTE! You know it when you bite into it...nothing fresh about it. Orange chicken probably frozen too...bland chicken, breading, sauce. Crab puffs were decent only...on my previous visit, as they failed to include paid for said items on my fateful LAST VISIT. Did I mention weak service? I can get "good taste" frozen chinese food of this caliber from any grocery chain at half the cost and none of the headache! You"ve been warned.
