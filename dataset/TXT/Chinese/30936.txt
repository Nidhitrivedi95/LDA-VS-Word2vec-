9ibMbke1qYbmhJ2Qf3tWfA We have never been here, but received a flyer on our door with some coupons. We actually didn't end up using the coupons (yet) because we decided to have lunch here. It was definitely the best Chinese we have had in the southeast valley. I don't know what's going on with the quality of Chinese restaurants in Tempe/Mesa/Chandler (seems like every place I try is terrible), but Dragon Express is a shining star in the area. We ordered the chicken fried rice (not traditional, but tasty), and the vegetable dish with tofu (it was so delicious! Will definitely order again!). We also got some crab angels that were yummy and the best I have had in a while. The only disappointment was the chicken egg rolls; they seemed dry and didn't really have any flavor, but they were pretty large. Portions were great, prices were great. We ordered online and food was ready for pick up on time. The person who helped us at the counter was nice and friendly. The restaurant was clean and smelled good! We'll be back!
