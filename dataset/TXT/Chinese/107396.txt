l9vx-OTdDPU-oHZ17aVxdg This a nice place, always packed.  Food is great, not everything on the menu is upto par, but some simple dishes are done to perfection like the green beans, soup, and pakoras.  It's halal, and in the middle of Desi community.  The service is what I find very annoying, I know Asians don't like to talk much, but even to grab their attention, I have to yell across the restaurant for them to listen.
