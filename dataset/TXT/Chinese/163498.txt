URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg Best Chinese food we have found in AZ.  We live about 25 minutes away and do not hesitate to drive here anytime we want Chinese.  We don't even try places closer to us anymore.  I have not had anything bad here, but our favorites are the hot & sour soup (we get it without shrimp because my husband doesn't like seafood), Szechaun green beans, beef fried rice, hot and spicy Szechaun prawns (you have to try these if you like shrimp), and the holy grail, the salt and pepper chicken.  I dream about it. Really good food here, always a good crowd but still fast efficient service, and they get your order right.
