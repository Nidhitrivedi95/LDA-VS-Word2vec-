E8ugJa02FVCgfnjqV817iw I don't usually leave reviews but I thought I should for this spot. The staff was attentive and friendly which is a huge plus for me. The menu had plenty of options and there was a good sized lunch crowd. I think that also says a lot about a place. That being said, I would have given more stars had I liked my meal. I ordered the chicken Pho. Which I usually love..unfortunately the soup was basically garlic broth. I really love a genuine pho and this place added so much garlic that I literally couldn't taste the jalapeño. I'm sure there are plenty of garlic lovers out there whom would rejoice but I am not one of them. So this review is for all the people like me who would rather not have garlic in our Vietnamese soup. Da Vang also adds a ton of garlic to their soup. Hope this helps some of you out there.
