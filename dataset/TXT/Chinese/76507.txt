gAT3p2Ooou4lUYiF4OKj7g Our party of five visited the restaurant on a Friday night, and we were seated promptly despite a fair number of guests.  The service was outstanding and professional...we never had an unfilled water glass, and our waiter was friendly and efficient  The food, however, was bland, most likely because Yen Ching is located in a retirement area and they know their audience.  I can't say that anything was particularly fresh-tasting.  All five dishes we ordered were swimming in mild, salty sauces.  It's no wonder that this is my 80-something year old father-in-law's favorite Chinese restaurant.  Also, they need to lose the dusty artificial plants and the generic muzak, otherwise the atmosphere was okay.  There are much better Chinese restaurants around town for food, but you can't beat the friendliness of the staff.
