CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I ordered the basic chow mein noodles with chicken.  It was pretty tastey but not the best I've had...they seemed a little soggy (wierd, I know).  The old man ordered spicey noodles with chicken and he seemed to be satisfied!  He has a high tolerance for spicey dishes, so it was right on for him!  The dim sum all looked GREAT but we didn't order any this time.  I would definitely go back...even just to have a smorgasbord of appetizers!
