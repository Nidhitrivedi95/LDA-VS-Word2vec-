b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag Maybe it was the evening but the food was mediocre and service was slow.

The drinks took 15 minutes.   We ordered appetizers.   The appetizers were uninspiring.    The appetizers did not taste as if they were made on site but purchased thru a service company (ex. Sysco ).

My friends ordered the sushi and ment I need it was pleasant but nothing to write home about. I ordered the General Tso Chicken.  My sauce was bitter (thinking it was mixed with something or not prepared correctly.

The wait staff was pleasant but slow.   I would skip this place and find something more appealing.

Please note that you can see the kitchen staff.   They too seem uninspired which is probably reflective of the food.
