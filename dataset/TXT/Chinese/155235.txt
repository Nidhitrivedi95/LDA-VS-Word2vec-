TIu83s4sWMdhbwimzdfzIQ I always do take-out. and I pick it up (10% discount) because we live so close to it.  When my family comes over, very often if we're ordering out, this is one of the most requested (other than Tomasso's... will review next).  The food is cheap, the owners/employees are lovely, and it's much better than most fast food Chinese take-out around these parts. 

Would recommend the following: Singapore nooodes, the spicy squid, General Tao chicken, and the Cantonese Chow Mein.  They don't skimp on ingredients; for example, dishes that feature shrimp actually have lots.

Don't be put off by the rather run-down appearance of the restaurant.  The food is worth it.
