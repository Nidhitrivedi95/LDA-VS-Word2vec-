PXxgRi0njZb_X_slCIjqSA It's good, convenient and it's one of the few Chinese restaurants that cooks with gluten free soy sauce.  I'm sensitive to wheat/gluten and great tasting fast food is not really an option anymore.  I especially love their pork fried rice, beef chow fun and chicken and vegetable with the white garlic sauce.  Big portions too - we always get at least 2 meals - dinner and lunch the next day!  Friendly staff too.
