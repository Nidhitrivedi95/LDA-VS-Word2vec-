HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Would be a five star but the service is not great and some guy proceeded to have full working conversation during our meal.  

The servers are too focused on their own tables and not helping others by getting the food out.  I saw my sandwich sit ready for 5 minutes.  While my server was busy and the other server just looked at it.  

That being said.  The food was amazing.  Pork Bao and short rib grilled cheese must have.    Pass on fries. Just ok.  

I will come back for food and can hope service is better and other diners work at their office instead of restaurant.
