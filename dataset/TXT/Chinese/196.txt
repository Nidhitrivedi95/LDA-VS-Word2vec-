-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg is this place a joke.

terrible pho. Tasted no authenticity whatsoever. ID'ed every single one of us, including my bosses who look at least 35. Stirfries were unedible - worse than chinese take out honestly. Bunch of flies flying around, slow service, terrible food. 

come on.
