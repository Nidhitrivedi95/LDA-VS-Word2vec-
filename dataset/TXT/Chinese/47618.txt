BzZNKx6Des02RuAtT-uOPw I love the food and semi-dislike the ambiance. I don't like eating in plastic lawn chairs. And most of the servers have that  "I'm way cooler than this in real life" attitude. All that said, I could eat the fried tofu in dragon black bean sauce every day....and I don't really like tofu - but this is just different and wonderful! Lots of fresh vegies, wonderful creative ingredients on the entire menu and the cocktail menu was pretty cool as well. My husband tried some sort of basil ginger tini last time - it was wonderful! I would give the place five stars if the seats and service were nicer.
