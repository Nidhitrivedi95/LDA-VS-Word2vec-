tH_ObhULoHCb1n08pbHgHQ I tried this past week and found the dishes same as other places. The service was great as it is a family run business and we could see the owners eating with friends trying new dishes. We were one of the first customers to arrive and it is not super busy as other places.

During the night, we had a shrimp dish, peking duck (2 dishes), fried orange flavoured fish and a lamb plate. Overall, it was a nice experience and parking was not too difficult as it is east end of Markham.

I will be going again for CNY dinner and update this review with hopefully, some special dishes. The owner is nice and friendly explaining dishes and told us that there are new dishes in development.
