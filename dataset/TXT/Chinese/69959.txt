f1iTkj320DVn4TyWcvsUjA Food is a 3 star but I give a 4 star for effort.
The place has a bad location but still manages to survive. Its located in a small plaza with nothing much there to attract people to visit. 

Once seated we were given menus but noticed right away that there was no English. Not sure if there was any English menu but my dad was doing all the ordering so it was okay for us. We decided on the $68 prefix meal which came with a steamed fish, mixed seafood/veggie, half a chicken and sweet and sour pork. We added an eel cooked two ways for $38 (deep fried with light breading and other with sweet sauce). 

Once we finished ordering the lady serving us who I can only assume was the owner said we really didn't have much veggies so she said she would give us a veggie dish free. Meal starts off with a soup which I can best describe as being seafood mixed with eggs. I know I'm not describing it right but just look at the picture.

The rest of the food started arriving very shortly. While we were eating the owner starts to chat up my dad asking which area we live and asking us to come back more often. I guess this is how she gets return customers because throughout the night other customers came in and the owner would address them by name like they are regulars. And this didn't just happen once but with several other customers throughout the night.

I thought she was very kind and genuinely asking and almost begging for business. 

The food itself is typical Chinese food you can find anywhere else. The eel for $38 was way over priced and tasted decent only. The meal ended with tofu-fa which was really good and with another effort to retain us as regular customers the owner gave us some extra tofu-fa in a container to take home. 

So counting all the extra effort this lady put in I really have to give it an extra point.
