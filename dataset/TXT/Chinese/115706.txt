N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ Ackee fusion attempt: 
I'm Chinese and love Jamaican cuisine. I visit family in Jamaica often and love the food culture there. Ackee and salt fish with bread or bread fruit is one of my favourites and Patois's attempt to change the classic dish explains why you shouldn't change something that's already perfect. The main reason why I think this dish fell short was because the ackee is lost in the background. Maybe because the ackee we get in Toronto is canned and not fresh is why the flavour wasn't there. Either way, I wouldn't serve this to someone trying ackee for the first time. 

Chicken and waffle attempt:
I'm a novice when it comes to this dish but I wasn't wow'd by Patois's but it was good. A few days after trying Patois's my friend introduced me to real chicken and waffles and it over shadowed Patois's. It feels as though you're eating them as 2 separate items rather than chicken and waffles smothered with sweet and hot sauce. My mouth watered typing that out. 

The ambiance and dining experience was great though. The server was nice and patient and recommended some of his favourites. All the servers seemed genuine. I'd definitely go back for a beer and snacks.
