JQWIZ8MT-VGZzO5W5XCB5Q If you want good Chinese food  then 88 China Bistro is the place to go. I did a translation job for this company and its guest were from Shanghai. I wanted to bring the guests to a good Chinese restaurant  to eat lunch so I thought of 88 China Bistro. My dad works part time as a chef there so I only trust his cooking skills. I had the curry tofu and it was delicious and the curry sauce wasn't too strong. The flavor was just right. The egg roll was hot and crispy. My guests and I had the seafood soups and they all enjoyed  the seafood soups. My guests had the lo mein and the fried rice and one vegetable dish. They all enjoyed the food at 88 China Bistro. 88 China Bistro is not far from dowtown and it has its own parking lot. Although the parking lot is not big. The staffs there were super friendly. Great food and service.
