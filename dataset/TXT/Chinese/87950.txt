HyoPFfBHLK0lKVHWEdFpvQ BBQ Fried rice is really good. Lots of BBQ pork in the rice and they give you a generous helping. Orange chicken is good and so are egg rolls. The egg rolls aren't really greasy which is nice. The plain fried rice that comes with the entre is kinda bland and are plain nothing in the rice, but the rices that have meat and veggies in them are very good. I got delivery and food was here in less than 30 minutes. Will definitely order again.
