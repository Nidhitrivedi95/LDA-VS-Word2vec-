6sATfFam9_q9uod0I2aCsg I actually passed this restaurant several times driving by before I finally said to myself that I need to check it out. It's definitely the nicest (decor and food presentation) Chinese vegetarian restaurant I have been to in Toronto. 

The food is very original but a tad bit on the pricey side. We had the purple sweet potato soup which was very different but tasted amazing. We also ordered the fried rice with pine nuts which was just perfect. Not oily at all. 

I would definitely go back again because there are other items I want to try. I also want to check out dim sum lunch since we only went for dinner.
