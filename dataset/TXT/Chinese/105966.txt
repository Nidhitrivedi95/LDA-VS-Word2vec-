ky5L-EfUwU9chSPcIeXM5w I've been here around a few dozen times now and I still like it.

It's not authentic. It's not healthy. It's not the best in Las Vegas or Henderson but you know what, it's the best for a few miles all around, in this area of East Henderson.

Yeah. I know there are much better places in china town, on south eastern, on sahara, there are better places -everywhere-...

...but there are times living in far east henderson you just don't want to deal with traffic, freeways, wasting 30-60 minutes there and back depending on where you're driving and you just want to hurry up and get yo a$$ back home. I challenge you to find better chinese within a few miles of the corner of lake mead and boulder highway. 

So if you don't want to drive all the way over to Green Valley, just order already. It's not going to kill you and you know what, it's going to taste just fine. 

Things we have ordered and liked: I really like the egg foo young. It doesn't make sense because the gravy is not that great but they load up the eggy patties with lots of stuff and it tastes great on rice. We get the combination. We also get the honey walnut shrimp. Sweet but we like it better than Panda's. We've had quite a few other things here and someone said everything they have had has been over 4 stars. I have to agree with that. It's been consistently good unhealthy fast food chinese when you're lazy and eatin' on the couch with your honey.

My ***** five star rating comes from being the best in MY neighborhood. A neighborhood restaurant is one that is within 4 miles of my house. I can dash there and be back in my PJs extremely quickly.

It's not good enough to drive across town for and this rating may go down when some competition moves in...but until then, it's best in the area...and there isn't much to compare it to over here.
