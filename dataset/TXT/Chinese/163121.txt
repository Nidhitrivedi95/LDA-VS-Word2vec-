My girlfriends and I came here for dinner on a Friday night before hitting the town for my bachelorette party. We waited at the bar for the rest of our party to arrive, and I was happy with the drink options.

Once our party had all arrived we moved to a table...

Here's where things get lame:

First, one of my good friends asks our server about some wine and he just shrugs and says he doesn't drink wine, but that they have a "wine guy", aka a sommelier which he couldn't pronounce, but that he was at they're other restaurant....
Next, when I order I ask which seafood dish is best and he told me the Happy Family. It's a mix of shrimp, calamari, chicken, and scallops with veggies in a brown sauce, which sounded pretty good to me. Looking back I think he only suggested it because it was one of the more pricier options, at $15.95. 
I love veggies and it was mostly snap peas with some broccoli mixed in, so I grab a snap pea and immediately want to spit it out. It tasted like soap :( plus the sauce wasn't brown at all, it was kinda clear. Not much flavor at all, except for the soapy flavor :(
I didn't eat much but took the rest home for left overs. Later that night and for the rest of the weekend, I had some weird stomach issues but nothing too serious and chalked it up to the drinking from the same night. 
On Monday night, I heated up my left-overs and only took 2 or 3 bites because it tasted so horrible and immediately made my stomach hurt. The next morning I woke up to the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had. I won't give you all the gross details, but I was so sick I couldn't even stand to take a shower. 

I read another review just now with someone else getting sick from seafood, so DO NOT order seafood from this place!!
