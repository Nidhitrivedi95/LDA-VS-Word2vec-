I especially love the 10 foot glass window where you can observe the cooks hard at work! Try the leek dumplings (steamed)... they're very tasty -- and mix them with a dab of vinegar -- careful not to burn your mouth, as these dumplings and other otherwise harmless small foods are usually filled with hot succulent soup; don't let the soup escape as it's definitely the best part!
