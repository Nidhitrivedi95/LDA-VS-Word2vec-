The menu consist of affordable grubs and snacks - perfect for the students crowd at lunch time and after school. 

I was working nearby, and saw the crowd at lunch time.  I returned after the lunch rush and ordered the popcorn chicken and an avocado smoothie. 

Their Popcorn Chicken are perfectly spiced and satisfy the salt craving that begs to be pairing with one of the bubble tea or smoothie.  

Everything was made to order - probably because I didn't go during the lunch crowd.   

I really enjoyed this gem and will be back the next time I am in the neighborhood.
