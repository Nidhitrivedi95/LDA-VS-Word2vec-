7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA 4 1/2 is what I should give.

Oh so spicy, oh so good. The mushroom flaming pan is probably one of the tastiest vegetarian dishes I've had, period.

The flaming pan dishes are good, especially the fish (the mushrooms in that, oh so tasty)

Service can sometimes take some time, but there are days when they are quick too. I did a take out order yesterday and that probably took a total of 10 mins.

Tried duck tongue, probably won't try it again. Wasn't very fond of it.

Anyway, the place is a must go, especially if you enjoy mouth burning spicy food.
