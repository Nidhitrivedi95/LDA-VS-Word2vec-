TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ they give big ass portion, and the food is cheap. but i am chinesse my self. i think they gun po chicken and shrimps taste like shit. i guesse americans like any thing that is big in portion.

If you are fellow Chinese, don't go

For my white friend, i guess you guys love they " Chinese" food hence the 4.5 rating

 Just an other American "chinese" restaurant In a white area that don't deserve the 4.5 star review .
