rv9T1qGHbh9eXqFpKEPy_A My man and I are in the processing of moving so we decided to grab some to go food from Sesame Inn. We ordered about $60 worth of food (we love leftovers) - BAD MISTAKE! Waste of money. The Mongolian Beef had zero taste, didn't even taste like what Mongolian beef should taste like PLUS the meat was ORANGE! What the what??? The short ribs were so dry it tasted like beef jerky on a bone. House fried rice was ok but the lack of protein in it was next to nothing. Crab puffs were dried out, almost like they were sitting out for awhile. The white rice was filled half way, like they ran out and didn't want to make more. 

Do yourself a favor, locate another place to eat. I do not recommended this place. It was disgusting.
