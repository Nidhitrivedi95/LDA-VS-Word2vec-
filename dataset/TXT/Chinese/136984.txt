qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A used to be such a great restaurant. really gone downhill. had a server that took our drink order and then never came back to the table. finally ordered from someone else and got raw chicken skewers and a noodle dish with- NO LIE- more stalks of green onion/scallion than noodles, CILANTRO and TOMATOES in an Asian noodle dish. very weird food on a new "farm to table" menu. all this and when leaving, told the manager and he didnt care or apologize. no thanks.
