S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ I love Bahn Mi sandwiches and so I try them where ever I travel, this place has great French bread that they use for their sandwiches and also they are visually appealing in presentation. When you pull into this strip mall do yourself a favor and go to the very last entrance furthest from that way you will end up on the 2nd level the same as the restaurant otherwise you will be climbing the stairs to get your bahn mi.  The overall taste is of the #19 Charbroiled Pork Bahn Mi Was good but not awesome, I don't know what they are missing but I have not found a sandwich yet that touches Ba Le in Chicago......
