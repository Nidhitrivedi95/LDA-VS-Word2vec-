aY-lZvoTHAFl9k6dcfcAxQ If you're in search of an amazing Chinese restaurant, look no further! I was very pleased with my experience at Chen's Chinese Bistro. 

As soon as I walked in, I was warmly welcomed and seated. The ambiance of this restaurant was nice. My order was taken quickly and by a helpful waitress. While waiting for my food, I was kept busy by the many televisions and upbeat music. 

My order arrived in no time. The presentation of the food was neat, which was nice. I ordered the lunch combination of the black pepper chicken. With my order, I also received a crap puff, egg roll, and rice. The chicken was filled with amazing spices and was absolutely delicious. 

I highly recommend Chen's Chinese Bistro if you're looking for scrumptious Chinese food. Overall, this restaurant had amazing customer service and food. I will definitely be back for more!
