First off, this tells you this isn't one of those pure vegan places.  I was a bit concern it was going to be all vegetable menu.  At least they got some fake meat stuff for those still dipping their toes in the vegan lifestyle.

Second, this was pretty good.  Except for the texture, which does not not have the chunkiness of real meat, you can't really tell it's vegan.  My lunch companion agrees about this point.

Lots of stuff to try.  I'm not a pure vegan but would like to eat healthier.
