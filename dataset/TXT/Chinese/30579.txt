The service was wonderful and the lo mein is probably the best I've had around here. The Mongolian beef, however, was not very good. Didn't like it. It's seasoned with WAY too much black pepper and definitely not something I'll be ordering again. But that's to be expected of any menu. You're not going to like everything you order, but I will definitely be back for more.
