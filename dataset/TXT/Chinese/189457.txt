yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA This is one of my favorite places to get Chicken Pad Thai in town. It is delicious! I get low heat and they never botch it up. Parking can be a drag especially during the evening or weekends and it is located in China Town. This is one of the places I recommend to people when were out and wanting to have good food. Hat's off the the chef! Thanks :)
