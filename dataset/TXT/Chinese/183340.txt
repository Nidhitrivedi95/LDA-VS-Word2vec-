XOMZyF__Wnm0GHhb1uHw6w Well, was My family's favorite Chinese restaurant until one day I went there to pick up my To-Go order and what do I see in the back, The old Chinese man blowing his nose with a paper towel then spit in a bucket that was beside of a stove or something.. I was so Disgusted by that. HE DIDN'T EVEN WASH HIS HANDS, AFTER THAT! I personally do not eat Chinese food but my husband and his family does! They been eating there for Many years! Not No more! That was very Gross, & disgusting! This is how people get sick! Not washing your hands! Why in gods earth would you have a spit bucket in the kitchen, Thank god for the Open back and you can see everything, but none the less, We won't be going back! So I'm just warning everyone keep an eye out just in case! LOST SERVICE! Food was Good though but now I'm disgusted and can't go back! #DisgustingChino #Inshock #Never Again #NoStars
