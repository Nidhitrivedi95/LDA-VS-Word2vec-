GkY6UWWn0Fz2ehcuBp66pg Ate here again because we were bored of our old Dim Sum watering hole (Crown Prince). Ordered:

Har Gow (shrimp dumpling)
Mock Pork Belly
Fried Pumpkin
rice noodle roll wrapped yu tiao (fried dough)
BBQ Pork Bun
chiu chow fun kor (peanut vegetable dumpling)
Siu Mai
steamed veg
lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice
Chili dumplings (that were drenched in soy sauce and not chili...)
Tapioca Pudding

To be honest, was quite disappointed this time. The dumplings all fell apart and were sticky. BBQ Pork buns were still moist. Mock Pork belly was good, as was the fried pumpkin and the noodle roll. Everything else was not that great and came out pretty expensive compared to the cheaper Dim Sum options around the GTA.

Probably won't come back again for awhile if it's this inconsistent!
