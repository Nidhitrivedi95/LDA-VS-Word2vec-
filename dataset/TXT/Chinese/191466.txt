yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A Have heard about this place for years and finally went.  Made reservations, but still had to wait 30 minutes, but they did extend Happy Hour prices for us since we had to wait.  Food was good, service very friendly, but it was very noisy.  Once Happy Hour ended at 7pm, it quieted down.  They appear to be extremely busy during the happy hour.  Will definitely go again, but may just get take out.
