Fj0zObYm5McHcbtE6MSU0A Update: got some boba in the last few days (mainly the milk teas) and they tasted really good! My boyfriend and I love the almond  this place is great for deliver, I'm gonna order the egg foo young next time! Also this time (3rd or 4th?) they gave us a menu and this makes it easier to order next time. Our go to when we're lazy :) or especially craving boba lol





My boyfriend and I ordered a honey peach and honeydew slush, two spam musubis, and it was more than $10 we got free (2) egg rolls. The ordering was easy on the app and it took about 30 minutes to get here which wasn't bad. 

Honey peach slush just tasted like regular peach, didn't really taste any honey. My boyfriend liked it though

Honeydew slush tasted great, kind of wish we asked for boba. :(

I personally prefer the spam musubi to have equal spam and rice but this was okay, it had more rice than I liked but then again it's personal preference. 

Egg rolls had vegetables in them, crunchy, dipped them in the sweet sauce 

Will be ordering slushes w/ boba or the milk tea next time!
