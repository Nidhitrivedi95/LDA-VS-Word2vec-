NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place was more of a restaurant than a typical BBT joint. The interior is very nicely done.  They're really kid friendly and provide high chairs & children's dishware.  The food is pretty tasteful and they have nicely sized portions. My BBT wasn't the best I've had because my biggest pet peeve is having watered down BBT with melted ice!!!! ARGH!!  I'd rather have strong tea with half ice.  Other Ten Ren's (in the mall or Pacific Mall) make it nice & strong with lots of ice, just how I like it!

I guess overall I would say that it's pretty good. Good enough that I'd be coming back if we were in the area again.
