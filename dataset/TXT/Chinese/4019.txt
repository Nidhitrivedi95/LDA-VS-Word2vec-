_Ss4d4dYzehTmWJGpkqL7w I come here for the moderately priced Chinese food which for the most part hits the spot every single time. 

Coming here after the bar or a night going out is great because they close late everyday and I can't think of any better spot with an friendly ambience in the area such as this. 

Service is good to bad depending on time of day you go, this place can be really rammed. All in all I say it's a sweet spot and a must try when you're in the city and want some authentically genuine Chinese food. 

Seafood here is always on point for me, grab their deep fried soft shell crab, Steamed black bean oysters and or razor clams... Soooo good! Lobster is always a good bonus and of few places in the area their shark fin soup is quite delicious too.
