Y6Vw0FF8Qz9XD8fY4Z9Vfg Over rated and super hyped up for nothing.  I'm not saying it's not edible, BUT quality is  like poor fast food ... Just "asian style."  I ordered the chicken plate and Kimchee tofu.  Chicken had no flavor other than the old oil it was pan fried in. Tofu had sweet sauce that came with it but didn't resemble any kimchee flavor. The egg custard in the boba milk tea was the best thing there. The setup is like asian version of the "Friends show" cafe scene with TV and area with board games.  Too bad no one was in there to hang out.
