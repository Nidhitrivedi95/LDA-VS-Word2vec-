QI0PGXbGkIdInOOBeq6ieQ Was running errands on McKnight Road, and decided to give this place a go. Used to be Tokyo Sushi buffet. They've changed the format a bit - not centered on Sushi, though they do have a selection of I'd say about 10 different rolls. They still have the make-your-own stir fry area, and have a great selection of Chinese items. I was here on a Thursday about noon and it was PACKED. Everything seemed to be hot and the staff worked feverishly to keep the dishes replenished and the tables neat and old dishes cleared. It's not gourmet food, but there's plenty of variety and everything tastes decent. They could do a better job of labeling dishes, but that's a small quibble. The staff was pleasant, and the price can not be beat. I don't go to a place like this for American food, but they had an assortment of that too. I personally would rather they replaced boring American food, which I'm certain other places could do much better, with some other more exotic Asian dishes, but that's just me. I'm sure over time they'll figure what works and what doesn't.
