BY1_pf7FHUycHOwYEenDlQ First i want to say the food is really good, but unfortunately there is a hidden charge of an automatic 6% gratuity on every order. This is nowhere stated on the menu, nor were we ever verbally or otherwise informed of this charge ahead of time. For months my family would order food there, pick it up ourselves, and still leave a tip until one day we noticed the charge inconspicuously on the receipt. We have never ordered from there since because i feel it was just a shady thing to do. My disabled mother who doesnt have a lot of money to begin with would treat us there once in a blue moon too and it makes me angry to know they ripped her off with that sneaky charge. Wont ever go there again.
