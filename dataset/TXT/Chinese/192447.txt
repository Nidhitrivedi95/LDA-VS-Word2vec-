Z4CA7jEArUT_D-1ZM4Bh1Q I love this place! I've known about The Wok since about '06 when I was big into the local band scene. I had some friends work there so I'd pop in from Mesa to visit and to get the AWESOME kiwi-strawberry chicken and crab puffs. Those are probably the best things on the menu, hands down. The bar is super cool, but I've only been there once since they opened it. Jamie, the owner, is probably the raddest dude ever, which makes me love this place even more.
