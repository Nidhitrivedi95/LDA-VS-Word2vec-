HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ Ginbu is our quick, favorite sushi spot. Many times we get it for delivery (though, they only deliver in a 3 mile radius of the restaurant). Before I write this review, I want to preface it by saying that Ginbu isn't some fancy smancy sushi place (like Nikko, Enso, Pisces, Room 112, etc....though, all these places are delish). It is a smaller, low key, and cheaper sushi option. If you are looking for some crazy designed roll, this place may not be the spot for you. 

-Usually, my husband and I get one of the Chinese meals (didn't really care for the terriyaki but the Ginger is great!) and two sushi rolls. We love the spicy tuna roll.....simply tuna and spicy mayo. Very tasty. We also get one of their "specialty" rolls like Cherry Blossom, Crunchy, or Star. I absolutely love all of these rolls.
-We have eaten in the restaurant before, however, I have always felt like this place was our go-to for take out sushi/chinese. Thus, we normally get take-out/delivery. They are very quick with both take-out and delivery
-They have great lunch specials......it's like $8 for two rolls and a salad or soup.
