rT8DwZu7pvuWKRM1nwVuug Stopped in here for lunch today shortly after 11. Nobody else in the place (customers, I mean), so of course I was greeted and seated immediately.  The garlic chicken was tender and perfectly garlicky, the egg drop soup delicious, the sides more or less standard-issue (but still tasty). The servers kept my cup filled with soda and otherwise stayed out of the way.

Shortly after I started on lunch, a few other people came in and were greeted like family  - guess they were regulars. 

I don't get up this end of town much, but next time I'm there I'm definitely going to come back. to Bamboo China.
