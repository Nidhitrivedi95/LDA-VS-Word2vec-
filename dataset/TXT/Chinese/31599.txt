9rzfGwR--QUGn7BZJdm-Sw Great idea to have a confort food place open as at 3:30 am hunger struck. ggreasy delicious noodles( this morning) now i feel sick! etc!! service was slow unfortunately, they forgot to bring my friend's food out 3 people were eating while the 4th was waiting, needless to day when we asked the server for the food we realized it was just sitting there at the pass noone giving a damn to bring the dish! large portions though and well seasoned just drowning in oil! will i go back? probably not.. not unless i m in the area again desperate for food after a long night
