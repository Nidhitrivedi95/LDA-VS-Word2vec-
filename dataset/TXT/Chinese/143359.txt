rntKF4Dm9JIJoSNi5XqRsQ Dumpling paradise - easily my new favourite dumpling restaurant in Markham. I timed my visit to arrive mid-day since this Chinese strip mall gets very busy (note - there is underground parking). The restaurant looks like most in the area and the service was incredibly fast.

We enjoyed the following:

A) Shanghai noodles - incredibly good and not overly oily. Just a small complaint - I would prefer more mushrooms added to the noodles.

B) Onion Pancake - Comparable to other "Shanghai" style restaurants. Not a real standout.

C) Leek & Pork dumplings - so %$#@!&* good I can't explain it. GO TRY THESE NOW!

D) Mushroom & Pork dumplings - Not quite in the same league as the the Leek dumplings but still very good . The dumplings are all made fresh and you can tell with the first bite.

E) Pork & Chive dumplings.... AKA soup dumplings. I love to add red vinegar to every bite. 

We enjoyed a large meal (with leftovers) and the bill was just $30. Great food, fast service and low prices - the perfect trifecta. I will be back for sure.
