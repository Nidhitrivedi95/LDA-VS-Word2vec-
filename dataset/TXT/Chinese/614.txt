-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw I love how much you can customize your orders here!  Most of the drinks are available warm as well as cold--perfect for the chilly, rainy spring we've been having :(  I ordered the roasted milk green tea, as it came highly recommended both on Yelp and by the friend I came with, and it was a great choice for a warm drink.  It's also great that they let you customize your sugar levels--I often find bubble tea too sweet, so it was great to have a no sugar option.
