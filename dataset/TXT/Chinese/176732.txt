Chef Wong's is a new Chinese Restaurant that replaces Congee Wong in First Markham Place.

Interior has been totally renovated but still keeping the similar colour theme of green.

Menu is quite similar congee and noodle but with additional of more Cantonese stir fried dish which are good for dinner.

Cuttlefish Ball with Vermicelli in Fish Soup ($5.95), I am not even sure if it was fish soup as it lacked the fishy smell and taste. The vermicelli though cooked well with a good bite. Portion size though a little small as I can probably eat 2 bowls of those as snack. Loaded with MSG...I was so thirsty afterwards.

Service though was really friendly and courteous. 

No Afternoon tea special offers.

Just be really careful as the floor is really slippery. 

I might come back to try out other items. Not a bad option for a quick meal.
