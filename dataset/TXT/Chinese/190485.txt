YKImxc9VimLbDl2sQN1BBQ I have had food delivered to me several times from this place. I always get chicken and it's really tasty. I prefer spicy chicken and a brown sauce rather than white. They have great sticky white rice, great crab puffs(8 of them for like 5 bucks and filled with lots of cream cheese and REALLY big) good egg drop but, ask for crispy noodles. I am a great tipper and they arrive faster than anticipated EVERY time.
