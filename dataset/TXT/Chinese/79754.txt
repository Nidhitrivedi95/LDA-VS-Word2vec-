GL7tuUyuCPsz1L0L81MpUA Overcharged for our food, and not given a receipt by the delivery man. The bottom of the delivery bag was also covered in about two mm of liquid grease. It's a shame because the overcharging turned what would have been a reasonably priced meal into the exact same price point as everywhere else. Every container was absolutely covered in grease and it was just difficult to enjoy. The chow mein was also weirdly gelatinous in certain bites. 
Was told delivery would take an hour, and it did.
