JRRduMZI2aU3UCjfNEQURA The photo says it all. If you are a fan of dumplings, this is the place for you! Our meal came out hot and steaming, just watch out for the juice in the dumplings as it has a tendency to squirt out. In terms of the other reviews on here, I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised at hot clean this place was. As for the service, well, this is chinatown. It doesn't matter what city you are in, chinatown is chinatown. Dial down the expectations and you'll do just fine.
