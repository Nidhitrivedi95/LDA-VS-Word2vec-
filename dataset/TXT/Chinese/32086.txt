9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw We live very close by...very close...when we call for delivery seriously from the time we call till it is at our door.....maybe 15 minutes WOW!

This place is authentic Chinese to me, hands down. Their beef moo shu is EXACTLY like our fav San Fran Chinatown place.

The Orangie Chicken is very good, not fake tasting, real oranges :) that's how the guy repeats it on the phone, so cute :)

Our fav is veggie chow mein, no water chestnuts, and add fresh garlic :))))) sooo good!

Their Singapore Mai Fun is very good, their Vegan dumplings are awesome! Check their website and they have just about everything. 

Sometimes I get veggie fried brown rice with cashew nuts!!!! Sooo yummy!!!

We add and subtract certain ingredients and I was scared at first but they totally dig it!!! They don't seem put off and the food is ALWAYS flaming hot in heat and totally right!

Super sweet and even when dining in, they are quick and the place is very clean.

ORDER SOME NOW :)
