M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g I had the Hainan chicken lunch special for $10 and it was delicious. My only issue was how small the order was. I'd go back to try other dishes...the Hainan chicken alone gave me the sense they make some quality Chinese food.

I'd bump this to 5 stars if the lunch special portions were larger!
