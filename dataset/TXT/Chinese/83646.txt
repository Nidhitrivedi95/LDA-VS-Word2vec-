HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ We ordered Gin Bu for take-out. We split the sesame chicken with fried rice and chicken lo Mein with an added on egg roll. 

Positives- Really easy ordering, fast-service, the chicken was nice and crisp, the fried rice tasted great though it didn't have any veggies in it (which is a trend for Chinese in this area I've noticed). 

Negative- The lo mein was a little mushy and pretty bland. The majority of it was not eaten. It was also a tad pricier than some of the other Chinese-American take-out spots in the area.

I don't think I was impressed enough to go back though I just might have to take Suzanne S's advice and check out the crab rangoon.
