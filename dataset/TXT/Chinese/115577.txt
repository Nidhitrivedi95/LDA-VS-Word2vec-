N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ Came here after work for dinner and drinks on a Friday night. Make sure you make a reservation well in advance because this place seems to book up fast. The restaurant has a cozy and chill vibe, but let's just dive straight into the food because that's what you're interested to know more about, right?

We ordered the Jamaican Patty Double Down, Chinese "Pineapple" Bun Burger and the Jerk Chicken Chow Mein. The Jamacian Patty Double Down and the Jerk Chicken Chow Mein weren't that memorable to be honest, but the true star of the show was the Pineapple Bun Burger. Think of it as the Asian counterpart of the McGriddle at McDonald's, and I mean that in a good way. The pineapple bun adds a hint of sweetness as you sink your teeth into two super juicy patties. They even threw in some hickory sticks for some smoky flavour I'd assume, but I could've cared less if they were there or not because that pineapple bun and meat combo had my full attention... Onion rings on the side were great too.

Verdict? Get the burger. Also, got a tip from a friend that the fried cauliflower dish is really noteworthy. Will have to try that next time!
