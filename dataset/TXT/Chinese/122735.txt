OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw actually haven't been here for a few years, but friend wanted to have dim sum and this was a bit closer to us than going to spring mountain area

place was pretty crowded, we got here close to noon and had to park at end of the lot

wait wasn't too bad, as most Chinese places aren't, about 5 mins top

ordered the basics, sui mui, har gow, spareribs, beef noodle, CHICKEN FEET of course, some pork buns, Chinese broccoli, jellyfish, etc.

little slow on carts, I think there are more carts making rounds at Orchid Garden, but still got what we wanted

dim sum was good here, will have to make sure to come here more often
actually haven't been to any really bad ones out here....except the borderline visit to East Ocean awhile back (give them a pass since we went at 2pm)

pretty reasonable, 3 of us had our fill for 44 bucks
