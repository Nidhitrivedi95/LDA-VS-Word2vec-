NJyTPOukXuLK8vabKw7nvA First time here. The food is pretty good for a spicy restaurant. The service was very good except an older lady that was there. She looks like the owner. She speaks very mean and it's not good if you're not a topical northern people. I might come back but not a big fan still.
