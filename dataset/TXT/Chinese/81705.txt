H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag Food is delicious and priced very cheaply. We ordered the veggie and tofu soup, pad Thai, and the orange chicken combination plate. Was very impressed with the quality of the food. The service was wonderful as well. She noticed that my little sister liked broccoli and put extra broccoli on her plate for the entre. She was so friendly and funny. Will definitely be returning.
