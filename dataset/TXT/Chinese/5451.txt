0BeKOp6cWw4ArB04lnyBYw This place has been here for as long as I remember, serving cheap East Asian food (Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Fusion) in cheap and large quantities. I went here on more than one occasion, choosing to take-out rather than dine-in. The restaurant appears to cater to delivery and take-out clientele. The interiors are very basic and cheap, I certainly wouldn't want to have a sit-down dinner.

I have tried their Pad Thai (mediocre noodles with little vegetables but lots of colouring) and chicken stir fry (alright but not great). If you accidentally stumble upon this place you'll find the food just okay (won't get you sick) but for me the cheap price doesn't warrant eating mediocre fast food.
