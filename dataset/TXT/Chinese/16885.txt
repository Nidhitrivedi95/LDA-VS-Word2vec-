Actually too authentic for my taste.  We had the tomato beef and it was scary.  I think there was part of a heart in there.  We actually left almost the whole dish.  Very sad about that.  The hot and sour soup was good.  The chicken dumplings were good too.  The kung pao would have been awesome if they had it with white meat or less fatty... So 50/50 on this place.  Shame as I had high hopes.
