_blrEZQZ6et5QEUa-a2WLg After dining in about every chinese restaurant in town......this by far is the tastiest, consistant, best value in town.     The staff is usually friendly, the place is very clean.

I like the fact that they offer samples of their food if you need to.

I eat there at least once a month.
