ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ Visited Sun April 16 for Dim Sum party of 3
Arrived at 10:30am, they don't offer early bird discounts anymore. The place was already half-full. Service was great, it takes a little while to get the food and then it all comes at once. 

Pros
Highlights include fried shrimp roll and pan friend turnip cake. 
Prices:
Small $3.90
Medium $4.90
Large $5.90

Cons
A bit pricy compared to Chinatown, come for a special occasion and experience feeling like royalty.
Try and sit away from the door, the cold air would still come in even though there is a double door. 
Ordered a fish maw congee which was X-large and $12!
They also charge $1.60 per person for tea! Tea costs mere cents and honestly should even be a charge. Next dinners, try and get this removed and see if they will allow this.

Damage - $71 for 9 dishes before tip

Protip - Most items come with three pieces, so order accordingly.
