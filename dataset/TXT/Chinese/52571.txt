cjatara6LkXRu2BXD_jxlA Went to this place after hearing all the hype from other friends, and had some high expectations. I have to say this place is pretty good. the decor when you first arrive is very relaxing and casual. very comfortable design. Overall it is a nice location. This food although slightly pricier than normal chinese bbq joints, is pretty good. We went in a party of 10 people. so it took us a longer than usual wait. Unfortunately this place does not take any reservations. so its better to limit your part to probably 6 people or so. to make life easier. The food specialty is that it is a coal grill. so it goes back to the days when you have coal bbq and have that coal flavour in the food. This place is definitely pretty good. 

We had quite a bit of food, such as lamb skewers, oysters, beef skewers, as well as clam and lots of variety of veggies. the money wise it does add up. which is why it is better spent in this restaurant with more people. 

The service was pretty efficient and i liked the fact that they place the skewers on a heated plate so that it would stay warm when your still eating. 

Definitely a place people should try at least once, from the area. i would recommend to friends.
