The fried rice tasted like lukewarm oil, our eggroll's were definitely not the right color on the inside, and our container holding our chicken dish was only half full and incredibly bland. Essentially, the meal was only worth of a trash can, which is where it went. And I really, truly hate to waste food, so that is saying a lot.

We arrived at the restaurant to pick up our order exactly 3 minutes after I called it in, and it was already waiting for us on the counter. I should have known then what to expect!
