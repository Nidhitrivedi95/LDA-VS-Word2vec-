rQ6C54q1N2iq9iDKSA3QGA The restaurant is modern, clean, and well maintained. If there was a option for 2.5 stars, that would have been my rating.

We ordered 4 won-ton soups. Good flavor, but we all commented it should have been served hotter.

BBQ rib app was good, and big portion - thumbs up!  Served boneless...interesting...

Regarding the other reviews, (all 4 stars) my experience could have been judged as 4 stars for the overall look, cleanliness, etc. of the restaurant - but certainly not the food....or the attention to detail by the server on our visit.  Although the server was pleasant, menu knowledge was lacking, and I think he may have been a fill in employee.

      Entrees were just average. Lemon chicken seems to have had 2 previously frozen chicken breasts like you get in a package from Sams or Costco (that was the comment from my cousin...he really knows food). They were thin and flat looking..
      The sesame chicken, and orange beef portions were huge, the sauce was fine, but the meats were so thickly breaded that it really detracted  from the taste, and overall experience.
       
      I think we really gave this very nice looking restaurant every chance to "wow" us, but they fell short this time. Bill was $72 without tip - 3 adults, 1 child.  All meals were adult portions: 2 apps, 4 soups, 4 full meals, hot tea, one soda...no adult beverages. Therefore, pricing was average, not cheap as other reviews suggest.

      I think the overall experience was good, but the recipes (especially those that involve breaded and fried traditional dishes) need improvement.
