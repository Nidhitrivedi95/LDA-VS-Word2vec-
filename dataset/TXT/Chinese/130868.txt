pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA We were hungry and were about 90 minutes from when Carrot Top was starting. Found this on Yelp and were really hesitant cause of a Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine all mixed into one.

This place had very loud music playing in the background and couldn't hear each other talk. Service wasn't that great as we mostly sat around waiting for someone to take our order, fill our drinks, and check up on us, and bring the check.

Food was just so-so, I like my Japanese food to be delicate and have a perfect balance and only using the most minimal and basic ingredients. When I started tasting weird flavors that didn't go well together in my assortment of food, it ruined what I come to love about Japanese food.

Not sure I would like to come back, as I didn't like the combination of flavors, the loud music, and the bad service.
