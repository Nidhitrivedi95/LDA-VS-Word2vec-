Tavernakaya has some unique offerings and a great location but it's quite expensive. Also, while some have given Tavernakaya a thumbs up on the service, our experience wasn't necessarily anything to write home about. The servers were friendly but not necessarily very attentive. We were hoping for a quick meal before a show and it ended up lasting over an hour during the peak dinner rush.

The ramen was disappointing and not very flavorful and the yakitori (we had the hanger steak, pork belly, and mushrooms) were really underwhelming.

The maki rolls are something that rescues this menu! They have some really interesting rolls in the MC Hama and the TK Bay that were really delicious!
