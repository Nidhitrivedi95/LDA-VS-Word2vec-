L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA My go-to Chinese restaurant in Vegas. The service is always great and so is the food. Everything is reasonably priced and portioned. You won't have to worry about being hungry after your meal (especially since they do serve complementary white rice with your order)!

Although it might sound odd, the Cod Filet with Cream of Corn is to die for. It's such a simple concept but no other restaurant serve this eccentric dish! The cream of corn complements the crispiness of the cod. Another favorite dish would be their String Beans with XO Sauce. It is cooked to perfection and the sauce is not too overwhelming. 

The only con would be that parking is a hit or miss. Since it is located in such a busy plaza, you might have to resort to parking at the next plaza over. Sometimes you might get lucky and are able to find a spot in the same plaza, but good luck leaving the plaza with wild, crazy drivers trying to fight for your spot.
