gnqHyA6gY2-m9S-FKt6Xqw I wish I could import this restaurant to Hyde Park so I can have Cravings whenever I don't feel like cooking. Its the cheap but great Chinese eatery brought to life with low, low prices, order at counter, big, heaping portions, free tea in styrofoam cups, etc. Staff is really friendly and the dishes we tried were pretty good too. Try the chili chicken and the eggplant.
