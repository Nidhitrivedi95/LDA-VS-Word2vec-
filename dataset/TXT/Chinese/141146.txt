rcnjeruxT_-zThMekbMUbA Let's discuss. This is not a bad location to get Panda Express food. I have eaten here 2x. Once at dinner and once at lunch. Really. The food is good. It's turned over a lot because it's busy. The line goes fast. The only down side I can see is that it's a bit dirty. The garbage needs changed out more often, the tables need wiped down more. But since the line is so long, the staff is serving so there is not enough time. But that's it. The staff is nice. Food is good. They will get the cleanliness down. I hope. LOL! They will score better once they figure out how to handle the rush and keep up with the store.
