-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ The good news is that it's less popular than many of the restaurants at the Red Rock so it's easier to find a table.  The bad news is that the menu is pretty restricted, it's pricey, and the food is only OK

Somehow, Chinese restaurants always *smell* good and this place is no exception.  I sat down, ready-to-go after smelling its wonderful aromas waft over the casino.  

The potstickers were good, but only 4 per serving.  The signature pork fried rice was very good.  The wor won ton soup, however, was not so good -- pretty bland and at the suggestion of the waiter I got talked into adding egg noodles to it, which filled up the bowl too much and kind of fought with the soup.   The other problem is that the entrees are too huge for one person so unless you want to share you are going to end up with a lot of wasted food.  Not bad if you're a local and box it and send it home.  Less good if you're a hotel guest and need to put it to waste.

Finally, it's not cheap.  I think we spent something like $65 on lunch for two.
