-865Ps6xb3h1LP67JcQ3mA They consistently take more than hour to deliver and their food is definitely overrated. They also never give cutlery regardless of where you ordered from. The one time when I called them and complained about this, they sent cutlery but I was again disappointed as they gave only 2 forks and a spoon for 3 people. Very poor experience so far. Definitely not ordering from here again.
