A5Xd85djipsW546Bq6qIYA I was visiting a friend in Pittsburgh, and he told me that this is the best Chinese restaurant that Pittsburgh has to offer right now. So, I told him that we will go here for dinner. Well, I had the Volcano Chicken, which was strips of fried chicken saute´ed with wine sauce, and he had the Amazing Chicken, which was strips of fried chicken in a slightly spicy and tangy sauce. Well, there was nothing volcanic about the Volcano Chicken, and there was nothing amazing about the Amazing Chicken. I mean, this might be the best in Pittsburgh, but this isn't the best Chinese I've had. I wouldn't visit here again if I were to ever come back to Pittsburgh again, but honestly, this isn't a bad restaurant at all. It is pricey though. It really makes me wonder how bad other Chinese restaurants are like in this city if Sesame Garden is considered the best.
