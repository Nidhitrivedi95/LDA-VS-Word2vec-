SJVrnBT80VtUScxxIofB-A Smelled much better from outside than in.  Taste was so poor, I will not be returning! Steamed rice was so flavorless! The noodles were flat-flavored... The only semi-decent part was the BBQ pork... And it was definitely not good enough to make me want to return-- ever! Just avoid the foods 2 go!
