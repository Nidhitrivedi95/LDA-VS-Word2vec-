yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I had a couple of cocktails at the Golden Tiki (awesome spot, check them out!) and needed something in my system to offset the effects of rum. 
 Since my judgment was impaired, I threw calorie counting caution to the wind and charged ahead. 
 This is not haute cuisine so take this in context of what it is- it's an Asian eatery that's open late, they are prompt, semi accurate with food order and no, they are not shooting for any Michelin stars here. 
 Expect noise, bustle, several fish tanks sans ANY fish (overhead, lol) and nice greasy and fatty fare. 
 We ordered salt and pepper calimari to share and I got my fave, beef stew. My noodles were not ones I ordered, so there's the semi accuracy. Who cares, I ate them anyway. Chunks of beef were huge and deliciously fatty, broth was thick and savory and price was right. 
 Place was packed at midnight on Wednesday, good mix of couples, families with little kids (yup, at midnight), just friends hanging out. 
 I recommend this place if you are hungry, in the area, in the mood for noodles, and are familiar and comfortable with service model of a typical family owned Asian food joint. It's efficient, tasty and will fill you up at a good $. 
Don't come hiking across town just because they have 2000+ reviews :)
