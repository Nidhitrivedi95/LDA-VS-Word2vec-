6PdHFAW72p0sSrMCX0mmbw Very authentic northwestern Chinese cuisine. I've been craving some authentic Lanzhou Ramen for years! 
The broth in traditional beef noodle is on point, I can tell it's slowcooked beef stock, so aromatic and savoury. I don't know why people are saying it's bland....it's what the dish is supposed to taste like. 

The chili oil sauce smells amazing. Too bad they don't have white pepper available. 

Hand pulled noodles is what "Ramen" actually means, not those crappy spaghetti strings they sell at Kenzo. Plus the food is so cheap, what a gem. Thank God I'd never have to go to Kenzo again if i'm craving Ramen. I've been here with friends for more than 8 times in a month. 

lamb skewers are divine!  definitely give these a try.


Downside is the seatings are limited, meal time wait can get outta hand.... but then again, it's telling you the food is great!
