r1SfvWKoRQcoMoGy9ou-JA If one is looking for a quick meal that's healthy and decent, this place fits the bill perfectly.  Despite its fast pace, everything was very orderly, you don't get the "rush effect" where everyone is just relaxing and enjoying the decent food and service.  Extra kudos to the very slender robot like server who was attentive, courteous and fast on the feet/hands.  Very rare to find such good people as servers, brings a lot of energy to a place.  The Congee here is good, very solid.  The fried dough/noodle "fun" dishes are all good to go.  If the tea was better, it would complete the experience totally.  Bottom line, for under $10/head and be out in 20 mins or so, this is the place.  And yes, their bathroom is clean and the dining room is well maintained in a neutral tone, nothing tacky or weird w/ their design.  I have been coming here over the ten years while visiting Toronto, and the fact it still stands strong says a lot about the management and staff that make it happen here.  Congee Wong, rock on.
