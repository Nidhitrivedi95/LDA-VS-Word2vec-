SRYM6FaIF6LuXldcC1PY8w As a foodie, I usually prefer local places instead of chains. However, PF Changs does a really good job for a chain restaurant. This location is very well managed. Inside, it has modern Asian themed decor, and is a bit more upscale than other chain restaurants. It's fairly loud inside, especially later in the evening.

Our server was above average. Better than most chains, yet nothing that really said "wow."

The seared tuna was solid. Served traditional style with sesame seeds, ponzu sauce, and chives. The tuna was fresh and cooked properly.

I had a cup of egg drop soup, which was also a solid choice. It had a good amount of eggs in it, and wasn't overly salty like a lot of places.

For my entree, I had orange chicken with white rice. The chicken was moist and flavored appropriately. It was all white meat with no grit. The steamed rice was a good accompaniment. Portion sizes are generous here, making it very affordable.
