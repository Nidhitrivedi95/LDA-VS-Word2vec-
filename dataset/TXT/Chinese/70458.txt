f5iPbCVgv-2x00ZBoOwU7A As Christoph Waltz famously exclaimed in Inglorious Basterds: That's a bingo!

This place has it all: beautiful interior, amazing high-energy atmosphere, fantastic cocktails and drool-worthy Chinese food. AND it's got the coolness factor of being a "secret" bar hidden behind the curtain of a cute little convenience store.

We showed up around 9:30 on a Saturday and were told we'd have to wait about 45 minutes for a table, so we hit the bar. The place was jumping and the music (DJ in the corner) was on point. I ordered a perfectly balanced cocktail called Tropic Thunder, kind of like an elevated pina colada made with "coconut-soaked rum", pineapple, lime and the tropical pandan leaf. It was so good I ordered another.

Once seated, we opted for pork and shrimp wontons (served in sichuan chili oil, topped with scallions and sliced Thai chilis); spicy cucumber salad with crunchy sesame seeds; and Shanghai noodles with braised beef shank. All were dynamite!

As far as I'm concerned, this place is a winner. BINGO :)
