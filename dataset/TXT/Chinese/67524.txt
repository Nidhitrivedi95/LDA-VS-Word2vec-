The service was simply horrible. The restaurant was near empty with many servers mulling around doing everything but attending to customers.  After taking our order, our server disappeared for the rest of our dining experience.  Another couple a few tables away had the same issue trying to locate their server.

The food left much to be desired.  The seaweed vegetable soup was OK, although my companion found it to be bland.  The duck was dry and they forgot to serve any sauce with it.  The spicy garlic eggplant was acceptable, although not as spicy as one would expect.  The biggest disappointment was the vegetarian vegetable noodles (Hong Kong style).  The dish had way too much sauce, resulting in the noodles getting soggy.
