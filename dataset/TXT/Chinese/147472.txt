SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ Ling & Louie's acts like upscale Chinese (fusion?) but feels like a chain.  The menu is far more imaginative than the usual Orange Chicken - Mongolian Beef oriental eatery, and that really works on some dishes, such as the Heavenly Buddha.  But other dishes are not so satisfying.  Consider a special the day I was there - duck noodles.  First, there was far too little duck.  Second the duck there was tasted like reheated leftovers with a poor flavor and a dried out consistency.  Third, the sauce was one-dimensional (sweet) and overwhelming.  A complete miss except for the noodles themselves.  The chicken and rice soup, which you can get for $1.50 with a meal, is quite a good deal but very salty.

I expect this in a place where the chef is only a cook, but not where the menu is studded with interesting sounding options.

Ling & Louie's is pretending to be something finer.  If it weren't it would rate four stars as a neighborhood quick oriental diner.  But you should try it - you might feel differently.
