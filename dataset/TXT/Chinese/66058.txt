EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw Quick synopsis: Not as bad as people first thought when they opened, but not as good as dim sum restaurants in Chinatown (yet).

I can't even remember what this location was before it was Dim Sum Cafe, but I eagerly waited their opening. With the bad reviews coming out as soon as they opened, I decided to hold off coming here until they could find their groove. I finally paid a visit here last weekend. The restaurant is clean and spacious, but the table tops are a bit bare for a dim sum place. If you want soy sauce or any other of the condiments like hot sauce you normally see at a dim sum restaurant, you have to ask your server to bring you some. 

As far as the food, it satisfies the craving for dim sum, without having to drive all the way down to Chinatown from the westside. Their fried rice is a small serving for the price, but has good flavor and is enough for 2 people. My husband enjoyed their fried shrimp balls, which came with a generous serving of mayo. The filling for the stuffed eggplants was tasty, but the skin on the eggplant was tough and inedible. Baked BBQ pork buns weren't too flavorful and lacked filling. Pork suimai  had melt-in-your mouth meat, but the wrapping fell apart when trying to get it out of the container. Unfortunately they were out of the baked cream buns, so I'll at least be back to try those out. Service was very attentive and my water never went unfilled. Menu shows that charge for hot tea, but we actually were not charged for, which I appreciate. I think this place will continue to learn from it's mistakes and get better.
