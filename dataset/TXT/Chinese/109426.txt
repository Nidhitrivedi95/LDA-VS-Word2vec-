lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA Have been in here three times during the stay in palazzo. The food was ok in the first two times. However in the third time the experience was terrible. First, the service is very slow. There is lots of empty tables and several waiters were standing there doing nothing most of the time. The water was on after 20 min and food was on 20 min after. And the last dish was on after 1 HOUR! The service fee was 18% since it was a group of 7. However they didn't do anything, no water refiled at all! It is definitely below 10% service. Second the food quality was not good. Xiao long Bao has no soup in it. All the others were just mediocre. This is the most depressed experience in palazzo. If you come in a group and don't want to waste your time in waiting, definitely not come here.
