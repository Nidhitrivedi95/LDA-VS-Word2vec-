a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg We were walking around & got hungry for something quick but healthy.  I ordered a cobb salad... gross!  It was all the bitter inside of the lettuce with crap thrown on top.  Eggs looked like they were hard boiled & then scrambled in a bowl.  The service was friendly though the waiters do tend to have more friendly conversations with great & not do their job more often than not. Shouldnt take 10min to cash out my ticket.
