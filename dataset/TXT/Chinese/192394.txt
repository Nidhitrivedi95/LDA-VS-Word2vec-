z3hD4GX5gSJtuqNhN-o2cg I've been once, and it was definitely "as good as it gets!" just as I've been told. Ordered orange chicken for the chil'ren and a chili shrimp dish with extra spice for myself. I ventured out and ordered something new and it was great! 

The restaurant is very small on the inside, so I can't imagine what it is like when it's busy. When we went, we were the only ones that were placing an order to stay. The people working there were very friendly and most helpful!
