Hm2YntlJzqP4reNZRlkCEA Had a great experience at Woodstone Eatery for lunch. I tried the Portuguese chicken baked rice and the cod fritters with an iced HK style tea. Love the fusion of HK style cafe and Portuguese food, great selection of unique meals and snacks. Staff were very welcoming and were excellent with going over the menu. Will definitely be returning here and trying their other dishes!
