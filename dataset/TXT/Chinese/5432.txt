0aA5l11oXes0aS6mkN5lMQ I went with two of my co workers. I got the generals chicken. It was crispy. Burnt black crispy.  My co worker got the hunan beef which was 90% fat and cheap meat. The tea tasted like soap water. They brought the food out one order at time with minutes in between. When we got our check we asked to split it. They responded "no split check" and told us that there was a 20 dollar minimum if you use debit or credit cards.  Oh and the lunch didn't come with a egg roll, and no fortune cookies after the meal. Will never return.
