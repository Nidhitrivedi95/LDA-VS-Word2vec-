pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA This is really a 3.5 start review, Read on...The food is spectacular and atmosphere is funky cool. The Service was very attentive. Be warned. If you go in a group and they ask to "put together some courses for the table" you will pay and you will pay very very dearly. This seems to be their normal mode with big groups (6-10) as we have had them ask the last 3 times we have gone. The previous times we ended up with great food and probably spent a little more than we intended. 

This last trip was over the top. They kept the courses coming including the Hot Rock Kobe Beef. This was a super cool food experience and great tasting- but $160 PER PLATE? Frankly I'd refer to the wait staff as salespeople who did a darn good job giving my Platinum card a major workout. 

I have no idea how Yelp can rate this $$$ as it should be $$$$ with maybe an extra $ tossed on for good measure. 

Overall- awesome food, deceptive "meal suggestions" and crazy prices. Will I go back- yes-but I'll be selecting my own food next time thank you very much!
