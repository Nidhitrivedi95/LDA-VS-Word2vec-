fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw we go here because it's located down the road from our house.  we're glad that it is there too.  it's a small place, but clean.  we usually get lunch here as theyt have great lunch specials.  portions are pretty good size for the price.  food is tasty.  the only thing they need to work on is the egg rolls.  (however, it's been impossible to find good egg rolls in las vegas...anywhere here)  they are also very quick here.  during the lunch rush, i call in and immediately head over and my food is ready, always less than 15 min.  they are friendly and definitely a great place to check out.  we will continue to go back.
