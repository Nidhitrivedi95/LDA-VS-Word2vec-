DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA Sooooo...we decided to head to china town and look for some good Chinese food and thought we could not go wrong with SAM woo. First off this place is dirty as hell, the food was horrible, maybe because i have been spoiled by the best Chinese food the San Gabriel valley has to offer. I ordered the duck noodle soup and the soup did not taste good at all and to top it off it was really expensive. bill came out to 50$ for 4 people which is only about 30$ when your eatting in California. 

Don't waste your time here........... it is better to drive 4 hours back to California and eat at the SAM woo there.
