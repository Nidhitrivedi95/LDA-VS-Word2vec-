uFNM9ICvZN0TEbURIpiIDQ Excellent dumpling take-out spot. You can eat like a king for $15. This appears to be a family-run business and the grandmother figure can often be seen hand-rolling dumplings in the window. Freshly made and scrumptious. Friendly staff.

The downside: closed on Tuesdays (random and confusing day to be closed).
