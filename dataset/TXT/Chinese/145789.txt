s2gO3yd3yef3ws0OtgZ_TQ I'm fairly new to foot massages. My feet were sore so I decided to try it.  after getting it done here, I have discovered a new joy in life! 

I came in on a Tuesday afternoon without an appointment. They took me in right away. 

Their room is spacious and clean. They have cable TV, even foodnetwork! They bring you tea and oranges and snacks. Su was the lady that did my foot massage. She was good! She felt knots in my thigh and focused more on those areas. 

Overall I am happy with their services. 

$45 for 60 mins. 

They seem to have pretty long hours to accommodate most working people.
