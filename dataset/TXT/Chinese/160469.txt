U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q My sister and I LOVED this place! We came back twice during our 5 day stay. A friend that was recently in Vegas posted about it, so we tried it out. Yes the giant tanks of goldfish are amazing. I took *so* many photographs. Beautiful.
We ordered the red bean puffs and loved them. The spring rolls were also good. Both times I ordered the crispy tofu and loved it. My sister ordered scallops both times, too. :)
Service was a bit slow during our 2nd visit, but as soon as we alerted a server that we wanted the check, they brought it over quickly.
