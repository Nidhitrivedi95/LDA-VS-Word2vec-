fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA I am shocked and disappointed in the quality of the food here, during our visit for dinner. I've been to DTF in taipei (original one) and the two locations in Los Angeles, this is the worse one I've tasted.  The signature Xio Long bao is just average,  not the great, but the other items that are staple signature dishes to order at other DTF locations : shrimp fried rice, vermicelli soup with bean curd, soup noodle with spicy and peanut sauce,  all tasted below par compared with the other locations, plus their pricing seem to be inflated( $13 for a small plate of shrimp fried rice and it's soggy.....)vermicelli is supposed to have flavorful semi-CLEAR colorless broth, instead it's tasteless and have a dark brown tint(looks like the broth was made with soy sauce and water, and actually taste similar to that), soup noodle with peanut sauce has blend taste and soggy texture at same time, without some of the typical important ingredients such as minced green onion and garlic as garnishes on the top... I have been to this location before years ago and it didn't seem this bad....tremendously dissapointed and is far below any other DTF locations while charges more then other locations... will not recommend.
