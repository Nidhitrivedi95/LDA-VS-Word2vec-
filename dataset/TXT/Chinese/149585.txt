sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg Tot's is awesome! I actually like it more than Pei Wei (which I like a lot). I just don't go as often since I don't live in Tempe anymore. But anyways, everything I have had here has been awesome. The sesame chicken, the orange chicken are amazing. I seriously don't think they have a bad item on the menu. Young is the guy that runs the place and is super nice. It is always super packed at night time. This is one of the best kept secrets in Tempe as far as I'm concerned. I hope they open up another store someday.
