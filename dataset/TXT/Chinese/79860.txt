gnkyosoOepBUqog7iDdggQ Usually I would come here for their cheap afternoon tea combo which is the popcorn chicken plus a large panda milk tea for $5.99 i believe (don't quite remember the actual price). Although food is mediocre, The portion of the popcorn chicken is not bad. The biggest problem though is the service. I understand that it's a Chinese place, so we shouldn't expect too much for their service, but it always gives me a headache trying to flag down someone. That happened twice so far... If not, I would have gave them a 4 stars.
