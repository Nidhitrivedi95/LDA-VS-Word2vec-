For what it is, the food you recieve is in huge portions so you get your money's worth.  It tastes good and its filling as well.

I just don't understand how everytime I walk in, there's a reserved sign placed on the table in the far corner with all the windows.  NEVER anyone sitting there, but it's always reserved. Really odd.  The staff are questionable and practically ask you to give them a tip.
