zPcF4fI18gSp42G17oHmmg So first time here.. and the food was old and dry! Not even hot! Crab legs horrible just sitting in warm water no flavor! The sushi guy doesn't even wear hair net.. the cool guy has no cloves! Meat very dry! I had a sushi and it was so old mold flavor!!!! Never again I'm shocked this place isn't shut down yet!
