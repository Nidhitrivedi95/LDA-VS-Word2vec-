cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw I would give it 0 star if I could. The food is very mediocre but way overpriced. The most outrageous thing is that they serve you small pickled vegetable buns purchased as frozen food from the supermarket and they just heated them to lukewarm. How could you tell?  By the label on the paper underneath the bun. It is a complete rip-off.
