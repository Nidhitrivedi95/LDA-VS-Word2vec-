VGxJbglGlx-a7Gdc55Q6jQ I have been to Katana quite a few times. I really like the food and the service has always been good. Every time I've been there we sat at the hibachi table, but I like that they offer other asian varieties of food so everyone can find something they like. My new favorite thing about this place is that they deliver to my house. This is my go to place for ordering Chinese food. You can even get the hibachi menu  items delivered. Delivery is timely and the food is always good. I will continue to get delivery from Katana.  The online ordering is also a plus!
