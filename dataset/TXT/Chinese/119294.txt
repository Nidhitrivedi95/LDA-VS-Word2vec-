nt-bokSaqLeYc8APwrq6Pw So far, my favourite Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh. If they would only deliver their food to me, I would eat from here about 3 times a week! I've only eaten in once and although as Cheryl said it's nothing edgey or high fashion, the service was brilliant and the food was, as always, FANTASTIC! I've lost count of how many times I've gotten takeout from here but it's been on point every.single.time. I've had a variety of dishes from fish & tofu in a claypot to the more mainstream sweet & sour chicken/pork and have not found fault with any of the dishes.

Well worth a visit.
