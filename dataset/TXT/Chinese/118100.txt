NKHvmp19c6wrm0dZXcLtmQ Would not recommend this place for bubble tea. The bubble tea here is overpriced for the size. The drinks are not cold. They serve their drinks lukewarm or cool so it's not refreshing at all. It's so bad that even their own employees don't order drinks from here. 

Desserts are alright though. 

Service here is not that great either. They ran out of one of the things we ordered on the menu and just took it off our bill but didn't tell us. We sat there waiting for so long and we were informed after we asked them that they ran out...
