BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA Mothers dumplings is a tradition for me and my family around Christmas time. They have great dumplings both meaty and vegetarian that are handmade in store while you watch. They are quick, affordable but mostly tasty. The chive, pork, and shrimp dumplings are great but the beef and green onion is even better! But one of their best dishes isn't even a dumpling... Its the sauteed eggplant stir fry. A definite must try. We also had some noodle soup and plain congee (add your favorite seasoning!). There is also a salad that is somewhat Korean in flavor and design: smashed cucumber salad. It provides a fresh bite to clean your palate. 

We had three kids with us and one of their highchairs was not acceptable. Loose legs that felt like they might fall out at any moment and a broken strap that is very necessary for safety didn't make us feel very comfortable but they are kid friendly.

The food is relatively quick because its usually steamed. The back area past the noodle making stations/employees is quiet but also slightly drafty from the back door and can be occasionally ignored or forgotten.

For 5 adults and 3 young kids it was $76+tax&tip.
