i55cm4i5C7fSCVONIQ8DRg We were passing by the area on a road trip and was craving Chinese food and found New Wong's via yelp.  I wasn't expecting much being from Toronto where we have a ton of great authentic Chinese food.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I've included a shot of our spread.  The food was very flavorful, not too greasy and salty and I didn't feel super thirsty after from too much MSG.  

The fried flounder is my favorite!  I've never even had it in Toronto.  The waitress had suggested it.  The service was also fantastic which is usually rare in a Chinese restaurant.  The waitress was really friendly and smily.  Will definitely stop by again if we are passing through.
