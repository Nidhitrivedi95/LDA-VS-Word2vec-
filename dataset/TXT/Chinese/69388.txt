eZQbDYQTZk0_cBroVxnPWg A-OK!!

I've enjoyed take-out from Siu Wok four times now and haven't been disappointed. Very inexpensive for the amount of food you get. I have created 3 meals from one lunch special. The Pepper Steak was really yummy and perfectly spicy. The Kung Pao Steak was quite good as well as the Szechuan Chicken. (I'm noticing a spicy trend here). 

The lunch specials are served with fried rice, an egg roll and (2) crab puffs. The only thing that annoyed me was the "crab" puffs. OK,  not only is there NO crab in them, there isn't even a hint of "Krab" in them.... you dig?? Call them what they are...... cream cheese puffs, thank you. I'll eat them anyway..... no need for deception. 

Yesterday I had the Teriyaki Chicken for lunch. I questioned it immediately because it looked *interesting*. I actually joked to my lunch date about what I was eating and that I didn't believe it was chicken at all but in fact the victim of some "ghetto backyard, dove massacre"... alas I was wrong. I'm just not used to eating only dark meat chicken and let me tell you, it was fucking delicious. 

In closing:
good cheap eats
cream cheese treats
bomb dark meats

now if only they had crushed ice.....
