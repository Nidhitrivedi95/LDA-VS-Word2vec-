U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ I have been looking for a place here in Las Vegas that serves an AUTHENTIC pork belly bao (bun) with all of the fixings on top. There are many "asian fusion" type restaurants in town that have them on their menu as appetizers (seems to be the new fad) but they are not authentic Taiwanese. Another place that I found that is close in authenticity is Fat Choy inside of the Eureka casino... Just a little far for me. But I finally found the place!! And it's called Taiwan deli! Who would've thought? 

The pork belly is braised perfectly with soy sauce and topped with pickled radishes, mustard greens, cilantro, and crushed peanuts and drizzled with hoisin sauce. SO GOOD. The bao is soft and fluffy; just the way it should be. 

I also tried the salt and pepper popcorn chicken and it is legit. Fried with basil and tossed with the Chinese 5 spice seasonings. Must try!

I will definitely be coming back to try the stinky tofu and chili oil wontons!
