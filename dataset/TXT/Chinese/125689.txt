Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w They get one star bc the waitress was good... the food ... cold and bland!! Or & way greasy!!

Food was cold, they do NOT bring fresh food out like they should. The sushi, or whatever that was, was gross.... I never seen so much sushi with cream cheese, bitter cream cheese.
What I could manage to swallow was the Hot and sour soup, which was very tart, bad tart. The lo mein was beyond greasy.... don't get me wrong I LOVE Chinese buffet restaurants but this place is the WORST I been to and the most expensive. 
Same your money... the local Harris Teeter has a better Chinese buffet & it's cheaper.
