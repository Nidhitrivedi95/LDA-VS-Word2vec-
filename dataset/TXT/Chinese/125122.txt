oWEFIvvt_kJCuk2V268XeQ For me, this is the closest place for dim sum geographically. Sunday wait times seem longer when you're hungry, so get here early. 

Carts break out of the kitchen like bulls at the Stampede, so don't lolly-gag when these trolleys pass your table, b/c he who hesitates loses radish cakes. Steamed pork buns are nice and fluffy rather than your standard rubbery pork pucks. Taro nests and squid tentacles are excellent.  Seating is well spaced in some areas and toiyt loike a toiyger in others: the Summit's (and most other Chinese places) only downfall for me. Tea is replaced every so often and is as hot as 10,000 white-hot suns. Less than $10 a person. 

Magiiiiic.
