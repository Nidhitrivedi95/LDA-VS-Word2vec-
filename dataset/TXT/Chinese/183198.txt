XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw I just got back from another delicious meal at Dumpling King, and can not fathom how this restaurant got some of the negative reviews that it did.  I live in New York, so I am used to good quality Chinese food.  My son's friend recommended Dumpling King so we decided to give it a try. I am always leery about trying new places, but am s glad I did. From start to finish the food has been delicious. Fresh, tasty, hot from the kitchen and reasonably priced. I couldn't ask for more. The owner, Merry, is lovely and speaks English beautifully, so if you have any questions she will be more than happy to answer them. Some of the dishes we enjoyed were the potstickers, beef dumplings, brisket, sweet and sour beef, and fried noodles with chicken. The bill for all that food for four people was $60 with lots to bring home! The decor is festive and bright. If you are expecting Panda Express, then you are in the wrong place. If you are looking for a good, high-quality meal then go to Dumpling King. You won't be sorry.
