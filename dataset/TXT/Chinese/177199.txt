wwoOWTunPh4QnaKW11Zl7A I saw a deal for live lobster for 11.99 per lb. Picked 2 big one. Was gonna weigh it but the guy behind the bar said to go to the cashier. I went to the cashier, and she said I should have weighed it at the live seafood bar. Then she called for help! A man came and took my lobsters to weigh. The bill came as 36.87 for 2 live lobsters. The problem was on the sticker, it said 30.84 per kg. My lobster weighed 1.18kg. So from the deal of 11.99 per lb, my bill should be maximum 27-28 dollars. It was obvious that they took advantage of me not watching them weigh and put the right price on my lobster. It was a big disappointment.

I emailed T&T customer service about the problem. Not because I wanted the $10 back, just because I think the head office should know about it. And I must say they have very good customer service. I got the refund of $11.36 back.
