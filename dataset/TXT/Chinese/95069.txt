jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg We went for Christmas eve dinner ( as Jews often do!) looking for a straight forward chinese food meal. Ordered standard fare, pot stickers, wonton soup, egg foo young, mongolian beef... the worst, brown gravy, cornstarchy, old oil tasting, salty, gooy , single note tasting chinese food I have had in years... if this wins all these banners for the best in las  vegas, they must have fed the LVRJ for free for years.
Yuck!
