xuD16x4Jlc__QMtl-AY6Xg This is my regular dim sum place.  They recently got a new owner and renovated a little.  They are current having a promo for dim sum S/M/L all cost $2.70.  They also changed the menu a bit but all the basic dim sum items are still there. 

The food quality is always good when you go and the service is fast and attentive.
