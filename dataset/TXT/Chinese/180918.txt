X9ftU-exKhTMOjtr3B52rw I had to update my review from my original 3 stars down to one (it would have been zero if that was a possibility). The original post is seen below the break in page.

I was never enamored by this location, but I always want to give the chef a couple of chances, as they could of had a bad day at the racetrack the day before. This time was by far the worse experience ever! I shall never return to this location, and will tolerate the extra distance, and go the extra mile to the Hwy. 7 location.

I followed up as usual after my wonton noodles with a plain bowl of noodles. The noodles lack life. It was made in water that just wasn't madly boiling. Rather than complain, I sucked it up. I proceeded to order a second bowl of plain noodles, and this was an absolute disaster. I couldn't withhold my tongue any longer, and complained to the server. I suggested that the water to cook the noodles was not boiling madly, and the noodles had a doughy texture - not the "crunch" that it should have. 

What happened next threw me off - completely! They recooked the noodles! They recooked the noodles I spat out into the bowl in the same hot water they use for the other guests! OMG - really! I couldn't tolerate this longer, and really made a big stink; they gave me another bowl of noodles, it wasn't much better, but wasn't horrible.

I shall never return to this location for the lack of hygiene and their poor quality.

The Hwy 7 location has better food quality. The quality comes down to the technique of the chef as the materials used are identical. The location is newer, and and looks more modern. Unfortunately I'm swayed by food quality, its preparation and final outcome. Decor and other exterior fluff is for others who prefer atmosphere over food.

Final thoughts. No cigar compared to how the noodles have been mastered in Hong Kong.
