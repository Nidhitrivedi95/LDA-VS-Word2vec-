jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg So much has changed since I first discovered Mini Pot. Qi (the owner) has added a lot more variety to the menu. There are a few additional pots and a ton of new sides. 

There's a selection of grilled skewers--all of which are excellent! The dry spice rub has a cumin base and is incredibly flavorful. Although spice level is objective, I think people of all heat tolerances can handle it. The chicken wings and little sausages are my favorites. But if you're craving something meatier, they've got lamb and beef skewers too.

The new jelly noodle dish is mouth-wateringly addictive... and its cold! It's a pretty hefty serving, so I suggest sharing it with another person or simply ordering it alone with some skewers. It's a wet noodle dish with a somewhat soupy sauce. It's refreshing, spicy, and has a hint of that nutty Chinese sesame paste. Fore-warning: The heat from the chili pepper will creep on you!

A few new mini pots have hit the menu! Kimchi, I believe, is the most recent. I haven't tried it yet but I'm sure it will be a hit. I might be Korean but my frequent orders will probably remain the lamb pot, the tendon & radish pot w/ a side of tofu skins and rice ovalettes. The menu is still finding its footing. So what does or does not come with the pot varies visit to visit. For now, mini pots are sold on their own where noodles and/or rice are sold separately. 

Don't forget to pick up your frequent diner stamp card. Buy 10 get 1 free. I've filled up 2 cards already and working on my third.
