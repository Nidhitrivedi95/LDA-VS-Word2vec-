ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ I have been a big fan since I came to Canada - I was pretty young. Their iced lemon tea and iced milk tea is to die for
 Honestly can't find another place that has great service and great food for its price.

I always get the omelette with ham in the morning with vermicelli with pork. During tea time, I get the steak and fries. Their steak is made exactly medium rare. My fave!

I can't rave about this place enough but its not really your traditional HK style restaurant. Try it and you'll love.
