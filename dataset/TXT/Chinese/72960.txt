fHkiH52AATeRa8Fi2yStpQ This workers are rude they have charged me more than I was suppose to be charged I paid over 23 dollars for chicken broccoli and rice it wasn't even  enough to feed two  people!!! They  get upset when you don't spend a certain amount of money in there. Every time I get a to go order it's missing and entree. Overpriced rude and the food isn't very good. Make sure to check to go orders they will rip u off.
