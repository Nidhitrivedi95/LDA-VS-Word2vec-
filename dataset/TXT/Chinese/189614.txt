yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA oh man... look around you. look to the right and to the left.  you will notice their blood shot eyes and lackluster emotions on their faces.  YES, everyone is hungover and tired.  but everyone seems to come to this place for pho to cure their head ache.

i've been multiple times after a night of clubbing and it usually hits the spot.
before entering, you will usually have to put your name down on a wait list,  but don't fret, the wait time is very short.

The portions are big and the broth is tasty.  I like how they have the condiments on the table.  if you are one of the types of people who need white onion with your pho, make sure you specify white onion.  my friend got green onions before....lol... wtf.

If you want fast food, get PHO.  i once ordered the pad thai, and when everyone got their phos and was almost done with it, i just got my entree.... so i don't know what the fuck i was thinking ordering something that wasn't pho at this place.  but real talk, the pad thai was delicious.  i might get it again when i come back to vegas.  haha.

come here if you want fast service and cheap good drunk food. and they are open 24/7!!!!!
