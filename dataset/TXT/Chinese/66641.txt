EhTYPpGzs2MfDspt1nU7Hg Ok not sure who is reviewing this restaurant to give it such high scores?!?

The bubble tea recommendation was bang on, 5 out of 5. Very good for what you pay. Definitely will come back for this. 

The hakka chow mein with chicken and shrimp was $10, and half the size of what I get from Tangra Villa at under $8. I'll take the additional time to drive by Markville instead. Kids said it tasted like spaghetti, and we couldn't argue with them on that. 

Kung Pao chicken was not crispy at all, so not sure the appeal of this dish. Seems just like chicken breast cut up and mixed with a gravy.

Cashew chicken was same thing, chicken breast mixed with cashew and some veggies.

And the portions were tiny for $10. You get twice the size from a food court (Peach Tree Plaza or First Markham Place) for only $6.

Glad I tried it out, will only be back for the drinks.
