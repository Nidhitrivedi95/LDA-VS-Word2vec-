I7eqTdTmRTWYwF9HNZAHxw If you're particular about freshness of flavor you MUST do yourself a favor &  go. The sugarcane chicken is always a must start not only fresh the yummy chicken on sugar cane you grill at the table but the plated loaded with fresh mint, cilantro, lettuce & other goodies that comes accompanies it. For less adventurous eaters their basis Pad Thai is as equally fresh but I stress to try something you never have. You will not be disappointed.
My dad is not an Asian eater but his Salmon in Basil Ginger sauce was sublime & now he'll go at the drop of a hat.
Another fabulous fact...amazing cocktails & happy hour price of $5.00 for a normally $9.00 drink ...wonderful!!!!!
