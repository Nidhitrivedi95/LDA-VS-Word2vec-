OygJyqypKFZJIZ6r9dML7w I was gonna give this place a 2 star but my parents were so disappointed in the quality and selection of food that they told me to give a 1 star review. So this will be my very first 1 star review. The reason for such poor review has to do with the overall experience. First off, on a Saturday afternoon you would expect almost all dim sum restaurants to be packed to the rim but not this place. It was only about 80% full. Secondly, the food was just terrible. Nothing came out fresh. Everything we got was obviously old and had been sitting for a while (Push cart dim sum). Thirdly, the portions were small and selection was limited. Fourth, the service was so slow that our finished plates were piling up in the corner of our table. The only thing which gave this place its 1 star is the price. With four people we only had to pay $30 after tax but I'm sure if the food was better we would have ordered more.

This one is on the never to return list
