z9lOfnUorcbWR_xS0DSeHw I've been resisting going to this place for the past several years. The location was previously an 'all you can eat' place called Yummy Buffet.  It's illogical why I resisted.

I went here recently and ordered the cold chicken, eggplant dish, and fried chicken.  Everything tasted amazing, but in particular, I want to say, be open to the cold chicken dish - the briny sauce it was smothered in was a heavenly combination of sweet, tangy, and salty.

I'm definitely coming back here again.  Three dishes came out to $30 or so for two people.  You could also go cheaper and order the lunch bentos.
