nBwOIq5KI-zmxp061dTmgw Really great place would recommend to anyone. Only thing that was negative was the new asian lady taking orders. I don't know if she doesn't speak English but she has a hard time explaining the menu items. She also lacks customer service skills. Too bad I wanted to try new items.
