1PMwRG0uWGxk2hIVEQj62A +.5 for service

I got the better end in terms of service compared to some of the reviews I see here. It was relatively easy to wave down a waiter or waitress if we needed something (say, water/tea refill). We also got the bill relatively fast after we gave them the order form.

In terms of the food, it was overall good, but there were a few misses.

Positives:
- Siu mai
- Dough rice noodle roll
- Veggie dumplings
- Omasum with tofu
- Stir fried mushroom and fungus

Negatives:
- Curry cuttlefish (way too mushy, it just melted in my mouth)
- Overall limited selection, but they do good with what they have

Total bill came to just over $50 for 8 dishes and a party of 3. Slightly overpriced for what I received, but if my friends and/or relatives suggest coming back here I wouldn't mind.
