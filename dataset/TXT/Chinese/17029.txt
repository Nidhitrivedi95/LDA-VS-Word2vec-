4JkGjRRc3XucG9U8XwthGg it sucks because I really want to give this place a five star.  They are clean and friendly and that is a major plus.  But the food has been OK I am writing this review after three deliveries.

1. Order
Wontons:  Awesome!
Cheese Ragoons:  Pretty good.
Egg Rolls:  Not a fan and one more try.
Cashew Chicken: Great!
Sesame Chicken:  Not good when you took a bite you could really taste the flour and you could feel the flour texture in your mouth.  Wont get it again 
Rice:  Great.

2.  Order Family Deal B:
Egg Drop Soup:  Wife thought it was good... I am not much of a fan of any kind so I reserve judgement.
Egg Rolls:  2 nd time no good
Wontons:  Awesome
Ragoons:  Great
Cashew Chicken:  Great
Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Awesome! I like the fact they keep the sauce off till after delivery.
Rice:  Good but we were short an order.

3.  Three Entree Order
Wontons:  Free and delicious 
Chow Main:  Seemed a lot like lomein and never thought I would say this but they for sure do not use MSG and you can tell in this dish.  It was just missing a little bit of that butterness that you get with MSG.  But it was OK had worse had better probably wont order again.
Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Awesome our number one dish
Orange Chicken:  Same exact issue we had with the Sesame chicken.  Could really taste that flour and felt the flour texture.

We are OK with experimenting with more the prices are not bad and so it is OK at least one dish is always good to eat.
