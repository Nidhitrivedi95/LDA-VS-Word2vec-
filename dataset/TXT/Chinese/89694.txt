i9B6_kxVwunw23TCI_BEtw I think the reviews portray this restaurant accurately.  While it's always packed during the weekends and weekdays sometimes, their price point is high for the quality of food.  However, that's probably more due to a lack of dim sum competition in the area.  When I used to work in this area, our team would always go here for a monthly lunch (and while fun, it's weird being the only Asian guy and trying to translate everything!!!).

Pros: 
-for a business lunch, you can order what you want and aren't left guessing what to eat. -Egg tarts, taro spiky triangle things, deep fried shrimp dumplings and any fried food comes out piping hot so you know it's freshly made.  
-Siu Mai is very good
-Any of the BBQ pork or chicken buns have good filling.  

Cons:
-Pricey. I don't find it superb quality (like Casa Victoria) or quantity.  
-Sometimes it takes forever to get the bill.  

Verdict: Great introductory dim sum meal for those new to it, good if you are in the area (within 10 minute drive), but you have much more options if you drive an extra 15-20 minutes east or north.
