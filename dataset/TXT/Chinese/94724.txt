JfbbFcJgj8Zfn9SjGDnBgQ Roasted pork (rib section) - just as good as last time. Meat was tender. Skin was crispy. Definitely better than a lot of places I've had it. If you ask them to, they'll let you choose where (within reason) you want your meat cut from. If they have a whole pig, I doubt the'd let you hack a chunk out of the top if they usually start from the bottom, but I don't actually know this for a fact.

Sweet and sour pork ($4.00) - not made to order. More like made so that if people want to buy sweet and sour pork made from that day's pork odds and ends, they're welcome to. At $4.00, I really can't complain. I've had much worse sweet and sour pork at much higher prices. I've also found that sweet and sour pork from Chinese BBQ stalls have a considerably higher meat to filler veggie ratio, probably because they don't bother to obtain veggies to put into their sweet and sour pork. This one had a few tiny scraps of onions. All in all, good portion, decent sweet and sour pork, and quite cheap.

Nice touch. I wanted the roasted pork bones. There are plenty of Chinese BBQ places that'll charge, sometimes through the nose, for these bones. I asked, and the lady manning the counter gave me a good sized pork back bone (I think it's a back bone), for free! I wish there was more (even if I had to purchase it), but she told me they were out. Oh well. Another day!
