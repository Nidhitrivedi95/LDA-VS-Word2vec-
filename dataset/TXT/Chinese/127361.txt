pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og This is my 5th visit  to this spot. Other visits did  not necessarily disappoint....  however, tonight's dinner/ happy hour was lack luster, to the point that I question coming back. Service was slower than usual, and drinks took FOREVER to arrive. Excuse, upon excuse later..... our drinks arrive and orders are taken. 3 sushi rolls, 1 order calamari, and a kid's  lo mein. Lo mein was flavor less, under seasoned(daughter  barely touched it, she normally finishes  her plate). Sushi was not as delicious  as we remember.  Calamari NEVER CAME.  I'm so bummed as this place is literally a minute from my house. To  make matters worse, second round of drinks took easily 12-15 mins to arrive..... didn't even have anything to numb the pain from this sad, sad experience. I don't know if I'll return, this visit  sure let me down. I guess I'll have to find a new sushi spot nearby.
