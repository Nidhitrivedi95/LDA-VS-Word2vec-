Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ From my visits to Hong Kong and various China towns, i have come to realize a good Dim Sum place  has several things in common. Very poor customer service and high noise level. Orchids Gardens have both. They will come around and force their food on you. Every cart claims to  have the best food. And every cart does have great Sum Sum. Some of my favorites are the crispy pork balls and the stuffed eggplant. 
Keep in mind their portions are on the small side.
