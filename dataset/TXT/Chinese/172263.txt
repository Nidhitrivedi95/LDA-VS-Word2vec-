It varies from location to location, but overall it's fast and efficient. 

Ambiance:
It's cleaner than your typical HK Cafe, and it's usually packed. The cafe is where you go and grab a quick bite with your friends or family. It's usually pretty loud inside.

Food:
Their food is more to the expensive side compared to other HK cafes, but the quality and portion is there. The only thing I dislike is that a lot of the dishes doesn't come with a drink, where this is standard practice in most HK cafes. The extra $ they charge you for a cold drink is also more than usual.
