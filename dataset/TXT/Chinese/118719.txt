NnV0LkIs5YjUSPzAP1nWXQ We went to this mall and noticed that there is a new Thai restaurant that just opened. Just wanna support local Thai business, because I travel around the States.

After I talked to a nice server asking for food suggestions, we got three dishes that is really authentic Thai flavor. They are crab fried rice, rad nah noodle, and bean thread salad (Yum Woonsen).  They are all huge portion that three of us could not finish them.

We definitely come back here if we have to visit Las Vegas again.
