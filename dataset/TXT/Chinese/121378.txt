o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg We stopped in for lunch today. My wife ordered chicken curry and I tried the buffet. Lots of options and the buffet was popular today. I tried most of the food and brought some home as well. Great flavors. Some had heat, but not too spicy. Nothing I had was bad. First time I had goat and it was good. Reminded me off park. It was all very flavorful. I even brought some home for dinner. The wait staff was helpful; but not as proactive as I would prefer. Still, because they were not busy they did help us with questions and service. They were friendly and the manager even walked me through the buffet choices and told me about each one. Nice place to stop in and dine or do take out. I would recommend you try it.
