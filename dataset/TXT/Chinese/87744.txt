hwe7f0QthkND-H4Ekg37qw Very disappointing. I was the only person in the restaurant and yet it still took 20 mins for my food to arrive, and all i got was two maki rolls. 

Also the only time i have never finished sushi. The Eel was gummy and had no taste, and the yellow tail was slightly warm, which is a big no - no for sushi
