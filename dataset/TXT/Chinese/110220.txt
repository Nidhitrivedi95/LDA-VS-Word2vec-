LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA We have yet to be disappointed  in Flo's after at least 30 visits to this restaurant. My favorite starter is the calamari with peppers. The batter is so light on this dish and the spices have just the right amount of zip. I have never tasted calamari done better than Flo's. The service is always prompt and friendly. The dining room almost always seems to be full and everyone around us looks very happy. Flo's has to be doing something right to be so busy. Some of our other favorite dishes are the coconut chicken soup, a delicious classic Thai dish or the spring rolls. Any of the stir fry dishes are exceptional and I can honestly say we have never had an entree or appy we haven't thoroughly enjoyed. Flo's is one of the most consistent if not THE most consistent restaurant in the Valley. I do miss the yummy almond cookies they used to serve with your check but the fortune cookies are still a fun way to finish up a great meal and what a value. Two can dine for $20.00 easily and go home with leftovers. Compared to P.F. Chang's ( I am not a Chang's fan) Flo's is a winner.
