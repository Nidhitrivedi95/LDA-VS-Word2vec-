UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ So my girlfriend and I walked in around 8pm on a Monday night. Needles to say, it was pretty dead; a large party and a 2 top. I'm baffled tht it took the wait staff between 5-10 minutes after we were seated to be greeted. After the initial wait, the rest of our meal was enjoyable, the food came out hot, and u could tell it was fresh from the fryer and hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp. My only negative comments are towards the wait staff; not very friendly and the service was lacking, they were definitely saved by their kitchen
