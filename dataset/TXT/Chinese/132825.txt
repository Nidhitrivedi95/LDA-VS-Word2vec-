prHnRsgY-PuM7vxe8-RwEA We used to order here before many times but after my recent order, I think I will not give it a try for awhile because the food have the same taste. It takes like oyster sauce from the noodles the beef with mushroom. Chix wing is ok but how can you go wrong with frying chix wings but I could be better and the porkchop - has a different taste. Doesn't taste fresh. Im so sorry.
