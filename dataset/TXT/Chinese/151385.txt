szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A Everything about my food experience was great! What originally drew me to making the drive to try this restaurant out were the reviews posted here. What made me a believer was the taste and quality of every dish we ordered. I always try to find Asian restaurants where you see other Asian families frequenting....I mean, who eats at a restaurant when you can cook the same dishes better at home. My family and I were the only non-Asian people there on a fairly busy night. 
The portions are large enough to share and still have left overs. Comfortable seating as well. The only major issue that we encountered is that there is no handicap accessible ramp or space between the front parking spots to get a wheelchair through.
