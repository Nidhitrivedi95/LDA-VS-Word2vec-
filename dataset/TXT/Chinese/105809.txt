Kxop0nGA-BUrwYD4EGhyPA I ordered through Just Eats. My order was 100% wrong and when I called the restaurant they refused to admit that they sent the wrong order.

They were not willing to do anything to help my situation - send the correct order or help with a refund. I called Just Eats who followed up with the restaurant on my behalf and they denied knowing anything about the situation.
