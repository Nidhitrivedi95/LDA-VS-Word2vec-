U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ Based on the reviews, I figured I would like this place.  Maybe it would be a cross between Saigon Pho and Anise, wouldn't that be nice.  My fave is Anise for the quality, but its on the pricy side.  Saigon Pho is okay, always busy, but the quality can be hit or miss and they tend to use dark meat chicken instead of white, which I prefer.

Anyway, this is about Pho Chandler.  I won't return since it's out of our way (we were going to a play at Hamilton High).  Hubbie got a beef soup that had the gelatinous beef in it (w/ brisket too) that you either tolerate or will make someone like me gag.  He much prefered the beef soup he can get at Saigon Pho.  Daughter got the Pho Ga and she liked it and thought it was comparable to Anise but I was thinking no way just looking at the dish.  I got the lemongrass chicken and it was waaaaaayyy too sweet...and I have a tremendous sweeth tooth.  I much prefer the lemongrass at Saigon Pho.

The place is clean, service excellent.

Anise still remains my gold standard and Saigon Pho my fallback for when I want to go cheap.
