Apparently this place is a franchise that originated from China so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant was very clean with interesting decor. 

We ordered the special cod fillet with chopped chilli soup base. Additional toppings that we selected include lotus root, cabbage and glass noodles.

The cod fillet was fresh and tasty. The soup base was just the right level of spiciness and was also quite flavourful at the same time. It was not the numbing spice that you would get with loads of peppercorn which is the kind that I do not like. It was a very satisfying meal and I would definitely come back again!

They have an option for regular or large for the grilled fish hot pot. I think a large would be ideal for 2-3 people and 1-2 people for the regular depending on how big your appetite is. They also have other seafood hotpot options including crayfish.
