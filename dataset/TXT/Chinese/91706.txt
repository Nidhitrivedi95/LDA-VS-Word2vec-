ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w Growing up in Toronto as a second generation Chinese, I've had my healthy share of dim sum having dined 2 to 3x a week of my 50 years of life in Toronto.  I was excited to try Kwan and while I would give high marks to: ambience, friendly & efficient service and overall food / flavors.  The prices are quite, $2.00 per person for tea (they even charged my 11 year old daughter who didn't even have tea) and a table of 6 the bill for Friday dim sum was $155.  Better value and view at Pearl Harbourfront for less money & same flavors. I'm glad I tried Kwan and will go back when I'm next in Midtown, but it's not on my fav top 3 priority places.
