I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg I've had the Thai milk tea once and it was okay. If I really am craving it, I would take it. I do come here for the fluff shaved ice though! Being a Thai tea fanatic, I get the Thai tea with condensed milk with red beans. Although my body hates me for the sugary overload, my sweet tooth is pleased! It has a fluffy texture and it is really light. The condensed milk really adds onto the sweetness, which is what I love! Parking is a nightmare though because of the restaurant next door, but my family usually eats there and then head into here for dessert and for board games. Especially for a hot Phoenix summer, this place really hits the spot.
