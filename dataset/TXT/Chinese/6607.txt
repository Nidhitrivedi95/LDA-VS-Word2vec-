0kag5JGemji05P3oxx4lpg Upon hearing about Facebook postings concerning the  bartender that has worked here for over 7 years I decided to take some action. This guy is an idiot who is always trying to impress the entire little restauant with his drinks he makes up. Being a small place everyone has to listen while he rants about his skills. 
THE WARNING HERE IS HE SERVES  MINORS ON PURPOSE! He seems to cater to the younger crowd....under 21! Kinda creepy!
I WATCHED AS A COUPLE OF YOUNGER GUYS WALKED IN AND WERE NOT CARDED BUT INSTEAD GIVEN SAMPLES OF THESE "SPECIAL" DRINKS.

It is ashame because the food is good both lunch and dinner.
