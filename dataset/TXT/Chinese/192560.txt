Z4MvEVylnZPW_vddQc2Ihg Great food selection, great service. Ate here for the first time today and I recommend this place. You can make your own noodles and put any ingredients you want. They have an amazing selection from meat to vegetables to sauces.  I love seeing how my food is being cooked. My glass of iced tea was refilled consistently.
Love this ppace!
