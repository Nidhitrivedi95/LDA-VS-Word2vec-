uNQIqdowid2t3KR6t7vijg I am a culinary adventurer. It's been 20 years since I have come to this mall but I thought that I would try it, in search of a noodle place. I had done some research and was aware that this place existed. 

There are two restaurants in the food court, this one is the only one that displays English signs. However, I didn't feel like ordering in Chinese, so, I spoke in English and it was almost like he didn't understand me, I had to repeat myself multiple times. Am I wrong? If you have an english sign, you're expected to speak English?

He took my money and rather than handing me the change like most people, he placed it on a tray. Like, he didn't want to make physical contact with me. Normally, I would be pro-anti-contact but I can't be assured that the tray that he put my change on was very clean. 

Here's what my meal contained, it was the Goodies Special Noodle, which had 2 vegetables, 2 beef brisket, one chunk of fat and 3 large fish balls with noodles and soup. This meal is not very complicated, but it took them awhile to make it. Then, they yelled, "Hey!" over to me to come get my meal. 

Looking at the meal, it looked edible; however, I did notice some iron flecks from the wok that were floating on the soup. The atmosphere was also unclean, the mirrors were broken and had a film on it. I hate to say it, but I have eaten better, cheaper and cleaner in the streets of Hong Kong. 

The food was good, I had no complaints, but the flecks of iron didn't make my day. The tray was dirty, as well.
