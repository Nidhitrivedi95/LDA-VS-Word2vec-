AyOLu1vg-CZtVVhYRKJYAA Sad to say we frequented this place till today. My daughter had a bug with wings in her egg drop soup. When she showed an older lady who was a waitress, her reply was that it came from the shrimp. Ummmmm, there are no shrimp in egg drop soup. She walked away and didn't replace it. My daughter had to point it out to another worker and finally she brought another bowl. When I called the Restaurant to speak to Mgr I got the run around. Then was told his name is Jeff and he is on vacation. Ashley finally took the phone. I explained what happened she said she kind of knew what happened. What did I want her to do. I told her I was disappointed in the way it was handled and no gesture of goodwill was offered. She told me she would give her a credit next time she came in and then rushed me off the phone because she was busy. Horrible customer service from a place we went to regularly. After this experience we will never go there again. Beware of "extras" in your food at this place! @bestchina
