NdpvGGF4cLrdnA6ydSZz3g This hot pot place is really good compare to the other hot pot places. Their AAA slice beef is really good and their watermelon juice is good to with their hot pot food. Their pots are available in small or large and you choose your soup, at separate charge. They have a good selection of selected dishes for hot pot and their customer service is good!! Best in markham so far...!
