Tz5a_AzxWx0gtIAlinr1Ww I must be stupid to not follow my own advice. After an initial poor experience in May, I have been back twice with continued disappointment. The only thing I can rationalize as to why is the convenience of a buffet. But, it is three strikes and your out and I won't be back. Food remains bland, tastes similar regardless of what the dish is called, and is lukewarm.
