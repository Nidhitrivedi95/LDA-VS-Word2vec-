vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I'm only giving this place such a high rating is because of the food, which was good, but the service absolutely sucked. Waited in line for about 10 mins before anyone acknowledged we were in line. Another 10 mins before our order was taken. When it did come, it came incomplete and the last dish came out over 10 mins after our first dish came out. The manageress then tried to bullshit me by saying that the particular item takes longer to cook because they needed to fry it first. She shut up when I called her out on it as I have owned a Chinese restaurant before and knew what goes into making sweet and sour pork. I would've rather she just say I'm sorry we fucked up, it's coming right up. Never try and make lame excuses to the customer.  I guess she feels what happens in Ping Pang Pong, stays in Ping Pang Pong.
