UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ I ordered the small Greek salad with chicken, tender juicy and full of flavor.  My husband ordered the gyro, he said it was delicious, I tasted his french fries they were warm and crisp. We used the free drink offer on yelp. Highly recommend this place as we always try to support at mom and pop businesses. Definitely worth coming back to.
