-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw went to grab a drink with a friend after dinner and ordered 2 large pearl milk teas but the cashier 
messed it up making it 1 bubble tea instead of 2 and we ended up getting a regular sized cups instead of the large we ordered. I had a rough week so I didn't say anything and we just left, but the tapioca was hard and the tea was pretty crappy so never coming back there again (  )
