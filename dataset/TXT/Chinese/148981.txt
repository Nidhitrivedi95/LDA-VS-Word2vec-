SNkkuchbVtUzCwyENcai_g Obviously there are better Korean restaurants if you're willing to make the distance to Koreatown but if you're working in the are and just want to grab a bite to eat, this would be pretty decent. 

Their lunch specials are filling for about $9 (tax and tip included) and the food is fresh and well-made. Went with a coworker last week, I got the pork bone soup which I think should be a well done staple in any Korean restaurant and it was really hearty (didn't even finish it!). He got the bibimbap and reported also filling and yum. 

The staff is friendly, even the single waitress who seems overwhelmed during the lunch rush since she's the only one serving. You might have to call her over multiple times and repeat requests but she's so nice and apologetic it's not even an issue.
