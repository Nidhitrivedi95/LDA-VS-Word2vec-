IS_IWMsFRJii__17LsP1Og I came here based on the reviews, but was severely disappointed.  I ordered a simple lunch special and it took nearly 20 minutes to get.  When I got back to work it was a mess.  My eggroll was so under fried that the middle was raw and cold inside, the salad is just lettuce with half a teaspoon (if that much) of flavorless dressing and the entree was a joke.  Minimal flavor at best, totally dried out noodles and zero "thai" essence.  I could have made the same thing with top ramen noodles.  Should have trusted my gut and went to my usual place instead.  Lesson learned.
