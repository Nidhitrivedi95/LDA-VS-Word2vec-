WLCdg4ib7-_7b8epoXRjAw Best steamed dumplings EVERRRRR (in excited Oprah voice)! Ho Ho Cherry House is a reliable neighborhood Chinese restaurant that does primarily takeout/delivery business. Service is generally very quick and friendly. 

The menu is pretty long and features standard fare. The dumplings are always perfectly steamed and they usually throw in a couple more than the count says on the menu. Some of the fried foods can be a little on the oily side. Online ordering is definitely a bonus! 

P.S. They have coupons on the Clipper app sometimes, though the app is not user friendly.
