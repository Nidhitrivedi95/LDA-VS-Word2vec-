bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg Do NOT come here for brunch. We were a large group of 8 so we called early in the week for a reservation. The only reservation was Sunday at 1:30. We thought this place must be the place to be  and it's so popular! We come here at 1:30 and there is NO one here. Why did they state this was the ONLY time available. We even double checked the day before that there wasn't any other reservations. We arrive and it was very disappointing from beginning to end. The Bloody Mary was TASTELESS, didn't even have a hint of any kind of flavor despite claiming to be kimchi flavored. It was sent back! The dim sum was $5 an item for ONE piece of bun or ONE biscuit. It was actually sad because the pork bites were flavorful and the biscuit was delicious it was just SUCH a small portion. Not even authentic dim sum portions are this small. When we were grossly disappointed we asked to order more and they told us the kitchen was closed. WHY would you make a brunch reservation at 1:30?! The wait staff didn't even warn us there was a last call. All the other brunch reviews share the same sentiment. I should have listened to my fellow Yelpers.
