ZuNJelvkJD4wsXNBRg6t5w Hubby and I ate here, excited about hopefully finally getting GOOD Chinese food here in the NW.. and then we got our reality check. 

Service was good, ingredients were fresh, place seemed clean.. so they get one star.  The taste of the food, however, was forgettable.

Hubby summed it up. "You could take even the spicy dishes and blend it up for baby food"

There was no flavor, just a vague sauce covering what would otherwise be good ingredients, rendering them into nothingness.

Three dishes, all fully snooze-worthy. Even their potstickers were boring. We won't be back.
