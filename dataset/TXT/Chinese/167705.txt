VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng I'm not sure if I'd come back to this buffet, even for the decent price. I was extremely disappointed in both flavor and freshness. Most of the food I ate was lukewarm. Chicken was lacking in flavor and dry. Fried rice had some kind of mystery meat thrown in. No indication if fried foods were vegetarian, and green beans were wrinkled and tasteless. I did enjoy the 'Make Your Own' Hibachi station. The crab puffs weren't fresh but the flavor was good. I wound up only eating those for my dinner. Desserts were sub par, dry, and lacked diversity. I understand you can only expect so much from a buffet of Americanized Chinese food.. but for $10, you could easily drive down the street and get Hawaiian BBQ or something that doesn't taste like no attention at all was given to the cooking. I've had much better for the same price.
