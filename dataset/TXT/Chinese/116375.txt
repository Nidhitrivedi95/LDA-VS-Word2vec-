n72smZw1iVORdnjGfFT0FQ Came here today with my sister after church, unholy is how I felt walking out. Ordered the Russian boursh, pork and cheese bolognaise baked spaghetti, and the fried dough wrapped with rice roll. We were served with a nice hot bun with some butter at first. But everything just went downhill from there. The cheese was a Kraft singles slice, and it seemed like old grounded up cha sew instead of ground pork. Served with a nice portion of ketchup instead of tomato sauce, I would've settled for canned tomato sauce over whatever that was. Boursh was mediocre but it's okay, and the rice roll... Well the fried dough was very crunchy, don't know what to say. Currently writing this review while trying not to borderline vomit my bed, just don't come here anymore, the place is no longer the same.
