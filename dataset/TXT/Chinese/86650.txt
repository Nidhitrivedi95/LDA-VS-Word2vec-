hPTx2Y5e4Czbr21XcbDN8g Be prepared to be hit with the stinky tofu smell even from out the door!  You do get used to the smell by the time you're sat down though.

I think the stinky tofu used to be a bigger dish but is now a smaller dish.  (it's still a good size)  Other than that, the noodles here are good but there are few veggie options (always like to have a veggie dish when I eat) and the portions are quite small.  

I find that a L size noodle and a regular size doesn't differ that much, would definitely recommend just a regular size.  Service is usually lacking because I only ever see one woman serve the entire place.
