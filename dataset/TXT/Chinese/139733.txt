qy6RM3qsgXTanVH-TlJaXQ Went here tonight for dinner with my fiance. The food was excellent (I got the pan fried noodles with shrimp and he got the chicken chop suey) and the staff was awesome. Our server was constantly refilling our water and asking us if we were satisfied. He even let us hang out after we finished eating and still refilled our water. Great service, and I look forward to going back again!
