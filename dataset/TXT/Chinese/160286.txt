U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Like a fool, I came here with a date and did not order any noodles. So I am not too sure how reliable my review can be. Anywho, the big gripe on yelp is the price of the food. Yeah, it is a little steep (nothing crazy), but maybe these people forgot that they were at one of the premier casinos on the middle of the Strip in a little town called Las Vegas - which is not exactly where you go for bargains on food. That aside, I was not overly impressed with the food, but it was solid and the ingredients were quality. The menu is crazy-extensive, so there are many dishes to come back to - if you can get past the price point. The atmosphere is really impressive, but a bit sterile. (The gold fish are awesome.) I read multiple problems with the service, but I did not have any problems on my visit - I was seated promptly and the service was attentive. Will I go back? With a Chinatown's worth of options a mere few miles away, probably not. Yet, if I was on the Strip and had a taste for Chinese, sure.
