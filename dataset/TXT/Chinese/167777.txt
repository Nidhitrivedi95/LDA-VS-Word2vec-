VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng One of my favorite buffets in Vegas. Although not a buffet on the Strip, this place is definitely one of the most crowded buffets I've been to in Vegas. It's very popular with the locals and visitors.

They have plenty of food and it never runs out despite the continuous stream of folks coming here. The employees are continuosly filling up the trays and so there is always hot food served.

A lot of the Asian buffets seem to always have the same types of food but Buffet at Asia goes beyond your typical Asian buffet food. They have so much more. There are all kinds of food. They have Thai food (pad thai), Chinese food (general chicken, brocolli beef, fried rice, chow mein, spicy chicken, egg flower soup, hot and sour soup, dumplings, egg rolls), Hawaiian food (oxtail soup), American food (french fries, crab, lobster tail, chicken wings), French food (frog legs) and all kinds of dessert (mango pudding with dates, coconut pudding, frozen yogurt, almond cookies, sesame balls, Chinese donuts, fruit cocktail, cream puffs). The crabs seemed to be the fan favorite for most. I noticed people's plates were piled with this.   For the soups, I really liked the wonton soup. The wontons inside were meaty and hearty. For the desserts, I was a fan of their Chinese donuts. They kept bringing these out and so they were always warm and soft. The mango pudding was very flavorful as well. I even was a fan of their frozen yogurt because it had a nice, fine texture and was not runny or milky.

Aside from your typical soda drinks, Buffet at Asia also offers different kinds of drinks like fruit slushes with boba and ice coffee.

Dinner at Buffet at Asia is $14.99. It's a great and yummy deal!
