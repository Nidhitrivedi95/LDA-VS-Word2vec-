Went here with yelpers Lin and Joyce. Why not consult my asian yelpers to try out this new Chinese place? But..it was merely meh.

We got:
- The beef pan fried noodle:- given this was suppose to be Cantonese style, this was not Cantonese style. It wasn't crispy enough and it was kind of too drenched in sauce and oil...I wasn't a fan.

- The garlic eggplant:- it was just ok. Kind of wish there were more flavor to it though.

- The seafood tofu casserole:- Yeah, I agree with my fellow yelpers, that was probably the best dish we got, as it came out in a stone pot with lots of different foods in the pot. 

Overall? Ehh. I mean, I didn't expect to be blown away by this place but.. meh. I wasn't a fan... it was just ok? The environment is kinda uncomfortable as well...
