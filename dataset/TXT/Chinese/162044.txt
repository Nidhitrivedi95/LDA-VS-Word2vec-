Came here when it was buy one get one free for dinner (Monday-Wednesday). They gave each person a ticket to redeem a whole lobster. The lobster was dried, overcooked and had a strong seafood smell to it. The actual buffet was okay. They were really good with replenishing empty dishes so the food was always hot. The best thing at this buffet aside from the price is the soya milk. However, I wouldn't come back here even though it was cheap and the service was good because the food just wasn't good.
