ZaV97nuYxH32bthBIzjgmw I agree that this place is A-OK.  It is across from UNLV and the name leads itself to "Chinese" but there is a big sign that says "MONGOLIAN BBQ" - a bowl is $8.99 if you get meat, cheaper for veg, $3 more for shrimp eaters.

The veggies were fresh and there was a good selection - bok choy, spinach, tofu, green onions, white onions, carrots, pineapple, bean sprouts, peanuts, baby corn, mushrooms, orange noodles, cabbage, etc....

Interesting mix of sauces to create your own - soy sauce was behind the counter in the hands of the grill master so he added it.  For those who order meat, you can choose chicken, beef or pork or all three.  I got beef.  There was enough food for 3 meals so this was a really good deal.  No complaints!  I would go back.  The service was friendly.
