Qn5QMHOV6f5uHbxvrTPGRA We tried this spot at the NoDa Company Store. The food was fresh and the people who worked there were very friendly. We shared the buns and the dumplings. The dumplings were amazing and we loved them. The buns weren't great - they kind of fell apart. That being said, I would come back here for the dumplings alone.
