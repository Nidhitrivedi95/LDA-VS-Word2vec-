W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g First time here after trying Vietnamese dishes in Seattle earlier this summer. Was hoping the Beef Pho was just a great here and it was! 

I ordered the Beef Pho with sliced beef. Piping hot & delicious with very fresh Basil, Bean Sprouts, Jalapeños and onion. Yum!

Ordered Pork Spring Rolls and also received a free order of Vegetable Rolls for my Yelp! check-in. Full of flavor, not greasy at all. Served with a variety of fresh made sauces.

Service was awesome with very friendly & smiling server. 

Order to ready in less than 10 minutes. 

Great menu with a wide selection of entrees, appetizers and soups. Very reasonably priced!

Highly recommended! Enjoy!
