LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ worst service ever I had experience. had seated at chair for so long no one was even coming to check. Last, do not ever let server recommend something your check will be horrible. I had order a whole duck and a live fish to be cooked. Three people was just enough to eat no more stuff left. My check was $180 I was shock. I mean they are not even a restaurant at strip also their food was not even good as to pay for a round hundred. One more thing was they also add the tips even my table was not more than five. A restaurant with horrible service and no laws no more to say just don't go here
