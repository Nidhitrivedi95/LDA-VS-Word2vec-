KhvwEXKJXRTgcJRNmJNhsA The food is okay, but the service really is disappointing, so disappointing I'll just give the food back and I got it delivered. Why does it takes 15 minutes, asking the gate code to my house? That's like getting lost in a dead in? Then food was cold and they fuck up on my order and I ordered online. First time and last time very disappointed
