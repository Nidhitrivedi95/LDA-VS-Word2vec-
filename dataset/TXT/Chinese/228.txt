-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg I love Vietnamese food and this was a disappointment.   The portion was a on the small side for pho. Also it was lacking in flavor. All the ingredients were correct for the dish but it was poorly prepared. My wife's food wasn't much better. I was excited after reading the reviews but was let down by the food.
