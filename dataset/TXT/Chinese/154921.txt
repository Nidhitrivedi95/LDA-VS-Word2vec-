tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw I found this place on Yelp.  Ordered pickup of here and it was pretty good. The food was decent but lacked a little flavor.  I ordered the chop suey which I haven't had in a long time.  It seems very promising and will most likely get food there again.

The ambiance seems nice so maybe next time it will be a sit down.
