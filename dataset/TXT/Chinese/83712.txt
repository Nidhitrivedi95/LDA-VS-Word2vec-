HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ Just ordered from Ginbu tonight and was not happy with our experience. The food took over an hour to get here. We got Shrimp Pad Thai which had no flavor and was very dry. The sushi rolls were mushy and did not taste fresh. The crab wontons however were good. For over $50 I expected better quality food.
