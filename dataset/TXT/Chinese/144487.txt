RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ Is it just me or is portion size now smaller at Rose Tea? I paid $9 for the he-fun noodles to go and was expecting it for both lunch and leftover for dinner, instead I got an incredibly small portion that left me feel ripped off.   The food is decent but it is not deserving of the four stars that everyone seem to give.
