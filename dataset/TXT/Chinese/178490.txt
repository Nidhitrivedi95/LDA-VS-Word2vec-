x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg I've been coming to this location ever since they converted the Swiss Chalet into Asian Legend. I've always gotten good service and great food! No complaints!

I normally get their Hot & Sour Soup with Shredded Chicken, Snow Pea Shoot with Garlic in Soup, Sautéed Green Beans with Dried Shrimp, Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Ground Pork, Pan Fried Chicken Dumplings, Pan Fried Pork Dumplings, Pan Fried Green Onion Pancake, Chinese Bun (steamed or deep fried), Pan Fried Pork Buns, Shanghai Noodles and Chicken Fried Rice.

I know it's a lot of food but usually I'm there with at least 4+ people and we put the noodles and rice into take out containers for the next day. 

Overall, it has a great atmosphere, beautifully decorated. You can always order online and go pick it up!
