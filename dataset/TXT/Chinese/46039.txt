BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA - Fried long green beans: small portion for the price, not bad but a bit kinda bland IMO
- Pan fried dumplings: a bit bland as well
- Mapo Tofu: crazy salty, not numbing and not really spicy.  Someone dumped a random jar of chinese spicy chili paste into a pot with tofu.  Embarassment.
- Soup dumplings:  kinda sloppy, half were leaking/leaked out, broth wasnt that good
- Hot sour soup:  watery and bland, stingy portions

They don't seem to do anything very well.  Service is good at least.  Would rather go to Din Tai Fung or Asian Legend....
