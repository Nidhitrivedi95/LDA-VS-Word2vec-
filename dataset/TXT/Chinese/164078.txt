uU8up3hGwW9qnzQD1HZsMQ Thought it was decent. People are nice. We had the problem of not receiving cashew chicken when we ordered it. Got takeout and then had to call because the meal was not cashew chicken. When I asked to deliver new cashew chicken, they brought to the house literally 15 cashews in a cup. Yes you read that right. Funny at the time but no clue on customer service. Just remake the meal! I didn't want to make a scene with my family so just smiled and closed the door. 

Thought this was an undercut from the owner that they didn't even recognize this type of service is not appropriate. This place has been the brunt of numerous jokes this week behind their back. I'm willing to try it again but the owner really needs to reach out to us on that one. 

Wow-
