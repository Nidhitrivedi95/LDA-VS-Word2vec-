OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Finally came back after a few years, it was the restaurant that I was introduced to Dim Sum. Comparing it to say KJ, they're probably not as good but definitely as far as price and quality go they're good enough. 

They have all your usual favorites at dim sum chicken feet, bbq bun, egg tarts, etc that were all good. I didn't have anything that was bad so I'll definitely come back if I'm craving dim sum! 

KJ can get pretty quick really fast and I usually average close to $20 per person, but here we averaged $10 per person.
