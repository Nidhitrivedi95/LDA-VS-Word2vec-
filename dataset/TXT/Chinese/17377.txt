4rSHsXO4ozQoD0hoPCDatQ I'm not gonna front -- this is a Chinese take-out place. It's cheap, it's fast, it's friendly, and I've never had any problem with the grub I've gotten from this place. It's the closest Chinese take-out to my apartment, which alone means that I've been to this place probably more times than I've been to my own kitchen. I wish they bottled that smell of fryer oil endemic to most Chinese take-outs. I would dab a bit behind my ears every morning.
