Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg I am always a fan of PF Chang's, but the one in Las Vegas had a special menu where large groups can order by paying per person and get unlimited appetizers and entrees,  I think we paid $27pp and got two appetizers and 4 entrees along with white and brown rice.  If we ran out of anything, they would bring out more.  The food was good and the service was excellent.  The only downside was the excruciatingly long wait.  They said 45 minutes, but it ended up being a hour and a half!
