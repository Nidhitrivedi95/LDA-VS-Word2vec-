t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA Recommended from someone that was a local for a bit. It was really great! Went with a friend after a meeting, before we went to airport to go home. The Szechuan dumplings, shredded garlic pork, mala chicken, soup dumplings, jalapeño ground beef noodles, chicken wings, and... one other thing. For two people, enough to feed 6-8. Leftovers actually came home on the plane and lasted just one day.

Food was authentic, food came out quickly, people taking order were nice, just loved the whole hong. Really authentic not Americanized but they have Americanized if you need it. 

I will be back!
