Well, this is how I've been feeling whenever I think about Bale sandwiches from back home in Honolulu. Basically, vietnamese sandwiches better known as bahn mi.

I've been on the endless search for these sandwiches...I, literally, drove up and down Spring Mountain looking for this place.
I think my endless search has, FINALLY, ended. =) YES, I can breath a yummy sigh of relief!!!!!

Not only is the bread to-die-for because they're soft and sweet but, the price is better than expected. ONLY $4 for a sandwich. 

Expect to see me there more often. Foursquare mayor of Hue Thai better watch out...Imma be checking in there more often!!!!!!!!!!
