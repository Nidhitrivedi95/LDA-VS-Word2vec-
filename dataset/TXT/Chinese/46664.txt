bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Just left after a very nice dinner. Food was very good have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant since moving here from California.  All the chicken dishes had a generous amount of food and all the vegetables were fresh.  Everything was well seasoned and hot.  Wait staff was attentive and courteous. Only suggestion I would make is the potstickers need to be crispier.  I will be back again, didn't really want to give this review as it.may get too busy or crowded.  Hey but they deserve it!
