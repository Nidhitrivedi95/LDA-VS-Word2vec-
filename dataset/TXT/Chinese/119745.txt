NyGlEmuYcpZSKfk6IwJeSw The design of the place is great with small izakaya style booth.
The cocktails were also good especially the Tokyo Mule.
But that's it for the good reviews.
Unfortunately the menu is far from being Japanese. It mixes Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese altogether with American style food... which is weird considering the restaurant main theme.
As for the food itself, the maki were okay but the Udon noodles were not very tasty and well overcooked. I also ordered a medium/rare steak which has at best medium and far from rare... and of course it cames with fries (good btw) but it is not what you expect in a Japanese style restaurant.
Overall not a very good experience!
