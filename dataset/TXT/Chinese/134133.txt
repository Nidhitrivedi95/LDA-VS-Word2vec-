Q_Iia5C2quTUVfE5_8jObw Terrible service, very small portions relative to price (and to other Chinese restaurants). However, I must admit that the food was delicious and came extremely quickly even on a busy night. The dishes were quite greasy though, and some of the seafood can be a hit or miss depending on the chef.
