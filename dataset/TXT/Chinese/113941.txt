mRubgo8WfjraJkE5Bvbf6w Pretty tough reviews but this was my first visit.
I went for the Panang Chicken Curry... not too spicy which was good and came with some rice and they had a coupon in their paper menu's at the desk for a free chicken egg roll with an entree so that's what we did.

I'm no curry expert by any means but I've had better curry at Thai places previously but I wasn't disappointed at all.  I could have taken more rice but in the end it turned out to be just enough.

My buddy went safe and had the orange chicken which he said was just fine and he'd also return.

It's not a really nice place so no worries there, but not dirty at all, just kind of quick sit down and eat type place.. wooden chair booths but plenty of seating for a lot if you had a group.  Ladies were very nice and food came up fairly quick.

I'll go again and try another item on their menu and hopefully will be just as good or better.

Oh and they have Diet Dr Pepper, which is awesome... just sayin.
