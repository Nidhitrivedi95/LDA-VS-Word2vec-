7rh29SPJMkyeI2BJcjqzLQ Driven by here a million times and had no desire to stop in. A friend told me they went here and loved it, so I gave it a try. I get grossed out easily if places are dirty. However, you walk in here and it is so impeccably clean. It seems to be a nice family owned business. The service is fantastic. The hot tea is freshly made with herbs and steeped...Delicious. Only $1.75 and they bring a nice little pot enough to share. The prices are incredible. $8.95 got me a Sa Cha Chicken with fried rice, soup, and egg roll. This is "old school" nothing fancy. No fancy pricing! They even have coupons out! My new favorite place. Also, a perk I enjoy....On these freezing cold nights you can easily park right at the door!!!! Looks like they do a lot of take out.
