dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ Been hitting this place hard for the last four years and I keep coming back for the tea, drink specials and the understanding that I want fish. And I want it now. I bring all my work friends and we tear up the all you can eat. They are always happy to see us. They don't give us the "you eat and go home Na eat sushi all day". They welcome everyone's requests for extra spicy mayo and never complain when we go through dish after dish. We make compitions on who eats the most sushi. Regardless this place doesn't hold back when I have ordered to go. I get free food with my orders. They love me here. They know who I am. The chef prepared my chirashi without asking. I couldn't ask for better service or fish. This isn't a high end perfect cut sushi. It's a home with friendly faces and hot miso soup. No matter what people say. This place is a gold mine in the land locked Arizona state.
