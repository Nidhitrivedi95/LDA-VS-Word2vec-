hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q 5 of us came here for my husband's 40th birthday celebration. This is definitely our favorite sushi hangout. The staff is always happy and make us feel like we're hanging out at a sushi version of Cheers!   And if the the staff isn't enough to win you over, the food will amaze you!  Awesome happy hour specials!  Thank you, once again, for making our experience a special one.
