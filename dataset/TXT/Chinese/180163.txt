X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg The pros:  Ran into a promoter at the Excalibur hotel who got us on the guest list ahead of time- arrived around 11:30 and had no line wait and free entry (ladies only)
Tiesto was the headliner. 'Nuff said.

The cons:  Has a huge capacity but the main dance floor area is surprisingly a bit small on the 3rd floor- it was packed when we got there and you're packed in even more like Sardines by the time the headliner comes on.
If you want water, they only offer bottled Fiji water and at $9 a pop! Ridiculous.

Overall though, we had a great time, mostly because we saw Tiesto, who came on around 1am. Not sure I would recommend it though unless you specifically want to see the headlining DJ. I don't know if this is true of most Vegas clubs, but only having the option to pay $9 for a bottle of water is ludicrous.
