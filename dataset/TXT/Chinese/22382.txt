Another place that used to be the best in town, and is now an embarrassment. 

Food off the Chinese menu is still good, but the regular menu is no longer up to snuff. Sauces that were once delicate and light are now weighted down with starch and made unbearable with sugar. I went with about 6 other people and the only dishes we enjoyed were some pan fried noodles, and some stir fried greens. I don't even know what the greens were... maybe snow pea leaves... but they were good. Still 2 out of the 10 dishes we ordered isn't a good record.
