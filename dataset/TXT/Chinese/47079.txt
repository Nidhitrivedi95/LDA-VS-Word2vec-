bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A Straight to the point: we ordered from here for the first time and it was some if the worst Chinese food we've ever had. We moved here from NYC so, yes, our standards are high but we've lived here long enough that we know where to go to find food that is at least acceptable. This is definitely not. Almost everything we ordered was flavorless. If there was flavor then it was the flavor of grease. We wanted it to be good. We had high hopes! But it was awful. We will definitely avoid it in the future. :(
