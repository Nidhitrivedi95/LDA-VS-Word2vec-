icTMQrn3BYeSfBrxQZN6Bg Gold Diamond opened up where the Bright Pearl use to be.  We decided to check it out for a mid-week dim sum craving.  Arriving around 10am-ish, we were one of the only few occupied tables.  Service was quick to come with tea and a very polite waitress picked up our dim sum check list order.

Food arrived almost immediately after ordering.  It was sizzling hot - fresh from the steamers/deep fryers onto our table.  Quality wise, the food was decent.  Nothing out of the ordinary but the hotness made it seem fresher and therefore better.

Since it was before 11:30am, we got the special pricing of $1.88 which made our meal for 5 people only $30 - amazing!  Definitely would go again on a weekday or weekend!  

3.5 stars for good food, nice service and no need to travel to the bowels of Markham for decent dim sum.
