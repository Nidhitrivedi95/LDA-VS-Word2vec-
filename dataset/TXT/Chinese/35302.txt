ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ Fathers day dinner at dragon legend last night. Food for the most part is pretty good in comparison to other buffets. Peeking duck is always a treat you don't see elsewhere. Mussels crab and the veggies are good quality. Only issue I had was the time limit. I get it that it was a busy night but the fact they were cleaning up the table while we were eating dessert I did not take kindly on. They are pricey in comparison to all other buffets already. Some consideration would have been appreciated.
