dN3-yXUI6ybiLhO-lF5oQg All day $7 specials near York University....what's not to like?

They call themselves a Congee house with 14 items

But they have over 100 traditional Chinese dishes so they offer more

Place seats 30 or so people so bring a group and order a pile f dishes and eat and eat well

This is the only chinese  place I have come across
That offers a Cullen or Doughnut on the menu

Enjoy a beef tripe & turnip with a Pork Liver Congee and a hot tea
