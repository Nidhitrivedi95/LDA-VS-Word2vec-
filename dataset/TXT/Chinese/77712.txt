Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA I love this place. It's yummy, service is quick, and prices are so cheap it's crazy. My favs are pineapple fried rice and pad thai. That thai spice and flavor is always there. No dish is over $10. I ordered calamari, pad Thai, pine apple fried rice, and a rice dish that came with fried chicken and my total was $30, and it fed me and my dad and sister, and we had leftovers. So good! I recommend
