aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg We found this restaurant from Yelp. Mmm.. So yummy and authentic. We actually felt like we were in Hong Kong. All the dishes we ordered were great, but I especially like the roated pork and BBQ pork. Milk tea is great too. 
When we are tired of the buffet from Vegas, this is the place we go. For good food and great price!
