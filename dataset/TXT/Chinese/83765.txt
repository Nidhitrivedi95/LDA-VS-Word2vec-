HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ I really enjoyed the sushi here. The service was excellent! They were very knowledgable and offered great suggestions. The sushi was brought out very quick and the prices were very reasonable. We'll be back! I found out about this place on groupon. It was listed as popular and now I know why!
