LsgE9TBlyvGFF2n7esSd2w I have tried different locations of Pei Wei, but I will just rate the Avondale one because that is the one I go to more often. It is OK, service is good. The favor of the food is either sweet, hot, or salty. I can not taste the different between Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines. I know it is a chain, but maybe I am spoiled with all the different cuisines around the valley. We go because my husband likes it.
