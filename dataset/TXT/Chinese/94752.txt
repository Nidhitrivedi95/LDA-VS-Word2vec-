We went on a Tuesday night and the place was packed, so it is obviously popular with the locals. We ordered oysters with black bean sauce, salt & pepper squid, eggplant and fried tofu, snow pea leaf tips and fried flounder in black bean sauce (this is an off-menu item, they typically serve their founder braised but we requested fried). Everything was super delicious --and they have amazing lemonade (random).

If you are sick of the overpriced options on the Strip, pay Joyful House a visit.
