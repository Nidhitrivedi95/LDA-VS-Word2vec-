LoB-Ho9DRsNcWkoz_a_vJA Not very good. The chicken satay with steamed rice was smelling strongly of fish. Maybe they used the left over oil or used a uncleaned dish after cooking fish to prepare this. Many items on menu were not available.  The chicken satay on steamed rice was very oily and the mango milk shake was a disaster..... overall bad food. But the place was neat and clean, service ok.
