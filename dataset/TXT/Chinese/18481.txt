5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A Consistently good food. I stop here for takeout on my road trips to California. I know that Thai food can be all over the map and Thai House doesn't have a million silly pictures on the wall of famous people (hint, hint fans of Lotus of Siam...) but the value/price ratio is very good.
