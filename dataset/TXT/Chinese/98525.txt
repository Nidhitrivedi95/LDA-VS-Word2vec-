JRRduMZI2aU3UCjfNEQURA Service is a only a tad bit better than the Lincoln location. The big difference between the two locations is that It's cleaner and more new looking. What I did NOT appreciate was how misleading the waitress was. I asked how many were there for the fried oysters which was 5.99 or 4.99 (something like that). She said 4. When we received the oysters it was two "large" fried oysters. I was wondering where are the 4? So she waitress came back and told us it was 4 SMALL oysters and since they only had large ones they gave us 2 large ones. Um...ok? So why did you say 4 oysters in the first place. In general the service was ok, not as atrocious as the Lincoln location. dumplings are really juicy and I like them. But....misleading waitress = big no no,.
