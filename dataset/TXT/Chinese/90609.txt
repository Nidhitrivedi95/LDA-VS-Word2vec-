IHt79wxZHkD7QSzlDRDivw hmm hmm hmm. obviously they only take cash which resulted in having to drive 9 blocks away to a scotiabank and return, but wow was it ever worth it. Roasted pork, skin so cripsy, oh my god. Barbecued pork, oh my good flesh so tender. Didnt try the duck but it was highly recommended and the chef gave us some deep fried crab to try which was equally delicious. Just so you guys know, this place was rated the best chinese bbq spot in North America by "Gourmet" magazine, which is now out of business but has been considered the premier restaurant review publication of our time.

Go there, now.
