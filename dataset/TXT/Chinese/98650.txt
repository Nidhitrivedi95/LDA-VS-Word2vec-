Jtj8qgXzuWKjO2DYIn45dw Have eaten take out from here at least 50 times more like 100 i suppose but never looked at the yelp listing until today. I question the people who do not like it as in no way has the food ever been anything but great but the way these people act like the food is from mars or something I have to wonder how honest they are. Even if the food tasted bad I have never seen it anything but cooked very well and always fresh and steamy hot when I get it home. I have gotten it and brought it to friends houses for meals gotten many different items and never had anything but great hot food. Seems everything is getting so expensive these days but I usually get enough for two meals so looking at it that way it is still a great bargain.
