QKCu3cKjMAOOZI7tEfv0zg This place is always empty and I was hesitant about ordering from here even though it's located at the corner of where I live.  So I decided to finally stop in on my way home from work and wow I was surprised.  They may seem empty but not today. I walked in and there were a few people already waiting for their order, they had several large phone orders and a few people were coming in after me.  

I ordered the pad thai and it was very very good.  I went back a few days later and ordered the lunch combination kung pao with fried rice.  and again there were a few people in front of me waiting for orders and a few people came in after me. 

I think this place just APPEARS to be quiet and empty but it really isn't.  The food is good, I will definitely go back and continue to try other things.  This isn't the BEST chinese food I've had but it's very good and worth return visits.  Their prices are avg and a good amnt of food for what you pay for.
