rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg There's some harsh reviews of this place but I don't have an issue with it really.
Price is normal for dinner places, the staff are not the nicest people out there but if you sit and eat they are nice and quick with soda/tea refills and removing plates.

They have a happy hour (I think it's every day) from 4-7 where all their appetizers (lots of em) are half off.  If I get there before 7, which I try to, I usually only order a bunch of different appetizers so I have like 4-5 different things to eat... I like it.  Their orange chicken is bomb too!
