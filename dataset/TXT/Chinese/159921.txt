U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Didn't eat much during my trip and was really sad that I wasted a meal here. Presentation of the food looked really nice but the food itself was soooo mediocre. Dan dan noodles had a HEAVY peppercorn taste, I couldn't even finish it because my tongue was tingling the entire time. The best thing that we ordered was the eggplant, which is kind of sad.
