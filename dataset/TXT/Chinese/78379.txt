GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog The concept is cool and the vibe is inviting, that is what drew me in. The food was bad bad bad! The tacos were salty, the marg was gross, the dim sum reminded me of a TV dinner in taste. Would not recommend it at all! I had the pozole too, usually I am 100% all pozole all the time, it was tasteless. I swear Taco Bell would have been a better option for a lot less.
