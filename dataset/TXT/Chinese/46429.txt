BvrG8XMpTtlJYWhOCbnpaQ Since I didn't really want to cook for Christmas Eve dinner, we had to find a place that was open, and not only did we find this place but the food was great.

The owner/manager was very nice and explained the menu. Since we all decided to have the stir fry, he then helped us decide how spicy for the sauces and also helped us decide what would be best--rice noodles, flour noodles or rice with each of our bowls. The rice noodles were very good with the mix of veggies that I added to my bowl.

I really liked that I didn't have to decide what size bowl, as all the bowls were the same size. I had shrimp in my stir fry. I was expecting smaller ones, but these were medium sized and very tasty.

Food was decent, but the people working here were so nice! Five stars for a great experience on Christmas Eve!
