Yes, YES its expensive.... its in CEASAR'S PALACE.  Have you ever been to some place in a CASINO themed as a PALACE and gotten anything cheap?  Hell, a room service box of cereal would be at least 8 bucks.

The decor is spectacularly cool, with suspended pattern carved curved ceilings and rows and rows of goldfish tanks.  A guy in the kitchen is hand-stretching the noodles and the noodle dishes are authentic.  I enjoyed myself thoroughly and the cold hand stretched noodles in szechuan sauce were extremely delicious.

The service was a bit slow, but don't be hatin'.
