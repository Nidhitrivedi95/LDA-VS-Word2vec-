xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw This place was good.  Typicall Mongolian BBQ although a bit pricey.

The location for this place is really good because it gets alot of foot traffic so you will see this place packed at almost all times.

I like this place better then its competitors in AZ because it caters to the nightlife eaters with Sake bombs and other drink specials.

The selection of meat and vegetables is great and you will find yourself stuck between making several dishes.  I think that if they droped the price of the all you can eat, people would be happier as they would make smaller portions of different things...but right now it feels like everyone crams as much as possible into one bowl.

I recommend this place, but its nothing you have to rush out to right this instant.
