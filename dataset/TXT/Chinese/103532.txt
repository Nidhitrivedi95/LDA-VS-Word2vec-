But they had great menu options and the cashier even made it a point to ask every single customer if they had any food allergies. For the gluten-free crowd, they have several soy-sauce substitutes available, so you don't have to limit yourself to just the curry options.

If this had not been in an airport, I might not have been so generous with my rating. However, it was an excellent airport option.
