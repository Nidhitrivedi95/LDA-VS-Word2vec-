VDdX2TGa9hNHwjzrnVSC_A This place is in such a quaint looking area of the old port.  Cobblestone and all.  Inside, you are treated to a very tea house like atmosphere.  Teas everywhere.  They also have a small menu to pair your tea with light appetizer type food.  It's nice to sit down, relax, and pretend you are a little snobbier than you really are.
The service is nice and they will chat with you about the different types of teas.  We got one of the blossom teas which are always fun to watch as they steep in the glass tea pot.
There is definitely a zen like feel to this place.  I like it a lot.
