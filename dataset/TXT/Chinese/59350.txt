DIxgItsSI9QwX9H8lVptYg I usually order delivery from a different spot but I thought I'd change things up tonight and unfortunately I will not order from here again. The food was ok. But the delivery driver could not understand me and I could not understand him. I understand a language barrier but when you have to explain directions to someone over the phone it's very frustrating. I asked for soy and hot mustard to be included with my order and it was not. The food was cold when the driver finally did arrive because he got lost. I don't blame him. The restaraunt should have better gps instructions.
