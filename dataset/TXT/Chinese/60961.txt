DoSp0KBcnwn4SYssW7P2Ow Feel this place has been here since like forever.. though I don't go there all the time, I always like going here because unlike Destiny, their food is adequate and decent enough for dinner and I find their customer service is always so much better than Destiny.  

The downfall is their place is so busy, it is very hard to get seats at busy times..    However, you can call and make reservations. 

Their drinks have more variety and you actually feel bang for you buck without getting ripped off or overpriced items. I  also loved they have a separate round square tables at the back or small private room for groups...  

I will definitely miss this place since it closed down since Feb 22nd... and their new location is due to open in Downtown Markham.. but when? we won't know :(
