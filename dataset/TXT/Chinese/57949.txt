D9bf5U0y_0MnL9wMFc4bKQ This place is pretty small, and the portions are small as well. Came here on a Saturday night, but ended up at the bar - so remember to make your reservations! Got the peking duck for two, and while it's not the real-deal peking duck, it came pretty damn close. Too many peas in the stir fry for me, but overall it was pretty good. Recommend getting one more dish (not from the appetizer menu), since the portions aren't that big if you're hungry. But the ambience is cute, and I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're not sure where to go for dinner on a Saturday night!
