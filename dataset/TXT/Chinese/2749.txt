_GwVhLhVF_NkEjdcY0TZ8w One thing that made me really want to try this restaurant was their auto-rotate bbq system. You simply place the skewers in the slot and they automatically rotate and cook - pretty cool I must say. All you have to do is sprinkle some seasoning (chili powder and salt). They have a wide variety of skewer options. I ordered the meat combo, comes with chicken, beef, shrimp and lamb, 4 skewers for each meat. The beef, lamb and chicken were all marinated. I thought the chicken meat tasted the best, meat was most tender. The shrimp was really dried out, pretty much impossible to peel off the shells so i just ate it all.
They also have pineapple on a skewer available for $5. At that price you would hope they would serve fresh pineapples but nope, it was canned pineapples and tasted horrible. 

Apparently Seahood has the same concept as Captain boil, eating seafood boiled in a bag drenched in spicy sauce. Since Captain boil always seemed to be out with crawfish, i decided to try crawfish here. Its nice how they dont have a fixed price per pound since crawfishes are quite heavy and the actual meat inside is like the size of your pinky - $13 for a bag. In the bag there were approximately 10? The only thing i would say is it felt kinda cruel having to break and pick out the meat, felt like i was dissecting the crawfish. Originally the sauce has 3 peppers but we asked for mild, still quite spicy. The sauce didnt have much flavor other than tasting hot.

Overall the food was ok, but nothing special. Interesting concept, but more of a gimmick. I found the restaurant trying to be everything - the seafood in the bag, and the bbq style, and also they had normal chinese dishes as well. I don't think I would come back.
