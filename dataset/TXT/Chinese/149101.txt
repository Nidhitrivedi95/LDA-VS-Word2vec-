sOaeX1zQWuqbPcclvjtdeA The food was great! I had the California Roll and the Pad Thai. The pad thai was a little bit more on the spicier side but it was still tasty. This is the first time I've been here and I would go again. 

I'm giving it 4 stars because the waitress was sort of slow. However besides the good food it just had a very chill atmosphere. Loved the ambiance.
