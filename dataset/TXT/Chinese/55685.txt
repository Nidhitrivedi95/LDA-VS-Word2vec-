cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ I've since left Cleveland, but I wanted to leave a review for this place because I ate there at least twelve times in the last year. 

When I was in college, I studied abroad in China and ended up living there for five years. I'm originally from Cleveland, and nothing prepared me for authentic Chinese food. I ate myself stupid at small, cheap, restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai, and when I came back, it was hard to find anything comparable. Americanized Chinese food lacks the spice and tang of the real deal, opting instead of sugary, corn-starch heavy sauces. While other Chinese restaurants in the vicinity of Han do a fair job of approximating authentic dishes, Han is the best at capturing the authentic flavor while not drowning its dishes in oil.

The strength of Han is based on its outstanding head chef, who makes ordinary Chinese restaurant staples with flair and excellence. Although Han advertises itself as a kebab place (and the kebabs are really good, and if you've ever eaten chuanr off a grill at midnight in a back alley in Beijing, you'll agree with me), it's best experienced as a northern Chinese restaurant that also serves kebabs. And yes, the kebabs are heavily spiced. If you just want grilled meat, please tell them so, because in China, they pour the spice on with great enthusiasm.

I personally recommend the Dandan Noodles (dandan mian), the spicy string beans (ganbian sijidou) and the Sliced Pork in Garlic Sauce (yuxiang rousi). But everything is good - I haven't had a bad dish here.

Service is prompt and friendly. Prices are very reasonable. Clean and simple decor with adequate parking. Highly recommended.
