NKHvmp19c6wrm0dZXcLtmQ Mmm this place is a decent place to grab a bite, drinks or dessert. A huge pro is that this place is opened till pretty late but it gets really busy so it's hard to find a table - especially if you have a big group of people. I've been here a few times and never sure of what I want to order. The Japanese fries and popcorn chicken here taste pretty good. I ordered Cheung fun for the first time and I'm surprised that it tasted pretty good. Soy sauce/salt could be reduced a little bit and have more peanut sauce on it (bomb sauce). This was a pretty big portion for me and I couldn't finish it (only thing I got so after a while I guess the taste for boring?). I got a honey green tea cold drink and it tasted alright. Wish it was a little sweeter. 

The ordering of serving was really weird. Someone had ordered dessert and a meal. They brought out the dessert first.. before the meal? We asked them to take it back and bring it out after the meal was done. 

I prob wouldn't plan to come here unless a group wanted to and it's a little bit more on the pricy side. There are other Taiwanese joints I would rather go to.
