e88VWa9xdHmSFdMZne9eLQ After coming back here for the pho (Vietnamese noodles), I have to upgrade the rating to 4.5 stars, or basically rounded up to 5.

Hungover after a night a the bars, the gf recommended grabbing pho at Mandarin Wok. I never even knew that this super-Chinese restaurant would offer Vietnamese noodles, let alone if it was authentic or not.

Surprise. Surprise.

The pho was EXCELLENT. Far exceeding the likes of legitimate Vietnamese establishments in the Champaign-Urbana area. I would venture to say that it rivals the pho I get back home in the San Francisco Bay Area, but that's probably because my pho-addicted brain craves any substitute.. although the Yelper in me looks for quality and authenticity :]

Soup base was flavorful, noodles chewy, meat offering varied and delicious. And they even bring the bean sprouts, herbs, and jalapeno slices.

You will not be disappointed coming here for a hot steaming bowl of pho. If you've never had pho in your life, consider trying it at Mandarin Wok a first step to something incredible.

*Caveat*: only order the beef pho, as according to another Yelper the seafood pho is whack.
