bsjBLLHR4TMVR5eAeLAI9w if you're in Montreal and want stellar Hong Kong Chinese food in Chinatown, go to La Maison Kam Fung.  I came here with my parents for dinner and it was the best Cantonese food they've had since leaving Hong Kong for Boston in 1983.  We feasted but the lobster dishes were most memorable - one was ginger and shallot and the other was spicy salt & pepper.  I don't think I have ever seen my parents so happy.  We always talk about how on our next trip here we will have dim sum and dinner here every day.  Now that Montreal is on Yelp, that return trip may be sooner than later.
