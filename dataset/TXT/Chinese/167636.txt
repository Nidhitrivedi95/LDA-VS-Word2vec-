ViFDeMpfxe0EdIgOhX48Kw I also should have read the reviews before eating here. Not that I had fantastically high expectations for convention center food, but this falls way below even bare minimum standards.  This was so bad it made me sign up for Yelp just to review it. I even hear the employees describing the food as "awful" after a customer left. Nasty, slimy, tasteless chicken. Tiny scoop of fried rice. Tastes like freezer burn everywhere. I know convention center food places will have higher prices but $5 for a soda??  "Foul" is the best description. Avoid at all costs.

Staff was also rude and snippy. The first employee had no idea about the menu options (hint: there's only one $10 abomination) and the second seemed to delight in saying "no, we don't offer cups for water" and "no, we don't offer bags" and "$5 for a soda..yeah I don't blame you, I wouldn't pay that much either."  Horrible.
