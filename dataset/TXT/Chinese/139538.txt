Dim sum was outstanding; my family and I technically had stayed in Toronto for 4 days and we had dim sum over here twice already!  Yes, it was that good!  Presented with a wide variety of dim sum, savory and sweet, from the steamed buns to baked sago pudding dessert, wish I had more room in the stomach!  Dinner was not super duper but prices were reasonable and foods were not bad at all.
