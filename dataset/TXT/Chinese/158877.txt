U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ I was writing my first review while I was waiting for my order. Here is the latest, and most updated one.

It's only my second time here. The first time, my friend treat me for some shaved ice. I LOVED it because she asked for extra milk and even told us that if we need more, all we need is ask.

I tried it the second time, by myself, and ordered the same exact thing. I asked for extra milk, and they gave me just a little. The second time I ask, the guy gave me a small platter of nothing but condensed milk. He told me that it's $.50 extra! I was like WTF!

I was expecting the same experience I had the first time, that's why I came back. But since they're very shady, I WONT be coming back no more! 

What a shame.
