u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ My bro swears by this place and every time they go to LV, they always make a pit-stop to KJ Kitchen. I never knew LV had a Chinatown. LV's Chinatown is different - it's actually CLEAN!

This is a pretty big restaurant and a lot of people frequent this establishment. I saw a lot of Chinese patrons eating here which is definitely a good sign.

Our party ordered the following:
-Shrimp with Lobster Sauce ($12)
-Sweet and Sour Pork ($8)
-Lo-Mein House Special ($9)
-Beef with Chinese Broccoli ($8)

The food was descent for the prices. I did find the food to be super greasy. I needed to drink a lot of water and green tea to coat the stomach. The portions were generous and we had leftovers, which we couldn't bring with us. 

Service was good and attentive, and by the time we left, there was a line out the door. 

This place was far from the strip. So if you feel like local Asian food, come to Chinatown.
