FDl-B4kuvpAsY8QPgXwQAA This place is TERRIBLE. The food is extemely salty, looks thrown together and worst of all they don't even use lo mein noodles. They give you SPAGHETTI NOODLES. Is this an Asian carry out or Italian? Why are you using spaghetti pasta noodles? Very unauthentic. The shrimp tastes extra fishy as if it weren't fresh. I will never step foot back in this place. Spend your money elsewhere. The fact that there were like 8 workers in the back and they served me this trash is mind boggling.
