IFXL6wMLBgBSGSiLBjtViA Tips is including your bill. Be careful to pay double tips, they don't mention the bill is included tips. I don't recommend this place.
Because vegetables are not fresh( it was terrible) tofu and noodles are still ok. Service was terrible,too. I went to the cashier to get water. And Everytime when we needed something, we went to find the waiter( just one waiter there is and he was not attentive) 

I strongly recommend do not come here,
You are better to go somewhere which is worth to spend your money.

I will never come back this place again!!
