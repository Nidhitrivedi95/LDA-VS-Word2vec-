AEYNihHmGIjmUciRFo3qwA All I can say is don't judge a book by its cover ...  This is a family owned and run place where the food is inexpensive but every dish is fresh, delishious! & flavorful. 

Their sauces are amazingly scrumptious. Yin's has to be my all-time favorite Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. I mean I know good Chinese food when I have it and considering the options available in Phoenix this is one of the better Chinese restaurants period.

They take standard dishes and add high-end ingredients and interesting flavors. They are very consistent (never had a bad meal). All the dishes are wonderful, you can't go wrong with anything.  Particularly good is their Wor Wonton Soup.

FOOD:  The food is always consistent (never had a bad meal). The food is superb!PRICE: The price was also quite reasonable. SERVICE:  the service has always been great  prompt, polite, and attentive.  AMBIENCE:  Just right for the neighborhood. The interior is rather standard Chinese restaurant fare, so nothing special there. CONCLUSION: I would highly recommend this place.
