You can call in your order or order online like I do. Compared to other places that offer curbside Chang's has it down. I'm never left waiting passed the promised pick up time and the person bringing out the food is courteous and goes over the whole order ensuring it's all there. 

The pork fried dumplings are super bomb. Great flavor and highly addicting. Chicken lettuce wraps from here are some of the best I've had. I change up between a few different beef dishes but it's always something spicy, beefy, tasty, and over white rice. The portions are good and vary like price depending if it's from the lunch or dinner menu.
