Quite simply, this was one of the most tasteless meals of my life.  I had to salt my food and put some of the hot peppers from the jar on my food to get some flavour.  

Hot and sour soup:  It was very bland and not spicy at all, although it did have a few shrimp.  Even the Mandarin, now when you go to a Chinese buffet, many of the items are compromised, their hot and sour soup was much better.  

Sea bass: boring

Noodle dish:  boring

Sichuan chicken:  also boring.  Now, you would think that anything Sichuan would be hot and spicy.  This was not.  

As another person on restaurantica put it perfectly, "Overall though the dishes lacked a bit of flavour punch, as we found every dish to be somewhat bland overall in flavour."
