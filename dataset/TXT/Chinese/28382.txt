8LUKD_9rkJoUIIuT9uiDbA The Chinese and Thai food is good for the price. This restaurant is byob with $3 cork fee. Meat is fresh. The sushi is only ok. I had an ocean roll and dragon roll. Dragon was good but I didn't like the ocean roll. Salmon in ocean roll didn't taste as fresh so I didn't eat it; I can be picky. Ichiban has way better sushi. I would go back here though because of good Chinese and thai food plus you can bring your own alcohol. Go elsewhere for sushi.
