Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ I've been to quite a few dim sums, and I want to say that my faves are usually based on taste, price, and service. This place does the job, but it's not my first choice. 

We came in a group of 8, so I got to try a lot of different items. I was a bit disappointed that the radish cakes didn't come out hot and freshly fried. Some of he dishes had been microwaved, and even had Saran Wrap over the plate, which they removed only after you pick it. 

The wait was only 5 minutes on a Sunday at 11am, so I think that's pretty good. I'm not sure if there was a standout item for me. Oh, the chives dumplings that are round and flat were my favorite. 

Food comes out quick. We were bunch of fatties with eyes bigger than our stomach, so by the end, htere was enough leftover to create a combo dim sum meal for dinner. 

The price came out to $28/pp after tax and tip. I believe gratuity was included as we were a party of 8. Never seen a $240 bill at dim sum before, but there's always a first for everything. 

Good note: this place has dim sum ALL DAY
