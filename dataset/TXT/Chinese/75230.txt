fvnaLCkyIyCw7vQuO8-H3g Don't go here unless you are Chinese. I honestly felt racially discriminated by the staff/servers. The restaurant was empty when I arrived and they completely ignored me and my family most of the time we were there. They insisted we sit in the back corner of the restaurant and every time I needed something I had to get up and ask and even then, they did not bring me what I asked for. I had to ask 3 times to get water, each time, having to get out of my seat to ask. I had to ask multiple times for spoons for the soup they served us for 4 and only had 2 spoons at the table. They also forgot to bring our rice and we waited 20 mins while our other dishes got cold before we received our rice. I have to say this was the absolute worst dining experience I have ever had. I hate to use the racial card but I honestly have no other explanation for the poor service. I watched quietly as they attended to other tables and blatantly ignored my requests for water, spoons etc.
