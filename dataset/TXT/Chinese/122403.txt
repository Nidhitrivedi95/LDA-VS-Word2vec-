OgwN65jZebPRIPSmNpRP7A A pleasant find in downtown Middleton. I was craving noodles and hand made noodles are very difficult to find; even more so in Wisconsin.
These are fantastic. I was looking for the dim sum but it got lost in translation; next time ask for pot stickers. I had the Taigu spicy pan fried noodle lunch special. You get the option of a soda or 2 baby egg rolls. I opted for the 2 egg rolls and burned my fingers on them. They were pretty standard with cabbage inside. The noodles were a little bit chewy to the tooth and flavorful. I would have liked them to be a little more spicy. There wasn't enough burn or kick to make me sweat.
Overall, a great lunch spot and I was full half way through my plate... that or I was tired from chewing.
Definitely a great addition to downtown.
