ruHEkBY2ysclSFIcai4tfg Possibly the worst Chinese food I've had in a longgggg time.  Since I live in Scarborough, there is no shortage of decent Chinese places to choose from and last night, after a botched curry attempt, I decided to order Chinese take out and try out a new place.  We normally order from SS Kitchen which is always good but I thought it may be a good idea to try somewhere new and have a back up delivery joint.  And boy, was that a mistake.  

I ordered YangChow Fried Rice, Shrimp with lobster sauce, Chicken Soo Gai and Singapore noodles.  The delivery order came to a little over $42 (which is on the pricey side given the quality and portion sizes).

All the ingredients (shrimp, bbq pork, etc) in fried rice were bland and the rice, not quite "fried" enough, leaving chewy lumps of rice packed into a tiny takeout container.  Shrimp with lobster sauce was a mixture of unbalanced black bean sauce wasn't and egg and the sauce tasted bitter in some bites.  Singapore noodles certainly looked the part but had seasoning issues again and last but not least, their chicken Soo Gai clearly reflected the restaurant's attempt to stretch one chicken breast to appear as many pieces, as the chicken pieces were sliced, pounded and dunked in huge amount of batter before being fried in what tasted like old oil.  Funny enough, the thinly sliced and pounded chicken breast pieces were so tough to chew and barely edible in a coating of old-oil-soaked batter, the horrifying reality of the Soo Gai sauce (they call it a mushroom gravy.  Is that even Chinese???) was almost an after thought.  

It's amazing how some places can stay in business this way.  I certainly wouldn't be picking up the phone to call them again.
