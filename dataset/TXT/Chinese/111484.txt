m9iqRUgclcsQs-z8c2FTeA I went to Suddenly Slimmer to get a massage. The massage was good, the service was TERRIBLE. My masseuse told me to tell the girls at the front to give me the introductory price, which is about $69 for a one hour, rather than $95. When I told the receptionist, she gladly said yes, and took my credit card. When she handed me my receipt, I noticed that I had been charged $105, which is the intro price for a 90min massage. A simple mistake, so I thought. When I told her that she had charged me for a 90min, and I had only had a 60min, she informed me that she would have to call down her manager to refund the $35. I said that was fine and she went to get the manager, came back a couple minutes later to tell me that the manager was in the middle of something, and that I would have to wait a little bit. Again, I said alright, and sat down. After 45mins of waiting, I couldn't stay any longer, and asked if I could take care of this the next day. She said of course, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. When I came in the next day I found out that there had not been a manager on the previous day, she had been sick. Then when I asked for my refund, it took about an hour and I was only able to get credit for the spa.

I am absolutely appalled at the service at Suddenly Slimmer, and clearly, so is everyone else. I would give this place only one star if it wasn't for the good (not great, but good) massage.
