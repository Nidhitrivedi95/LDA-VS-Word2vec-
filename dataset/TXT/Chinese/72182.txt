FfbBQZ85mWHEjQNzphcvKw What do you call those days in between Christmas and New Year? Is there a name for them? Whatever they're called, I doubt anyone can really be bothered cooking and so the hunt for an excellent takeaway is on!

Now, it probably says something about how good Silver Bowl is that my sister ate from here two nights in a row.  The second night, my boyfriend and I joined in on her recommendation.  Unsure of what to have, partly caused by my reluctance to order Green Curry (I make this all the time at home) meant we ended up playing it safe and choosing to share some Pad Thai and Green Curry between the two of us, with my sister going for the prawn Pad.  And we threw in a starter platter too.

The food took about an hour to arrive, longer than we'd have liked, but not so long to warrant a complaint.  When it arrived we were delighted by the very generous portions.  So big were they that we couldn't finish!  The Green Curry was delicious, although bear in mind it is also fairly hot.  The Pad Thai was huge!  And really tasty.  But I was so full from eating the curry (we'd ordered rice to accompany), as was my boyfriend, that I'm afraid we ended up wasting about 1/3 of it.  I reckon you could easily share it, throw in a starter, and be satisfied.

Our order - starter selection, prawn Pad Thai, chicken Pad Thai, chicken Green Curry, rice and garlic noodles - came to just over £40, so really very reasonable.

I can see us ordering from here again!
