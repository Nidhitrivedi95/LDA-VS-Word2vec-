$1.99 bottles of Heineken 
$1.49 bottles of Bud Light 

ALL DAY, EVERY DAY! Craziness! 
Panda may not have a happy hour, but with prices like that it seems like it would be happy all the time! 

As if that wasn't enough reason to get you there, the food is pretty good. At first I thought maybe they just got all their customers drunk so the food didn't matter . . . luckily, this is not the case. Panda does not use MSG and has brown rice as an option. Include the fact this place is within walking distance from my house and I am even convincing myself more and more that I need to go there more often, not just all of you. 

The few times I have been, there have only been a few other people in the restaurant so the wait staff is ready and waiting to fulfill your every request. The few times we sat at the bar, the bartender has been very friendly, yet knew when to give us our space as well. Seeing as how there are a total of six seats at the bar, that is a good skill to have. The restaurant is a little small and there isn't much to say about the (lack of) atmosphere. All of that is the reason I am a little leery to give four stars, but right now they are at 3.5 ish. 

Advertisement boasts "We serve Dim Sum! Made to Order." I haven't tried it, but now that I know it is an option, I'll have to add that to the to-do list for my next visit.
