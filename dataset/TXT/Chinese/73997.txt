FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ Great Dim Sum. One of the best I've had. It is on the high end of Dim Sum with the prices. There is special pricing for S M L items if you go before 11am M-F at the moment (for the opening).  The food is dim sum with a modern twist. There are no trolleys in this place. The service was a little slow. It took an hour for all our food to come. We ordered 7 items.
