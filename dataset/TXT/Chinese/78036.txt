After the generous offer from Ajay for 2 free bowls we went back to Genghis Grill for dinner tonight. This time we actually ate in the restaurant instead of doing take out. This is probably the best way to experience the food. You get a table, take a card and go stand in the buffet line. You tell the person which size bowl you want and then fill it up yourself. This way there is no confusion on what you want in your bowl and you get to choose the amounts of each ingredient. I got a regular size and stocked up on chili beef, cabbage, mushrooms, onions, spinach. Then take your tray to the cook station and choose your side, fried rice in my case, and they cook it up for you. The flavors were again wonderful and of course even better since I got everything I wanted this time. The wait staff were friendly and attentive, although maybe a quick run down of the ordering process would make it less awkward for those who haven't been there before. Also, try the Coconut Honey Fizz, it goes great with a spicy bowl.
A few thoughts on the process, nothing to the restaurant itself. A menu with the choices that you can look or maybe even fill out before going to the line would be helpful so your not standing there trying to make a choice and holding up the other diners. It would also be nice if the vegetables were first then the protein; only because veg tend to take up a lot of space in the bowl but then cook down significantly and it would be easier to stack meat on top of them and still get a decent amount of each. 
I'll go back again, but definitely sticking with making my own bowl instead of online ordering.
