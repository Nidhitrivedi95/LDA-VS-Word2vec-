1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA The 3 stars is mainly for the service which was amusingly bad (we were literally laughing at how bad it was.) But the food was actually really good and probably the cheapest authentic chinese food I've had in a while. Horrible service, but its just down the street from me so we'll most likely be back.
