OW9CcNpg336qpnnJr-bIUQ Well we went here instead of sunset station buffet. The dinner price went up to 12 dollars. And I remember this place being packed even with the casino buffet across the street. Well the quality of the food is ok. It used to be better. The sushi was fresh. Didn't have Mongolian off the grill this time but previous visits it was good. I guess it's called lucky star out front but Yelp pulls up China star buffet.
The ice cream machine was out of order. The fried rice and chow mein was on Saran wrap in the hot tray. The chicken skewers were decent. Same with the broccoli beef and orange and sesame chicken. Nothing stood out and was memorable. The donuts had been out forever and were hard as a rock. I'm surprised its still hanging on. I'd pass on this one.
