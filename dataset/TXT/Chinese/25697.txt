7fiRVsawDX0vCpoMTbbxcQ I cannot imagine this place will be in business much longer. My husband and I ordered an inedible mess of Chinese vegetables and moo goo gai pan. My veggies were 90% napa cabbage. They should have called it Chinese vegetable. The sauce was orange water--no flavor whatsoever. His food was equally bland and awful. 

When we called to complain, the owner showed no signs of caring. 

We've lived in Fairview for nearly 13 years and I'd say the first ten years or so, they were fine. Quality and customer service has totally gone off the rails. We will never be going back.
