I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Well I was a little nervous to try this whole boba thing but now I'm hooked! The honeydew was a bit too sweet for me but almond milk tea is right up my alley. Next on my list is the red velvet snoh. I may even venture out to having some red bean or rainbow jelly toppings! Hooked for sure
