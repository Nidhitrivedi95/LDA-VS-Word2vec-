zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ So i came back to Momofuku tonight, this time just for the ramen.  I held off on posting my review of Daisho until i had eaten at the noodle bar just to make sure that I was being fair.  And I totally was...

Adding to the explosion of ramen bars in Toronto, we come here to the legendary Momofuku to see if its worthy of the fame that its New York location has spread.   Having gone there this summer, i was excited to try this local branch.  Delicious as it was in New York, I did find the broth too salty for my taste but was blown away by the pork buns and the mushroom buns.  

Lucky us, Momofuku delivers some of the same goodness.  I opted for the namesake ramen which comes in a shoyu (soya sauce) broth rather than the more common and fattier tonkotsu (pork bone) broth.  Perfectly poached egg perched atop a bed of noodles and surrounded by two pieces of pork belly, nori, a dollop of a spicy sweet sauce, green onions, some kimchi.  Flavourful and not too salty, the noodles had the right amount of bite and that gorgeous egg oozed its yolky goodness.    

I won't claim that this is the best bowl of ramen ever but I'd say it was pretty darn tasty and definitely worth a return visit should you be passing by.
