safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg this is the best all you can eat buffet because the food is nice and it is also $6 and that is so great except the food is only okay but if you want something delicious then you should just spend $6 on the buffet and get a ton of chicken wings because the chicken is really crispy and juicy it is the perfect chicken balance except it's deep fried a lot like it is fried chicken so when you bite it for the first time it will burn your mouth because of the oil and after like your nineteenth chicken wing that might become dangerous I mean my nineteenth chicken wing was not dangerous but I am an experienced professional also they have this thing called egg foo young it is so good and it has this gravy sauce and sometimes the egg rolls are burnt but I don't really like egg rolls anyway and I don't know anyone who does

it is pretty dark inside so you will probably get a lot of food on your shirt but that's okay because they have napkins for you and cold water to dab the napkins in and no on will ever call you a rude name like white trash or slob

there is a lot of good chinese to eat here so you should get everything and chicken
