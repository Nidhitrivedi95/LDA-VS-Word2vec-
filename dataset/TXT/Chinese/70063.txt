f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ Been to this place so many times now and I'm so happy I finally got pictures of their food! I think this is one of the best places for dim sum compared to the other places I've tried here in Las Vegas.

The restaurant is nice and clean, staff are friendly but the ones that push the cart for the food are always in a rush. 

My sibling and I got our regular food from dim sum and it was nice and warm, not cold like other places. 

All in all, for sure I will be back to eat here as I've been eating here for about 5 or 6 times now! Delicious, fresh and there are many ladies pushing the cart around to get all your food!
