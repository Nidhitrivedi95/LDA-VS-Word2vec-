F06m2yQSPHIrb1IT7heYeQ A Cantonese restaurant on the southwest side of town - what a treat! Rainbow Kitchen is a no-frills, non-trendy traditional Chinese restaurant. The staff was pleasant and helpful. I can see myself becoming a regular here.

Post-election day comfort food:
-Beef Pan-Fried Noodles
-Salted Fish, Chicken & Tofu Clay Pot
-Beef w/ Black Bean Sauce

I called in the order and picked it up 15 minutes later. Looks like deli items sell out fast - they ran out of crispy roast pork by 12:30PM. Everything was delicious and on par with Cantonese restaurants on Spring Mountain. The beef with black bean sauce is especially good - tender chunks of cubed beef stir fried with peppers & onions. I will definitely be back to try the ong choy, steamed fish, & sea bass clay pot.
