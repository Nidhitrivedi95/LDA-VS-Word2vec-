TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA No acknowledgement for 10 min. I am literally standing at the front while I am typing this and waitresses keep walking by not even saying a word. How can you make eye contact with someone who is standing at the front of your restaurant and not say anything! It's not even busy.

Finally got acknowledged. 15 minutes later. What in the world...
