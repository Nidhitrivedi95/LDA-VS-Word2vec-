TSGBM2z5BTeJvYQAznz8Fg I first tried Jogoya with some friends and decided to return again later that same week with my family because it was so good. The first thing I noticed was how beautifully the restaurant was designed. It is very welcoming and the staff are just wonderful. I really enjoyed dining here and I think it would be a great place to take a small or large groups of family/friends. 

The buffet boasts a large variety of Asian entrees, including crowd favorites like orange chicken, crab legs and even some dishes you only see at a dim sum. It also has a Mongolian style grill, a sushi and sashimi bar, fruits, cake and ice cream, and even a chocolate fountain! What really impressed me was the quality and selection of sushi and sashimi. I don't usually see yellowtail served at other buffets, which I was able to really enjoy here. I would say that Jogoya is second to none as far as a local seafood buffet.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed dining at Jogoya. It has become my new favorite place for dinner with friends and the prices are very reasonable as well. I will definitely be coming back very soon!
