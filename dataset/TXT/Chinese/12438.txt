2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w We just moved here and we're looking for a good Chinese place, After reading the amazing reviews (and the few that weren't good who I'm convinced were at a different restaurant), we decided to give it a try! This is our new favorite place to eat. The service is amazing. Everyone seems to get along and the atmosphere is great. The food was SO fresh and it didn't take all day to get it. We will definitely be back. The prices are great as well, very reasonable and you get a ton of food.
