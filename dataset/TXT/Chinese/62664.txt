dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw My dad has complained many times why we don't go to Chinatown when we visit Vegas so this time I said fine, let's eat there.  I've never heard of "wun nam" cuisine but apparently it's part of Szechuan if I'm not mistaken.  Anyway we got their special noodles which they are famous for.  It's pretty good, has a similar taste to pho mainly because of the broth and the cilantro.  It was better than I expected but the smoked duck had too much smokiness flavor for me.I wouldn't mind coming back and grabbing some noodles but I won't be going out of my way to eat here.
