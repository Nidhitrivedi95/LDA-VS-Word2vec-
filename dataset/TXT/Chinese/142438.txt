RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg Felt rushed in ordering and judged for what I was ordering by the waitress mentioning "that's a lot of food". She didn't even ask for anything else then walked away. I was going to order more food. What does it matter how much food I order? 

Ps. Stick to the Chinese food. I come here mainly for the crispy pan fried noodles and honey walnut shrimp. Portion sizes are large and great for sharing!
