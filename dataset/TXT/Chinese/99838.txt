JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA What an awesome restaurant to enjoy some time with friends or family! The vegetable items are fresh and they have a huge selection. The board of flavors has some wonderful selections and I would recommend the teriyaki sauce flavors. Don't forget the customer service is great! We will continue to drive 40 minutes to this place.
