Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw This used to be my favorite Chinese food place. We even ordered there on Christmas last year.  I went here tonight and waited a good 45 mins for my food. The people in front of me and to the left me got their food before us. We waited :45 mins and my son kept complaining he was hungry. At the :45 min mark I asked to cancel my order so I could feed my son elsewhere. Granted, they were busy but why are the orders being served out of order? When the owner came and asked why we can't wait longer. I said my son was hungry. She said just, "ok" no sorry... Nothing. So, we were leaving, a rude lady to the right of me said, "they didn't wait that long." The OWNER replied with, "oh American restaurant, 2 hour wait, no complaints." WOW! You had loyal customers- not anymore!!
