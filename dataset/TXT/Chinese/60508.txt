dnNjNkcYSjFudOLcOFkxlg This is truly a Chinese fusion restaurant.  It is one of the biggest of its type.  Once walked in, there is a large foyer and a waiting area with lot of seats.  The price is not expensive.  You can pick whatever type of food in the menu - Hong Kong café style, noodle, congee, entrees, bubble tea, dessert, and BBQ pork/duck/chicken.  So each of you can order your own type.

We try the    which is ok.  The broiled pork rice and the fried bean with shredded pork are tasty.  The best is the BBQ pork wrapped in steamed bun.  The desserts which we did not order look so so in the display shelf.

This is the restaurant that you can come before you decide what you want to eat!
