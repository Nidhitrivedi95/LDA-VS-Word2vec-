jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg Great place for late night need for Chinese food. They're open til 3am so after a long day, they're my version of comfort food.  I love their schezuan (sp?) shrimp with onions and their chow fun and lo mein dishes.  My fave appetizer to get is the jellyfish with pickled carrots.  The service is better than your hardcore Chinese restaurant where the server doesn't smile and just asks you what you want but not much better.  Food comes out hot and fast, just the way it should.  They must have a buffet or something at night since I see the layout against the fish tanks but I always order from the menu.  The menu does have a mixture of what I like to call Real Chinese and American Chinese dishes so it will appeal to those who order egg rolls and pork fried rice (you know who you are) and those of us who do not.  

I minus one star for the fact that the bathrooms are sketchy and dirty bathrooms at restaurants freak me out because I wonder what the kitchen looks like.
