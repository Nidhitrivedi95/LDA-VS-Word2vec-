EHKzu5r2NEz5Zq2R84J4ow Simply the best Asian food around. Family owned and operated. Bruce and his family are always there to make sure your dining experience is the best it can be. Moderately priced and above average food from your typical General Tso to a more traditional tastes like Sun Bay Jee (3 cup chicken) hot pots for you to choose from. They also have sushi available. Some standards along with some of their unique rolls you can't miss are; Pink Lady (my favorite), Black & Gold, Sex on the Beach, etc. We have been going here for years and have never been disappointed. Some of our favorties are Sun Bay Jee, Tokyo Steak, Pad Thai, Egg Foo Yung, Garlic String Beans, and the Amazing Chicken is just that, Amazing! They do have take out and the lunch specials can't be beat with the lunch boxes and prices. Just go and enjoy!
