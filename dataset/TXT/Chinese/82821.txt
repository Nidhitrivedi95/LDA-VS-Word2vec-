hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q In a nutshell: authentic Chinese noodles made in-house. Assortment of dumplings too. 

I've been here several times and I can't say I'm entirely impressed. Although it's neat to watch the cooks make the noodles right in front of you, they seem to use the same dough for everything on their menu, which makes it easy for them to offer such a variety. However, everything I've tried just seems to taste the same because they use that same dough for everything. If you get one dumpling, you've tried them all. I've tried the potstickers, soup dumplings and pan-fried dumplings. They taste the same, just depends if you're in the mood for fried and crispy or steamed and soggy. In terms of noodles, of course the broths and toppings change the flavor but something about the ones I've tried are still so similar. I've tried the Dan tsu, Dan Dan and spicy wonton. Of the three, I like the spicy wonton most. Dan tsu has a strong 5 spice flavor and Dan Dan, I'm not a fan. Their Dan Dan noodles have a strong peanut butter taste and although that's a key ingredient, I don't think it should overpower all the other flavors. 

However, I do like the bubble teas. Their bubble teas aren't overly sweetened and I like that you have the option of getting an additional topping other than tapioca. They have grass jelly and red bean which I haven't seen at many other bubble tea places. 

All in all, the food is decent but I wish there was more a variety of flavors. I will continue to try new dishes each time, seeking for something that stands out from the rest of the menu.
