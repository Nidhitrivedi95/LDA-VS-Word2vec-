rkVTKhUDO-VtrIu8esB75g This place is just in a little food court in Caesars Palace. I wasn't excepting much but with the hangover I had the bowl of udon was delicious and exactly what I needed. I opted to get the combo (udon + sushi) because I was starving but the sushi was not good. Definitely not worth getting.
