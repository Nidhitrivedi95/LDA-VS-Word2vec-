sfd19Wo_7g2TwaoJmA9B8A This place used to be somewhere that I would eat every few months, but after my last visit I will never be coming back. I ordered the Home Style Bean Curd and about halfway through my meal I noticed something that looked like a bug on a piece of cabbage. Upon further inspection I discovered that it was a CENTIPEDE. I had never wished so badly that I had just found a hair in my food. I called the server over and he apologized and informed me that sometimes they have them in their cabbage and the kitchen must have missed this one. WHAT?!?! They removed the dish from the bill, but that was the extent of it. My date didn't finish his meal either because he was so horrified. Yuck.
