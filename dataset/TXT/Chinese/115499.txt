n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A I was there for a work dinner party. We let the waiter choose our entire menu which was refreshing. The service was outstanding. The food could be described as very good. We had the duck & a bunch of other stuff. Everyone appeared to enjoy it.  
It is expensive, like everything in Vegas. However, since I let the waiter pick the entire dinner without even looking at the menu, I was afraid I'd get crushed worse than I did. With multiple drinks, we were just shy of $900 including tip for 6 people. 
Oh yeah, the ceiling moves.  Whatever.
