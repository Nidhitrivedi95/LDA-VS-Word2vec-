vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw If this is best Chinese in Las Vegas, I guess I will have to put up with mediocre local chinese until I get back to northern California.  We weren't put off by the rude and contemptuous waiters -- that's the way most of them are to gaijin in Chinatowns.  But we do need more than a minute to peruse a new menu.  We ended up with Potstickers, Sichuan Shrimp, Salt and Pepper Pork Chops and Beef Chow Fun.  I would have liked some more vegetables, but there was no eggplant or green beans on the menu.  Just a lot of Tofu and mysterious mixed vegetables.  Although the food was good, none of it was outstanding.  Certainly not worth driving all the way across town for.

But the real mystery of this restaurant is WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE PLATES?  We were given one tea cup (no water) and one saucer.  A saucer?  We kept waiting for plates, but none ever appeared.  My husband grabbed a couple of saucers and cups from the table next door.  But regardless there was a lot of spillage as we tried to balance any thing else on the saucer besides a spoonful of rice.  Yes, you can eat directly off the serving plates, but that too is pretty messy.  I was feeling rather embarrassed about the state of the pink tablecloth until the waiter started removing dishes and spilled the saucer of potsticker sauce over the table.  Yeah, I had to tackle him in the back hallway to get the check.  Plenty of food there, rather tasty, but nothing worth going back for.
