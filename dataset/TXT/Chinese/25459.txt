7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA My husband and I stopped here one day to try out a new Chinese place in the area than our usual places. The place looks really nice inside and they have a pretty broad selection on their menu. My husband and I ordered off the American menu. I got the chicken and broccoli and my husband ordered general tso's. 

The food was delicious! The portions were just right and for the price you could save half your meal for lunch the next day.

The service is the only part of my issue with the restaurant. The waitress was very friendly and nice but not attentive. But it wasn't only her, other tables I could see were frustrated with their waitresses as well. Ours didn't refill our glasses of water, which I feel is pretty important, nor did she do the one time "check in" to see how the food was. She along with the other two waitresses were gone half the time and the restaurant wasn't even that packed with people.

If we were to eat here again, we would only get take out because we sat around for half an hour just waiting.
