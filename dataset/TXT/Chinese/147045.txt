s9zNmeJIu83WVL56QNLD2A Love this location because the employees know how to fill the plate and make sure you get what you pay for -- no skimpy portions here! The food is typical Panda fare but it's usually pretty fresh as they cook all day long. The employees are friendly and there's a drive-thru which is super nice. And the bathrooms and dining room are clean. No complaints.
