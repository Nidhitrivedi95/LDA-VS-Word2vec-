zTJg9_VFyXiQQ0PegucaJg Tried to order delivery.  The food was 45 minutes late and cold.  The mu shu pork came with flour tortillas, and only contained approximately 2% pork.  I haven't had the heart to dig into the steamed rice yet, but I'm curious as to how they're going to fuck that up.

Even no Chinese food would be better than this.  :P

(Oh, and when I called to see when the food would arrive, the person answering the phone was unhelpful, and unapologetic.)

(Further updates: The rice was adequate, the hot and sour soup resembled luke-warm vinegar, the general tao chicken was mushy (though the sauce was okay), the spring rolls were cold, soft instead of crispy, and undercooked, and finally the beef ho fun had decent noodles but overcooked beef.  I stand by my original statement of prefering to eat nothing as opposed to having this again.)
