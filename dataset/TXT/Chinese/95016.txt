jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg My family took me to this restaurant while we were visiting in Vegas. The food was great! You have to try their roasted duck! Our food was brought out quick. The place seem very clean and nice, but it was a bit small. 

On the bad side, when we came the host told us we only had an hour to eat since all the table were already reserved. The waiter rushed us to order and took our food away when we weren't even done yet. And the table right next to use was extremely loud. 

But other than that I DO recommend this place, but make reservations ahead of time!
