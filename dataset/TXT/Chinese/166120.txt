VaLnPWq6cLnK5x2wXBVOKQ I really enjoyed having dinner at this place.  I had the fish cream pasta.  Unlike 99.99% of all Chinese restaurants in Markham that attempt to serve Western food, this place got the texture of their pasta right (El Dente)!  So I was impressed by that.  

The restaurant is quite small, so it's very difficult to get a seat without a reservation.  The prices are reasonable and food quality is good for a Chinese restaurant.
