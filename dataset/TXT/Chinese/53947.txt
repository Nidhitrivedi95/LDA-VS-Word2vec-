cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Wow is the first word that comes to mind about this place. Talk about everthing you can get in a Chinese restaurant but with a twist, there is also a Sushi bar which loved sushi is one of my fav go to fast food. By far one of the BEST  buffets i have been to in a while . I am going to sit here and enjoy this moment. While i dig my fork in a bowl of sticky rice and savor this moment.
