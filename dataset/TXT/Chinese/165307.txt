UzW_6PaLFzPjP7_2Czk3Wg I noticed this place only had one review (and one star at that!), so I HAD to write one. I don't know what "Brian S. from Austin, TX" is talking about.

When I was 2 years old, I moved to Brunswick with my parents. We ordered food from China King often while I was growing up. When I was a little bit older, we moved 25 minutes away and still made the drive about once a month just to get their food. I'm 25 now and I've lived all over the country (including California, Brian, practically the Asian food capital of America). China King is still the standard by which I judge Chinese food and every time I go home for a holiday, et cetera, we always order China King and enjoy it together as a family.

So... the food: Oh, so good. They have the best Egg Foo Young I've ever had. I had a shrimp Egg Foo Young once in New Orleans that came close (and I knew the family that owned the restaurant, so I know they were making me their best), but STILL it was not as good as China King's. 

Their General Tso's chicken is epic awesome. Other Chinese food restaurants tend to use tiny little pieces of chicken all hacked-up and gross looking. China King uses huge pieces of white meat. So much better.

Their House Wonton is perfect for a gloomy day. 

Anyway, yeah. Go to China King. I guarantee it's better than any Chinese in the area. Plus, it's a family business. I've got 25 years of China King experience and I can tell you that I've never had a bad meal there.
