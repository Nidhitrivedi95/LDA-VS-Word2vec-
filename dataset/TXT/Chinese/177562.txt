The new owners retained the chefs and the menu but decided to jack up the prices for a la carte and started offering a pricey buffet.  They also did away with the ultra popular Happy Hour which drew the crowd.  Big mistake!

Lesson 101: if you want to charge Strip pricing at a Chinatown location catering primarily to locals, you're setting yourself up for failure.  Don't let that a crowded restaurant fool you into charging higher prices for a quick profits.  Stick to your basic and you'll survive, or crash & burn like many other local restaurants in Vegas.
