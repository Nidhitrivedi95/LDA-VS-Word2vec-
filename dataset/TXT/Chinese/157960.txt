twrfUEK_7kTOLOL96oPYyw We stopped by this place today and had never gone to a build your own grill like this. Breana (not sure spelling) was such a sweet heart and showed us the ropes! The food was plentiful and yummy. We took home leftovers for what is another meal. Thank you Breana you made our experience great and we look forward to eating here more often now that we "know the ropes" lol
