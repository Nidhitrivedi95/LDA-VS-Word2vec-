ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ I am definitely a fan of the place because their authentic taste to bubble tea. 

I had their taro and it was amazing. I love the fact it has taro bits in it and they always ask me about my ice and sugar level (I feel so taken care of~) 

I only wish they had small tapioca like bubble tea republic, but then it would be too perfect!
