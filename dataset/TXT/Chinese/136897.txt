qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A Went to p.f. changs to celebrate a birthday and we were greeted by a extremely friendly and attentive gentleman named. Marcus. its a pleasure to dine places where the employees actually listen and acknowledge customers when they greet someone.  When leaving he asked how everything was and were we given birthday dessert.  We said no but its ok and joked saying can I get that to go?
He said of course it should have been offered anyways.  And he promptly placed the order to go.  I expect good service from our server, which quite honestly was subpar, considering we had two wait staff switching off at our table, Michelle and Vicky but i am writing this review for Marcus and his professionalism he showed making our celebration one to remember. By the way ordered the kung pao jimica tacos and they were delicious. I highly recommend trying them.but hope for better service next time.
