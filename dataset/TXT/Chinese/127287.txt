pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og The BEST meal I've had in a long time!!! Our waitress Liz was knowledgeable, prompt, and very, very kind! We had the Thai mussels, Tuna sushi, Mongolian beef, orange chicken,  and three different rolls. She asked if we left room for dessert (which we hadnt) but we had a birthday at the table so we went all in. It was incredible!! Everyone had a great meal and talked about the next time we would be coming back and who we would bring with us!! So So good!!!!
