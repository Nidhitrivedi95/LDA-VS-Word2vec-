pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og Kinda far from civilization, but it's all good.  Gotta eat inside the tree room!  The room is amazing - according to the waiters and one of the owner, everything was imported from oversees.  I didn't order sushi, but I did get the Hong Kong style noodles and Seafood Tofu Soup -- Mmm, yes both times hit the spot.  Aromatic and tasting at the same time -- what's not to like!  Our service was outstanding, small or a large crowd is not a problem.  Will save this place in my pocket for next time :) (Shout-out to Jay, Shane, & Stephanie!) - Enjoy
