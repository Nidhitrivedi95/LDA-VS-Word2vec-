FfmH-oEWN7K1za-o8KZQDA Love the service at this Bakery - the owners here are always ready with a smile, and recommendations for you. My favourite are the eggs tarts, which come in both the flakey crust and the cookie crust...but that flakey crust is just phenomenal, with a rich buttery taste.

It's got a nice little sitting area too, so perfect to grab an HK milk tea and eat your egg tart fresh! 

Prices are great - nice and cheap, a delish light breakfast or snack under $5.
