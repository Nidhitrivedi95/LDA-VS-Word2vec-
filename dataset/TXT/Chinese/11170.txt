2DO-8SvPvx1rACloHiD9Mw This was our first time at this restaurant.  We had carry out for four.  My wife picked up the food and she commented on how nice the staff was to her. 

We ordered 2 egg rolls, egg drop soup, General Tso's chicken, beef with snow peas, sesame chicken and chicken with cashews.  

The food was great.  Everyone was very happy with the portion sizes, quality and the nice food containers, which were very nice for left over storage.  

When we eat Chinese it will definitely be at Lotus Cafe.  We highly recommend this restaurant.
