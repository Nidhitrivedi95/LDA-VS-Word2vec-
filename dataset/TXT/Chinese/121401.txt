o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg We went there on a Monday evening hoping for a good experience and was let down. The service was spotty, an employee was going through paperwork right next to us, and the place was empty. We asked about alcohol and were given two options: red or white wine. We got white wine and it came out in tiny glasses (and was likely boxed wine). This typically wouldn't bother me, but what did was when we got the bill. They charged us almost $9 a glass for the wine! Our mediocre meal of Chicken tikka masala and biryani with wine included came out to almost $70!!!!! And the waiter initially tried to not show us the itemized receipt (we had to ask for it)! I felt used! Never again.
