pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og We've been here twice and last time we came was a good experience. But this time we came here it was an amazing experience. We came here during the lunch special which we never had. I have to say it was an amazing deal. I will defiantly come here again during lunch. 11 bucks for sushi, rice, a main entree and others. Amazing deal! The servers kept checking up and they held the door open for us when we left. Customer service was phenomenal.
