Z4MvEVylnZPW_vddQc2Ihg I came here with a bunch of the coworkers during lunch.  I've eaten at many mongolian type places before so I know  the routine.  It's an AYCE place for the Mongolian grill and they have a separate aisle that serves up your typical your Americanized Chinese food like your sweet so-wa pok and broccoli beef, egg rolls, and whatever you think of.  This place had a lot of options and shit so many sauces to try that when i got to the sauce part of the area I just stood there confused.  I didn't know what to use so I just started to pour a little bit of everything.  I still came out really good.  I had two bowls and left with a food coma.  So much for being productive for the remainder of the day.
