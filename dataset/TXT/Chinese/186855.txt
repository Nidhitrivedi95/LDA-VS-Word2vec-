yDJhScdD8cCCYfO4WNb-CQ Walked in to a quaint little place with a French name on a Chinese Board and a Hawaiin like tikki shack as their bar / cashier area. Initially I didn't have high hopes for obvious reasons but I was pleasantly surprised. There seemed to be a never ending amount of people walking in to pick up their take out orders so I guess this place is more popular for that than dine-ins. Which is understandable as it looked like they only had about 6 tables altogether. 

We ordered the Tom Yum soup, extra spicy, which I found amazing and it also tremendously helped open my sinus and taste buds for the evening. If you have a flu / cold, this is a must-try menu item on the list. You can thank me later. We also ordered the Manchu chicken and General Tao chicken and I completely agree with Sherry K. on yelp and found the General Tao chicken really good. I wasn't too fond of the Manchu chicken or the service as such but am looking forward to a trip back to this place to try their other items, perhaps their Schezwan Shrimp as a lot of people who were walking in seemed to be ordering it that day.
