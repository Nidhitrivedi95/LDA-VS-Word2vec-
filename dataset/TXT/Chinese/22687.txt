6OhahrmtLGmkUdPfaMck0A Went here last night, wasn't too busy at 630 on a Monday. This place is a guilty pleasure of mine, but my favourite dishes are probably the most unhealthy as well.

The three dishes that are a must (in my opinion) include the following:

1. Pan fried pork buns - comes with 5 per order, the buns are so soft and the undersides are pan fried making for a delicious bite

2. Green onion pancake - so crispy and full of flavour. Best I've had anywhere.

3. Pan fried pork dumplings - also comes in 5 and the undersides are perfectly fried. 

Just make sure you try everything with the red vinegar!
