DxbdfvNYPCyiLJDDPJK3Tg I ordered delivery so I didn't have the opportunity to dine in and check out the customer service but from what I gather, the delivery guy was really polite and smiling lots when he delivered. I got variations of fried rice and all were pretty good. You get a solid amount of food for what you're paying. The food taste really good and the price wasn't too bad. I'd definitely order from here again
