I6oxEn1HT41S2GPrDKPPvA This is my staple place to eat whenever its pass midnight and I need to have a nice fill. I have been here with my gf as many times or more like Roger Federer making it to the finals of a Grand Slam! 

Their wait time for dim sum is crazy loooonnggg, but they do have quite a variety of selection for it to make up the wait. Plus its not too bad in price...$1.70 per dish, unless you go special on them. I would say their staple dish that really is consistent and really good compared to other places is their 'Siu Mai'. I dunno why, but its just really good when I splash it in their chili sauce paste!

Whenever I come to eat late-night supper here, we would order the siu mai, eggplant, beancurd oyster skin, ha-gau, and steam oyster with garlic or black bean sauce.

Sometimes we'll try their rice noodle with chicken and pepper on black bean sauce...This one can get quite filling for two ppl. We also get their sizzling scallop with egg tofu! This one is for tofu lover's who likes diff texture and taste of tofu.

We also try the 'Dau Miu' which is steam veggie with garlic, or the scrambled egg with shrimp...

Luckily for me so far, I have not experienced getting flies or bugs on my food like other fellow Yelpers...

Pro of coming here to eat:
1) 24hrs
2) Not too expensive on price for food
3) Close to my area in scarb

Con of coming here to eat:
1) Hit and Miss with service
2) Mostly do not ice on water
3) Waiters are a bit rude at times depends which one you have helping you

Its only 3 stars based on overall consistency from my visit on dim sum time and supper time. Take your chances!
