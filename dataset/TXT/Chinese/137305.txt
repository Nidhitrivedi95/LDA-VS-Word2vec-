qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA Been there this past Saturday and it was packed.  Placed looked nice but I was a bit dissapointed with the service - yes it was fast however the orders came in wrong.  Food quality was just ok...I've had much better at Kura Sushi which is near by.    

Don't think buffet is for me I guess.  Find buffets usually lack the quality since they have to prepare them so quickly.
