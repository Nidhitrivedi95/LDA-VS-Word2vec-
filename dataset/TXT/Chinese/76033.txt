g-Q3rLkyGT-TtiRgE-PvgA Low quality Chinese food. My sugar-loving child found the sweet and sour chicken to be objectionable. The green curry with beef and shrimp was terrible due to a cost-cutting abundance of sauce-stretching corn starch. The beef was very low quality.  We were up charged for wonton soup which was watered down in another cost-cutting move. This is not a good bet for Chinese food in Scottsdale. Please avoid and seek other options on Shea Blvd.
