3j_mvJHnT7nJd7su_7zazw The restaurant was in our hotel and we wanted something quick so it was perfect.  The service was ok and my crab roll was good but the avocado roll is to die for.  My gf and I wished we would have just ordered 2 avocado rolls.  It was definitely priced well!  

I can't stop thinking about the avocado roll.
