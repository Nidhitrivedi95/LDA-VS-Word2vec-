VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg Boba is always good but i think this place might be my regular for when i want it. I ordered a thai tea with boba. I came in around 9pm, so it was pretty relaxed inside we were the only ones in there. There services were quick and orderly, i did kinda feel rushed to order though. But besides that the thai tea was amazing best place for it that ive tried so far, next time maybe order food see how it is
