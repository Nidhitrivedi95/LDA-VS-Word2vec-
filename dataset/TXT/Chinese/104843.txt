kqqv1ZD-Gq1A03E1K6tzxg So happy I tried this place! Probably one of my favourite Hakka restaurants now.

I tried the spicy Manchurian chicken fried rice, spicy pepper shrimp, chilli chicken (with gravy) and crispy ginger beef. All four dishes were to die for!! It tasted amazing. 

The service was okay, despite the staff being kind, they didn't really do much. We had to always make eye contact/call them if we needed them.
