FLTbKRmBytP1AbjWSPEeyw OMG!! That was the worst ever. I was so completely disappointed with this restaurant I can not believe it. We went in at 7:30 and they were out of all seafood - no shrimp, no scallops, and believe it or not even plain fish either. The service was mediocre if not a tad rude and the portion sizes were paltry. I would have preferred PF Chang's, and we all know how Chinese that place is ...
