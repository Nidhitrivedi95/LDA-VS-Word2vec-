D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Came for the lunch special today, 1pm 2 Mar 2016.  Ambiance was good nice and casual and not crowded the usual hipster music.
-Drink, Strawberry Smoothie w/ boba great enough said.
-Salad was crisp with a good dressing.  Negatives, it had a single brown leaf so happens and a little too much dressing but still tasty.
-Honey BBQ pork, thinly sliced pork with grill marks and slight burnt edges so a true grilled delight.  The sauce was good.  Negatives, slightly dry and a little fatty but still good.
-Pad Pak Ruam (veggie delight) w/Chicken, two kinds of mushrooms, chilli peppers, carrots, cabbage, celery, zucchini, broccoli and leaks.  I got the 4 spicy so it had a decent kick but not over powering.  Definitely taste the garlic which I like.  
-Negatives, The veggies were not cooked evenly so broccoli was ala dente but leaks/cabbage was over cooked.  Chicken was dry so had to use the sauce and drink to help it down.  

-Overall this is a good lunch destination for a quick bite to eat and not feel rushed.  I would come back just not an everyday venue.  FYI they do a military discount 10% for those staying close by.  The BBQ pork was the best so far.
