qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w My first Yelp delivery experience and this restaurant definitely ruined it. Waited an hour and a half for the food that didn't even come. I a canceled the order because it just got ridiculous. I am less than five minutes away from this place. I called once it hit an hour and they claimed it was ready to go. I called again once it hit over and hour and a half and just told them to cancel the order and they said that they didn't have my order as received. I Called them out on that lie real quick because I had just spoken with someone before and they had my address and order info just from my phone number. 

Worst service ever. Absolutely no customer service either. Would not spend a dime with  them ever. Who lies to their customers?! Who has them waiting for so long for a simple order? These guys. I would advise order from here for delivery  unless you want to waste your time.
