PgaHjsWV3whvHF1CHU1rZg Meh. Maybe 2.5 stars.

I went there because I wanted some Chinese Food and was far too hungry to take the time to journey to E30th.  The food is not terribly authentic or interesting-- just run of the mill Americanized Chinese suffering from an overabundance of "brown sauce".  

THE FOOD:  The veggies, chicken and shrimp are of good quality and fresh.  I enjoyed my "cupid's arrow" special of shrimp and chicken with green beans in a spicy sauce.  The spicy sauce was the standard brown sauce seasoned with peppers.  My daughter's noodles were a giant undifferentiated lump of congealed starch, dyed brown with soy sauce.  Inedible!  The potstickers were a touch greasy.

THE ATMOSPHERE:  I really miss the 1980s.  So do they, apparently.

THE SERVICE:  The one stand out is the service.  Friendly, fast and pleasant.  Our waitress was so nice and helpful.  She even gave my daughter a tutorial on chopsitcks!

I'll stick to my favorite takeaway when I'm too lazy to journey East.
