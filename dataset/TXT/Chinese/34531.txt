aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ My husband and I went there for his birthday. The decor is absolutely beautiful and we were greeted by the very lovely and gracious owner herself, Rita, and let her know that she should be very proud of her chefs because the food is sublime. Danny our waiter was very sweet and on top of everything and I cannot get over how incredible the service was.
Highly recommend the gyoza and cheese dumplings (as a non seafood eater they have a great variety of alternative options!) and they make the best peanut sauce I've ever had.
My husband is in love with the Rainbow Roll and Sushi Pizza.
Definitely my favorite Thai food restaurant.
