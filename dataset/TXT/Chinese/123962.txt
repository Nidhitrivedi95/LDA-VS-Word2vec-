oNZgQTBzazjS6JQBvmE_HA First try at this nearby dumpling house. They have a small menu of non-dumpling, non-dim sum items that are nothing special. But their boiled dumplings are excellent, nicely packed, very tasty. Their fried dumplings are equally good. Definitely worth a try for a dumpling feast.
