I was surprised that the soup had vermicelli instead of yellow egg noodles typically used in wonton noodle soup and there were just three little wontons. The soup base was tasty. The fried rice had ample ingredients though it was a little heavy on the oil for my preference. Washing it down with a bottle of Tsing Tao and some hot tea did help my homesickness.
