DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg I really love this "PF Changs Jr." and come here often. I order online using coupons they send to me via email. Last week they sent me a BOGO for the entrees and this week a 20% off my total order. When I walk in to pick up my food they always remember me and take the time to ask how I am and go over the order to make sure it is right. 

I order the pei wei spicy steak each time but change up having either rice or noodles under it depending on my mood and have them leave the veggies out. Just spicy steak and rice or noodles do it for me on that dish. The veggie spring rolls are damn good. It comes with a sauce for dipping that is very good but my wife likes to dip hers in their sweet and sour, so we pay .50 cents extra for that but it comes in a reusable/washable plastic container. The side of brown rice I ordered this time was not cooked right and still crunchy. It was intended to be mixed in my dogs food as a "healthy" treat for her but the spoiled girl ended up with some of the white rice instead. My wife had honey seared chicken and enjoyed it... I had a few peices and did too. I am always satisfied after eating here.
