R-9gUTN8BJIDqGgzXEmq3Q Yesterday, it was take your child to work day which also means take your child to lunch day.  Lee's is relatively close to my work so I thought I would give it a try. I am assuming the owner's were the ones that greeted us at the door and waited on us.  Both were attentive but almost too nice...like "put the lotion in the basket" nice. Trust me, I rather have happy waitstaff that one with hipster angst but it almost was too much.
In regards to the food, I thought the value was there.  Lunch prices hover around the $6-7 range and come with a choice of egg roll, wontons, or soup.
The fare is your typical Americanized Chinese but executed well. Nothing to complain about but also nothing that blew my socks off.
The interior could use some general sprucing up.  Stained ceiling tiles and dust collecting on the ceiling fans may be ok if it was called "Lee's Attic" but otherwise, time to get scrubbing.
