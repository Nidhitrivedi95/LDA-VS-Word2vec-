eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ Get either the miso soup or the dumplings!  

You have never had real miso soup before if you think of the cloudy salty crap from a powder packet that's served in most Japanese restaurants.  Here, they make it for real and it's amazing!  For added fun, get a flavor infused egg!

The dumpling are rocking.  Hot and authentic, you couldn't ask for more.  Try all three sauces!
