lXZvgVmIz-ko1OiCG-VDTw On a whim my wife and I decided to eat here since there was a dust storm outside.
     Simple stated we had a very good meal. We both had soup along with an app. There are so many choices for your soup and everything satisfies perfectly. They even give you a good amount of shrimp and dumpling if you so desire. You could eat here for months and never get tired with so many choices.
     Give them a try and you won't be unhappy.
