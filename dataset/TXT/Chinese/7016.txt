The food is really good, they are always bringing out fresh food and swapping the trays every time I order and tossing the old one (which usually doesn't have too much left anyway). The rice noodles are more spicy then I'm used to, but they are still good. The atmosphere itself is what you would expect from a small fast food Chinese place, in a Plaza, next to a grocery store, but the food is better than expected. Our family has tried so many Chinese places, and I have a slight allergy to msg but love Chinese food so it's hard to find one I can eat and not get sick, but this one seems to do well with my body. I haven't gotten sick as of yet, and the lady in the front tells me they don't use mass amounts of msg like other places. When we first moved here, I called about 10 Chinese places and almost all told me they use a lot of msg in there food. :/ In conclusion, my advice is to definitely try this place. You might be as surprised as I was, and make it your new go-to Chinese spot.
