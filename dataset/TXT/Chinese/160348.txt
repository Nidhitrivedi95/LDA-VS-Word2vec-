U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Pros: for a Chinese place, the food is exceedingly good (at least the Kung pow chicken and dumplings we ordered were). The hand pulled noodles are delicious. If you enjoy hot and spicy food, this place is for you.

Cons: the service is lacking. The price is a little high, but what isn't on the Las Vegas strip?

Overall: I will defiantly come back again.
