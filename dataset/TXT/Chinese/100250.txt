jyZqmlaziZKtPv8AVTzciw Taste: The food tastes good for the most part. Roast duck is second to none and so is their lobster. That said, everything else tastes mediocre. This is where the 1 star came in.

Where they lose it all is on sanitation/aesthetics/service. This place is filthy and when I say filthy i mean FILTHY. There are roaches, there are incredibly sticky tables, there are unclean restrooms, there are unchanged vents in the restrooms, the smell from the restroom, the lack of soap in the restroom, lack of paper towels in the restroom. When you walk into the restaurant, you can feel shit inside your nostrils immediately and you know you are walking into a polluted greenhouse. It is hot as hell and I am positive there are significant contaminants in the air. The vents in the restrooms and in the restaurant are so incredibly old that you can see the layers upon layers (from years upon years, and I have actually been here for years to see this progression) of dust growing on each other.

The service is horrendous. You will get an unhappy waitress take your order. Then you will get your food 30+ minutes later. Then you wont see them until you get the check.

I have been here +20 times in the last 7 years because my parents like it. I would never come here on my own and neither should you lest you be coerced.
