f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ Used to come here for years when the place was Cathay House and last week just noticed its under new management or what looks to be as they have a new name and place has been remodeled.  

After getting seating in what seems to feel like a back overflow room we waited for service. They only had 3 carts going around and you had to wait or waive them down to get dim sum delivered to your table. The servers were nice but you had to get their attention to get service as they didn't come around to check up on our table. 

Food wasn't as great from what I remember,  service was aight, and just not what it used to be. Will not be coming here again and will need to look for a new spot.
