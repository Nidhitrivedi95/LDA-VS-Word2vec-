dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ I love this place!!! Great sashimi and sushi for the price! I love the friendly sushi chef Allen and waitstaff. All you can eat at 19.95.
I am trying to get back here on a weekend night for 1 cent bottles of beer. Sounds great to me!
The price/value cannot be beat imho. The very very large soup bowls look fantastic and the rolls are nice and fat!
