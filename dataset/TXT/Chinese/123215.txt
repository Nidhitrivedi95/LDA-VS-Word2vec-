Oj4PqiXtPTd4kZdI5aG1uw Hidden gem!  Odd location with minimal parking.

The Shrimp sui mai was great!  Also chicken available.  
Rice rolls with you choice of beef, pork, shrimp etc was alright... wish they were served with the sweetened soy sauce rather than the generic soy sauce thats on the table.

Went with parents (both chinese) and husband (1/2 portugese/chinese).  Reviews were mixed about this place.  My parent and husband said the rolls, dumpings, curry cuttlefish, fried tenticles were good.  However thier fried dishes lacked and were too oily... Shrimp wonton (husband said the wrap they used was not good), Deep fried shrimp w/ crab claw (husband said this was very good),  No one liked the beef ho fun... meat was chewy and flavorless.

They do sell a large variety of frozen dumplings that you can enjoy at home.  Yhe prices are very fair.

Note:  They only accept cash or debit.
