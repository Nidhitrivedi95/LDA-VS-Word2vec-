c98EjK4wKpKrGrdZibPq2g I was there eating on Saturday and the food was very delicious. The only problem I had was when I was leaving  (I'm disabled so I have to walk with a cane) , I do know if he was the manager or what. But the guy up front just stood there and watched me having trouble opening trouble door.
