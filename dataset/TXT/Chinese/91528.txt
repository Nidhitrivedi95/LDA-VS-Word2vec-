ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg This was my first dim sum so I don't have much to compare it to but I  loved it! Everything I had was great minus the tripe but that's just personal taste. It was very crowded inside but we didn't have to wait long for a table. The service was really great as well. The only thing I didn't like was that I really didn't know what I was eating. The food was very authentic and I really didn't know much about Dim Sum. Either way, it was delicious and I hope to be back soon.
