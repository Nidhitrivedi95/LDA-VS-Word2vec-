6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag I went to China Mama today and we ordered the beef chow fun; pork chop noodle soup; stirred fried spinach and some buns.  Everything was really good and this place is quite clean.  The chow fun noodles were made in-house and seemed knife-cut, and very fresh.  I also really love that they have Japanese fluffy sticky rice instead of bland yucky Texas long grain like a lot of cheap Chinese places.  The wait staff seemed very friendly too.  It's a block from my office, so we are definitely going back.
