H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag Best Chinese food in Vegas. Owner is always so nice and helpful. She really cares about the food and the quality. 

This place will continue to be a weekly stop. 

The egg drop soup is excellent and you get it with all meals, even when you are waiting on your take out. 

So far, we have eaten the pad thai, general tsao, 2 different shrimp dishes, sweet and sour pork, and the Mongolian beef. All excellent. 

The crab Rangoon for starters is a must get.
