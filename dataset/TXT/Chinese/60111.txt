DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ If "ohana" means family, what's the Hawaiian word for tasty?

Nothing fancy here, just straight up Hawaiian styled food. I've been trying to eat less carbs lately and I figured maybe a giant plate of meat would be fine for lunch.

I ordered the BBQ Mix plate with chicken, short ribs, and BBQ beef. This massive BBQ plate is a great lunch fix and for anyone who needs that premium protein boost. The chicken was very tender and plentiful and the BBQ beef was perfect! I could have eaten the entire cow if it came prepared like this.

The Short Rib on the other had almost no meat on it at all. I know short ribs don't normally have a ton meat on them, but usually there's a little to nibble on. This small set back didn't ruin my lunch, I mean; I still had three pounds of chicken and BBQ beef to eat. 

As a wild card option I ordered the Chicken Katsu Musubi. This was very interesting, but also very good. The crunchy katsu chicken with the soft sticky rice was a great combo. They have multiple musubi options including the classic spam musubi, just incase katsu chicken isn't your thing. 

With my sodium levels through the roof and my belly full, I would say that this was lunchtime victory. Would I come back? - Duh

Mahalo!
