XGX5LW0s-OpjmOpVXXYshg Asian Legend is good, but short of amazing. Here are a few key points:

1. The dumplings are excellent. The soups are good, but a bit salty. The duck is average. On a whole, I found a couple of items to be too salty, but most things were pretty good.
2. Despite other critical reviews, this place does a brisk business. It is popular among the local Asian community.
3. The service here is absolutely horrible. If you want nothing but the hot tea they bring out and your food, you may be fine. Otherwise, you will not be offered anything else, plates will never be cleared, nothing.
4. The menu here is quite extensive. You can order a plate of very North American buffet style Chinese, or more regional/ authentic cuisine. They also serve dim sum style portions. Prices are somewhat reasonable.
5. The restaurant is loud. It is a difficult place to have a conversation.

In conclusion, you can eat a lot here for an ok price. You might like it. If you want service or ambiance, forget it.
