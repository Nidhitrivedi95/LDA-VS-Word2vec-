tsYriuDpdtaTju7LUANDzg I used to work down the street from this Panda and the food is consistently good as is the service.  Better than the locations closer to my house.  Don't know why the rating is as low as it is...

The food is always fresh. The orange chicken, for instance, is always crispy.  Never tastes like the food has been sitting there.
