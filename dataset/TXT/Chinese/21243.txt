I generally have no idea what I'm doing in a Chinese restaurant, so I like that their menu has a lot of pictures. 

I agree that it's a little pricey for Chinatown, but it's not like I know how to order at the really authentic Chinese places that are a lot cheaper - I need my friend there for that. It's a chain, and I haven't tried the other locations, but this one is worth coming to.
