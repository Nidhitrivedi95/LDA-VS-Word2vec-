9SHoWGXsGOCa5hOjBOzPtg Eat here occasionally.  Never had a problem with an order or the servers.  Typical asian service, quick and no small talk.  We (GF and I) come for the lunch specials, a crazy amount of food for the price.  Here's a tip, 1 full order is more than enough for 2 people, so you can really save $ and get an appetizer.  I like there sweet and sour chicken.  I wont go as far as to say that this is AUTHENTIC Chinese food, but its perfect for a typical Americans idea of "Chinese food."  4 stars all the time!
