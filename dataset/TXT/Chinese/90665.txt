iiEjVLb4JDLE2xl8YGR-Gw It's so refreshing to have a Hunan eatery amid an over crowded Sichuan/buns/dumplings/noodles market! 

I've been to Chili King twice and both experiences have been solid. Their menu obviously promotes authenticity, but there is a small panel devoted to the western palate. In general, I think their vegetarian dishes outshine their meat dishes, which is an accomplishment on its own, considering that vegetarian dishes are more exposed by its simplicity. 

I've tried a variety of items including ribs, pork-belly, winter melon, watercress, intestines, and other simple stir-fries. If you love some legit spicy food but aren't crazy about strong ethnic spices prominent in Sichuan cuisines, you'll love their stuff. 

Most importantly, their service is warm and inviting. Although unrefined and lacking in formality, they project a sense of sincere familiarity that characterizes Chinese hospitality, reminiscent of a hole-in-the-wall, (in the most loving sense possible) family-run, side-of-the-street restaurant in China. 

Is their food off the charts delicious? No. I think I can do a better braised pork-belly at home. But it is a fair representation of legit Chinese home-cooked meal. And to the Chinese people in Madison, this place will feel like home.
