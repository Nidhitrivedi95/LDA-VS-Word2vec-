6CFO0CoQq0l-kUZrKdCBkQ Met Judd and Lynn L. for dinner out on the Lake. The venue is beautiful with it's dark woods and sporadic Asian decoration. Having opened within ten days of Montelago taking over, it still has some improvements in decor and quality of food.

The cuisine is more Chinese American than traditional with many of the dishes geared toward the fast food crowd. The agreed favorites were the Orange Chicken and Shrimp and Veggie Tempura. The poultry dish was surprising tangy and possessed a more complex variety of flavors. The shrimp were lightly battered and fried to a golden perfection. The fried veggies are not your typical variety, instead they use the same mix of broccoli, pea pods, carrots, pearl onions, and water chestnuts as they do in many of their other dishes. The Mongolian Beef didn't possess any kick. The Kung Pao Chicken had some nice heat that crept up on the taste buds, but they had forgotten the peanuts. The main complaint about both dishes was the excessive use of cornstarch to thicken up the sauces. We had also tried the Orange Beef and Sweet and Sour Pork. Both were inedible. The former was cooked to jerky consistency and the veggies lost their vibrant color and crisp texture. The latter was pungent, but did not taste anything like sweet and sour. No onions, peppers, or pineapple. Our waitress had to telling us the difference between this dish and the Orange Chicken was the green onions sprinkled on top of the chicken. The choice of white or brown rice is a welcomed touch, but placing everything on top of it was not the best presentation. All of this might sound like a lot of food, but the serving size was not that large. We could have polished it off, if some of the dishes did not disagree with us. 

The main reason why Xing gets two instead of one star is due to the server. Rebecca is the only front of the house attendant and listened to our suggestions. I would like to see them succeed.
