SktLID5_ywSlgVE-h3NB3Q First time ordering from this place and it will be the last. The sesame chicken had every part of the dark meat chicken grizzle and all. The fried rice had long pieces of dark meat which tasted terrible (we didn't eat it). I love egg rolls and can always eat them but not these. Big pieces of cabbage and some other stuff that was uncooked Took a bite and this big piece falls out not even packed inside the egg roll tight. It by far was the worse 40 dollars I spent . Panda Express beats them all over and that is saying something when franchise beats fresh cooked.
