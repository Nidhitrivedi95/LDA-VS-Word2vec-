XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA I really wanted to come back and give this place a 5!! I ordered the same beef soup but his time I tried a thicker noodle but it wasn't cooked thoroughly. Everything else was great like last time, and even the chilli sauce was better in my opinion. The service was also pretty good despite what other reviews have mentioned. 
I also got the tea egg this time and it was cooked well with lots of flavour!
