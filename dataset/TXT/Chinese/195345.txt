zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Came here on lunch, come early as it is packed full of people. 
Got sat in the last available table for 4 people. The food comes quickly and the staff are attentive. 
You will likely share a table with other people and the seats are relatively uncomfortable. 
I got the pork belly ramen. It is good and the table gets a little squeeze bottle of siracha which was awesome. 
Broth is good, pork belly was excellent! Noodles were good as well. However my boiled egg was severely undercooked and it was a little more on the pricey side of things. I split a pork belly bao with a friend and my entire meal came to $23. A bit much for lunch.
Each level at momufuku is a different restu rant and if you feel like something sweet after your meal you can go to the milk bar which is on the second floor. 
I would come here again but Kinton is still my favorite ramen spot.
