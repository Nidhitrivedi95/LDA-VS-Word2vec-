yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA When something is as perfect as this place where do you start?!? 
They are open until like 5:30am. awesome! 
Everything is cooked to order. Amazing. 
It takes under ten minutes to get to you, yaaay! I hate waiting! 
Thai iced tea? Yes please, I'll take two! 

Whoa..ok I have control now!! 
OK, well I love this place like whoa, think that's obvious.. As I mention in my reviews from time to time, I am a pescetarian and that can be a challenge at times finding food especially late night. This place has great veggie dishes, I recommend the stir fry vegetables (oh girl!) The shrimp is good too but one of my new favorite dishes actually is the cubed steak with onions and green beans. I know what you're saying right this minute, uhhhh how are you a pescetarian then? Well, my friend ordered it I ate one  of the green beans with my rice and immediately had a culinary orgasm. (whoa girl!) I ended up eating like all of them, but she said the steak was tender and juicy and whatever makes red meat good (that's what she said), not into it but those accompaniments were the business! The Thai iced tea doesn't come with refills and that sucks because I can drink like 8 of those. right now. Let's go. Woman vs Drink. Hey that sounds like the theme of my upcoming weekend. details to follow.
