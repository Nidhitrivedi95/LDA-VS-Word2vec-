n62dcL1e8BQA1_kUEYrldQ They don't call it Amazing Chicken for nothing. This place was an excellent Yelp find and I would have to agree with many of the reviewers. I have eaten here quite a few times since finding it on Yelp and they have yet to disappoint. The sweet and sour chicken, kung pao chicken and amazing chicken are excellent.
