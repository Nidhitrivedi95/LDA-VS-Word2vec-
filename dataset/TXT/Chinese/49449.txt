CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I like this place, it's casual and the service is usually good. I've been here few times whenever I stay at the Bellagio. The food is tasty and flavorful. The staff are nice and friendly. If you're craving for Asian cuisine give this place a shot. You won't be sorry.

Any item on the menu is good
