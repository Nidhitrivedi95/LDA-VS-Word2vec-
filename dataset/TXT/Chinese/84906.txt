HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw Food was good but I'm giving it four stars since it was such a bargain to eat there. A family dinner special that could feed 6 people was only $22. It was just me and my wife and we barely dented it as there was a ton of food.

Had the Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Fried Rice and Lo Mein with Hong Kong Coffee and Milk Tea to drink. Everything was very tasty but I would say the sweet and sour chicken was the weakest dish as the sauce was warm and made the breaded fried chicken a bit mushy.

We ordered from the Arizona style menu (Americanized Chinese food) but they have an authentic Hong Kong style menu with all the things I seen in the cafe's in Hong Kong and China while visiting there. Very authentic feeling place and 95% of the customers were asian.

Will definitely eat here again.
