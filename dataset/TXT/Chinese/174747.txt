WfgupKdYx1h0mKBmOmNQ3g Took a hour and a half for delivery when they are only 10 minutes away. The wantons are basically just chips. They were not filled with anything. The fried rice was the only thing that actually tasted decent. The rest of the food was pretty bland. Probably won't be ordering from here again.
