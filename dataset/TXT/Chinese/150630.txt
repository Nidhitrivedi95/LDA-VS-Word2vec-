Prices are reasonable for the quality and the addition of more traditional Asian dishes makes it a nice gathering place for those who may not eat sushi. The wine list is lower quality but the food doesn't beckon a higher quality wine offering so it's reasonable. My main suggestion is that they replace the plastic menus as it seems to lower the overall experience. The sushi stack was excellent.
