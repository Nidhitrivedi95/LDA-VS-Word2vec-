jCg6MSfu3fgXxO2QrpDV7w The family that runs this place is awesome! Great customer service with fast service. We have been here many times and never been disappointed. The special chicken wings are one of our favs. Super saucy and perfectly cooked. The only thing that I wished was better was the house fried rice. I LOVE fried rice and there fried rice is not her flavorful. 
Overall Li's is a staple in our families take out options.
