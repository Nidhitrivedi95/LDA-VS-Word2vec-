RU3PsG2y_eGBFi_8jDqyQA I have ordered from this location a few times. But this last time on 3/24/2017 the service was disgusting the order was wrong and incomplete. I ordered orange chicken and what I got was dried out almost flavorless chicken I asked for no steamed rice and got 2 big containers of it I called to find out why things were wrong and incorrect instead I heard it was the new girl she doesn't understand then I get you'll get next time. This is the final time I think if I pay for something we should get what we paid for also it took the driver over an hour to deliver the incorrect wrong order further while talking to the lady on the phone she gave me someone else's address saying it was mine then had the nerve to ask me if I'm sure I believe I know my own address I had to tell her your wrong I don't care what shows up from my number im not the first person to have a cell number. So all of this is to say I am now done with this place completely.
