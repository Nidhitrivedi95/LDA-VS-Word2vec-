Ordered a chilli chicken, it took twenty minutes for me to get it and on top of that it wasn't even decent. Chilli chicken house is way better by a long shot, and that's not even the best Hakka place out there. Honestly, I so wanted this place to be good, which made the letdown that much more upsetting. 

I made give this place another try, but definitely not the chilli chicken.
