2gI7dlktBQXPZiuOW-HWvw Very disappointed. Thinking it was a resturant.  It has a fast food type atmosphere from which you order off a board. Food was not authentic and had some very generic tasting chinnese items. I have to say the shrimp  in Paco crumbs was tasty, but i would have a hard time coming back here again.
