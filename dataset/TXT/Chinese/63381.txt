dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ I could eat sushi for every meal, but my husband can't stand it.  This place is the best of both worlds for us!  The selection of the sushi and other dishes is great, the service is friendly, the quality is excellent, and the price is just right (1/2 price sushi).  My husband ordered the cashew chicken w/fried rice last night (it was so delicious).  For the price, the portion size was big and we had plenty of leftovers to take home.  As others have mentioned, this place is a hidden gem and we're so glad to have found it after recently moving to Mesa.
