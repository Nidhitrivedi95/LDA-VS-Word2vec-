QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ I don't understand how this place isn't permanently packed.  For my money, it's the best dumpling place in Chinatown.  You can tell their dumplings are made by hand in small quantities, using only fresh ingredients.  Honestly, I don't think I've every tasted dumplings in a restaurant that were so close to the ones that the mother of a friend of mine from Northern China makes.

I've been bringing guests from out of town to this place for years and absolutely everyone loves it -- including a discerning friend from San Francisco who insisted on going again the next time she visited.  Not to be missed.
