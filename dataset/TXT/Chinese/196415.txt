ZMCxAECs6KOhpcWpt8HBiw Came here for dinner with my family on Friday.  We got one of their set menus and added on a few dishes.  

I've been here before for dim sum also, and I can say that dinner is only marginally better.

Any robbers who need to dine and dash should eat here.  The food comes out like its pumped out of an assembly line.  Our lazy susan was so overcrowded that all our glasses clinked together and toasted each other when we turned it.  It was definitely an aggressor, knocking out all dinnerware that crossed its path.  The restaurant wasn't even busy - so why the food was coming out so fast can only be explained (at least in my mind) by this one rationale - if the chef finished pumping out the food, they can pay him one hour less.  :p

The food itself was okay.  The sweet and sour pork came in such small pieces that you got more batter than actual meat.  The salty and spicy slices of squid was inconsistent, with some pieces being overly cooked and thus chewy and others being fine.  The seafood soup lacked any real intense flavour, and all I could taste was the chicken broth and a whole lot of thickener.  The yee mein was bland and boring.  

All in all, pretty mediocre food coupled with overcrowding - I felt like a future piece of foie gras being force fed by my villainous captors!
