cE8AfllSAn3RKsxqB6t4xw We were excited when this Panda opened up just down the street from our home, but we were shortly disappointed. Every time that we have been here since it opened, either through the drive-thru or inside, the wait time is absurd! They are understaffed or not adequately staffed, very long wait times for everyone! We'd much rather go to the other Surprise location on Bell Rd if this location keeps up the way it is! We'd probably make it there and back home faster than it would take to come to this "down the street" location anyway!
