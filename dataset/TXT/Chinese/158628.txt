tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw I come here all the time and it used to be my favorite restaurant, but not anymore. we sat down at 6:15 and didn't leave until after 8 due to the awful service. I'm young, but not as young as I look, and I feel like that had something to do with it. The server was nice, but extremely slow and carefree. when we were waiting for more than 20 minutes for our order to be taken, we kindly asked the manager to simply let our server know we were ready to order. that's where it all went south. the manager was the rudest manager I have ever encountered and he acted like we were such a bother. once we got our food(40 minutes later) they gave us ONE BOWL of white rice for 4 entrees, and they didn't even bring my boyfriends brown rice. There was also a hair in my food, but I didn't even bother mentioning it because I just wanted to leave at that point. the only pleasant part of the experience were the kind hostesses. I won't be returning. I don't mind paying to go to eat, and I'm a server, so I always tip 30% which made me think they would have known to at least try giving me good service since I've been in multiple times before. I guess not. I won't even waste my time, and you probably shouldn't either.
