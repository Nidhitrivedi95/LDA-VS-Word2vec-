XC7RBm6or4mf2LyKqQfuUw This is really just average Chinese food. I suppose if you are in downtown and don't have other choices, this might be a decent option. If the price was about half of what it is, I would give it 3 stars. But whatever the price, it's just average. You can get equally good food at your typical carry-out place. We had mu-shu pork, a wonton soup, and a dish with peas, mushrooms and tofu. All were average. Unless you just want to eat Chinese, and have lots of money to throw away, skip this place. Average dish price is right around $20. Unlike many Chinese restaurants, rice is not included with dishes; it's $2.50 extra. Fortune cookies are not included either.
