I usually call ahead and pick up.  I wouldn't recommend dining in as there are only a few tables and the ambiance is nothing to write home about.  The food, however, is everything I wanted.  I ordered the pork lo mein and the mongolian beef.  The lo mein was tasty and had a decent amount of pork in it.  The mongolian beef was good but had a lot of onions.  Definitely don't order if you don't care for them.  The portions were generous so I'll definitely be having left overs.  The girl at the front is great, always making sure everything is just right.  This place is a hidden gem perfect when you're craving some Chinese take-out....4 stars.
