hRbUkwU9awUan32CD-mdHA Went here for dinner so cant comment on the dimsum. There was an event held there to celebrate a babys' 100th day so was very loud. That didnt deter from the flavourful food.

All the dishes we tried were pretty good. They even made the mussels dish light on fire. It's all for the effect as it was fully cooked already.

I highly recommend the "salted duck egg battered fried squid/shrimp/scallop" dish. It's the first time I've seen it being offered at any chinese restaurant. Probably very high in cholesteral but it's just so good.

Flavours are good. Prices are a bit higher than the normal cantonese restaurant.
