9q0qW2sbI147hAaUVfVUqQ I've been here for dinner once with my family.  The food was definitely enjoyable.  That said, I find it to be a bit pricey for what it is.  We were a party of 8.  We ordered their dinner for 6, along with 2 other a la carte dishes.  It came up to over $400 with tax and tip.  

Just a few days prior, I had dinner at another restaurant.  We had ordered a similar meal, minus the shark fin soup.  The price was more than half of what it cost at Richlane.  

That said, Richlane was much better decorated and spacious.
