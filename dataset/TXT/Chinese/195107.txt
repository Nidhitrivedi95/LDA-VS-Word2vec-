zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Came in for a quick lunch before leaving shangri-la, place filled up quickly. Everyone seem to order Pork ramen, we also ordered pickled vegetable on the side, thinking it maybe some amazing objects.... but its flavor was at most mediocre, not worth the price I'm paying. Noodle was hot, Pork was just okay. Did it excite me? No, especially after great experience in shoto, this is a letdown.
