NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og I really wanted to like this place since it's literally next to where I live, but it was AWFUL.  We ordered potstickers as an appetizer.  They were small and tasted pretty bland.  Then we ordered a full order of Sesame Chicken and a half order of Beef and Broccoli.  First, the "Sesame Chicken" looked completely dull.  The sauce was absorbed into the breading which makes me wonder how long it was sitting somewhere.  The steamed rice side was uh, rice.  Next up, the Beef and Broccoli should be named the puffy shrimp flavored beef and broccoli/carrots.  Seriously, I'm doubting that was Beef at all, just awful.  The "Fried" rice that came with it was pretty much white rice with brown food coloring, so bad.  

Finally, my wife ordered the egg drop soup.  Nothing special whatsoever.  The only reason this place gets two stars vs one was the courteous delivery driver.  Do yourself a favor and drive up the road on Ft Apache to Mr Chopstix for a decent Chinese Meal.
