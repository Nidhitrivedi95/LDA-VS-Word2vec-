yBHltbm3DqNaKgBgTMpxsA My favorite "go to" takeout that is local...  I always get the chicken and shrimp pad thai.   It is an amazing portion for the price. They have a great amount of meat in it too! Always consistent yummy taste too! My husband and I get it a few times a month! My son always gets the beef or pork lo mein and happily kills it! The lady who is working there is always super friendly and the food is always ready and my order is always correct! Love it here!
