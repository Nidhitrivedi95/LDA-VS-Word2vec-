pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA The only thing preventing me from giving this place 5 stars is the price--which was fairly steep (We spent $50 per person for lunch).  However, the food was FANTASTIC and the menu had lots of interesting items--it's Japanese/South American fusion.  

I ordered chicken teriyaki., which was incredibly tender and served on top of these delicious purple mashed potatoes in a tasty sauce.   My companion ordered a variety of sushi and rolls. He was born in Japan and is very picky about his sushi, but he was very happy with everything that he ordered.   We defintely will go again.  Next time I want to try the plantains!
