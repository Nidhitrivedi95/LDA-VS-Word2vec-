kVXyz0mYd7NaGuGdM_VMeQ This restaurant is to be cherished for it's exotic authenticity.  It's as if a hole in the wall lunch counter was airlifted in from the East Coast or from China.  The food is simple lunchtime fare.  The staff is from Guang Dong.  

The interior is just the simple fluorescent light, clean, plain decor that you would expect from a low cost bakery and lunch spot.  There are three tables and some chairs at a lunch counter. 

By authentic, I mean that the typical baked good has glittery shredded pork on top or red bean paste.  The meals, all five or six dollars, include beef with bitter melon and Fish fillet with black (fermented) beans and pork intestine.   

I predict this place will meet great success and so I look forward to an expanded menu.  Drinks like Pearl Milk Tea and Frozen Green Bean Paste Ice would really make this a snack place to be cherished!  

Given it's authenticity and student-oriented pricing, this bakery makes a good fast, cheap alternative to the also-excellent, much more deluxe Ichiban Restaurant further up Park Street.

It is currently open 9 to 7 six days a week and closed on Mondays, contrary to the info listed on Yelp.
