AMM3qOH9DUQzJHm9Q3vHag Perhaps the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten.  The food was very greasy and unappetizing. 

The fried rice is an unusually bright orange. The lo mein noodles were not hot. The orange chicken tasted like it had buffalo wing sauce in it. The teriyaki chicken had an anise flavored after taste. The sushi did not taste fresh. 

There were more non-Chinese food than Chinese food options- pizza, Mexican food, etc. 

The place was not at all clean. People have commented on the ice cream. There is no way that is sanitary- everyone reaches into an ice cream freezer with their arms to serve themselves. Gross. 

This place is awful.
