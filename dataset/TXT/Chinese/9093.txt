1PMwRG0uWGxk2hIVEQj62A My friends at work told me about this restaurant on Woodbine that served dim sum for cheap if you go early in the morning. There special is order before 10:45am, dim sum is $2.60 per dish.

So we decided we'll check this place out early one Saturday morning.  Normally we don't roll into a dim sum this early but to avoid the crowds we arrived at 9am. The restaurant was already at half capacity. Saw a lot of older people dining and reading their papers. 

On the order sheet with picked a variety of standard dim sum dishes. Sui Mai, Har Gow, Sticky Rice wrapped in a Lotus leaf, Beef Rice Noodle Roll, Crispy Chicken & Shrimp dumpling (a new menu item), and a spare ribs & rice in a pot. 

From all that we ordered I only liked the Beef Rice Noodle Roll and the Sticky Rice. Everything else was so-so in taste. 

When we left at around 10:30am the restaurant was packed. So it pays to come early. 

Taste was okay but for $2.60 for each dish you can't really complain. So the value is excellent.. just recommend getting here early to avoid waiting in line. It's a pretty popular place.
