MhnihE0alud0ereVInSt8Q I ordered the Pu Pu Platter for two as well as the tofu with vegetables plate. I was not exactly impressed. The food was delivered to my door and a few of the packages were either damaged or haphazardly taped together since they wouldn't close all the way. Now for the food. It was... not the best. I could feel my stomach yelling at me as I ate it. I wouldn't try this place again.
