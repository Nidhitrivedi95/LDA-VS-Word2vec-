l9B72QwKjUhEA-pLumCa5w I continue to give Golden Egg Roll 4 stars.  I love the house chicken and schezwan chicken (I'm sure I misspelled that).  I did not like the Hunan chicken; however, I despise bell peppers and didn't realize they were in this meal until after I got it.  Golden Egg Roll became a regular place for me to go to because it was cheap and better than decent.  Now that I've moved, I'm going to miss this place.
