AMM3qOH9DUQzJHm9Q3vHag I'm not going to lie I think this place is also not what its yelped up to be. 

Don't get me wrong I'll probably go here again, its super close to my house and my husband found a lot to eat here. Theres a lot of things here that kids (and my husband) would like, i.e. pizza, mashed potatoes, french fries, chicken nuggets, and chicken wings.
I did really like that you can sit down quick and get right to eating lol. What I found (not terrible!) was most things were mushy and kind of bland, like the chow mien and orange chicken. I also thought their egg rolls were so gross, BUT their pot stickers are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good and they have that amazing sauce that goes with them! MMMHHMMM I will 100% go back for those alone lol. AND their sushi was actually really good! Nice small bite sizes unlike the ones you get at sit down sushi places. $25 for the two of us with drinks.
