Grilled octopus, dumplings, enoki beef, Dragon roll and unagi are favs.  Service is great-very prompt.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  Dishes come and go like clockwork.  Best on a weeknight, not too crowded.  Sat for 2 hours with no rush.  I think the prices are suitable for the quality food and service you get.  So worth it
