W9JHcg3YTWo2-gfLSS4Wlw I don't know where to begin with all the great things I have to say about Paul. After several years of chronic neck and shoulder pain with severe migraine headaches, countless physical therapy, doctor visits, and long term medications with not much luck, I finally made an appointment with Paul which was one of the best health decisions I've made. 

First I was somewhat apprehensive about trying acupuncture but his caring, calming, healing and connected demeanor put me at ease that I forgot about the thin needles. I am now a true believer in the effectiveness of his work. He has made a tremendous positive impact on my health through a personalized and sophisticated acupuncture and cupping treatments combined with herbal, dietary recommendations, coaching and self-help exercises. I greatly value our weekly incredible conversations and have learned so much from his feedback. Through his coaching in being mindful and present, I was able to integrate my mind and body to heal. Now I hardly ever get one mild migraine per month compare to two severe ones per week. 

Paul spend generous amounts of time on each visit and does everything in his power to help you feel healthy and happy. I always look forward to my appointments because I know I will leave feeling balanced and amazing. He seriously goes "above and beyond" for your treatment. Words cannot properly express his enthusiasm for his patients.

His clinic is very zen-like, clean, relaxing, comfortable, and aids in receiving world-class care. 
Paul has an extensive knowledge of integrative medicine, acupuncture and how your mind and body works as a whole.  I highly recommend this amazing caring, compassionate, knowledgeable, patient, professional and highly skilled person to anyone experiencing pain issues, anxiety, insomnia, stress, etc!  If you are contemplating acupuncture, don't hesitate to talk to him and give your concerns; make your appointment, you'll love the results!
