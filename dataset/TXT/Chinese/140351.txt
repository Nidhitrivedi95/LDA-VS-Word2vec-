r5qUfdiSL2_hHfdqXBJAMA Very good lunch. $30.00 for three of us. Steamed dumplings for appetizer. 2 shrimp lo-mien and 1 cashew chicken with egg rolls. Almost an entire plate of shrimp and noodles to take home. Snack of cashew chicken taken home also. Great service and very good food. We'll be back when we come again to Madison.
