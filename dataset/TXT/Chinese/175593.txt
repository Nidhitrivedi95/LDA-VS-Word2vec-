I suppose it's a good change from the wastage and mass-production of Lean Cuisine in this country, but an extra slice of fish didn't kill anyone did it?

Everything about this place is "clean" from the the Asian decor, to the sharp black dress of the waiting staff and not to-mention the quality of ingredients. Sushi needs to be crisp on the palate, not overpowered by the rice, wasabi, or soy and this is definitely the case at Room 112. Delicious sushi dishes with vibrant presentation. You'll spend a lot of time on the menu since the difference between one roll to the next is literally one ingredient. You could probably order any sushi roll and be satisfied (nigiri or maki). I tend to stay away from the cream cheese as that's just an insult to fresh fish. 

There's an enticing "Rouge" hue to this place that makes your eating experience all the better. I would recommend you accompany every meal with a bottle of sake (warm or cold). My favorite is the Ozeki Nigori sake, as it's very very reasonably priced, flavorsome and light. 

As for the other dishes on the menu, the most appetizing dishes are the "Specialties," which push me away just because of the price tag even though they're scrumptious. This kind of restaurant can't justify a $20 duck dish. Just look at the people around you. I'm walking in with a t-shirt and jeans for a light dinner. I didn't realize it was gonna burn a hole in my pocket. To be quite frank, you'll have to drop $30 here to sample the best of the best. After all, why wouldn't you want the best they have to offer? So be prepared!

Go for the Passion and Cherry Blossom as rolls
Singapore Rice Noodles
Any of the Teriyaki Grill items
Kalbi or Miso Sea Bass

Enjoy!
