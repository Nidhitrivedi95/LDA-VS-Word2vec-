Large drinks menu with lots of different liquors, beers, wines, and some mixed cocktails.  I will definitely go again and try some of the food next time.  Only problem is that it became a little crowded and loud, understandable since it was a Saturday night and the place is new so there's some buzz around it but we had to leave since we couldn't hear each other talk.
