-U8hTUEJHKROEaX5rGoqzA Pegasus is right around the corner from my house. They provide a good chinese message at a reasonable price. The sixty minute message covered all of the muscle groups.  The price was $40 not including the tip.  The neck portion felt really good. The staff was professional and the place was clean.
