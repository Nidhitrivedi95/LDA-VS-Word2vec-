5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g Noodle Pot is in China Town and the definition of a hole in the wall. But don't be fooled. This little Tawainese cafe packs a punch. I venture to the storefront with the pig as its logo at the recommendation of my Tawainese banker.  She should know.  And she scribbled in Chinese letters on a piece of scrap paper at the bank the words for Liver Soup with noodles and I dutifully presented that to the cashier at Noodle Pot.  Ten minutes later I was immersed in a beautiful tasting broth with that wonderful fresh liver taste. Yum. Four stars for me. In coming back to try more.
