-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ 1st time here. We ordered the teriyaki combo and the seafood combo. Both were tasty and good. Serving is ample. Each combo is just about $10.
There's only a few table so i don't know how this will be on a busy day. We ate saturday night, all 5 tables were full but moved quickly. 

Service was fast and courteous.

The only thing I didn't like was the place didn't feel that clean. One of our fork and extra plate was still filthy. I hope everything else is clean.

We'll come back to try other items on the menu.
