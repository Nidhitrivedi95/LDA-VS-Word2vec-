oWEFIvvt_kJCuk2V268XeQ I'm new to dim sum, so I'll keep this short and sweet.

First of all, this place is HUGE. We were seated and had tea within 4 minutes of sitting. I like that. I did however, feel like someone was going to get up and do a speech any minute - as the dining room is banquet hall styleee. I kinda felt like I was at a wedding the whole time. A Chinese wedding? I don't know, but someones wedding. 

...And I like dim sum. I've been to Summit Garden twice in the past month.  I have to literally starve myself to be able to go... or at least have 3 people in the party or you don't get to try as much as you like. 

The portions aren't as little as I thought they would be,  but I liked pretty much everything I tried.

I felt like I was being bombarded with servers coming by with carts and carts of food. I didn't know what to try, so if it's your first time, PLEASE go with someone who knows this place. It can be very intimidating if you don't.

I think we had 16 dishes last time, most of them large.. and it worked out to like $30 a person (3 people) Not cheap, but I guess we ate a lot. 

I'll definitely go back but with more people.. I don't mind the atmosphere being busy and banquet-like and the food was hot and tasty. I'll have to try more places and re-comment on this in the future. 

Ooops, not so short and sweet. Gah!
