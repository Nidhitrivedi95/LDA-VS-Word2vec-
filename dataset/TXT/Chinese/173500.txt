W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g I cannot even explain how thrilled I am to finally find AMAZING Chinese food!!  I have been searching for over two years since moving from New York City.  I had almost given up until giving this place a shot.  The summer rolls are fresh and delicious!  I love the pork chow mien, all the flavors just work and the noodles are cooked perfectly.  The Chinese style lettuce wraps were also fresh and delicious!  The prices are more than fair for the quantity and quality of the food.  I cannot wait to try more items!!!  Great job to this restaurant!  And THANK YOU!!
