c8W-jLGOk74_h9gOa68xSQ I went to this restaurant with one other person, on a monday night. as it is the start of the work week. the restaurant was not too busy. This restaurant one of the many in Scarborough in northern style Chinese BBQ, so unlike traditional Cantonese style with the sweet and salty flavor that is dominant. The northern style is more spicy and savory. 

The things that are must try for any bbq restaurant is of course the BBQ Lamb Skewers. , i ordered those as well as the BBQ spicy pork rib, Chicken Gizzard, and Mussels.  The BBQ meat at this restaurant is pretty good, the meat is tender and just write, and the spicy pork ribs is very different then most available in toronto, and is definitely recommended. I do enjoy spicy, however i would suggest those who cannot take spicy to be careful as this restaurant has a stronger spice then others. 

The Mussels for this restuarants is not bad however i would suggest for more then 2 people you need definetely a bigger portion cause it is very small meat and you will finish it quickly. 

The vegetable we ordered the spicy and sour shredded potato, has a good wok flavour, however i find the spicyness is too overpowering and not much sour flavour into it.

The service in this place is not bad they were very efficient with the food, and the water.

overall i find that although the flavour was not bad, and most dishes they cook pretty wel, they do seem to favour a heavier flavour then most other bbq restaurants, which for some people and i know a few who commented throughout this restaurant is the one thing they prefer them to do less of. 

i would go again to this restuarant of course
