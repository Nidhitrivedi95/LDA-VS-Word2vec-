KHxuTxhVt0smTGngblIjSA Ordered delivery. The food arrive in 45 minutes and it was warm. This was my first time eating from here and it won t be my last. We ordered chicken balls, honey garlic chicken wings, egg roll, spring rolls and shrimp with chicken fried rice. The portions were great! Loved the chicken balls and sauce so yummy. Finding a good Chinese delivery restaurants has been difficult, this is now my go to.
