4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A Had dinner here tonight and really enjoyed the selection of ingredients, the service and the value. You are able to select the soup base you would like, your dipping sauces and because we selected the seafood option - we got a platter of oysters, scallops, fish and mussels. You could order more if you would like for an additional $3 per peice. The atmosphere is a bit dated compared to the newer places but the food and service made up for it. I was even surprised that their air conditioning was cool enough when we entered which made the dining experience great. I've been to other restaurants where their ventilation was poor and it made me feel like I was dining in a sauna. Their lemon tea drink also reminded me of the ones in the vitasoy tetra packs and dinner also comes with dessert. We had their mango sago. All in all, a great hot pot place to check out!
