X4CRPHvv-33kjxVJISZpUg the food is straight up gross.  i hate to say this, as a foodie i feel like i should ahve something better.  want chicken?  hope you like under cooked dark meat.  like tofu?  hope you like tofu mush with mystery slime on top.

i wanted to love this place, but it's just gross.  two star bc the staff is so nice, their sushi menu if you are brave enough gets a solid 'meh,' and the staff is so nice.
