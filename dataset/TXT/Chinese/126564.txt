p2OOk46G_AOO0nCWl-eVlg After a long day of work and I can't seem to get myself to make dinner, I like to get Pei Wei ToGo.  It is extremely convenient that I can place my order online and have my food accurately prepared for pick up. Typically my food is ready for my wife and I within 20min and I always get front row parking because of the "Pick Up Only" parking signs.

I have eaten inside before and the service was average (per my 4 stars and not 5). 

Always a good choice for a quick dinner in the evening.
