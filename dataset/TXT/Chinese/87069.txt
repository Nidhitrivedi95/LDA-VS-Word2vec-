hqpPDu238T1tpBa64Q0TSw Unbelievably inexpensive - you can get a meal here for less than $4. I was a tad disappointed, though, by the quality of the food. Food court Chinese isn't necessarily bad (Modern Wok does it reasonably well) - though Tasty Chinese doesn't buck the trend of standard, greasy, Americanized Chinese fare. Village by the Grange is filled with other gems - avoid, unless you absolutely must have Chinese food.
