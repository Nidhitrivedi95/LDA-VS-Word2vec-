My orange chicken was ok. I've had much better. It was hot, temp hot, not spicy hot... like so hot I couldn't eat it. Like, I left it in the microwave too hot, if that makes sense. I had to cut pieces in half and wait for them to cool.
My husband's mongolian beef was weird. The meat was spongy and just well, weird. He didn't even finish it.
Most combo plates come with an egg roll or won tons or something. not her...nope, just meat and rice.
The only drinks they have are pop in cans or water bottles and bottled drinks, no fountain drinks. And my can of 7up was only kind of cold.
We also saw the owner (he obviously doesn't speak English) yelling at the girl who takes orders. The chinese woman in there was translating the yelling. It was very unprofessional to do in front of customers.
We will not return. Bleck.
