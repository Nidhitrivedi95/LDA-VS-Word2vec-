hf761YTEXm0B1GdtGHGGYQ From the time my family and I walked on China bistro the customer service was amazing. Our waitress was Angela she knew we were cold from just coming in from the rain. She gave us a round table in a corner that had a heater. Wow she made us feel at home. The food tasted authentic and the plates of food looked appetizing, and it was sooooo good. We highly recommend this place. We will be back the next time we come visit lake mead. Thank you Angela for the wonderful customer service, see you next time.
