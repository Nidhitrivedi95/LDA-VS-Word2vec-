HP-FMQcqSOEjTmOxVkJD-A OMG, the cartoon shaped steamed buns here are so cute!  I had to pick up some to bring back to Ottawa for my little niece (and I got a couple for myself as well, lol).

I got 2 Hello Kitty (custard), a Keropi (the green frog) (red bean), an Angry Bird (chocolate and strawberry), a Hedgehog (taro), and a Yellow Chicken (mango coconut).  The buns actually have very little filling and are mostly just bread, but they are soft and fluffy.  Hey, the truth is I bought them because they are cute and look nice in pictures, not because I thought they would be delicious.  They didn't taste bad, but just nothing special.

All the cartoon buns were $1.99, except the Angry Bird one, which was $2.50.  Prices already include tax. 

This bakery also sells bubble tea and regular buns and pastries.  It's in Chinatown and is similar to other Chinese bakeries in the area (and in Chinatown in Toronto) except they are the only one I know of that make the cute cartoon steam buns.  Oh and they also sell Dim Sum.    

I only tried the cartoon buns.  5 stars for cuteness, 3 stars for taste, so overall 4 stars ;)
