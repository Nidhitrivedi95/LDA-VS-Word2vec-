1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I have to figure that a lot people, like me, end up here because of lines at Monta and Raku.  Both great.  Big Wong makes it a trifecta and makes the center the best food shopping center in Chinatown.  The house special soup with udon is so addicting I went back twice in 3 days.
