3PhF188adiC8ZutKRP9gyQ Came here on a busy Friday night. We weren't too sure how the seating was done, so we stood around for a few minutes before seating ourselves without being helped.

Once seated it took the servers around 20 minutes before they were able to help us. Granted, it was an extremely busy night with only two servers on the floor but that was still no excuse for the amount of time it took for someone to come and offer us water and ask us for the order. 

Once our orders were placed, we waited ANOTHER half an hour before our food actually came out. I don't know if the service is usually this bad but we were very disappointed with the night that we went. Oh and the order sheet that you order from only has Chinese characters on it, so if you can't read Chinese, good luck playing mix and match with the menu.

The dessert was ok, but it was not worth the wait.
