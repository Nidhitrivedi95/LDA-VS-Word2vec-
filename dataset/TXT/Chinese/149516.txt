sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg Tott's is as good as you can get for Chinese/Indonesian/Fusion takeout. I had first ordered the Curry fried rice with pineapple and it tasted exactly like how my dad makes it so I was impressed. Every time I go I get something different and I am never disappointed. If you ever want to go to Pei Wei or whatever  "Asian Fusion" places are popular, just go to Tott's. You won't be sorry.
