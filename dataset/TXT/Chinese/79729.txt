I've visited Graceful a couple of times when I was little, but mainly stuck to Lotus Pond since their portions are larger. However, I had to go to Pacific Mall this past weekend, and to avoid driving all over the place I decided to have lunch at Graceful.

Lunch on Sunday wasn't too busy, but then again there was the freezing rain the night before, which might have explained the wealth of parking spots available. The server gave us the dim sum menu, however he didn't give us the giant menu book until we asked for it...tsk tsk.

We ordered siu mai, vegetarian abalone sashimi, sweet corn soup with mock ham, mixed mushroom fried noodles, and the vegetarian mix (medley of mock meats together...forgot the exact English term). I absolutely loved the abalone sashimi and the vegetarian mix, and would've ordered seconds or thirds if I were hungrier (I did buy a vegetarian mix home though). The siu mai was nothing memorable, and the sweet corn soup was decent, though the mock ham was too grainy (Lotus Pond has it exactly like chopped ham pieces). The biggest ripoff, however, was the mixed mushroom fried noodles...one person can easily finish the plate, yet it was around $16. The taste wasn't bad, but definitely nowhere near a $16 value.

I think my experience would've been better if I stuck solely to dim sum. The end result was around $68 for 3 people! If I take away the noodle dish it would only be around $50, which is the average I spend for dim sum for 3 people.

Our dessert also took a while to come out, and we had to ask the server to follow up twice on it. The sesame balls tasted very good though, so maybe it was worth the wait?

I'm torn between whether to add the .5 for not for service, as I found it to be overall borderline. I believe considering the cost factor I'll leave it at 3.5, and in my next visit if I had a better experience I'll upgrade to 4.
