U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q The fried rice is supposed to have shredded pork, beef, chicken and shrimp. I only found 3 pieces of chicken. The chicken and mushroom with hand pull noodle only had 1 mushroom and no chicken. There was something hard the size of a dime that was so dark and hard that might have been a piece of chicken. The beef with hand pull noodle tasted delicious, but there was no beef only gristle. Two thumbs down.
