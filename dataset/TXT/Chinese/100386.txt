Jzz-ZLXsd2ClSn6UyFcbpw Took mom out to lunch and told her to pick some place downtown we've never been before. She chose this one based on the history. After reading some of the reviews here, I was a bit apprehensive but decided to give it a go anyway as I was interested in the history of the place as well.

I'm not sure what everyone was complaining about now. Sure, it's not fancy or modernized but it was clean, we were seated and served quickly, and it filled both of us up for under $20. I got the combo No. 4 platter with chow mein, fried rice, sweet and sour pork and an eggroll. The plate was full and I wasn't able to finish! The eggroll was a little too ginger-y but was large and tasty and the pork and chow mein were both really good and fresh. The fried rice was a bit plainer than I'm used to (no veggies or egg) but was still tasty. Mom got the pork lo mein and the plate was heaping - she also couldn't finish.
8 hours later and I feel great, if a little sad I didn't take some of the leftovers home. No ill effects like some reviews below stated.

I suppose if you go to a restaurant for a specific atmosphere, you're going to leave dissatisfied even with good food. However, I could care less about that - I'm at a restaurant to eat, not stare at the walls around me. This place is definitely worth it if you want some fast and cheap Chinese food downtown.
