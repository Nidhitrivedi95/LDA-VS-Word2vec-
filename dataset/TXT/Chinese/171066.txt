vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Best kept secret in Las Vegas! I'm a total fan. Left completely satisfied.

At first, I didn't want to patronize this place because of the silly name! It's almost offensive! I mean, Ping Pang Pong? Come on, are you freakin serious? 

But after reading other yelp reviews,  I had to give it a try and sure enough, my fellow yelpers did not lead me astray. 

Thx! I'll definitely be back and this will be on my to do list in Vegas!

The food was surprisingly authentic. Don't expect the best service.
