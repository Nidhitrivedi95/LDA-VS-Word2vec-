966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA Soooo, in my last review, I called our server "Aunt Wendy" because of her friendly and caring attitude.  A few more visits later, I want to call all the servers "Aunt Wendy".  Everyone is so nice and want to make sure that we're eating well!

Our last visit was epic!  We ordered A LOAD of food.

- Mushroom Noodles
- Wonton Noodles
- Grilled Chicken Wings
- XO Four Season Beans
- Assorted Vegetable Chow Fun
- Chiu Chow Style Rice Cakes
- Beef and Tomato and Rice

Conclusion:  Everything was delicious!  What makes the experience top notch is the clean atmosphere and great service, which is usually not expected in Chinese restaurants.  I'll keep going back just to see all the Aunt Wendy's =)
