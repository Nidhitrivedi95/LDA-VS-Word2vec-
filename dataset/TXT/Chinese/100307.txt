jzY_beeQKdvA-uZsqDke2Q Updated review! This is a solid 3 for me. I've tasted better ones but if you want a quick fix then this is the place to order from.

I always order there Beef Ho Fun with no bean sprouts (just a personal preference), beef with black bean sauce, spicy salted chicken, shrimp wontons, and chicken corn soup. 

Beef Ho fun is always a must! No matter what I order, this is a staple. It's not too oily and the beef is tender not chewy. Beef with black bean sauce was too salty so I always get it with rice, the spicy salted chicken is good but not consistently crispy (I've had better ones), shrimp wontons are not stuffed...very mediocre and the red sauce that comes with it taste weird. I'm not ordering that again. The soup was ok, I had to add a bit of salt. 

Make sure to bring cash as that's the only thing they accept. It's great for take outs, I've never eaten at this place before.
