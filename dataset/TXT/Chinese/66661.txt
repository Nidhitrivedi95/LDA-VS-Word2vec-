EhTYPpGzs2MfDspt1nU7Hg I picked up my lunch from Chef Lin yesterday and [spoiler alert] I am going back!

I love how they have an online ordering system so nothing gets lost in the translation of accents or the static of my horrible phone.

I ordered the pad thai noodles (less sauce) and the general tao chicken.
The pad thai was a little sour as many of the other reviews have mentioned but squeezing the lime onto it fixed the problem.  There was a little less chicken than I expected (.5 star off) but otherwise the dish was good.
I loved the general tao chicken.  It was crispy, the sauce was good, the texture was amazing.  I even ate less to save some for lunch today ... but then my bf came home 3 hours later from work and ate my pad thai and chicken ):  I rarely eat general tao chicken as I don't believe it as authentic Chinese food but this is my new sweet & sour pork replacement.

And the last 0.5 star off for forgetting my drink ):
