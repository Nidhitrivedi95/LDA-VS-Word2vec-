Their food was just ok and their dim sum was not exceptional like many reviewers had recommended.  Maybe it was available a year ago when they first opened but they definitely did not keep up with all the items.  The decorations were just average. Maybe they are cleaner and nicer than most Chinese restaurants.  There is nothing here that really stands out.  They just sell average dim sum and have the same menu as Fisherman's clubhouse at night.  Many people ate the crab and lobster for lunch which I think is just too much food for a simple lunch.   I guess a lot of people like to impress others.  There are way too many restaurants in Richmond Hill.  The competition is just too much.   There are so many other choices of restaurants that you don't need to come here.
Also their market will be closed.  The lady told us it will be renovated to another room in the restaurant.  I guess it wasn't doing well.
