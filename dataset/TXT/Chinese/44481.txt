BJLjRP7HvIbdQOZc9UoVNA Restaurant was filthy and the staff were rude. The food quality is quite poor. They have a ridiculously extensive menu. Most items fall under the congee, noodle, soup and fried rice category. The portions are very generous and prices are fairly low. If you ever thought about adding something random to your congee they will probably have it here. They have over 50 different types of congee! 

At least the hot pot of tea is complimentary. 

Cash only!
