X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I feel like this club has a darker vibe than XS or Light.  They do have nice productions with all their lights and visuals, including performances by girls dressed in brightly colored costumes performing a choreographed dance on a small stage behind the DJ above the crowd.  Nothing as elaborate as Light.  The dance floor is pretty small. A lot of VIP tables.  The second floor is the mezzanine which overlooks the dance floor and DJ, and there's a third floor with the Ling Ling room where hip hop is played.  The club itself seems pretty big because there's room to roam about. Ladies, wear comfy shoes as there is no area to rest your feet unless you have a VIP table, and there are a lot of stairs.  Great venue for EDM but not as elegant as XS.  Both guest list lines and general admission lines are freaking long (they probably hold the line to make it look like its super poppin inside) so allow for early arrival so you can enjoy a little of the club before it gets too packed with sloppy drunk people.  I'd probably only come back for a DJ I really want to see.
