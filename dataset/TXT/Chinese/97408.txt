JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw I had this place bookmarked for the longest. I don't usually venture to this side of town but I decided to give it a try anyway. 

Just an FYI - Parking sucks, not the restaurant's fault but it's very limited.

For starters, I asked for a water to drink. The waitress brings out what looks like water, but after the first sip (which I almost spit back into the cup because it grossed me out) I realized it was an infused water. I remembered another yelper posting a pic of their water which was very obvious that it had pieces of watermelon in it to show that it was infused.  Mine tasted more like it was infused with only the skin part of the watermelon. Gross. You've been warned.

The cucumber appetizer had a nice sesame based sauce to it with a very light drizzle of chili oil, but the way they have it stacked - the bottom pieces didn't have any flavor at all. It would have been better if the cucumbers were at least lightly pickled or marinated. Very bland.

Beef pancakes were good, they took 15min to make (and they did tell us) but came out nice and hot. They are very very juicy - seasoned just right. Dough is a little thick but this is typical. 

Beef shank - soup base was very bland.  It was a very light white colored broth. It was literally 5 pieces of beef shank, some noodles and a pile of green onions.

Beef brisket - (I stole some of my wife's soup since mine was so boring) soup base was much better, had a darker red color with a little kick to it. But still dressed up with only some green onions.

I'll tell you where the was place really good, and that's their hand shaved noodles - the texture of the noodles with the intentional imperfect cuts was really great. It's just a shame that I had to use 3 spoonfuls of hot sauce to give my soup some flavor.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.
