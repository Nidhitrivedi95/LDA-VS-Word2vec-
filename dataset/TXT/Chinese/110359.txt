LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA Best happy hour ever!   The following have been tried and are delicious:  salt and pepper chicken wings, edamame, crab puffs, hot and sour soup, sizzling rice soup, basil thai chicken.  All bartenders are fantastic.  Good selection of wine.  Only reason for 4 stars is their desserts (only 3 available) are terrible.
