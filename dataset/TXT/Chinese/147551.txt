SBPttAVjzEnN3VE6sKiaMg Went to Jo Jo last Saturday night with the family.  I did a call-ahead so we did not have to wait.  We have eaten there many times over the years and have never had a bad meal.  I had the mongolian beef and my wife had the pepper steak. The food is prepared upon ordering and servings qualify for doggy bags.  It was a good meal and we will return as usual.  The service was excellent.  It is one of my favorites in Charlotte where there are not many Chinese restaurants. The prices are very reasonable and there is a discount coupon on-line. I suggest doing a call-ahead on Friday and Saturday nights.
