WCkh_ZcsWKU1wx4bqyU9KA In search of some fast grub, the fam and I stopped at Taipei South for some good ole' fashioned Chinese. Needless to say, this snobby Big Apple foodie wasn't keen about trying Chinese in Charlotte but I was overruled. Ok not overruled, just figured I'd save my bullets for another battle.

We get inside and the ambiance is simple--nice, clean and more spacious than I thought from the outside looking in. Waitresses--and a kind man who may be the owner--all greeted us and we were sat quickly. 

We hadn't even sat down when the lady asked us if we wanted drinks. Seriously. That kinda put me off but that turned out to be the only blip in what was a surprisingly good night. Food came out super fast which was also disturbing to me but it was actually good I thought to myself as I took my first few bites. Really good as I helped myself to a second plate.

20m later all 6 plates of food we were sharing family style had been devoured. Authentic Chinese? No, more like the American kind and although I'm more fond of the former, this one really hit the spot. Cheers.
