VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg I've only tried this place twice and so far I like it.

The first time I tried this place, I ordered off of grubhub and when I went over to pick up my food, they said they didn't receive my order because their grubhub thing was down. I was disappointed because I was waiting pretty long but they took my order and I was out of there within 10-15 mins. 

Although their food is really good... I didn't like the coconut milk tea. I got it at 25% sweetness and it was just way too sweet for my liking. :( 

But overall, great place. I will continue coming here especially since it's literally 5 mins away. Hopefully I won't be disappointed trying another boba drink.
