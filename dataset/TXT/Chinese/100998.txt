K3J4zvnQ_G1d5xfffPf2Wg Sous-Vide is an amazing cooking technique which infuses the meat with amazing flavor and reduces toughness from classic over-cooking. Had the large goudon (sp?) bowl with onions and pickles (picked with ginger). My mother and sister ordered half and half bowls (half salad and half rice). I personally would not do this as I felt the rice wilted the lettuce. However, they liked it. It is inside the Plaza, so you won't see it until you enter the north entrance and walk a bit towards the "food court". Their tea is also amazing. We all tried different ones. Apple Milk, Hawaiian (hibiscus), and black. (The staff gave my sister her tea for free when they found out it was her birthday.)
Took my boyfriend the following week, the black pepper steak, just as good!
