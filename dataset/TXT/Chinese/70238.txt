I grew up eating this stuff. Not joking. I think my parents took me here when I was 5 years old. I am now 24 (just abouts!) and I still eat at China Palace and love it. You really must come here for their dinner. FAR FAR FAR superior to their lunch!

Portions are fucking massive. And tasty. We spent about $85 for 4 people and still had 2 days worth of leftovers. Hell yes.


PROTIP: If you come here and you secretly wanted to go down the street to Sushi Too instead, rejoice! They are owned by the same people and you can order from Sushi Too if you know what you want (they don't have Sushi Too menus at China Palace, obviously!) They will oblige. That is how cool they are.

Oh, and get the Wonton Soup, Hot Tea, and the Shrimp Soong. You are welcome. ;P
