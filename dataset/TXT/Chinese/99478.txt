Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ My parents have dim sum here on a regular basis and besides the hit or miss service, the food and selection is pretty good.  If you don't see what you want on the cart, just ask for it and one of the ladies can help you out.  We usually eat:  char siu baos (steamed for me, baked for my dad), har gow, siu mai, XO mein, stuffed peppers, chicken feet for my parents, egg tartlettes and others.  The dan tat/egg tarts have gotten really small.  Before, they used to be around 3 inches in size, now, they're just bite sized.  Everything else was fresh from the kitchen and before we knew it, we were really stuffed.

The key here is to get there before noon, preferably between 11 and 1130 to beat the crowds and avoid the wait.
