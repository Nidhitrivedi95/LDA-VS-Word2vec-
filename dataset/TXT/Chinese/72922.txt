Fhjzzo7ranqqgEdbiPD50Q This is a great example of hit or miss, I suppose. Opted to order from here due to several good reviews. Here's how it went for us:

Sweet and sour chicken was okay.
Salt and pepper shrimp had no crisp, the batter was doughy and without flavor.
Crab wontons were doughy, chewy, and not really appetizing.
Pork fried rice was bland.
Chicken chop suey was fresh, so that was basically the bright spot.

Sixty dollars later, counting in tip and delivery charge...

Never again.
Everything but one small dish was disappointing enough that we didn't finish the meal and now I'm looking at ordering pizza to feed us.
