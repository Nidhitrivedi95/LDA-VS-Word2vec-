3SozmlI5K7xapJBE41Ah1g I'm not sure what the quality of Chinese food that is available in Phoenix, so for this city, maybe the food here is good. I'm from Vancouver where there is a Chinese restaurant on every block, the Wild Ginger, would sit empty. The food is bland, the prices are high, the service is average. Not a good combination for a successful business.
Don't order wonton it's terrible 
KungPao bland
Dumplings tasted like cooking oil
Honestly this place needs a cooking makeover!
