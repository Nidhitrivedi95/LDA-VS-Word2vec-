HSz7sKZBjJkishjxqUvOMQ I like this place for lunches with friends.  Price is very reasonable.  For $10, you can get a decent meal and a drink.   They have a bakery too, but they don't have a wide selection.

Food: okay.  The French toast (afternoon tea set) is a good deal and tastes really good!
Portion: enough for women, not for men.
Service: most of the waitresses look miserable, never smile.  I have been going to this restaurant every 2 weeks for the past 6 years.  The staff surely recognize me, but they are not particularly friendly.
Cleanliness: hmm, don't expect the bathroom to be clean.  The dining area is okay.
Bonus: free Wi-Fi
