3PsmvwxetLz1Tzb-6mNhgA I liked this restaurant but I must say I was a little disappointed from all of the comments I have read about it. The location was great but the parking was a little frustrating...not enough. The atmosphere was good but again, it was cold on the inside.  The food was great and the waitress was friendly. We entered into the restaurant and had to wait about ten minutes before being seated but other than that it was an ok experience.
