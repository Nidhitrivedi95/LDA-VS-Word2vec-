HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Ordered the pork bao & duck bao to go just now.  Arrived at the hotel and the duck in my bao was just a tiny bit larger than a quarter! For $7 For 2, I definitely expected more than bread & pickles... was the cheat because we were doing takeout? Wonder who the chef was today. Pretty shady.
