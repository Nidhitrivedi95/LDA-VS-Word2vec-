g1UVmCOhQDY7TGSZ2rRT_w If there's anything lacking of this restaurant, they make it up in variety, speed and quality of the food. This is the perfect establishment for anyone that loves  Cantonese fare, the best style of Chinese food in my opinion. The menu has hundreds of options and this might be overwhelming, so I recommend glancing at pictures instead to make your selection. I always recommend a stir fry, noodle, rice, and definitely some of the fresh bbq. If you love congee this is certainly a must, with dozens of options. We typically get. Preserved egg and pork, a safe choice but always great! Congee queen always deserved a visit when we travel to Toronto. Prices are also very reasonable!
