oWEFIvvt_kJCuk2V268XeQ Our family are frequent customers for both Dinner and especially during their Dim Sum period.
On the weekends, get there no later than 11am if you wish to get a table right away.  The place gets really busy closer to the noon hour.

Food: The food quality and presentation has always been very impressive.  I have yet to experience anything negative with the food in general.

Service: I would say it is hit or miss...But mostly a Hit...Most staff are friendly and they have great memory as they do notice frequent customers.
And then there are few servers/waiters that are simply so Unhappy and Grouchy....I say if you don't like it...Hide it...Or find a new job...
Like I said, it is mostly a hit...plus a place that gets that busy, I am sure they are doing something right.

Price: a tad on the high side(still very reasonable), but for the quality of the menu items and the Dim Sum....It is worth it...

Tip: On weekends during Dim Sum...parking out front can be limited, so drive to the back of the restaurant where you will find ample of parking and a door that leads you inside the restaurant.
