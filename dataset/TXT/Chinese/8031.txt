1CeWMRJwyFkQ-fc3MR1Dmg My family and I come to this location quite frequent.  It is spacious with high ceilings meaning that it is not as loud as other locations.  Congee Queen is a Cantonese style restaurant chain with some Thai-Vietnamese fusion dishes.  Service is really quick here even when it is a full house.  It is usually packed on weekends during lunch and dinner, so I recommend making a reservation if you don't want to wait.  

Here are some of the dishes that I recommend:

Empress Fried Rice- has eel, fish roe, imitation crab meat, seaweed, egg, red peppers.  This is like a Japanese style fried rice in my opinion and is usually not found in normal mom and pop shop Cantonese restaurants.  You know the fried rice is wok-fried well when there are no rice clumps in your dish.

Crispy Tiger Shrimp & Mango Salad Tossed with Custard Sauce - this shrimp is lightly battered and fried and coated with a creamy mayonnaise custard sauce on top of a mango Thai salad.  

All the BBQ Items - This places does BBQ really well, especially the BBQ Pork and BBQ Duck.  The meat is very tender and juicy.
Spice Pepper Salt Squid - lightly battered and fried where it is crispy outside and not chewy inside

Fried Chili Turnip Patties - My grandma really likes this as the turnip patties are crisp outside and soft inside

Golden Milk Pudding - milk pudding with some brown sugar dust on top, great dessert to end the meal with

This place is fairly consistent in offering great food, good portions at a reasonable price.
