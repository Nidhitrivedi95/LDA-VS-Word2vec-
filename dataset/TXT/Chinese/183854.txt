xSplhd6mlpQzbjUAq3rP6w After stepping through the doorway, I knew right away that this restaurant was legit. The space was clean and bright. Reception was warm. Of course, it helps to be reassured that the 12 reviews prior to mine were 5 stars too. On my maiden voyage to Max Asia Cafe, I tried the Hong Kong Style WonTon Noodles Soup.

Based on my first meal, the food was, well, fresh. The Napa cabbage was sweet and tender. Broth was tasty. Wontons were plump with perfectly cooked shrimp and well seasoned pork. Noodles were perfect as well. Not soggy, not undercooked... Just right.

Not sure if I was being rude, but I admittedly tipped my soup bowl to empty its contents into my gullet as quickly as possible. I did, however, check if I was unashamedly committing a faux pas with Ivan, the owner and chef, who so kindly stopped by my table to ask how my lunch was.

I am definitely going to be a regular here. It's hard to resist with fresh ingredients and attentive service on Ivan's side. For my next visit, I'll be sure to taste the Braised Beef Noodles Soup at Ivan's recommendation... maybe for dinner. Spectacular!
