hlDcfzRGfmSmL5LpYcRqKA We decided not to order from Malee's because we wanted something a bit cheaper. God, that was a mistake.

I ordered the spicy chicken combo. I asked for noodles instead of rice. Crazy.. I know.

Pick up the food, take it home, open the container, get immediately pissed off. 

They didn't mix the noodles with the chicken and sauce and the noodles were so overcooked they might as well have been liquified. And I swear to God, they were spaghetti noodles.

(white people problems.. Yeah yeah yeah)

I was so grossed out and annoyed that I didn't eat any of it. I hopped in the car and went straight to Malee's where they know how to cook noodles. 

My boyfriend ended up eating the nasty, pathetic overcooked bland noodles the next day and he wasn't too thrilled with it either. And I quote "it's just something to eat".

Ps. They have a fish tank stuffed with two HUGE koi that hardly have any room to turn around. Is that the fish special? Or do they just enjoy animal cruelty. 

NEVER GOING BACK.
