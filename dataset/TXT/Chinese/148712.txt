SlQNMsVEOSxN-ciIn93LOw Pleasantly surprised !!! The prices were amazing and the food was delicious. Came in on a Friday night with a party of ten including children and we were seated and served quickly! The entire party enjoyed their meals. I ordered the house lo mein and it was simply delicious. Great portions too!! We all had to take a to go box home :)
The resturant appeared clean and the ladies bathroom was also clean.
