JTNdV6u3DK-wcqX7ZXl5hw I usually visit this location on a Tuesday as I am in the area. I almost always order the honey seared chicken with fried rice. Tonight this entree was on the dry side but the fried rice made up for that. I also received an unexpected extra meal with a nice note that said Just Because :)
