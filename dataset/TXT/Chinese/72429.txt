fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA The best dumplings I have had in many years. For those of you who aren't familiar with this style of fried dumplings, they are very crispy on the bottom and perfectly steamed on the top. They are cooked in a covered pan with a bit of water in it. Dumplings are steam-cooked as the water evaporates, and then the bottom gets crispy-fried till golden brown after all the water is gone. As you can imagine, this is easier said than done. This restaurant does a perfect job.

I had 12 fried dumplings and they were great. They were not greasy at all, and the texture is much more complex than steamed. I am going back there tomorrow for more!
