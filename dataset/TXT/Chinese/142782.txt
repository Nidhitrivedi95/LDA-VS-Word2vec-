RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw Typical greasy chinese food. This location is incredibly fast at serving the food though, faster than the other Congee Wong locations. It's also very affordable to eat here. I always get the XO Beef Rice Noodles, and it is well seasoned, but again, greasy. It can't be helped I suppose! The dish is enough for two meals. I usually buy it for lunch and eat the leftovers for dinner. 

The receptionist doesn't really have a customer service oriented attitude, but I didn't expect so. She was quick and efficient in taking orders from both in person and on the phone. The place gets incredibly busy at night because they are open late. 

I recommend this location if you're looking for a chinese food fix. I will definitely return.
