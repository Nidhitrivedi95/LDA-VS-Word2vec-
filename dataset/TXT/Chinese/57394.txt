D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw I am so happy to have found a really great thai place near the strip! Don't get me wrong, Lotus of Siam is good but I actually prefer the Drunken Noodles at Satay. It's in the same plaza on Paradise as Firefly, so the location is much better than Lotus. The decor is nice and their happy hour is solid (half off most appetizers and wine). Staff has always been friendly and attentive and some friends and I have watched a few of the NBA play off games there. There is a chill lounge area with low leather couches/tables where they have a projection screen for big games. You can order food/drinks and relax in that area instead of sitting at a dining table.

Staple order:

-shrimp dumplings
-thai beef salad (spice level 6)
-drunken noodles with chicken (my fav! spice level 7)

AND they deliver within 3 miles. Legit.
