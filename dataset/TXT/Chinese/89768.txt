IAqyeVG1ZMrv7hiV3FAB6Q We went to have dinner at this restaurant based on the previous recommendations.  What a mistake!  Food was way below average, dried up and not at all tasty.  Service was pretty much non-existent.  When we ordered water we got these glaring looks!  The best part of my meal was the ice-cream and apple pies!
