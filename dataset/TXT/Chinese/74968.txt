fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg Service, service, service! They had one little man waiting the whole restaurant, one host and one woman running the food. One mother and daughter couple waited 40 minutes for a bowl of noodles with shrimp. Several other tables left because no one had approached them for quite some time. We ordered the dim sum because we figured it would be quick and we were done eating before our drinks came. I blame this on very poor management not hiring enough servers for a busy day. Shame on the managers!!!
