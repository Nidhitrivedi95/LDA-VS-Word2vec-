Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA The is food great!  All dishes have a good ratio of meat & vegetables.  If you're new to this restaurant, they do give great suggestions.  For the vegetarians out there, they have a vegetarian menu that they don't normally present unless you request it.  I absolutely love the vegetarian items.  Must haves are tofu larb and fresh ginger with steamed tofu.  Be sure to finish off with mango sticky rice.
