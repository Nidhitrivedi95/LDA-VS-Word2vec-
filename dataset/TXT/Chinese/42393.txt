bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg I attended a birthday dinner here for a friend on a Thursday evening. I had high expectations, as I'm a huge Asian food lover and have heard great things about Pittsburgh's recent restaurant openings (as I've just returned to the city). However, I was disappointed with the food and service. The dishes we ordered really lacked a meaningful Asian influence (although no one ordered the noodle dishes) and flavor. Skate cheeks, placed on top of small pieces of white toast, were pretty bland. The fried Brussels Sprouts were the highlight (obviously, but don't beat Meat & Potatoes). We should have skipped the desserts - both options were vanilla custard-based, one topped with Fruity Pebbles (somewhat cute, but very poorly executed).

In addition, our server seemed to lack experience and confidence - we had to ask to place our order AND had to ask for recommendations, as our server never introduced herself nor asked us if we'd ever dined there (no one had). 

Hopefully the next season's menu will feature more "grit"...authentic Chinese and/or Southeast Asian flavors (ala Red Farm in NYC), b/c right now it seems they are trying too hard and missing.
