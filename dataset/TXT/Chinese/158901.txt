U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ Surprisingly solid option for this plaza- I know it's chinatown, but most of the dining options seem to be hit or miss for me. Prices are fairly low, portions are fairly good. Stick to the rice plates (pork chop is my favorite, has great flavor), haven't tried the noodle soups yet. The pork bun and chili oil wontons are okay for add-ons, but I've had better. Takeout orders are ready quick. Dining in is not my preference, as service is minimal and dining room usually needs some attention.
