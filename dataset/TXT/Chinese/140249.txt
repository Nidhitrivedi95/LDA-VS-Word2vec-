R4EhR8xhONLFqqI6ZnzNWw My husband and I are always looking for a great dumpling place and just had to come to give it a try.  

We ordered one order of assorted dumplings, the egg and chive pancake and kimchi fried rice. For us the real winner were the dumplings.

The dumplings were huge; huge doesn't even begin to describe it. 14 pieces of absolute goodness. Realllllly good!

The kimchi fried rice was a touch disappointing. I'm used to getting a fried egg on top of the rice and we didn't get that. Barely any kimchi mixed in and it came with shrimp when we had ordered it with pork. Wouldn't order this again. 

Egg and chive pancake, we were expecting better after reading those reviews. Ours was far too oily and tasteless. Big disappointment. 

At the end of the day, the place is called dumpling restaurant, the name says it all. It's signature food is dumplings, don't have any expectations for non-dumpling dishes.
