lkvHG6proAFP8_evKhdxKA Egg tarts and BBQ pineapple buns are 4 stars- most other things win 3 stars. I like their red bean pineapple buns though.

Because of the service and the mostly-3-star reason, I am not rounding up.

Pastry is delicious and flaky for the tarts, buns are soft and springy, prices are cheap, just make sure to keep track of what you're supposed to pay and count the change to make sure you've been charged the correct amount. The bags they supply mostly are not the kind that seal, so you must tie them.

Service is very brusque. This isn't a problem for me, however my experience could definitley be lifted from neutral to pleasant if the workers smiled or spoke in lighter tones. They sell bags of egg tarts for a dollar. I think there are 6 per package. 

For some reason I always seem to come in when it is extremely empty or extremely busy. Either way, there are usually some older people sitting at the tables inside, drinking coffee or slowly eating their things. You will not be bothered if you sit down to eat your purchases and relax by watching people go past the window.
