jDehhKtVZa62k32WHbnc2A This Sichuan restaurant is hidden away in the McIntyre mall on McKnight road. They indeed have authentic Chinese food, similiar to what How Lee and Sichuan Gourmet in Squirrel Hill has to offer. However, when we went they were extremely short on staffing, thus the service was super slow.
As long as you have the patience, this place is worth trying. But if you already live in the Squirrel Hill area, I would not make a trip all the way out here just for the food. However, they do offer hot pot, which I am not sure if How Lee or Sichuan Gourmet offers. But if you go during times they're short on staffing, do not expect to be served with hotpot anytime soon.
I forgot exactly what we ordered, but they had a spicy hot pot casserole with all kinds of mushrooms that was pretty good. And I also enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles as well.
Overall, yes it's a good restaurant that's worth trying and I'll be back.
