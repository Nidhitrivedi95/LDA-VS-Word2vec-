cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw Richard Pro returns with a fresh review after 6 years of being MIA from this location.

As mentioned in my previous review, this place used to be SWAMPED. When I finally returned, it was virtually empty. Unable to resist sampling their changes, I proudly present my updated 1-star review.

I ordered what they used to be famous for: xiao long bao. It came out lukewarm as though it was microwaved. There was no soup in the dumpling, and the meat was very tough. One of the worst xiao long bao's I've ever had, to be quite frank.

Next on my list was the salty rice roll. This was excellent, and I give them full marks for this. However, it's such a banal dish that it's really child's play.

Finally I had the spicy chilled cucumbers. This was absolutely awful. When prepared properly, the spicy sauce is hot and addicting and delicious. When made incorrectly, however, it's just like mixing a cold vegetable with tons of hot sauce. It won't taste good.

1 star.
