S9cc8kQLJYizT6Ql4L9vgQ Nepalese cuisine is something I am not familiar with, so getting a meal delivered from Gurkha Brigade was a real treat!

The name sort of puts me off a bit, I'm not sure why but like Rezzi pointed out, it's quite military which is a bit strange, but the food is certainly top class. I didn't realise you could order takeaway from here but, whilst staying at a friend's flat nearby, I was surprised to hear they get a take-away from here at least twice a month!

The food came, was piping hot and only took around half an hour which was really quick. I ordered a hot Khorsani (that might not be spelt right!), which was a curry style dish with chicken. It was really nice, very tasty but really spicy! It was about £10 too which is expensive for a takeaway, but we were celebrating exam results so we thought we deserved a treat!

I would certainly go to the restaurant itself, because they do a buffet lunch/dinner which I have only heard good things about!
