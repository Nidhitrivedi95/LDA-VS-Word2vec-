There is a huge variety of Chinese stuff, a smaller Philippine section in one corner, and miscellaneous Korean, Japanese and Southeast Asian goods scattered throughout.  Nice selection of live fish and seafood.

Some good buys on meat; I think one might be able to better on produce in smaller Asian markets if not buying items on special.

The store area includes a number of separate businesses (some reviewed in Yelp) which form a kind of Asian mall-within-a-mall. 

Checkers seem more considerate and polite than at some other markets.
