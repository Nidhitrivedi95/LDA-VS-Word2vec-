1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Visited this restaurant for the first time this weekend. We went at 5 pm on a Saturday and it was pretty quiet with only one other group eating. Service was fast. The young girl that waited on us was kind and friendly. The meal was filling and delicious. We had the salt and pepper wings, the fried wontons and a wonton soup with noodles. The place has some character as it has hand written menus hanging on the wall and it's not kept immaculate. To me it felt comfortable.   Will be back to try some other things on the menu soon.
