YaEPtPnEqh3WSsGq7cL44Q When we lived on Central ave. I think this is a restaurant we visited. I am not positive though. The food was great, but the yelling at the woman out front from tha back got to us. So we stopped going. But as I said, I am not sure this is the place, but it the right location.
