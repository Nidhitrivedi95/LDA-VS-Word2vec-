aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg Food is so good, I keep going back, every single time I'm in Vegas

What I ate:
- BBQ Pork: Super tender and tasty
- BBQ crispy pork belly: That crispy skin! OMG, so good
- BBQ roast duck: Really great! Crispy skin, fatty, juicy meat. 
- Wonton noodle soup: This is always a great standard if you're craving noodle soup. The broth is light
- Seafood chow mein: This is not your typical chow mein from your local chinese joint. The seafood is all super fresh, tender, not overcooked. I'm usually not a fan of squid in most seafood dishes because they tend to overcook it and make it rubbery. But this place knows what it's doing. Everything is cooked to perfection and the skinny chow mein is great
- Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce: Get some green in you! Cooked to perfection 

Pros:
- All the food I've had here has been cooked to perfection. Like superb each and every time. That type of consistency just can't be beat! This is why I keep coming back!
- Price is right. I think on average it's about $15/person? Maybe $20 if you get greedy. 
- Service is actually really good for an Asian restaurant. Everyone is friendly
- Food comes out fairly quickly

Cons:
- That wait! Coming at peak times can mean a wait, so be prepared. My friends came in for a really late lunch at 3pm on a Sunday, and that's been the only time there was absolutely no wait. If the wait is too long, just order to go!
- Fairly small. Nearly all the tables are 4tops. A few 2tops, and a few tables could be squished together to make 6tops. So try not to bring your nine foodie friends
- What kind of restaurant stay closed on Fridays?! Apparently this place is just doing so well they don't need to. So, just be aware of their business hours

Would I come again? YES!
