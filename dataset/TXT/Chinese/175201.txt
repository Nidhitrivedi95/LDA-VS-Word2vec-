WghhtS-tqDWMh_W2O13CYA I went there on a Monday and sat in the drive thru line, they said we will be with you shortly.  Well 5 minutes without my order being taken, I left. I believe in second chances, so two days later (Wednesday) I went.  I sat in the drive thru for a while, so this time I walked in the store and there was no urgency amongst the employees.  They were moving so slow, no wonder the drive thru line was so long.  So at the end of my order I asked for a medium beverage, I filled it up only to find out they were out of lids.  As a result I went back to the counter to ask for a lid, I got a look like "I'm Busy don't bother", so instead of waiting even longer I just grabbed a larger cup and transferred my beverage into the larger cup and put a lid on it.  
The food at this place is average but the service is needs work.  I do not know if I will be back, I do not have that long for lunch break.  Panda "Express" hmm not so express.
