JQrh2cmndqRKwTpVveHPDg Food was decent but not outstanding. Service was lousy during lunch hours. Food came very slow and our server was rude. We ordered the roasted Peking duck set and we asked them if it comes with a lettuce wrap after we finished the duck. The server sounded almost angry saying we have to tell them we want that when we order the duck set. Most of the food were tasty and well repented except the rice with meat. They simply put their ugly rice cooker on our table and let us scoop in it. With the price we are paying I definitely expect better service than this. I won't come back
