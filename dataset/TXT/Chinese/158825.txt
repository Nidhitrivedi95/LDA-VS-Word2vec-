U0fN0HPOrBCAwQ5JfNaO_w Small place, friendly and attentive staffs, laid back atmosphere. I love their fried dumplings! A must try as this is their speciality. The friend dumplings are crispy on the outside yet still have the soup on the inside. Not drying, not overcooked. They make it fresh here. I think this place is great for lunch or even nights where you don't want to eat so much. For how much they give you, I think the prices are reasonable.
