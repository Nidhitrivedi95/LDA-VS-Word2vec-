_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA This was the perfect place to go after raving all night at the wonderful EDCLV. We were craving a nice bowl of hangover pho and I was just craving for some rice and cha siu! Something simple and hearty, which they offered here at Noodle Asia :) we had a huge group and the host handled us pretty well, considering we didn't all arrive on time. My friends really enjoyed their bowls of pho. I really enjoyed my cha siu and rice! They give you a huge plate of cha siu for just $9, which does not include rice. The meal filled me up and for a great price too.
