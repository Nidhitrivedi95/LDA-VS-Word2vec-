kWkW6vVePpBox_fKfGgPjQ When you leave a restaurant wondering when Gordon Ramsay will come bursting through the doors to scorn the frozen reheated calamari, the warm, parasitic fish, or the wilted parsley used to garnish the plate, you KNOW you're in trouble.

Where to begin? I knew the minute that the calamari arrived that this would be a negative experience. It was over-cooked, obviously of the frozen bagged variety, served with mae ploy. We were brought some fresh lemons which did help. The service wasn't terrible, but I was called "honey" all night long by someone about my age.

We ordered the Arizona roll, Spicy Tuna roll, Eel Tempura roll, Rainbow roll, and the Sex on the Beach roll. All of which had too much rice, to little seasoning, and low quality ingredients.

The worst was the Eel tempura. It tasted burnt, like it had been fried in bad oil. The Rainbow was next up, warm, disgusting so that we didn't eat it. The Sex on the beach (spicy with raw scallops and siracha), wasn't so bad, because I love spicy food. It was spicy enough that you couldn't taste the poor ingredients. The other two were just nasty-too much imitation crab, too much cream cheese, too much old cucumber, and warm, gelatinous looking fish. GROSS.

We like to sit at the sushi bar and it was so low and small- obviously so you can't see what the sushi chef is using for your rolls! Not the best ambiance. 

Save yourself time and money. Don't be fooled by their tempting "discounts"- $10 a roll (after 30% off)  is outrageous for the quality.

I can't comment on the drinks because we stuck to water. They don't have Saturday drink specials.

I will stick to my old standbys Kyoto or Sakana. Cheap, fast, and more delicious than any sushi I've had in the Phoenix area. If you want all the glitz and glam, go to Ra or Blue Wasabi. So what if you have to drive 30 more minutes.
