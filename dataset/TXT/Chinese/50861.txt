Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA Vegan review:

If you are vegan, run away!! There is nothing vegan here (except one thing but I'll get to that later) despite what you might have on the vegan blogs and PETA. 

I am vegan and I came thinking I could get a deliciously cooked meal, but boy was I wrong. As I always do, I asked the waitress if the foods I saw recommended to vegans online were in fact vegan. She said she wasn't sure so she brought the manager over to chat. He kindly told me that nothing on the menu was vegan but that they would be able to steam up some veggies for me. Not very exciting but it was something. I had steamed veggies without any seasoning or sauce and a bowl of rice. At least I was "healthy" heh heh. 

Saving grace: the service was A+ and the manager was super kind and apologetic. I appreciate the knowledge that the manager showed regarding the vegan diet. It feels unfair that I'm rating this particular establishment so low but I'm bummed there weren't more options for vegans. STEP UP YOUR GAME PF CHANGS CORPORATE!!
