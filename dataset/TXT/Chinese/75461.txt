FykLjv4tIq618q8F2pvTKg I went here with good expectations, unfortunately upon reaching the buffet, I was immediately disappointed. The salad bar lacked diversity, as did the buffet itself. The chicken dishes are loaded with liquid smoke or some other flavor substitute, the sushi did not hold together and was underwhelming as far as flavor is concerned, most of the dishes were luke warm  dried out, there seemed to be no cycling of trays, the advertised 150 menu items were more reduced to 70...at best

The best part of the meal was the fortune cookie, and it because it was not made by them.

This is the kind of place you bring a date who you'd never like to go out with again
