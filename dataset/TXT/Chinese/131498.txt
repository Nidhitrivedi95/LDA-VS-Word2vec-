PJnLYU26wYp6TedhQ8PF8Q Have had take away from Lee On a number of times over the last 3 years.


 The food had always been tasty and good value, although recently we have been going elsewhere as the rice has had a strong burnt taste and other dishes are not as nice as before.


 Would like to try a sit down meal but the fact you can't see the restaurant when you go in the door is a bit off putting. Maybe we'll give them another chance soon!
