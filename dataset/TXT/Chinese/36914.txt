AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw I love Chop Wok! It's one of my favorite neighborhood hangouts.  The owner, Jamie, is so welcoming & greets us w a handshake every time. If you are looking for a laid back bar/restaurant with healthy Asian food options, Chop Wok might become your favorite hangout too.  It has been our go-to bar to watch a live game or just to hang out and listen to live music on the weekend!
