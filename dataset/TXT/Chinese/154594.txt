I saw this place after having some pho at Pho Dau Bo on Creditview and Bristol and it was quite the surprise.  The first time I had their winter melon black tea with tapioca and it tasted like, get this, tea with wintermelon and tapioca.  It was a far cry from other bubble tea places which just tastes like sugar + water + powder.  They loaded it up tapioca and it was nice and chewy.  

I was so impressed by the bubble tea, I came here the next day to try out their fried chicken steak.  I got the combo which included 5-6 pcs of chicken steak, fries and bubble tea for $9.95.  This is a steal if you consider that bubble tea costs around $4.00, so you are paying less than $5 for the food.  The chicken is different from Popeye's and KFC, but it's just as crispy as Popeye's. It's nicely seasoned, crunchy, moist on the inside but with a semi sweet outer coating.  It was delicious.  The fries were okay, not great, but not bad either.  What I really liked was the extra seasoning they offer on the table, which includes seaweed spice, spicy seasoning, curry, black pepper and lemon seasoning.  

Verdict: Come here for a quick and cheap guility pleasure meal but also feel satisfied with your choices.  Food here is much better than other bubble tea places.

PS don't come here expecting fruit flavoured bubble tea. It's soy milk, winter melon, and original.
