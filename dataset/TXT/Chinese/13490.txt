2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q Hot pot! Hot pot! Love the hot pot and vanilla cream burlee. Their hot pot menu finally came back. Somehow I feel that their services has gone much better. They care and checking up on your table in a timely manner. Sometimes, I found the food wasn't washed thoroughly. Kitchens faults... Server is willing to take back and get a new one for me. They won't argue like other typical Chinese restaurant.  I always get spicy broth with seafood. Their squid is different preparation then before. It's more texture and better taste of. Lamb chop is delicious. 

Only one more thing I got to complain is that their small white bowl the bottom part is always crack! I like to hold up the bowl when I eat. Sometime it cuts my finger :( 

Overall, there aren't many hot pot place like them has good price, portion, and broth! Of course, Will be back soon again!!!
