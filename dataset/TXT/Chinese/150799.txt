swfdlAMXwV8OjYD5nkA6nQ I came here on a Friday evening and it was pretty crowded. As a result, I had to wait a little while for the food. After reading some favorable reviews I thought to myself, this had better be good. When my Pork Osso Buco finally arrived I devoured it shortly after first taste. I mean it was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and the flavor tickled my palate. The manager was also very nice as well. The decor was pleasant and seemed authentic enough. Given that the more important points, being quality of food and service were well covered, I give this place a five star rating.
