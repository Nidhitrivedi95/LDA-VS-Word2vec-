qbDaSyxDfUZNheucJym2Pg Came here for lunch with a large group. It was about 1 in the afternoon so we got seated immediately.  Ummmm.... I don't have a whole lot to say about this place.  The prices were good on their lunch menu.  The staff was nice.  We got water and hot tea. We did wait longer for some things. Long like, maybe our waitress forgot lol. I gave it 3 stars because others seemed to have enjoyed their food.
