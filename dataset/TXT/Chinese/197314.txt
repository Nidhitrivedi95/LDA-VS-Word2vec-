ZQqiZAC4H4SI82W3RmaTKA Good quick Chinese food place with healthy options. They do the basic meals as you would expect from a local Chinese restaurant. It doesn't have a nice interior, but it's good enough for a quick lunch or dinner. It's about as good as you can get for takeout Chinese food type places, and the healthy options are really convenient.
