GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Until tonight China Poblano was my only positive review of a restaurant in Las Vegas (because their food is awesome). Whenever friends ask me for advice on where to eat, I usually ask them if theyve been to China Poblano (ive considered it to be my favorite restaurant). I live pretty close to the cosmo and order food in China Poblanos to go window on average around twice a week. I ordered my food like normal and sat down outside and was on the phone with my ill mother and after a few minutes a manager (Carrie) gets in my face and says "this area is for customers only, you need to leave immediately" and I told her that I was a customer and that I placed a to go order and was waiting for my food and she said "if youre a customer you would be sitting in our stadium seating." I was literally shaking from how she confronted me like I was some kind of criminal loiterer. Their stadium seating is this creepy area in the middle of the restaurant that looks like some kind of religious shrine. Carrie is a nasty, sad excuse for management, and she needs to be fired to reduce the number of customers, like me, who are never coming back.
