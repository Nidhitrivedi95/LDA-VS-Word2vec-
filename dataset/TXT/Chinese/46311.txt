BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I want to have some Chinese dumplings and noodles recently, so my friend recommended it to me. We visited there around 12:30 pm, it was not very busy. The restaurant was very clean and nice, all the dumplings were handmade freshly inside everyday. We ordered steamed pork and sour cabbage dumplings made in whole wheat flour(six pieces for $5.75), Dan-dan noodles with pork soy-bean paste, and small size dish of pickled vegetables. Honestly, the food there was very authentic and delicious but the price was a little expensive. It served us with hot black tea which made me very comfortable. It should be suitable for groups people to share because larger portion order would be much cheaper.
