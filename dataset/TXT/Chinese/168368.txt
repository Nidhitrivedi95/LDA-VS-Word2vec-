Voy_shxcm2YnHQOtfUj1KQ I like to check out the places that I haven't been told, "the best place for. ... is. .." Usually that means one lemming told another lemming etc etc etc... Or some hipster who just moved to town has decided it's the bomb (#LeThai). Spicy City doesn't have any sort of hipster / foodie cred. Just good really well priced food. If you like flavor as opposed to atmosphere (there is none) try this place. 

I stumbled upon it when I had Satan's personal bronchitis that he must have felt I deserved (seriously, you sleep with a priest once....). I had two spicy soups and cleared right up (take that BeeyellZoBob!). The sautéed smoked pork is sublime. And only $5.99 at lunch. 

I'd take a Sunday afternoon first date here. You can chat or watch Chinese soap operas on the big screen TV. Then take a stroll around Chinatown Plaza (stop at a bakery! Cream puffs!) they'll never know you spent less than $25 on the whole date (you listening #EHarmony player players?)
