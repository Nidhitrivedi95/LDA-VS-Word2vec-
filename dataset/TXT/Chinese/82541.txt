haa0u6VwTWBXbIW0mxlSGw Worst Chinese food I've ever had.  The Orange Chicken was coated in a thick sticky goo.  The Teriyaki Chicken was fatty and tendony, and the Egg Foo Yung was no good.  The fried rice had no egg or vegetables and the fortune cookie was stale.  The only good thing on any of our three plates was the noodles (which also had zero additions, just plain noodles.)  If I ever had to eat here again, I'd try a Lo Mein meal.
