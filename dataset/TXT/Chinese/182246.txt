XhMfL-6lt-prYyC9Lp02gg I was in Parma and planning to get chipotle for dinner but I saw Best Wok in the same plaza so I gave it a try. Clean inside, there's about 4 tables only. Looks to be primarily take out. They have an $8.75 combination for two entrees, rice, egg roll  I picked. I got chicken & broccoli and beef & broccoli. They charged extra for plain fried rice which is kind of annoying. Overall it was good. I would go back.
