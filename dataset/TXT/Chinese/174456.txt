WEw08dCcOiwH3Sw1f_8DKQ Superb! We came here for the first time to try their lamb skewers after hearing/reading great reviews about this restaurant. We also ordered a side of fried rice and black pepper beef garlic. The lamb was very soft and marinated in delicious spices which wasn't overpowering at all. I usually don't eat lamb as much because I'm not a fan of the gamey taste, but the lamb skewers did not taste gamey at all which was great. The black pepper beef garlic was literally out of this world. Upon first bite we fell in love! The beef was tender with sweet and garlic flavours which gave the dish a nice balance. We especially loved the whole garlic cloves that were cooked with the beef. 

I definitely give this restaurant a 5/5 for the amazing dishes we tried and I cannot wait to go back to try other popular items!
