70nmPKnAufzeKfRNVE0-Pg Oh I totally miss this place the most in Madison after moving to LA. As much as there's MSG on each of their dishes, it tasted fabulous and those Hongkong Crispy Chicken, their #1 best dish ever, top notch. Nothing beats that, I dunno what sauce they use but boy oh boy... but after you eat in here, make sure you don't go to something that needs lot of concentration cause you won't be able to stay awake. The msg usually started kicks in about 30mins later :P. If you like chilli oil, they have the good one too (due to msg :P) and they sell it for like $3 or $5, ahhh... writing this review makes me drooling and craving for the crispy chix... If you come to Madison, you should try and eat here... 

As to response on the other ocmments, yes the owner isn't friendly but if you eat there a lot and she recognized you, she will start treating u really nice and even sometimes she memorized what you like to order :)
