PViWXTbiRkRjZhAdH0xLxg Recently had a lovely evening at Cynthia's. The decor and traditional dress of the staff is charming. We were in a large group, and service was nicely paced and food served piping hot. The three soups we had were wonderful: wonton, sweet and sour and chicken/ corn. My favourite dish was the lemon chicken, which was crisp and flavourful. I highly recommend Cynthia's for a special night out. You won't be disappointed!
