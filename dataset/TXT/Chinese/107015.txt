L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA I am definitely not in love, but if you show up between 3-5pm, you can get a very sweet deal. First of all, they have $4.95 lunch specials from 11am-5pm, so regardless of your vampire schedule, you can pretty much bet the special is happening. If you have impeccable timing, however and can stall lunch until 3pm or perhaps go for an early dinner at 4:30pm, you can get a free large milk coffee or milk tea with your entree. The ice coffee is superior to the tea in case you were wondering. This is an amazing deal given that an iced coffee can set you back at least $2.50 elsewhere.

As for the interior, it is a step below okay, but close enough to okay to not offend. If you are used to Chinatown-esque restaurants, you will be just fine. The service was a bit abrupt, definitely not a bright spot. When the Mr. tried to ask about getting a vegetable mei fun as a special, he received a very abrupt: "If it is not on menu, you can not get it. Mei fun has fish cakes." The tone was enough to prevent any further questioning, so he accepted the fish cakes, and I ordered the stir fried mixed vegetables without any questions. 

The food was good. Not too saucy, and the mixed vegetables were all true vegetables: no baby corn, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots or odd fungus.  Despite the sea of fish cakes, the noodles were also tasty. There are definitely some experienced men in the kitchen, as everything was hot and seasoned appropriately. 

For $4.95, it is hard to beat. A little smile from the server might have edged me over to four stars. I might have to give it a second shot to see if there is a friendlier server on a different day.
