R4EhR8xhONLFqqI6ZnzNWw Hidden Chinese Gem. "Dumpling Restaurant," You would think the marketing tactic and point of differentiation is more evident. Googling dumpling restaurant, you can probably come up with countless searches well before this, simply because the name is jaw-dropping and outstandingly unique. That said, you'd be surprised at how tasty the food is, contrary to what it's boring signage would suggest. 

Service is not ideal, decor isn't exactly luxurious and up-scale, I'm really selling this aren't I? But the food and the price point? My goodness it's so worth the unequivocal stark contrast in service, decor, and signage. 

The steamed dumplings contents within are flavorful but not overpowering, the skin is just the right thickness, and coming out of the stove at the right time, it makes any living being salivate. My parents would always pre-order 200 frozen ones to go because that`s how good they are. The fried meats are tangy, crispy, yet filled with tender meats within. Sided with a cold dish that is refreshing, this meal is a big win for quantity at a very descent price.

Close your eyes if you`re someone that enjoys lounging in up-scale ambiance, but this place is a must try if you`re in the area. Worst case is you don`t like it, but it definitely doesn't make a dent in your wallet. So why not give a safe bet a chance?
