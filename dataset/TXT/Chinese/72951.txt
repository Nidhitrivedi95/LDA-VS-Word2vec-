fHkiH52AATeRa8Fi2yStpQ I love ordering from here. It is definitely one of our favorite Chinese restaurants in the Charlotte area. They have a wide variety of Asian food, and all if it is fresh and tasty. 

The prices are good and the people there are always friendly. Definitely a staple for Chinese food.
