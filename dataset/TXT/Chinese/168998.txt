Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA This is the second time we've eaten at Pan Asian, once in Summer 2015 and now again during Thanksgiving week 2015. We've owned a 2nd home in Summerlin since 2001 and have finally found a good Thai restaurant that is local, has good quality, has excellent ingredients, and is a family operation. We've had the Shrimp Soup, Curry Dishes, Stir Fry Dishes, Noodle Dishes, and Pad Thai ... all were excellent. Looking forward to our next visit.
