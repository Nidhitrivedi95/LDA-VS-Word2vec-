pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA This place is sooo good. They have a really nice atmosphere. My friend placed reservation here for my birthday. We got there perfect timing. The waitress and manager are so friendly. Service is really good here. Now the food, just great. We got the appetizer with salted bean, tempera bean, and grilled jalapeno. The beans taste good. The jalapeno wasn't spicy, but had a very sourish/"pickle" taste. It's different. We ordered a samba roll. That was really good. Crunchy, tasteful, and delicious. We ordered the tiger shrimp and sea bass. Both came with peruvian corn. It was my first time having peruvian corn. It is good. It's chewy and reminds me of "sticky" corn but larger size. The sea bass was very good. The meat was soft and sweet and melts in your mouth. It had a teriyaki flavor I thought. The shrimps was very good too. Both tasted very fresh, especially the shrimp. It smells like the ocean. We also ordered fried calamari. The calamari has a tangy sauce poured on top with mixture vegetable including good tomatoes and sweet plantains. They brought out warm banana chocolate cake for me. The dessert is delicious. Ice cream and a crunchy chocolate piece on top of warm chocolate cake in syrup with couple strip of fried banana. Just delicious. All the food were brought out in a very good presentation. The dishes are pricey. But if you want to eat fresh and good quality food, you should come to this place.
