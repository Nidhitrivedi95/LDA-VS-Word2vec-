KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ This place is a perfect example of "Never judge a book by its cover" On the outside it may look rundown and cheap, but once you walk inside, it's so beautiful its almost breath taking. The food is reasonably priced and the service is great. I have been going to this place for years, and no matter how far I move, I still try to make it ever few months.
