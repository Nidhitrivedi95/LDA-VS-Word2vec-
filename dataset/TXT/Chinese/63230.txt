DXP3MbE8srQITLlAuS45aQ Mapo tofu is one of the best in Pittsburgh. Stair fried pork belly with leeks is also very good. More than half of the entries on menu are spicy but there are also not spicily food. It is not on the menu but on white board, Steamed fish (<U+6E05><U+84B8><U+9B5A>) was also very good.

I uploaded photos of menus so we can order pick up by phone.
