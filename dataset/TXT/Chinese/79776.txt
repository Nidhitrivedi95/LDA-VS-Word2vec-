GlPvold8xQu3AVKOOCEkIA Well tonight is the last time I will be spending my money at this location. As the price increases, the size of the wings decreases. There's no reason why the carrots that they put in your to go container are digger than your wings. I haven't been satisfied with them since my 1st review. And the fries that came with it were not even fresh or at least warm. I don't understand how a busy establishment has cold fries. I should've went to ATL Wings up the street and that's where I'll be going for now on
