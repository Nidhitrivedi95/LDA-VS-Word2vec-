qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A I USED to love this place.  The service has really gone downhill the past couple of years.  It was a Monday lunch and the place was packed!  So, the servers were running around like chickens with their head cut off.  Our table was sticky, it took forever to get a drink and even longer to have our order taken.  The food took forever to come out, and when it did, we got two bowls of rice with it.  Weird cause we ordered appetizers.  Then, some other server came over with lo mein and set it on our table saying it was a mistake for another table and free for us.  OK.  Weird again.  We had to flag our server down for re-fills, waited forever for our bill and again for him to run the cards.  Luckily we were not in a hurry or there would have been an even bigger issue.  The managers were nowhere to be seen and the hostesses were talking in a group at the front of the restaurant.  Shouldn't they be walking around helping?? It was a crazy debacle.  I love their food, but the service will make me not go back in there for a while.
