My sister and I shared fried chicken wings, shrimp dumpling noodles, and seafood fried noodles, and all 3 dishes were excellent! We especially enjoyed the seafood fried noodles, the noodles are at the perfect consistency, tender in most parts but also crispy too. Portion size is decent, despite their deliciousness we couldn't finish them all, so will have some yummy leftover for tomorrow.
