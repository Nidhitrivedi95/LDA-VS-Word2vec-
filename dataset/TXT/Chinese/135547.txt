QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg i consider myself adventurous when it comes to food. i'll try most foods at least once before i pass judgement. so when the gals of the carlynton cougars ladies lunch said let's try mintt, i was like, alright, finally, somewhere new & exciting! we meet every 4-6 weeks, & they're pretty much a "meat & potatoes" group. we end up at same couple of places. aaaahhhh!!!
i checked the menu online to see what i was in for. it was a busy morning of menu & looking up words i had no idea what they meant. the menu was huge! i made myself a "cheat sheet" so i could converse somewhat intelligently!
from the outside it looks nice-no walls, all glass, & the sun shining on them made it look quite inviting. once inside though, it was dark, dreary. it was painted black & had very bad lighting. the host(?) took us to a table, plopped down glasses & a pitcher of water, & left. we sat..... finally, the host came close enough for me to flag him down. annoyed, he came over. i only got out-could we have some menus. buffet he said, & left. we wanted some pop, iced tea, nope. so off we went to the buffet.
1 of the pet peeves i have about food is a buffet! i don't care how many "snot guards" there are, it is not enough!!! this place was filled with ALOT of kids getting their own food! oh heck no! there is no guard against them! oh, i was becoming more excited as i approached the line! so it's dark, feels dirty & germy, & there are only 5-7 signs with food names on them. all the other dishes were crap shoots on what it was! & none of it was what i had written down! almost everything had a sauce on it. i did try several things, but honestly, i was not impressed. the flavor profiles seemed off to me. if that's what indian food tastes like, well then, i doubt i will give it another try. plus, the "staff" was kind of rude & well, not helpful. some of the girls eventually found the pop in a case, underneath, behind.....do they not want to make a sale?
