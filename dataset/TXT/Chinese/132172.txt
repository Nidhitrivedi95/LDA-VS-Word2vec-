PMsqD6wHCfxdrZkGXIepvA Another great experience at mandarin.  Great staff - even a little too friendly- because I end up saying hello 3-4 times to the same waiters over and over to a point I wished they made an effort to remember my face... So their efforts to stay friendly seems somewhat forced BUT I still enjoy coming here and the food is great !!
