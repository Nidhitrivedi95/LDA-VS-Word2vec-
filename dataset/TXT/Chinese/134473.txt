Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Flavourful, savory Indian food!  We ordered lamb vindaloo, chicken chattanadu, and mixed veggie curry.  The dishes were spicy, as requested (just make sure that you let them know if you want mild, medium or spicy).  

Lamb vindaloo had depth that it often lacks at many restaurants, and the chattanadu was amazing!  Definitely recommend the mango lassi.

The prices are very reasonable ...and we came here another time during lunch (this time for dinner)....they have amazingly-cheap lunch specials...great value!

Our waitress was extremely attentive and helpful.  even gave us a 25% coupon off at the yonge n bloor location (since we live downtown).

We recommend Everest. Along with Trimurti (Queen/University) and Indian Rice Factory (by DuPont station), among our favourite Toronto Indian restaurants.
