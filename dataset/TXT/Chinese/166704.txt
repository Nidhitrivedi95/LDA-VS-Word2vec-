vede55OuMkwUNd4wnr8GqA Will suffice to fill bellies in a pinch, but this location is definitely bellow standards of Mandarins in the 416 or the Woodbine location.   Perhaps it's a cynical view of upper-905ers as undemanding provincials who are content with the AYCE bang-for-buck and an array of multi-colored dishes?OK. I understand Mandarin is not gourmet cuisine, but it's usually pretty good for what it is, I'm just holding it to it's own standard.

On our group visit, the ribs & spareribs  fared the best, especially the Honey Garlic so tender even the bones could be eaten. The Green Beans sauteed in garlic & chili was also very good as was the Spicy Chicken.  Old war horses like Lo Mein, Shanghai Noodles, Lemon Chicken & General Tso  & Tepanyaki chicken were tolerable, though you could do better at a Mom & Pop shop at any Asian mall or supermarket. Black pepper Steak, Curry Chicken & Spicy Noodles were a total fail even with low expectations.

But the worst stuff was the BBQ counter. In other Mandarins the meat samplers from the grill are very high quality meat - I'd say better than places like Milestones, Montana & Pickle Barrel - but here the steak was a dry, rubbery choke hazard and the Chicken wasn't much better. Prime rib was OK and sausage was decent although dry and maybe a little old. So for those who didn't like the Wok offerings, only the Prime Rib, Crab Legs & Garlic Bread were safe - as long as you didn't add the chili sauce which was horribly sour and stale (think Ajvar cut with vinager & tonic water) 

I didn't notice any of the service problems others have mentioned. If anything I'd say the staff was above average in terms of friendliness and body language, I think because it's smaller and less busy than a Mandarin in Toronto there is not as much stress & pressure on the them, it's a nicer vibe.  But that's a small consolation prize for the borderline food.
