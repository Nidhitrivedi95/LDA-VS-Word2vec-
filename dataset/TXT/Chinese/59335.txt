DIxgItsSI9QwX9H8lVptYg I gotta give it to this location, the food is way better than any other place I had order. Got the won ton soup, pepper & garlic shrimp, HK style crispy noodle and sesame chicken (the best of orange chicken w/sesame) it was all really good and no complaints from me. Found an awesome chinese delivery that might just beat some of the chinese place I have tried in Chinatown.
