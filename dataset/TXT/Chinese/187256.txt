yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Im just A-OK about this place.

Props for it being open 24/7...and its a spot where my friends and I go to when were not sober...specifically around 4-6 AM in the morning. I can eat pho anytime...and pretty much everyday. I love pho & I love it even more when Im not sober. THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I KNOW whether its a guud pho place. Going intoxicated to a restaurant is similar to wearing beer goggles when checking out chicks. They all look/taste that much better. Coming to Pho Kim Long...yah i was intoxicated...so I should love the food even more right? For me, it was a No. I was satisfied (but not too satisfied), it was just A-OK, and I was starving like a hungry hippo.

Service was great though, but the food was just A-OK for me.

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^
