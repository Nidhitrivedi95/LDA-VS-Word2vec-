The only thing that made me angry is when the owner stopped handing out free refills to customers.  This isn't something you do to your customers (let alone regulars).  If it wasn't for the great food, I would not return.  The owner is an a-hole to his waiters (then again, I don't see any American ones now), steals their tips.  If you get an American, please hand her the tips.  This man thinks he's entitled to the tip if he glances at you from across the room.
