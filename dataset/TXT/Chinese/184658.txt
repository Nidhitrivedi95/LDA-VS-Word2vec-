xVHzCbDWCwmyavF5PgJRmg I've lived in this area since the summer of 2011 and I walk by this place almost everyday. Most places like this on Yonge street are complete dives -- well, I guess this one is too -- but a charming dive! I didn't go inside until a few weeks ago when I had a craving for chinese food. I'm glad I did!  It's so close to my apartment and now it will become my regular chinese food joint. 

It's cheap, decent, and close! 

I'm a fan.
