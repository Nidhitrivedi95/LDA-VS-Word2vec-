came in at 1130am for sunday dim sum and ordered 10 typical dim sum selections, as the regulars of this cuisine are well aware of.

items ordered from menu, no carts...the kitchen made everything on demand based on the order ticket, which has its pros (fresh, hot and very tasty morsels) and cons (when the walk ins started coming in your order may take longer than expected). everything was well seasoned and not overly salty (leaving you with the typical MSG thirst as with other eateries)

quality and flavor are at least comparable to main Chinatown dim sum eateries in a very clean environment, courteous staff

however, I recommend coming in early for dim sum and order all your items at one time so the kitchen ticket will be prioritized before other orders that come in subsequent to yours. We ordered baked bao and after a half hour wait, told the waiter to cancel it since we were done with our meal. When he settled the bill, the brought us the order, on the house!

definite should try spot
