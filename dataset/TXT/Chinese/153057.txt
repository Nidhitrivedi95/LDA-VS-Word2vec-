t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg Came into this place actually only because I was unable to find the restaurant I was looking for. I explained it was my first time trying them and asked to look at their menu. My 5 year old loves fried rice and chow mein. I asked if there was any way they could please make a combo plate with just fried rice and chow mein and they said NO! Lol! I can't believe that. Money wasn't an object and I am very surprised that this was an issue. Especially considering there wasn't anyone else in this entire place. Will not be returning.
