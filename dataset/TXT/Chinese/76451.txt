G7Ull-QUaNXyPwtEErHZ8g Agreed with the rest of the reviews which I should have read first. Steamed won tons dry, tough, and bland; chow mien noodles overcooked, bland, dry; shrimp tasted old and fishy and like the mud vein wasn't cleaned out; portion sizes on the small size for the typical Chinese restaurant although they were enough. I usually like to have some left for lunch the next day. Mongolian beef was also bland and barely spicy for a spicy dish.

On the positive side, we received 2 egg-rolls that we didn't order.

The price was probably average but very high for the quality of food received. 

We were quoted 30-45 minutes but it took about an hour to be delivered.

Overall disappointed and will definitely be trying somebody else next time.
