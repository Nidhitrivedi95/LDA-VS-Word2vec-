OfqTPtPSQfCVxaSlY4qAxg As much as I want to provide this place with some love....well I can't!

I think the food here is pretty authentic and good; if you're willing to wait for it.  My buddy and I ordered their pan fried noodles with beef, bbq pork, and peking duck.  Needless to say the bbq pork was pretty good.  Our noodles and duck, well we ate it at  home since it took so long for it to come out.  Needless to say, I was content with my noodles and the peking duck was what I expected it should be.  In the end, having to bring my food home after waiting really put a damper for my dining experience.  

I think if they would hire more help it would definitely alleviate some service woes.  The food is good and authentic.  The place needs a makeover for sure, but I guess you should expect that from a dive Chinese food joint! - Enjoy!
