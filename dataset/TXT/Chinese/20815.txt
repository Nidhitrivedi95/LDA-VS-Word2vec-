67IWr5jwskv0-RwWAhkTaA Food came out room temperature. The portion was very small and way over priced. Definitely nothing fresh about it. Tasted like it came out of a box that I could've thrown together at home for a few dollars. Gave it a total of 2 starts bc 1) it was edible and 2) the staff seemed friendly (not professional by any means, you could def tell they didn't want to be there, but they at least pretended to care about my experience to my face)... my daughter enjoyed her meal however I could have made it at home for much less. Definitely won't be returning here ever again. Save your money!
