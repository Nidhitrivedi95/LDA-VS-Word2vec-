OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I'm surprised I have not reviewed Chang's yet. This is my favorite Dim Sum joint in the city. 

I usually come right at 11 when they open and there are already people waiting at the door. Because it's still early, we get good seats and the food is hot and fresh. We are in and out in 30 minutes. 

The dim sum is better than other places in LV I have tried. I especially like pork spareribs, pork dumplings and egg custard tarts

I agree service can be a bit off sometimes. For all the times I've been here, it has been 80% good and 20% poor. But keep in mind I am ordering and speaking to them in Cantonese. 

I would like to note old-school Chinese restaurants like Chang's don't really specialize in great service, it's get in, eat and get out.
