I judge a place harshly on their soup dumplings, their pho and their pad Thai. 

I got the soup dumplings, the Vietnamese egg rolls (they come with 4 I just had to eat one before I took the pic) and the pho. All amazing. The pho was really flavorful (I got the combo minus the tripe). 

They make their own hot oil in house which was amazing. My friend added it to her soy sauce and it was too good. 

I need to get the pad Thai next time. 

If you're looking for a low cost Noodle house and are in south side, I recommend this place.
