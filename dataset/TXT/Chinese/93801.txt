J7rkQISD48jXgdM6UxNAbw Love love love Yoko's!!! I used to go here in college and high school. I moved away and finally went back 10 years later and the good still tastes the same! If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Food is delicious, my fav is the house of beef. Orange chicken and Kam paogee? Is good. So is their seafood bowl and their ragoons. Friendly people. Highly recommend!!!
