1FL3oE2mqq_EFAYPd1TWUg A friend and I went here a few weeks back after stumbling across it on our way to another place for lunch. It has a fairly unassuming front and seemed like a good spot to try.

I wish it were a tad cleaner on the inside. 

Prices were reasonable.

Dumplings: We had the trio of pan fried and boiled. They were all pretty good but when you have them all on the plate in no particular order, we couldn't tell what we were eating until we bit into them. So I ended up eating all of one kind instead of trying all of them.

We also ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein was was excellent. I'm a huge noodle fan and this dish just hit the spot. The noodles were crispy and just soggy enough where the sauce was. Only complaint was there were more toppings than noodles.

Next time I come here I will NOT be sharing the noodles with anyone!
