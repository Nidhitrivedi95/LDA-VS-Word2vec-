W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ The service was OK. I had the poser Logan and it had a strong unpleasant vinegar taste. When I order a pork ramen I expect it to be rich and fatty which I did not get from this ramen. I asked for chili oil and red pepper flakes but all they had was Sambal and sriracha. I will not be coming back.
