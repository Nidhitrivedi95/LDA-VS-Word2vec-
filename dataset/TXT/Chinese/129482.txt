We were seated right away by the host and our waiter gave us a good service! He explained that the restaurant is combined with 3 cultures; Peruvian, Japanese and Brazilian being it was our first time. He was attentive, kept checking on us and refilling our waters.

I recommend SEARED KOBE! Yummy in my tummy.

I wouldn't mind coming back here again. Its a little pricey but you pay for what you get. This place attracts more of high spenders and some people have complain about the servers being degrading and rude if you didn't look the part. And I can totally see that happening here...usually in high end places.
