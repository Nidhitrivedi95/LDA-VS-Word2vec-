I had the Shrimp Wonton Noodle and the wontons (four in each bowl) were packed with shrimp and the noodles were freshly made. Adding a bit soy chilli to it was a good mixture for a hint of spice because it can get really spicy and sweaty but can always request for more tissue as they are friendly servers. 

Served in fairly medium sized bowls and is comfortable spot to eat and kill time or as a fast meal. The menu is pretty straight forward can choose from Lo Mein to Noodles in soup with choice of noodles such as egg noodle, rice noodle, or vermicelli with either sliced beef or beef balls, cuttle/dace fish balls, or shrimp wonton/dumpling etc. Price range (~$5.75-$6.50) is a little pricy for serving size but can definitely make up for quality. The shrimp wonton noodles hasn't let me down!
