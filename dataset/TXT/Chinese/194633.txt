ZGpT6rcgSsJ4GxwTHbvvJw So disappointed . Spent $78 on dinner here.. if you like frozen and then reheated Chinese food or if you think Chinese food from the frozen food aisle at your grocery store is way to good for you and ur desperately searching for something worse than that then congratulations this is your place for sure.  I'm sorry but it was gross. I regret everything. 
Thank you for reading, sorry to ruin your meal plans.. or make them... who knows? it takes all kinds right?
