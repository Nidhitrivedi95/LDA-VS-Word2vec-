q7jC-6uH7IieKu8PcT2gBA My husband and I occasionally order takeout for lunch from China House. It is conveniently located for us and there is adequate parking for the restaurant as well as the businesses surrounding it. The food was ready in the length of time they mentioned on the phone, and this was my first experience picking it up from the restaurant.  As soon as I walked in the door, there was a young girl who instantly asked if she could help me and quickly found our takeout meals and rang up the order. I quickly glanced around the restaurant and I was expecting it to be busier around the the time of day I was there, noontime; however there was only two people dining in. My take on the limited business inside was that they lacked color and decor to add character to the place and that most customers have the same thought as us, purchase and take out. 

My go-to Chinese meal is General Tsos with fried rice. I really enjoy the chicken, broccoli, and sauce; however, I am not a fan of the chewy (dried) peppers that typically add some heat to the dish. I am not keen on the egg rolls or the hot and sour soup and will regularly pass them on to my husband. What brings us back is that the prices are very reasonable for lunch and for the amount of food that we receive, usually providing each of us with two meals. I am sure we will continue with our occasional appearance but will unlikely stray from our go-to dish.
