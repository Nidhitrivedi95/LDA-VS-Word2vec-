a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg The food here was decent. The service on the other hand was horrible. I know it's downtown Vegas and not on the strip but I expected better. Our food was mediocre and came out warm, not hot. I wouldn't recommend this place unless your starving and playing in the casino and you win a comp.
