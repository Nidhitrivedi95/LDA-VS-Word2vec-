eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g We went here for my mom's birthday and ordered the two people seafood platter (not sure what is exactly called because my parents ordered the food) 
The environment ambiance was very fancy and high class. The washrooms were extremely fancy, had a hotel feel. 
The food on the other hand was not as fancy as expected. The cool thing was they bring out your seafood out alive and show you how big it is (and they are absolutely huge!) The food did have nice presentation, but the taste was mediocre, and was not any better than the other cheaper seafood places we've been to. So that was very disappointing for me.
Overall I think this is a nice restaurant to go to on special occasions to treat yourself and family. 
But for the price and quality of food we got I wouldn't come back.
