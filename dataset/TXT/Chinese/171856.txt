VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Let me start off by saying I am in the food and beverage industry myself, so I am extremely patient and understanding when it comes to dealing with a busy/ bad server. 

However, I only stopped by flo's to order some take-out on a rainy night. When I arrrived, the place was packed and so loud that I coudn't not hear anyone talking to me! I walked up to the bar and waited for about 10 mins (like I said, I get it, there are busy! I can wait my turn) Then the bartneder finally turned to me and asked what i wanted. I said a to-go order and she told me that I would have to go to the hostess station....would have been nice to know 15 mins ago. So after wating in line again, i placed my order, veggie spring rolls and lettcue wraps. They told me it would be ready in 15 mins. I waited in starbucks right next door. 

After about 20 mins, I went back to check on my food. I asked a girl up front if it was ready, she said "she didnt do to-go orders" ok??? so i asked another girl up front and she said it wasnt ready yet. After another 15 min wait, I finally asked again if it was ready and they girl turned around and grabbed a bag off the counter and said here it is! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!! IT WAS THERE THE ENTIRE TIME!  I told her my food was now cold and soggy.... but she conviently didn't hear me say it. 

I threw it away in the garbage can outside... There goes 15 dollars down the drain.  No wonder the hostess insisted that I paid prior to recieving my food. I'm sure too many unhappy customers would walk out without taking their food home. I would have!!!

I will never go back to Flo's and do not suggust anyone else goes their either. The service is horrible and the food is not worth the $. No wonder they have to give away 5$ lunches. Even if I had complained, I'm not sure anyone would have cared. 

Trust me, save your $. You're better off going to Panda Express.
