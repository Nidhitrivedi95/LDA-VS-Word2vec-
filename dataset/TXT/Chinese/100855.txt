K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw Tiniest place. Super cramped. Really odd hours. Really authentic food.

Highlights:

Like all of their desserts, especially their steamed durian glutinous rice one. Delicious durian cream/paste/filling on top with a slightly salty glutinous rice. Sweet and salty and incredibly durian flavored. Oh so good. And cheap too. I think it's like $1.10 or something a piece? Get here early though! Weekends only and most of their desserts are usually sold out by 3:00pm. Side note for desserts. You can order their steamed desserts even when the store isn't open. You have to order the entire steamed container though (40 ish pieces). We've done it before. Boxes and boxes of durian goodness. So much love there. Pre-order though, days if not a week in advance.

Durian milkshake - only available in the summer. Also incredibly durian flavored and very well priced. I'm sensing a theme here.

Laksa - I'm not a fan of their roti or their curry chicken, but One2Snacks introduced me to laksa with two kinds of noodles. It makes for an awesome mouth feel.

Cheung fun - steamed rice noodle rolls served covered in a sweet sauce. Also included in the mix are an assortment of fish balls and some pieces of bean curd sheet. Makes for a good substantial snack or light meal.

Side note: Bryan, who is usually at the counter, is super friendly. He's also the one who will be the one to break your heart and tell you there aren't any desserts left. =(
