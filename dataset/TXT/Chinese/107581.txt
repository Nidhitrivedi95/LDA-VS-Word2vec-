LbeJgPgKKHw5qH0f02NHEQ This place gets 1 star from me. I used do be a frequent customer about 2 times a month since I live down town and it's usually excellent. Well this time I got general tso, egg roll, crab wonton. General tso chicken was so mushy and the sauce was thick like it was left over from the night before. The crab wonton were so over cooked you could not rip them apart and when I finally did there was hardly any filling. Only thing that was ok was the egg roll. I called and complained because Chinatown Inn is expensive and since I was not going to eat it I wanted my money back. My Roomate got chicken Lomein and egg roll. She returned hers as well. Her Lomein was gummy and no flavor. We got back they were rude and accused us of eating half of it when there was 3 prices of chicken out of it and now in my garbage can. I told them to charge me for the egg roll because that's the only thing that's was good. They did but they were not happy about refunding us. Never returning terrible experience, terrible attitude about their own product.
