uHyvmKKhKM0sip12o4HyFA Went here for Christmas '12 with a group of 18 people. I mad reservations like a week before. The only complaint is they tried to fit us into 1 table which is cool and all... But thinking I mad a reservation they would give us a better table. It was close to the entrance and people passing by I kept having to get up for people with strollers and wheelchairs. 

So got there around 10:30am (our reservation was at 10am). I'm glad they still kept the table for us considering its Christmas and its really busy. Ordered a lot of dim sum before 11am. They have an early bird special where the S,M,L are all $2.50 each. The food was delicious and steaming hot. I liked ordering with the sheet Cuz I don't have to flag ppl down and I can just chill and chat with the ppl I'm with. And food with just come. There wasn't one dish I have a complaint about. Catch for the early bird specialis you must pay cash. Im glad I brought enough cash that day for a group of 18. It was my treat lol. Btw, the decor inside looks beautiful.not like the avg dim sum place where it kinda looks.... Um trashy?
