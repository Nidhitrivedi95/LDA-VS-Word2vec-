My friend wanted somewhere to go for a girl to girl conversation over chinese dessert and i had heard of this place by another friend so off we went. It was a sunday night and surprisingly super packed. The tables here are really huge, like big squares really and they're spaced out quite far so you don't feel cramped. 

I ordered the sago/black jelly w coconut milk which came to my table sans black jelly. I thought it meant there was sago and black jelly but apparently it was one or the other. I never specified and the server never asked so I guess they felt like a sago night. The sago pearls weren't cooked long enough in my opinion... still too much chew.

My friend ordered the fried popcorn chicken and a waffle w fruit and ice cream. Good amount of fried chicken and the waffle came out w a mountain of ice cream, whipped cream and various sliced fruits adorning it all.

The servers were quite nice and attentive. there is nothing really wrong w this place and for the area, it serves it's purpose but I think I would head up to hwy 7 dessert places for the extra 10 min drive.
