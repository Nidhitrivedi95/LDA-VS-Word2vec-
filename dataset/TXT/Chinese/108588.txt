LjCrhp_Rys2bCIJHz5EGBA Haven't been to this place in about 10 years . . . and it was exactly like I remembered it . . . even to the pale green walls . . . how sad.

This place has a very limited buffet menu and I tried about 7 of the 10 items . . . so here we go . . .
Fried Won Ton . . . Nothing Special
Vegetable Chow Main . . . Tasted more like Spaghetti than Chow Mein Noodles
Vegetable Fried Rice . . . Bland White Rice with Vegetables
Orange Chicken . . . This was actually pretty good . . . SURPRISE
Vegatable Egg Roll . . . Luke warm and more wrapper than filling
Deep Fried Zuccini . . . Cold
Sweet and Sour Pork . . . Runny Sauce and Fried Pork lacked and flavor

So in a nut shell . . . Food on the lower end of the scale . . . Price was CHEAP . . . and that is why it got 2 stars.  It might be another 10 years before I come back again.
