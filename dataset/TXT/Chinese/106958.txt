L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA came here mainly because they close late and we were hungry. we ordered mongolian beef, kung pao chicken and their wonton noodle soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-noodle-and-chinese-barbeque-las-vegas?select=8UiNNR3cVaxzUVHi3UoCDw#_ZG9jqs7lvtN91AgXe23Ww). the mongolian beef and kung pao chicken dishes were okay, but i wouldnt recommend the wonton noodle soup. 

service is great and the food comes out quick.
