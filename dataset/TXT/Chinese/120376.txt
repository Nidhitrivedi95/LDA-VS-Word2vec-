Being of Chinese descent, I know what's good dim sum, and Rol San just doesn't serve it. Believe me, people. The food here is dry, bland and lame. So not worth the calories.

Okay, maybe it wasn't good because I went during off-peak hours?  But then again, I did order a non-dim sum item, and that was also bland and lame. So there.

You want good dim sum? Go up north to the burbs like Richmond Hill, Markham, etc. Spring Villa and Sam Woo are good. I loved Ambassador, but sadly it closed :( 

I know going to the boonies for good dim sum is a pain, which is why I rarely go anymore. Sigh. 

But if there is someone else here of Chinese descent who knows of a good dim sum place in Toronto's Chinatown (or near downtown), please tell me where. Pleeeeease...

:(
