ooZQt0jRqrJ_ejhjP8C4Mg if I could give this place a NEGATIVE star I would! I ordered the Shanghai Beef, was told it would be 1.00 more, they "padded" it with a HUGE pile of kung pau chicken. This was for my 3 year old, I saw the beef on top, gave him his food...then I heard SCREAMING!!!!!!!!! He bit into a pepper....REAL nice Panda REAL nice
