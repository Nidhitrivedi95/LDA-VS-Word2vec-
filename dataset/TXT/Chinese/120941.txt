O3PiNOj1vv5dCCywdw3_og I was very pleased with my call in/carryout order 2night.  They got our order for 4 completely RIGHT.  In the fast food service of 2016, this is RARE.  We were tired, hungry and, after devouring our fresh, hot, yummy Panda food....everyone was satisfied!!  Great food...great service!!  (Generous portions, too!)  Thanks, crew there at Panda 2night!!
