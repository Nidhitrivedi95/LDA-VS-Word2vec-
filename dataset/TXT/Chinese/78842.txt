GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Boyfriend and I made our way here after the Marquee Dayclub, so take that as you please on my tastebud judgements. 

We were starving but knew we had a dinner to get to later with his family so we came for mostly a snack to hold us over. We ordered:

- Traditional Siu Mai
- Carnitas Taco
- Swallow a Cloud

I wish we could have ordered more to try other things because I was super happy with what we got. 

Traditional Siu Mai doesn't taste all traditional like you would get at a real dim sum place, but it was still pretty good in its own Vegas Chinese Mexican restaurant type of way. 

Carnitas Taco....bf and I cheers with the chicharron they put on top and enjoyed a pretty delicious taco with an awesome salsa verde. But $6 for one taco hurts the heart a little bit. But what can you do...it's Vegas. 

Swallow a Cloud (wonton soup basically) kind of surprised me. I didn't have high expectations for it and just thought it was going to be a salty mess. Wontons were flavorful, broth wasn't too salty and noodles were just right and not too soggy. But of course $16 is pretty rough to pay for a small portion of soup. 

Overall, pretty good dining experience. Service was friendly, but didn't refill on my water often. Food was delicious, but definitely overpriced. But because it's Vegas, I'd probably end up back here again the next time I'm in town.
