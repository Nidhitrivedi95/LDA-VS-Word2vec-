ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg 3.5 - I'm a true believer that all great dim sum places never score above 4 stars for some reason. 

Came during CNY weekend and of course this place was PACKED. But the woman manning the front did a great job with taking names and in all actuality we only had to wait for about 15 minutes for a table. 

Standard dim sum dishes. But a notable dish is their crab ball. At many other dim sum restaurants, their balls are mostly the crispy outside, but at Li Wah, they're mostly crab!
