wbJQWVyJKTUh9ryZ4jUgwg my wife and I ate her last night when we found out our usual Chinese joint was under construction. We were a little leary but everything was GREAT. The place was clean and classy. We had eggrols, crab rangoon, mongolian, beef and kan-bo chicken. THIS WAS THE BEST CHINESE I HAVE EVER EATEN. No kidding, the best. The crab rangoon had real crab and cream cheese. The chicken and beef were awesome. We will definitely be back.
