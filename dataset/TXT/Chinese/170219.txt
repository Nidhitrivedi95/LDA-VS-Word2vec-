VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q I have been to this place several times and because their main selling point (I would say) is that they have soup base that has no MSG in it! Wow - it takes really good and I generally like their original fish soup with noodles. 

The style works in a "Step 1-2-3" process where you order your noodles, pick out your meats, select a drink, and any side orders if you choose to.

Very delicious and usually it does get quite busy. As per like the other photos already posted, everything is quite similar as it is so not much variations. 

Hot drinks I order the hk style milk tea which is generally my go-to drink in Chinese places anyways. This is a nice place you'd have for an easy and quick lunch. I never came for dinner before however.
