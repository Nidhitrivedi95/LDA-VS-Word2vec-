S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ My friends took me here. I guess this place serves primarily Vietnamese food and some Thai food. One of the things I like about this place is that their entire menu is in pictoral form so you can discern what you are actually eating.

I mistakenly thought we were eating family style but we actually ate our own individual dishes. My friend ordered appetizers: cripsy fried egg rolls and these interesting gelatin things topped with some orange stuff in a tiny dish. It was good when you add the fish sauce on top of it. I also ordered Pho Tai. It was pretty good due to its hearty beef broth. At least they give you large glasses of water. The decor is pretty interesting, at least it is not drab like many vietnamese restaurants.

Overall this place is much better than some of the typical Vietnamese places in terms of cleanliness.  If you compare Vietnamese restaurants, this is probably a better place to eat due to its cleaner environment. I would say that I would have rated this place a 3.5 stars.

It would be interesting if I ever came back here, I would be curious to try their sandwiches.
