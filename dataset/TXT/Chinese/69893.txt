f0zHPEwKLf3Aguf_IDemRQ Most underated restaurant in toronto. We live in new york and would love to see a restaurant like this there. The noodles were super tasty, fresh, light and big portions and the place was beautiful, industrial and pretty minimal. We had the dan dan noodles and the cold shuan noodles-both excellent. Will definitely come back!
