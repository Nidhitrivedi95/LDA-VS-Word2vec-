We definitely needed some Asian comfort food.  Just the thought of their delicious noodle makes my mouth water.


We came as a group of 7.  We had the shu mai and har gow.  They were decent.

I ordered the beef stew noodles (one of my fav comfort foods) and it was really delicious and SPICY!  

My friends ordered the won ton soup.  Delicious!  The fried spare rib noodles were really good too.


There were soooo many items on the menu that I wanted to try.  The chicken broth... the fish congee.... even the almond tofu dessert. 

I will definitely stop here on my next trip to Vegas!!! Highly recommended.

It's a little pricey but still affordable.
