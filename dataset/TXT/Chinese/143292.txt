rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g I ordered 3 sets of baked pork bun (char siu bao) total of 9 buns.  The first two, I took two bites each without tasting any of the char siu pork.  After my family ate their share we all agreed the there might have been only 1/2 teaspoon of filling each.  Phoenix Palace sure are stingy with their filings and lack quality.  Time to find another place for dim sum.
