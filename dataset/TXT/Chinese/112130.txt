MeEvtL0DA11Vla25vix_0A Came here with my family and ordered a bunch of dumplings since I was told it was their specialty. I don't know the exact names of the dishes since I didn't do the ordering so excuse the vagueness of this review. 

All the steamed dumplings we ordered were amazing. The pan fried ones were good too but I noticed the skin was much thicker and chewier so that kind of took away from the flavor. 

We ordered the lamb skewers which were really good but a bit fatty. We also ordered the cucumber and jellyfish salad (very refreshing among all the great and heat) and the spicy pork intestines (be careful eating the hot peppers - I don't know exactly what this is called, but when you eat it, it makes part of your tongue feel like it's a bit numb). 

Service was okay (general Chinese restaurant service), but the food was prompt. 

I definitely think it's a place worth checking out if you like dumplings.
