U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q I love noodles, all kinds of noodles and have eaten oodles of handmade noodles (in China  too).  Take a pass.  The noodles were okay, but the broth and sauces were bland and lacked flavor.  And for the prices they charge here, you're better off going somewhere else.  I was clearly suckered in by the word "Beijing" and the prop noodles in the display case.  Don't be tricked by the random 4 - 5 star review...it's just more props.  

The only plus, the scenery is super pretty and I suspect what you're actually paying for is the pretty goldfish in the tanks.
