WEw08dCcOiwH3Sw1f_8DKQ Just went here for lunch with my partner, after hearing it recommended by a friend, and I'm really glad we checked it out. I'll definitely be coming back! 

They have a lot of dishes that were not so familiar with me - I think with the Muslim connection, they're Western Chinese? But I always love trying new things, so that was a plus! And everything we had was really good. 

The very best thing was the steamed lamb dumplings - SO GOOD! I don't even normally eat red meat, but they had so many lamb things on the menu, and all the scents of the food around us smelled so good, I decided this worth a compromise, and it totally was. They make magic with lamb here!

I had the spicy tofu lunch special, and while it wasn't actually all that spicy - somewhat, yes, but my standard for "spicy" tends to be many other people's standard for "incendiary" - it was really tasty, and came with a side dish of cold edamame, which was nice too.

My partner got chicken with chestnuts, which was also very nice - I'd never encountered chestnuts in Chinese food before, but they went really well in it. Their sweetness made a nice balance to the savoury sauce. Again, not too highly seasoned, but still very good.

Service was very quick, too, which is good when you're on lunch break from work as I was. All in all, quite a nice find, and I'll definitely be back.
