SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
I like going here because they Have good food it is usually fresh and they have Sushi and a Mongolian grill too. They also have other foods like steak, pizza, French fries, enchiladas...
lots of desert choices including hand dipped ice cream!
It is about 10.49 per person plus drink price
GREAT FOR GROUPS TOO
