L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA I just flew in from out of town that afternoon...and after a lazy evening of napping, talking, and kind of getting pretty, we finally made it out to grub before we hit the strip.  I have a pretty much constant craving for asian noodle soup, so we decided to go to Chinatown, since my Vegas resident friend said that it was the ONLY place to get asian food.  

We randomly drove down the street and saw this place..."Cafe NOODLE...blah blah blah."  That was the place for me!  It was around midnight, and we were dressed up in very small pieces of clothing, but the waiters still made us feel comfortable.  He pointed us to the Beef Brisket & Egg Noodle Soup, so that's what we got (me without wontons and my friend with wontons).  

We weren't expecting much...after all....we just found any place with noodle soup and got whatever was suggested. But MAN...it was GOOOOOODDDDD!!!!!!! The broth....beefy goodness without feeling overwhelmed by the beefiness.  The noodles were JUST the right texture  to complement the beefy broth.  And there were HUGE chunks of beef, the kinf that breaks apart easily and it attached to a huge piece of tendon/fat.  I know it's bad, but i've always specifically loved those fatty/tendony pieces of meat.  I got like....10 huge pieces in that little bowl!!!   It was...to die for.  So good, that we both ate the whole thing, were so full that we wanted to sleep, and we decided to go home instead of go clubbing. hahaha.  Any food that can do that to a couple of club girls MUST be amazing.  

Next time I'm in Vegas i'm going to make her take me again ;)
