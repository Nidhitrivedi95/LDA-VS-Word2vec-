8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ Waited in line for over an hour. It seems like no matter how long the line is people wait, so we decided maybe it was really worth the wait. It was overall - mediocre. 

The atmosphere was nice. Big and busy! The food comes out at a relatively good pace. Ordered few items - har gow, shu mai, deep fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce, baked bbq pork puff pastry, beef ribs with honey and lemon sauce and finally pork and shrimp spring rolls.

My highlights were the - baked BBQ pork puff pastry, hargow and shumai. The steamed items were VERY filling, more filling less of the dough. The puff pastry was DELICIOUS! The best I have ever had.. 

I spaced out with the deep fried won tons and thought it was something else when it wasnt. So that was not appealing. Everything else was meh, nothing outstanding. I also order that uhmmm rice noodle dough roll thing - it never came. So we took that off of our order. 

Would I wait another time for an hour to go here? Probably not, I would try and make reservations first. None the less it is not going to be my Go-To... but also everyone should experience it once..
