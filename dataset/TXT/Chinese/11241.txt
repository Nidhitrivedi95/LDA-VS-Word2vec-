2FImjoBv0qvq9NumhcVOyA Orders: Combo C - appetizer platter (2 shrimp skewers, 3 beef skewers, 3 chicken skewers, 2 spring rolls cut into 8 pieces), lemon grass chicken (there is pork option), curry shrimp (choice of yellow or green curry), tom yum soup, green beans and shrimp, hainan chicken, roti (1 piece)

Pros: lemon grass chicken, green curry shrimp (spicy and yummy but could be better with a bit or curry flavour), roti (flaky and chewy just the way I like it)

Cons:
- tom yum soup (taste like packaged powder cooked with some tomatos, mushrooms, shrimp, squid and basil)
- hainan chicken (no chicken taste, green onion and ginger dipping sauce had no kick nor flavour .. if you know your hainan chicken, do not order this here)
- roti (bc it came with 1 piece for a combo meal for 3-4 people ... the piece is size of a small dish ... not enough to share if you really want to enjoy every spoonful of curry there is)
- lemon grass chicken (just bc i ordered pork and they gave me chicken)
- $2 for 1 bowl of rice ... debatable yes but considering we had to order 2 bowls for not enough roti... 

Service: not terrible but did not enjoy the eavesdropping during the whole time I was there.  They listen to every whispered order decision we made rather than let my group discuss.  

Overall, 2nd time here but probably won't be coming back.  Other than curry, i don't really recommend anything else much here.  Also, TIP, all roti orders come with 1 roti... trust me, it's not enough to wrap the dish + mop up the curry.
