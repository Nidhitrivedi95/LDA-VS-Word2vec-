Pretty extensive menu
Portions are good

Cons:
You won't be amazed by anything

Macey's is your typical Chinese diner if you ask me.  If you're craving Chinese food, this place will get the job done.  It's not flashy and it won't wow you, but it will leave you satisfied.  We were shopping at Square 1 and were looking for a Chinese restaurant near by.  Having a Chatime in the same plaza also helps!

Macey's doesn't look big from the outside but when you walk inside, there's a lot of tables here.  They don't seem to have to many tables that can fit parties of 6 or more though. I counted about 3 of about 30 or so tables that could fit.  Just be wary if you come with a big group.

Macey's has your regular offerings for a Chinese restaurant but it also has items you would find at a HK style cafe as well.  There are some western items as well just to fill out the menu.  All in all, there should be something for everyone here.  We were feeling rice noodles so we ordered two of those to share.  

We ordered beef rice noodles with veggies and another rice noodle with beef and XO sauce.  They were not busy at the time we came so the dishes come out very quickly.  One thing I got to say is the portions here are very good!!  My GF and little one shared their plate and could only really manage a little more than half.  You will get your value here, that's for sure.  The dishes themselves were what you expect, nothing special but nothing bad as well.  

If you're feeling Chinese and in the Mississauga region, this place is a safe choice.  It won't wow you but you know what to expect.  I would recommend this place to people looking for a decent meal with out breaking the bank.
