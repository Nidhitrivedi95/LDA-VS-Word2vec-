IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Too overpriced, definitely do not recommend coming here. Our waiter was a lady who wasn't welcoming at all whatsoever. Although, the manager whose tall and slim was efficient in checking in on our table to see how we are doing rather than our actual waiter who gave attitude and slow service. I also wasn't impressed with the quality of the food. I guess I had high expectations due to their prices.  Definitely not worth it. Very clean and fancy restaurant though.
