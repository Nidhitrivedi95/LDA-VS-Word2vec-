The Kung pao had zero flavor the water chestnuts and celery pulled any and all flavor out of the dish, it had zero heat there were red chili but I think they were just put in there for show.  The walnut shrimp tasted like old flour, the sauce was just mayo, super gross.  Lesson learned will never order from here again.
