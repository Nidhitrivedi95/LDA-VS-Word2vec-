WUiDaFQRZ8wKYGLvmjFjAw Not worth it. Food is mediocre at best (2 stars) and has gotten progressively worse. During my last visit after three half-filled plates (not even close to being filled up) I was served the bill as a sign of 'you have eaten enough and we want you to go'. No goodbye on your way out (four visits, not one goodbye). 

Time to say goodbye to China Buffet and seek out an alternative.
