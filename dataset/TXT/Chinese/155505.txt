TkXmhC7ZDA5H2tebIXH2_Q My friend and I ate here for lunch on 3/15. We loved it and will go back again. I have nothing but kudos for the food and service. They had crawfish and awesome shrimp. There was nothing that I could say was bad. People are too picky. For $6.99 for lunch...all you can eat... If you complain...stay home as evidently your cooking is supreme. As for me and my friend, we will definitely let them do the cooking. The service was wonderful.
