As an alternative may I suggest the Hunan chicken (not as spicy as you'd think), the General Tso's (also not as spicy, but spicy enough for me), or the Crab Rangoon (don't even think about reheating them - they must be consumed in one sitting). 

One more thing to avoid - the low mein. It's a bit flavorless and limp. I keep trying it, hoping I just got a bad batch, but no such luck.
