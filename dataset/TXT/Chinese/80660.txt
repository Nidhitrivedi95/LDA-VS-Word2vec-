GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g Without a doubt, the best restaurant in Las Vegas.  Service top notch. Food is excellent.  Value is excellent.  I've been there three times and I won't go to Vegas without eating here.  Taking a date or someone special where you want the best, please, try it out.  I know you won't be disappointed.  For a group, order one dish less than you have in your party and share.  I love love love this place.
