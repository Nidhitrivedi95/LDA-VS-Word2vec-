9Z_6rRy7Tl_C6HIgm7y6FA The food was pretty good, but I'm not sure it's 4/5-star worthy.  We ordered two dishes - and boy did they give us a lot of food.  Unfortunately, when they say "beef with vegetables" what they mean is a pound of beef and two pieces of carrot.  I was hoping for a better ratio of meat and veggies.  Egg rolls were really really good, and they had real mustard - not that crap in the packet with the panda on it - real, burn your sinuses out mustard - praise the lord.  We ordered the crispy fried tofu - won't do that again.  The tofu was in HUGE chunks so it was like deep-fried custard cubes.  I've had fried tofu before, this didn't quite cut it.

Nothing really negative to say - the price was fine, the food was fine, and it's close.  

Biggest plus?  I have never, ever, ever been to a Chinese food restaurant where the people were as friendly. Super-nice staff - thanks for that!
