S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ Hue Thai is two different restaurants: one serves some of the most amazing sandwiches ever made on delicious French bread, the other serves decent, but completely unremarkable Vietnamese and Thai dishes.

Our table ordered Pad Thai with tofu, Curry Chicken, Thai Chicken with basil and the Beef Brisket sandwich.  The Pad Thai was sadly bland. The Curry Chicken was made with the leftover parts of the chicken after all the prize meat was used elsewhere.  And the Thai Chicken was disappointingly spice-less and made with ground chicken that had very little flavoring (the basil was fresh, though).  

But the Beef Brisket.  Oh man, the beef brisket.  That sandwich should be listed with Cappriotti's Bobbie as one of the best sandwich tastes in this town.  I am considering employing a runner part time simply to head over to Hue Thai every lunch and get me a beef brisket sandwich.  It only took one order for me to be obsessed.
