qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA When it comes to AYCE sushi, I find that the quality isn't the greatest.
Especially when paying 29.99 for dinner, which is excessive. I've been to other sushi restaurants and 29.99 is a lot, even for a weekend.
First thing, there was a hair on my breaded shrimp. 
The fried rice is extremely oily. 
The sashimi was kind of warm. 
Some of the plates weren't clean. 
Although, service is really quick and we did get all the items we ordered. 
I just wanted to try this place because there was all this hype about it.
I won't be returning. 
Too expensive for what you get.
