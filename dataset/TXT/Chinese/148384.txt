sfd19Wo_7g2TwaoJmA9B8A Don't really like this place. I hear about it from people, it's always been there. I see people eating there, but I still don't really like this place.

The pot stickers were a weird consistency and the dish was kinda on the bland side. Personally if you're in the mood for something similar I would completely and highly recommend The Mint Cafe nearly directly across the street. Juss sayin.
