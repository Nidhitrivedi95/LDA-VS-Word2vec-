XEKx5litKe1KkfJpqtmJUw Summary: busy Chinese restaurant offers classic and modern Chinese dishes in a quality, old-school manner, which includes a loud atmosphere, big portions, wide variety, and regular servers who have an easy rapport with the families that mark this as a regular go-to spot.

Top Must-get: fried rice (any)
Top Regret: running free chicken

At a time when more and more local Chinese restaurants in the area are "cha chan teng" and "customize-your-own-noodle-shops", Dong Kee stands out as an old-fashioned favourite: yes, it can be a bit oily, and yes, sometimes there's a pinch too much salt, but for the most part, your dinner dishes come as you'd expect.

Last came here on a Tuesday night - packed house. We had to wait in the narrow entry hallway to wait for a seat. We were the third group waiting - got our number (#18) at 8:18, were seated by 8:28, and had our order by 8:40 - but we only had three dishes plus a rice, so take that with a grain of salt.

The places comes with complimentary soup (varies) which is a nice touch.

The "running-free" chicken wasn't particularly special (bit dry), but still we gulped it down. They're also really generous with their ginger onion sauce, which is nice. More positively, the beef dishes, fried rice, fried noodles (ho fan), and Chinese veggies were excellent.

The sweet and sour pork was actually very good - a good balance of crunchiness and flavour, with a decent meat:veggie ratio, which I highly value (it's not called sweet and sour peppers/pineapples, people).

The restaurant is pretty big but can get full, and it's popular among many families. They've got an array of large circular tables, and the few times I've been, many of them are occupied.

Worth coming back to!
