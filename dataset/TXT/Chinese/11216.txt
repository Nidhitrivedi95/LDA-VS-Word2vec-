2F6dAex41iqsoxjSX4xAZA I have been a Dragon Gate customer for 20 years. My wife and I loved to visit when they were on Brookpark road. Since moving from Parma to Parma heights, the quality and taste of the food has dropped and the prices have increased. We tried it once more a week ago and it just did not bring back memories of the old place.
