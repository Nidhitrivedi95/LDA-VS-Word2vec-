SlQNMsVEOSxN-ciIn93LOw Nope, I will never go back to this place. Food was just crappy. Service wasn't that bad although my server could've informed me more on items i ordered.  The shrimp with chili sauce was AWFUL. Tiny shrimp that weren't "cleaned" with this terrible thick red sauce and huge onion slices all over. I expected some yummy spicy chili dish---
i also ordered seafood dumplings - LAME! They were rubbery and just a piece of shrimp inside. I was thinking like a medley of seafood, ya know? 
my friend ordered general tso chicken- sauce was thick and dark, not what our ideas of this dish would be. Eggrolls? Terrible. Way too expensive for being unsatisfied, 40$ for two bites. Nope! That was my first and last time.
