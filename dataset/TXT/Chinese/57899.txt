D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA Food was good and was on the table in less than 5 minutes. 

Service was great.

Price wise: 
*Quite expensive* but what isn't on the strip. 
I guess I would rather pay a little more than to go outside and look for the same food that's cheaper in price. 

Environment really takes you to another place. Decorations all the way down to the tables make this place beautiful.

Serving size is just enough for one person so do not plan on sharing with someone. Order your own.

We ordered the duck on rice, BBQ pork on rice, juicy pork dumplings, lobster fried rice and noodles. All delicious.

I love that there is Asian food available in the Paris hotel and casino!
