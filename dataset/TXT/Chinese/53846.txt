cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ What happened to this place in the last year? Food variety has reduced.  Their signature pearl has been removed from their menu.  The two stations at maintain their quality are the roast beef and dessert station.  If I wanted roast beef and dessert, a Chinese Buffet would not be my first choice.  

As for service .  We where there for a birthday party (a party of 17).  We understood that the every seating is for 2 hours.  At 1.5 hours they started to request that we finish our food and leave so they can get ready for their next seating.  The restaurant at this time was 1/2 full.  10mins later while we are still eating dessert, they started to clean everything off the table.  10mins after that the manager, Sophie, came by and told us we have to leave now because the people from the next seating are there and they have to seat them.  When we left, I approached Sophie and asked why they rushed us out for a full 1/2 hour.  We understand that there is another seating and made sure we left on time but they did not have to rush us a full 1/2 hour before our seating time was over.  All Sophie had to say was that she was sorry and have a nice day.  When I tried to get a better explanation from her, she tried to pull me aside and then gave me the same reply.  

What I have learned from this experience...
1. This Reataurant is not looking for return customers.
2. Do not pay the check and tip 20% till you are ready to leave... Not even if they bring the check to your table 1/2 hour before your seating time ends and insist that you settle up then.
3. Never to return to this restaurant.  
4. Deter others from going to this Resturant (unless you don't like them, then don't say anything). 

The reason for the one star...
for maintaining the quality of the roast and dessert stations and their decorations.
