OgwN65jZebPRIPSmNpRP7A Ordered takeout on a whim because our usual spot close to our house was closed.  So happy we gave this place a try.  My husband and I kept saying how fresh everything tasted, which is usually not a word I use to describe Chinese food. We tried the Taigu spicy noodles, garlic chicken over broccoli, some fried rice, and the chicken teriyaki appetizer.  We were very impressed with it all.  We will certainly be switching up which Chinese restaurant we order from now on -- worth the extra drive for us!
