n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A Second time here, Food was disappointing overall. We took our guest from overseas, saying its the best in town and it was a let down. 
We ordered off the menu, instead of opting for their set menus - Mr Chow noodles and Curry Puffs were the only highlights - rest of the food was below avg. Food served was luke warn to cold - green shrimps were pretty bland
Mr Chow was pretty quiet with only couple of tables, food should have been hot n delicious given chefs would have more time. 
The service was great, as expected polite attentive and caring 
I am not sure if I can recommend this spot anymore - let down
