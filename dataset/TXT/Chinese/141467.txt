Rg4FHrDOD2DJeDY_khy-0w First time at this Pei Wei. Ordered for 13 for business meeting. 

I ordered the Thai Dynamite (along with nine others) with chicken. It was decent, with a good balance between the amount of protein and rice. Not very spicy though, which was unfortunate. I think they got overwhelmed by our voluminous order at 11:30 AM. 

We all wished they had labeled the tubs with names. We added names to the order but they all came mixed and with no names on them. Of course, a lot of them looked the same. It seriously took about twenty minutes to sort them all out. 

Hopefully they will take the time to do it right next time.
