lmfyEVKm3CDGWg18LeRhgA I was hoping this place would be fabulous, because the name itself is. However, it was more like mediocre. It is next to one of my favorite restaurants--The Cornish Pasty--on Dobson just south of Guadalupe, but let's just say I was a tad underwhelmed. I was meeting someone and was about 10 minutes late, but she hadn't even been offered a menu yet or told about the buffet option or cost. We both ended up getting the buffet for $8.95 each, which the male waiter said came with iced tea, so we both said yes to the beverage...and then never got it at any point during the meal! The buffet was pretty good but considering it was almost right at noon the food was not piping hot and some of the trays of food were quite picked over or even nearly gone and no effort was made to replenish while we were there for an hour and a half. Some of the food was a tad spicy but we had to hunt down someone to refill our water glasses. To pay, we couldn't find anyone and again had to go hunting someone down. There's too attentive, just right and practically non-existent waitstaff. This was the last of the three. But if you want a lot of food for not very much money and you're not overly picky about decor (the pink apparently refers not to any edibles but only to the color scheme of this 80s restaurant that was never updated), this is your place!
