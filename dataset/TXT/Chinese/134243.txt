q_KQbgnaYDlPx8EHTydcBQ Quick spoiler: above average HK cafe

Order & atmosphere: modern style quick eatery decor. Small wooden tables with no booths. Actual cafe is relatively small, this seems to help maintain a higher quality food product. Rest of my group complimented the utensils as cute.

Food & service: fast service typical of hk cafes. They have enough staff to ensure clients get served and food gets out quick (you won't find smiles though lol). My wife got the bolognese pasta which was flavorful, cheesy and meaty. My friend got a steak which was way too raw but they gladly rezapped it. I ordered a free range pork chop. My order took the longest but it got the highest praise from the table. Seasoned just right and juicy with simple vegetables and a small order if fries. Portions are average size for all dishes. 

For dessert we got the French toast cubes which were perfect fit sharing. Small yummy bites that came drizzled with sweet evaporated milk rather than the traditional sweet/honey syrup. 

Deserving of 3.5 but due to the Yelp rating system, it gets the 4 stars. I would recommend and would come back for more.
