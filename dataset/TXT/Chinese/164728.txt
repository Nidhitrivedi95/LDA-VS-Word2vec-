They have specials each day and prices for the buffet are different on weekdays than on weekends (because they offer more items such as crab legs on the menu). Sadly, they do have select days that they will have crab legs on the menu unlike other buffets, they'd have crab legs every night. 

I have a players card and I usually go here to redeem coupons and points. Their lines could get pretty long because people usually already wait 15 to 30 minutes prior before the buffet opening. You pay in advance and seated where your server will come to take your drink order. From there you are free to get your food. There is one line filled with food, a middle section filled with another set of food, and to the side the dessert section. It's pretty small and it does not have as much selection but I believe they always have at least one dish that is the utmost delicious. They have the basic American food and as you go down the line there is a mix of ethnic selections. The middle section holds your typical salad bar and in the corner section there's the ice cream machine and bakery items to chose from. It's an affordable buffet and I recommend going on a Sunday to get their seafood menu + steak!
