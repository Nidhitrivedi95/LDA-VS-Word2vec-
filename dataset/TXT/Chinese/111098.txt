M28FGxlpihDrbPCuTfUB6w Okay dumplings. I am still searching for the 'best' soup dumplings in Toronto...Markham has a few good spots, though. I digress...

Ordered: 
Pan fried pork and chives (ok...nothing special)
Juicy buns (I am always fooled by juicy buns (hahaha) because it's supposed to be similar to soup dumplings but soup is either leaked out or never evident)
Green onion pancakes (not too greasy, pretty tasty)
Steamed beef and chives (not a favorite at the table) 

I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again...there is a better dumpling spot down on Gerrard. Total cost came to 30 bucks with 10 dumplings for each order except for the juicy buns which were 8 pcs. Service was good and I appreciate a spot that gives a jug of cold water to each table...I drink A LOT of water.
