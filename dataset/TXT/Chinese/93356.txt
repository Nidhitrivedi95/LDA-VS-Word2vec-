J_btDyZbIv0hZNjrw56zlA Home to my first meal in Canada, ever! Made it somewhat of a tradition to swing by here first thing with every trip I've taken.

Nothing special or out of the ordinary, just your average, late-night Chinese fix. The best things in life are cheap, and preferably open until 5am

Start with the Chinese broccoli to show the locals how healthy you are, then proceed to scarf down their lobster special in no time flat. Take note of the hefty size, sharing is most definitely encouraged.
