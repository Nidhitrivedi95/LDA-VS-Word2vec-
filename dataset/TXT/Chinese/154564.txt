tEfvf1cznLZUIeTcKKpAIw I love their stuff! Some pretty authentic Taiwanese food. Not "hot off the night markets of Taiwan," but a solid taiwanese experience for the average Canadian! I come here for an oyster omelette all the time, and will drive half an hour just to get one. They're filling and so tasty and fun to eat. It's always better to eat in here, but I almost always take them home nowadays and the food is still delicious to go. The atmosphere here is warm and I don't mind eating in, but it's not exactly cozy. If you would like water, they have a self serve station at the back.

I also like their kookoo bites, which is essentially popcorn chicken with a Taiwanese twist. They offer many powders/spices to sprinkle on your bites, I highly recommend the paprika and white pepper. Delicious!

Everything is tasty, but I wouldn't eat here every day. It's something I crave once in awhile, but I've had better Taiwanese food. Granted, for a Canadian location it's great, and absolutely deserves 4 stars. I also haven't tried the bubble tea yet!
