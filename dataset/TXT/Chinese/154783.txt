tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw Not bad, first time here - I had driven past a few time and decided to finally get some carry out, and man we got the carry out - They gave it to us in a box.  

Place was nice, it was actually packed when we went in to pick up the food.  Everyone was friendly and the food was ready and perfect.  The reviewed the order with us so we knew nothing was missing.

We had:
Cream cheese puffs - could have been better, but I still ate them
Wonton Soup - Very good, and really good crunchies
Egg Roll - I am not a huge eggroll person but was good for an eggroll
Shrimp Chow Mien - I loved this!  Was a really big fan, I hadn't ordered Matthew did and I ended up eating it all
Mongolian Beef - was good, your standard Mongolian beef
Mu Shu Pork - Very good, and something I noticed a couple days later, usually the wrappers get hard and you can use to eat left overs the next day, These wrappers were perfect 2 days later

I think in the end, it probably depends what you like and what you order.  I have had better Mongolian beef, but this place had great pork.  I will go back and for a place that doesn't cost and arm and a leg it works as a neighborhood joint.
