RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw Do not know what to say. Congee Wong has good food. I have no complaints really. It is crowded so you can expect to wait in line a lot of the time. Come in a small group for fast seating and to order many dishes. Staff are friendly, but you will struggle a little to get their attention. But that's okay..it is typical of a Chinese restaurant! Makes it somewhat authentic as Yoga S. has posted. =D
