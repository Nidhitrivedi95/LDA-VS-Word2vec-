Todrg1F247iuDIm784XHfA Probably the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. We went to the restaurant and ordered to-go. While we were waiting, we let the babies (both 11 months old and just walking) walk around. The woman who had taken our order, though, brought us some water and saw the babies toddling around on the concrete floor. She warned us that if the babies hurt themselves, the restaurants insurance was not going to over it.... Ummmmmm ok? Other than that, it was pleasant. She offered to help us bring the food to the car since we had babies to carry. Oh and when she originally took our order, she couldn't figure out how to spell "cashew" so she wrote it in Chinese: LEGIT.
