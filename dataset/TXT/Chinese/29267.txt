They have set menus for groups that is well priced and good selection. Last weekend our family got the set menu with 10 dishes for 10 people for around $200; it was pretty good for the price. The set menu came with wide range of dishes (chicken, pork, fish, lobsters, veggies) and generous portions that were more than enough for everyone. 

They have very cheap breakfast and afternoon tea (3-5pm) on weekdays.

Overall, consistent and reliable quality of food, fast and efficient service.
