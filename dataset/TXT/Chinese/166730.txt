Veh0kB2ErSaKsH5v6o7nwQ I basically came here to sample their oyster pancake. If you're Taiwanese you will understand why this is like the holy grail of Taiwanese dishes.  Chopstick serves their oyster pancake on a small bed of stir fried greens and then covers it with a sweet & sour like sauce. Ok I'm not Taiwanese but I don't think the sauce is authentic and did not go well with the oyster pancake at all. The pancake had only 3-4 small oysters but the sauce actually ruined it for me completely. Maybe someone who's had real Taiwanese oyster pancake can comment. Sorry not very impressed.

On my second visit I tried their shredded pork, veg & shrimp noodle soup.  On the menu it states a choice of ramen or udon.  I asked for ramen but when the dish arrived, it was udon.  I had a feeling this might happen because the young server seem very inexperienced and new to Canada. Oh well, it might be okay, so I sucked it up like a buttercup.  

My first impression was it looked appetizing but the taste was bland.  I had to season the broth more with soya sauce (that is never a good sign), the shrimp was not fresh but was a good size and the udon tasted like the ones you buy at the grocery.  To top it off I was waving my hand in the air like a crazy person to get my water glass filled each time. And it wasn't even a water glass, it was those small cups you serve tea in.  Why can't they just give me a large water glass like a normal restaurant.  Yah I'm done...totally done with them!
