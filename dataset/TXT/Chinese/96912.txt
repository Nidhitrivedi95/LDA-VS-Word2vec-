joMyW9KcBEsHJxQuAMulaQ What a fun little place!! We were here as a group of four last week and had a great time. The food is pretty good. We ordered the nachos which were great. I had hot chocolate which was very nice and chocolate-y. It ha an actual piece of chocolate in it :) chocolate makes me happy!!
Like others have mentioned, the selection of games is not huge but it was just right. You're really not going to go to a place like this and spend 10 mins reading the instructions of a new game. Are you? Maybe you would. I wouldn't. 
The service was slow. It took quite some time to get out drinks and food. But the staff was super nice. Which made up for the slowness. They'd check in on us from time to time and see if we needed anything, etc. 
Overall, I'd go here again.
