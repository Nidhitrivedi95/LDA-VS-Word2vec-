AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I ordered the Mongolian beef and the crispy scallops special. The food looked great, but it was mildly bland. The meat could easily be tasted and perceived as soy. Overall, the taste was okay, but it isn't exactly delectable. The atmosphere was pretty good, with lots of activity, while still remaining pretty quiet.
