CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ Don't go in their in you are not hungry. It wont be worth it because you can get the broth at a chinese grocery store and they sell the lamb at the brossard location or korean grocery stores. Ask for the super super spicy  broth if you are daring :D and my favorite way to eat hot pot is to star with meat (lamb) .After about 2plates of lamb, I start with veggies and frozen tofu (be warned some of their labels have the weirdest translation). That way the veggies and tofu can really suck up the lamb flavor.
