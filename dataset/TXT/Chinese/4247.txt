_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Not all that it cracked up to be. We were a party of 15 and they crammed us into a table only for 12 tops. We couldn't move from our seats and kept getting knocked by the people next to us.

The worst of the experience is the way they trick you into getting bigger cuz they don't have the exact weight offered in the combos. when the bill comes all in Chinese and only one person can explain to us what it says. 

As for the food. There was a lot of bland tasting food. Quite ordinary, the food doesn't go with the presentation. Looks good but nothing special in the taste. Tips was automatic 10% but service did not warrant that amount. 

We all agreed we have had better food at OMEI. The restaurant is really busy but I think it's just for the presentation. That's my opinion. Not satisfying for the money. Our bill was over 1 grand and none of us felt satisfied. 

Cash or debit only.
