wZvSsHFU0NdyQ03625kh6g Pretty good food for Vegas Chinese food. We ordered 5 dishes to what with 4 people. A Tom Yum soup , beef and scallion, braised duck, tong xing vegetables, and house fried rice. Tom Yum is on the sweet side. Braised duck is good. Meat is flavorful. Beef and scallion is yummy really good. Fried rice is good because it is not too oily. Good service friendly and fast.
