5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Ambiance is nice.  Thought there appears to be some unique items on the menu, the mainstays of our dinner were very, very average.  Certainly good, but average in taste and presentation.   The service was hurried, I felt the waiters (about 3 of them) constantly asking us questions and being a bit pesky. 

The things written in previous comments seemed to be written perhaps by employees, because there was nothing to make Blossom stand out.  Equally good food can be had in China town a few minutes away, at fully one third the price. 

Go to blossom for the convenience if you are already at Aria, otherwise take a cab to China town .
