hRbUkwU9awUan32CD-mdHA One of the better dim sum places in Richmond Hill / Markham Hwy 7 corridor.  

Dim Sum Style -- you order from a dim sum menu, no push carts, which is what I prefer.  On weekends, additional items that are not on the menu will be brought out by the staff on trays; you pick what you like.

Quality and Selection -- all traditional items are there.  Quality has been fairly consistent and good, always fresh and every dim sum dish made-to-order.  Har Gaw (steamed shrimp dumplings), shrimp rice rolls, "pineapple" buns with BBQ pork filling, and siu mai (steamed pork dumplings) are all good.

Service -- nothing specially great or bad, befitting a place like this.

Keep this on the to-go list? -- YES
