sfd19Wo_7g2TwaoJmA9B8A I frequent this location on an almost weekly basis for carryout.  The food is always ready quickly, and the order is always accurate.  Not to mention, it is incredibly inexpensive.

Also, they have brown rice, so if this is your thing, be sure to ask.  They don't always offer.
