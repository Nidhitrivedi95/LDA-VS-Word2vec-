It was all the way past the Strip and into a very urban area that reminded me of my hometown.  The place stood out like a Outback Steakhouse around the corner of my house, so it was sort of easy to find.

When we entered, the place greeted me with it Korean employees and promptly sat me down, which is a plus in my book.  The employee was a young guy, probably in his late 20's taking our order for drinks.  When he asked us all, I suddenly looked around and saw a bunch of alcoholic drinks, especially sakes and soju (korean version of alcohol, a sweeter version of vodka).  My friend and i ordered some drinks and we all sat up and went to get our food.  The buffet had a lot of different types of foods like korean bbq, sushi of all kinds (mostly typical ones like california rolls), a lot of seafood options like king crab legs and such, and a LOT of desserts too.

My opinion is average (3 stars) for this restaurant.  Average food, but with many selections that anyone can like.  But, the option for the drinks are rare, especially in buffets.  That gave it another star.  This is a good place to go to when you're out in Vegas with a couple of friends.  The staff is good and the food is good.
