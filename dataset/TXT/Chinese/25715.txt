7FPYgKjPu7c2qTcRyBq5DQ I really had no expectations that a place with  zero reviews hidden in a drab shopping center would be good... But I was delightfully surprised. The sushi tasted fresh and was prepared to order. The staff was kind and accommodating for us and made small talk with my son which is huge with me. The decor was nice and clean. I want to say this place is family run but not sure, however, they take pride in what they do. We only had the sushi but we ordered a few to split we had the avocado, spicy tuna, and dragon roll... The dragon roll was fucking amazing. Gone before I could get a picture of it!! Worth trying at least for sushi!! Four year old approved!!
