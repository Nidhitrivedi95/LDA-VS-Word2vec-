H2RgkjPs3W-CxbyygCJJew I went here for dinner tonight with husband and 2 daughters. We got the Sashimi deluxe, Mongolian beef, and Teriyaki chicken.  The food was awesome. I am a Chinese food snob and this will be my go to place from now on. The portions were quite large.It was enough that we can eat it a couple more times. The sashimi was so deliciously fresh. The kids weren't too impressed but they are Mac-n-cheese, hot dog types.
