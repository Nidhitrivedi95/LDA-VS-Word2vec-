ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg One of my best girl friends took me and the girls here for some dim sum after an eventful night out. This was our first time in Cleveland and we wanted some great eats. We got potstickers, shrimp dumplings, pork shumai, mussels, chinese broccoli, beef meatballs, and fried shrimp balls. All were pretty darn delicious, definitely better than some places in Michigan I've been too. We were so happy to be able to be get the food so quickly! I saw that they had roast pork and duck..omg. I was too full to get some, but next time I will definitely get some.
