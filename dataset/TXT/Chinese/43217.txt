beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw I really. Really. Wanted to like this place. 

Me and my party of two came here on a weekday about 2 hours before closing. The smell when you first walk in is very overwhelming, but not in a bad way. It's in a way where you get excited to eat! 

We were greeted by a very pleasant hostess. In all honesty, she is the only reason I am not giving them just a 1 star. 

After we explained that it was our first time here, our hostess was kind enough to explain how the menu worked. She went over the soup bases, meats, what was on the conveyor belt, and any additional side items. It was neither of ours first time going to a hot pot. But it was the first of this nature for both of us. And our hostess made ordering easy. 

The soup was tasteful and flavorful, while the brisket was my favorite menu item to order from. The conveyor belt idea is very creative and I'm glad to have experienced it. 

A reason for the negative stars is because we were both extremely dissatisfied with the service given to us by the other employees of this location, especially our waiter. We asked three times for a bowl for soup and rice (each time we ordered a new meat, we asked them about those two items) and we NEVER received EITHER of it. Not once did he check up on our table, but he did manage to find time to talk to his friend who so happened to visit. We were very upset that his friend ended up getting a bowl of rice, even though we ordered way before he was even seated. 

Overall, I wish again that I could like this place. But the (lack of) service that was shown to us really left a bad taste in our mouths. Maybe we caught our server on a bad day, or we just sat on the wrong side of the bar. Either way. We will not be returning.
