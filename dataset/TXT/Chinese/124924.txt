ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ Yummy. I don't really care for the grandeur and opulence of the decor, but at least it's clean! It's not your typical Chinese place, with loud rude servers and messy bathrooms and shouting Chinese families. 
Most of the patrons are actually very diverse and a lot of westerners. 

Food wise, lots of choice, and something different from the normal dim sum fare, like Milk Tart with Birds Nest and Roast Duck dumplings. There's also a cute pig looking pork bun. 

I found that the pastries and desserts were excellent. Flakey and not dense. Try the Trio of Sesame Dumplings (not in the dessert section, in the Fried Section).

The other things, like the rice noodle and the chicken feet could have had more flavour. But overall, I really liked it. 

Come early on a Sunday morning before 11am, not for the special discount (they don't have that any more) but to grab a seat. It got really busy around 12pm. Also free parking on Bay Street on Sundays before 1pm!

Tip: Make a reservation! Don't get caught in the line up at the door.
