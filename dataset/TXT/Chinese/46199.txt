BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA The was a bit of a wait to get a table.  Maybe 10-12 minutes.  So I had high expectations that this place would be good.

We ordered the hot and sour soup (medium) and the pork and dill dumplings.  The soup is pretty bland. A bit too much pepper.  Not enough spice. The small was pretty small.  Also not sour enough. 

In addition, the dumplings were ok but nothing to write home about.

Service was ok. The place was cute.  Not sure if I would come back.  But my boyfriend did really like this place.  He would had rated it higher than me.
