We had dinner here - ordered a "complete dinner" of empress chicken and governer chicken, both came with wonton soup and egg roll. We started off with the wonton soup and here's what we(my husband and I) felt - the wontons were a tad too thick and chewy! The egg rolls were awesome though - no complaints!! I had the empress chicken where the chicken was tough with a really thick breading. The governer chicken was decent but had a little more soy sauce than we'd expect. Both the entrees were sweet to our taste although they were on the menu under the schezwan specialities (which were listed as spicy). Overall the ambience was good but the food not so great!
