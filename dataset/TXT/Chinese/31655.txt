9rzfGwR--QUGn7BZJdm-Sw I went here for lunch once. 

I was so turned off by the unclean look to the place and the lack of service we got from the staff who don't speak a word of English, that I didn't even order anything.

I ate one dumpling off the plate of my friend, and it did taste good, but for the good of my stomach, I did not eat anything else.

The food might be good - who am I to judge - but the place looks absolutely filthy. One only has to look at the lobster aquarium to know that the place isn't sanitary.

Yuck.
