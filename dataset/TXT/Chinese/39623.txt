awQmoQI2TRAt7VdeRKOR1Q If you're Vegan this is the place to try. As a vegan family it's hard to find good vegan food that would satisfy the entire family. Especially having a 9 yr and 12 yr old. Their eyes almost fell out of their socket when they tasted the food. In unison and excitement they said, 'oh my God this is sooooo good' I should have taken pictures of the food but it tastes phenomenal that I devoured it before the food can say, 'vegan cheese.' The wait staff was very attentive to our needs. As for some people complaining that the food takes too long is because high quality restaurant have real chefs that cooks from scratch. Most ordinary restaurants have pre-packaged food that takes seconds to microwave. All those big chains like Applebee's, Olive garden, Casey's all have pre-package food and not vegan friendly. If those chains have real chefs then they should be able to veganize the food but because it's pre-packaged they can't. The food at Sukho Thai is worth the wait. To top off out wonderful evening we found out that the chef was vegan as well. Would definitely dine here again!
