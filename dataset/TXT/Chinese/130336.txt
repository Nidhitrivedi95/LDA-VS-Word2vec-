While I understand that a party of 30+ was a tad bit too much to handle, I think their staff should have been more prepared for us, considering a reservation was made.  We were all seated separately (understandable), but were under the impression also that we would all be able to order whatever we wanted from the menu.  Well, that night, the manager told the bachelorette that we had a fixed menu (which was not told to her at time of reserving), and that there was nothing he can do about it.  I mean, it might not be a big deal, but with our huge group paying this place a visit, the least they could have done was accommodate our party with what we expected initially (which is pretty much what anyone would expect of any restaurant if no special instructions were told--order what you please, as long as it's on the menu).  

Yet, even with the misunderstanding that occurred in the earlier part of the evening, I can't complain much, as they did try to make it up to us.  Free appetizers for our party AND free shots.  Not too bad.   Food was amazingly super yummy.  And with all this..the bill nearing about $1400 & the craziness that my friend had to endure, we still managed to end on a good note at this spot.
