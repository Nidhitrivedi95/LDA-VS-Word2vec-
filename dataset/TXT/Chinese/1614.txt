-RmFfWUyUU1RPIGtih7J-w Visiting family in Henderson and they suggested we meet here.  Our large party of 13 was seated quickly.  We all ordered for our families and theyn were happy to seperate our checks for us.  Although, we ask that after ordering and that ws super confusing for the waitress.  After getting the orders straigtened out we enjoyed our soup and appetizers.  Our meals were served quickly but not all at the same time.  One person in our party waited for 15 minutes for here meal.  THe food was fresh and served hot.  Everyone was pleased with their choices and left very full.  The prices were very reasonable.  I WOULD RECOMMEND!
