vgc-XO64Uw7otc3sxmns1A A solid 3 and almost a 4 but unable to give half stars . I was there at 6:30 on a Wednesday evening. I was the only person in the restaurant but there were two full hamachi tables in the adjacent room. I had the summer roll which itself was a little bland but the peanut sauce (which I usually avoid) was very good and not too salty. I opted for the sashimi deluxe which is a chefs choice of 15 prices. Mine came with be standard spicy tuna and salmon but also included  white tuna. It was all fresh and the salmon was like butter but the white salmon seemed a little lacking in flavor. Overall for service, quality and value I recommend but it is not not an overly traditional or higher end sushi place. Nice for groups but wouldn't call it romantic, intimate or recommend for a special couples dinner.
