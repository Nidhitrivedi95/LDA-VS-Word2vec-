Atmosphere 5/5. The low lighting and music, combined with the narrow hallways and open ceilings created a cozy, yet spacious ambiance. Me likey.

Employees 5/5. All the hostesses, waiters, etc. were extremely courteous and friendly. Me double likey.

Food 3.5/5. Very average. It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great. I expected some sort of mind-blowing type of dish when I dine somewhere as fancy as Hakkasan but maybe that's because I'm a country bumpkin. No likey, no dislikey.

Price 2/5. As far as the bill goes, I wasn't surprised that it came to the amount it had. But because of the fact that the food was extremely average, it didn't justify the amount it came up to. Anywhere else, it would have been half (at least). #firstworldproblems

Overall it was a nice dining experience with top notch service and amenities-but it falls short with the 'slightly' above par food you'd find anywhere at a decent restaurant with a 'not so slightly' price.

Interesting note: the urinals are AMAZING!!! No splash back. NONE!!! (Only men can truly appreciate that fact).
