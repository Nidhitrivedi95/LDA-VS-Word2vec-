uoV4aDfXbRmvyHSezdn--w This place needs a little more love. 

Located in one of the most empty strip mall in Madison, you would not expect authentic and good food by its appearance. But they do. Not the best Chinese place around, but a solid choice for the west side. The main draw for me is the incredibly low price. 

My suggestion is sticking to the "Family Dinner" section on the their menu (the section with ABC combinations). You can get three decent entree dishes with $25. A very good deal. I recommend the fish dishes. 

Now there's A-Mart in the same plaza, Hy-Vee across the street, drop by this place and give it a try.
