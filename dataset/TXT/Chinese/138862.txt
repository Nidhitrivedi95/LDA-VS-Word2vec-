qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w We don't do Chinese often, but when we do, we always order from here. Every time we have ordered, the food is great and good portions for the price. We always order too much and have leftovers, which also taste great! The usually do take away and it is always ready when promised. We never have to wait to pick it up. It is nice to be in and out so fast.
