tK-PQOhZo94fonbQVXaOSg I decided to try a new Chinese food place tonight since I was craving fried rice. I usually order form Taste of China.  However after looking at some yelp reviews I figured I would give this place a try. 

I found their website and thought it was cool to place my order online. They have so many choices on their menu and decent prices. 

I placed my order online. I ordered Sweet and Sour Pork with pork fried rice and pan fried meat dumplings. After I placed my order I received my confirmation email, but I could not find a time to pick up my food. 

Thankfully I only live a mile down the street. When I arrived to pick up my order it was packaged neatly and waiting for me when I walked in. The owners children were doing homework at one of the booths,and the back door past the kitchen was propped open.

After speaking with one of the ladies at the register she told me that next time not to order online since it costs them to much money. If this is true why do they offer this option? 

Once I got home and saw what I got I was a little skeptical. It looked very different from my usual food, and after tasting it I was not at all impressed. The sweet and sour sauce was thick almost like jello, and more on the artificial sweet side than traditional sweet and sour. The pork had way to much breading on it considering the size of the meat. The fried rice was the best part, but I found onions and bean sprouts in it. Not my cup of tea. The pan fried dumplings were not crispy as I have had elsewhere and lacked flavor. The meat inside had no distinct flavor and I could not identify what kind of meat it was. i also received an egg roll with my order. The egg roll was extremely greasy.  

Overall, You do receive alot of food, but the quality is just not there. I would not recommend this place to a friend and I will not be purchasing again.
