VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q Really enjoyed the excellent, unique offering at this restaurant. However, don't go there with a tight time frame as there is often a long wait during peak dining times (waited 45 min for a weekend lunch), and large parties can be tough at this small-ish restaurant (party of 7 was seated at a booth that was extended by a small table with 2 chairs.) It is in the Times Square mall. Had to prompt the waiter to get some food that didn't arrive (possibly because we filled in the order form incorrectly), but they were pretty responsive. Liked the hot appetizers a lot. Would return again; but will try to visit during an off-peak time if possible.
