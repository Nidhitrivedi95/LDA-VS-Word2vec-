AbgNPAnuq8X90DUw5FQ2sQ One of our favorite places to go for dim sum. Food was really good and the service is above-average. Really impressed when asked for cold water they provided us with cold bottled water! Something did not expect at all. Been there for dinner. Portions could be a little bit more but overall food is very good.


I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a dim sum to go there!
