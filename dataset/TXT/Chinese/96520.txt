jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow I would give this place ZERO stars if I could. This is such a rip off. Food was cold and disgusting. Nothing was fresh or nearly warm. Even the popular stuff like orange chicken and fried rice. Took maybe 3 bites and was unhappy. Went up to the front and asked for a manager. Waited 10 minutes to speak to one and when she approached me she said "what's the Problem". I expressed to her I was unhappy and wanted a refund and she asked if we ate and I told her maybe 3 bites. She said she cannot give me a refund. I said why not, she said because you ate the food. I said where are your signs that say no refunds? She was completely clueless and offered me nothing, not even to warm up the food or remake Anything. Not a voucher coupon. Strongly discourage anyone from going to this place. Absolutely disgusting and very dissatisfied. Do not go here!!!!!!!
