dVMP0_oELc7hf77NYCgudg i will say, this is the most expensive chinese restaurant i have ever been considering the ingredients of their dishes. 
for example, i ordered their mix vegetable fried rice, which cost me 15 canadian dollar + applicable tax + gratitude tips and i was shocked to find out that the dish was consist of  rice (obviously) + bean spouts + green peas + egg (probably 1) + 3 slices of mushroom+ 2 slices of carrots (tiny ones! guys) + tiny cubes of celeries.  no taste, so i asked for hot sauce and salt. 
alone with other 3 dishes ( deep fried tofu cubes, fish filet, veggies) and tea, 
i ended  up paying 86 - 40 (from groupon) + gratitude tips

MOST OVERPRICED RESTAURANT IN TOWN  

it's my personal opinion

but it is located in a premium mall so maybe i should have expected that amount on my bill
