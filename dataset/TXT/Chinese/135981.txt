QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA Asked my friend where he wanted to go for his Birthday and this is where he choose.
I had never been here before,so I was excited to try it out.
Lots of parking here at the Chinese cultural Center.
Nice looking place inside and out. 
The Cultural Center is a huge beautiful building. Something that Phoenix really needs. But, it looks as if there is quite a few empty business spots here.

We were seated right away,but it did take a while to get our tea. Very quickly though they brought our soup. It was hot and Sour and was very good.
The lunch specials are huge plates and you can choose white rice or Brown. No substitutions on anything ,which is the norm.
They dropped off the check and you pay it at the front counter. But 3 people were up there and they were all yelling in Chinese at each other about something.
Four patrons were waiting to check out in a line and the were not helping anyone. It was a bit crazy. But, luckily we were not in a hurry.
Nice place but, I think I like Mui's in Tempe better. My kung pao was not that spicy for some reason.
Still worth a try.Close to the Airport. It is a great location.
