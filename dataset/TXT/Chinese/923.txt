-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ Went in 3 weeks after it opened and it was very slow,only a few tables occupied..After eating I could see why.The duck bao was very fatty and bland .Followed by the Chinese sausage fried rice that was hard and very ordinary,like something you'd get at Panda Express.Finished with the spicy beef soup that also was very bland and lukewarm...All in all it was nothing compared to the asian restraunts on Spring Mountain.Its like the American version of Asian food and lacks authenticity and SOUL..Dont waste your time and take an extra 15 minutes to China Town...
