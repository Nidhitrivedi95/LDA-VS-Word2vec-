HNW4P0jAhXYRJ_op7OcWCw I've been ordering from this joint since 2005 and honestly- I love it. I used to live right near it and just ordered out of convenience but I've moved away now and any time I'm coming through the area I love to grab something. We just had the Beef & Broccoli tonight and I love that it had thinly sliced carrots in it- excellent veggies (along with TONS of broccoli) and delicious meat. I pretty much stick with Beef & Broccoli and Cashew Chicken anywhere I go (I am a creature of habit and I fully own that...I like to enjoy familiar things). And these guys? They got those nailed. The place itself is nothing fancy but the staff is nice and the food is great!
