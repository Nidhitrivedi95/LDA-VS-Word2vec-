ZuNJelvkJD4wsXNBRg6t5w Ok I'm doing this review just for the service... I haven't even tried the food yet and will change it soon as I do... Did online order for delivery, and put on the comments not to ring the doorbell because I have a baby sleeping, dude rang it anyway.... He was apologetic and I'm just like whatever and signed the receipt... Opened up my order and see the soup I ordered have spilled... Not a lot but enough to piss me off and write this review within minutes of receiving my food
