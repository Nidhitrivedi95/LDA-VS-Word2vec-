BaHMCHFuuVpVUV_wOInnOA Turn back, this is not the Asian food you're looking for. There are plenty of better options around; in fact, almost all of the other options are better options. Rarely have I ever felt genuinely depressed about spending a substantial amount of money on food, but this seriously just brought me down to a new low and left me full of nothing but regret. Were it not for intense military training that left me a hardened and emotionless being, I might have wept after my experience. The food is not of the quality that anyone would expect for the dinner prices. Truly, the only redeeming features were the friendly delivery driver and my dog loved it after my wife dumped her hibachi chicken in its bowl (the same dog also likes to eat dirty socks and used dryer sheets for comparison).

I had General Tso's chicken with fried rice and crab rangoons, my wife had the Hibachi chicken and shrimp. Her Hibachi chicken was just sad, poor quality and dry, no flavor whatsoever. The vegetables that came with it were not hot and seemed barely cooked. My crab rangoons were the worst of any I've had and I always get them at every Asian restaurant. Frankly, I'm just sad and disappointed, not how any meal should leave someone feeling.
