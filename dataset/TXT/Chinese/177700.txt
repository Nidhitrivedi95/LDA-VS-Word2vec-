wZ3MABp8WcSHfZrlEQa5dw Very good service at this location.  I took my class of special needs students on a field trip here to practice money and social skills.  The servers were very patient with my students.  They allowed the students to take their time and make choices.  The cashier allowed my students to take their time paying as well.  Panda express also offers some really cool lesson plans for Chinese New Year online--free for teachers.  We went in because of the free resources they offer online.
