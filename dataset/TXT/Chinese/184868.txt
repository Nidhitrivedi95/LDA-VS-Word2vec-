xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw You can create a decent tasting meal here, albeit overpriced. The two stars are for the cleanliness of the establishment. This was my second time dining here and I left with sticky shoes from the filth on the floor. It looked like a disaster struck the ingredients area with a large amount of food on the ground and counter. All of the raw proteins were mixed together from people assembling their bowls. Plus, this time around they managed to mix up the starches my boyfriend and I ordered. He got my udon noodles and I ended up with his rice. They offered to fix it by scraping our toppings onto the correct starches. Not sure how that was supposed to work considering the noodles were mixed in. Don't think I'll be back to give them a third try.
