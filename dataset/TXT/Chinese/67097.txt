ElqLoKM__uU7DcYzRnMpNw i've been here twice and my opinion hasn't changed.  it's close to the hotel i stay and that's all i can say about it.  the food is just ok but the service is great.  went this time for lunch and ordered the garlic shrimp combo which comes with soup and rice.  not much taste to the shrimp and soup so i probably will go back when i'm too lazy to drive somewhere else.
