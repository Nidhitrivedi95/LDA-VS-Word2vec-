eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ Disappointing.
Let me start by saying that I read several reviews before deciding to order delivery tonight and got my hopes up. The food was so bland and sweet that I couldn't even eat it. Garlic pepper chicken had no heat and tastes like cardboard. Pad Thai had sugary aftertaste that was unbearable. The free egg rolls were over-cooked and wraps were crumbling. Lastly, the dumplings had fat, bone, and grissle in them.
