CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw Got a Groupon $12 for $20 worth of food. Good thing I got the Groupon because the food is pricey for what it is. The food was not that flavorful and some of the quantities were small. Might as well go to Panda and pay $6. They also didn't have some of the foods we wanted to order. However, the restaurant was nice and clean. I loved the ceiling deco.
