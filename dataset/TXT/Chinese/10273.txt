1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA On a Tuesday night, we ordered the salt and pepper pork, chicken curry over rice, rotti pancake, and almond pudding for 15.90.

- NO WONG!? FYI, it means good business or being prosperous. "big wong" is actually MISTA LEE. lol. good people :)
- Smells like raw eggs upon entering. goes away tho. you adapt the asian smell.
- No bone! easy eats for shovelers. pork chop cut in small pieces. 
- Chicken curry was great. comes with chopped potatoes. Not golden curry brand. where the carrots at tho?
- pancake tasted like a crepe! crispy! sweet! delicious! must get! 1.25! the price of a gum. BIG JUICE! probably less!
- Almond pudding was also a hit. 3 lychees tho. not bad.
- service is a bit slow. waterless for awhile. i get thirsty -___-. where my pork chop?
- Ms Lee takes pictures!
- So cheap! AYCE got nothin on this
