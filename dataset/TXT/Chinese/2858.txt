_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA This was a great gem in the Venetian! I was craving Chinese food and this place ought to relieve that crave.

- Schezuan Beef Noodle in Soup - the soup was good but it was oily. However, the flavor was just too great. YuMM. I finished it all. 

- Potstickers - these ones had extremely think skin and they weren't as crunchy or crispy as expected.

- Shanghai Fried Noodle - a little too oily and no life to this. 

- Fish Balls & Prawns with Rice Noodle in Soup - This was pretty good. The rice noodle was chewy. They added like that x.o. sauce and dried shirmp on top of the noodles. The prawns were juicy and delicious; however, the soup was a little bit oily.

- Fuk Chow Fried Rice - this was delicious. The "gravy" sauce with the sauteed vegetables made a perfect complimentary to the smell of the rice. Must eat this again.

- Hot and Sour Soup - this was quite interesting. It was less murky than other hot and sour soups but had pepper sprinkled and for the first time, it had pickled cabbage in it. Yummy.

I'm definitely a fan of this place.
