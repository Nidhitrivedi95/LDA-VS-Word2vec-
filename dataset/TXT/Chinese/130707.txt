pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I came here with my family of 6 for my 40th birthday dinner and was not disappointed. We were seated immediately and had no wait (had a reservation). Everything was fabulous from appetizers, drinks and entrees!
Pluses: Sushi rolls and sashimi, bottles of Prosecco for $41, the 18 oz bone in rib eye and the chicken teriyaki. Our waitstaff was super attentive, funny and on top of our every need!
Minuses: The bathrooms were super tiny and dark, the noise level was loud (but then again, so were we) and at the end of the meal, something caught on fire in the kitchen and the smell was outrageously bad.
