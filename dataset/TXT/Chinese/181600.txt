xEHTmRGyoj6y8m2qY50opw the destiny that brought us to the place was that my hubby n i finally gave up on our hunt for KFC, which he loves dearly.  so, we decided to go for chinese.  we hit the restaurant chop, chop first and sorry we had to walk out on them bcause nothing they had looked good.  we headed over to this place across the street and was glad we entered.  we were glad to see that they do have the real utensils to serve us.  the waiter was nice.  we actually walked in an hour early before they open.  the waiter was cool to let us in because we were starving.  we had gyozas n california rolls, which were good, but then these r the items u can't screw up.  my husband n i decided to try the walnut chicken, boy, it needed more work to make it super good.  the flavor was good, but it was the texture that we didn't like.  it was kind of soggy.  what they should have done was give the chicken a dip in the fryer then bread it n refry it.  that way the chicken doesn't come out soggy.   anyhoo, we ate up as much as we could handle the dish.  the dish is the alternative dish for walnut shrimp.  if u could eat shellfish, i would recommend this one.  otherwise try telling them to do what i suggest on the chicken.  our experience was cool.  the waiter was really putting the effort to provide good service, although it was kind difficult to understand him.
