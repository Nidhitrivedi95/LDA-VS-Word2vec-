Easy to locate. Welcomed warmly by the staff - really appreciated their genuineness. Ordered the chicken bao with an add-on quail egg. Wowed by the whole thing - extra-crispy chicken, pillowy bao wrap, crisp greens, and a firey, savory, gingery hot sauce. Had to come back the following day to try the tenders with chicken rice. Another excellent meal - enjoyed the pickles and lemongrass sauce. The friendliness of the staff made the experience even better.
