n72smZw1iVORdnjGfFT0FQ Don't get me wrong, I actually like this place but compared to the Chinese restaurants around the area, it's sub par.  It's a great place for a late night snack as it is open very late and the food is passable.  Anything baked or fried is good.

This is the Chinese version of a greasy spoon diner.
