D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw I had a really good experience here and I also had a bad one. The atmosphere is great here. It attracts lots of different types of people, young and older, dimly lit, and they even have a lounge area with a TV.

They serve hookah during the evenings and it's pretty decent priced. I think around $15. However, during the weekends it gets extremely busy (I waited an hour for a group of 3 people). They did not have a waiting system established either. 

Now the food is really good and their menu is extensive. I believe they mix-in Chinese food options, but do not quote me on this. They also give you options of Tofu & Veggie, Chicken, Beef, Pork for each menu item (how amazing is that!). They also have white rice, coconut rice, and brown rice options. Here are my favorites menu items:

Singapore fried noodles with Tofu: slightly crispy, thin version of Chow Mien. Delicious!
Pad Prik Khing (any meat, I have yet to try the Tofu version): Crispy green beans in a oily-spicy sauce with your choice of meat!
Thai Style Rice: Extremely sticky patty of rice, very good when served warm (it stays soft for a bit).
Veggie Delight: Mixed vegetables and tofu in a light soy sauce gravy. Add a little Sriracha and there is no sacrifice for choosing the healthy option!
