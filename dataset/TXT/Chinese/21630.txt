6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q I had a very disappointing experience here. The service was lousy when it came to the staff. I watched other groups come in, order and leave before I received my meal. The waiter wasn't very friendly or approachable when it came for help. 

Through my time there, I had slip off my shoes, and sat crossed in my seat. I had clean socks on and did not think this would be a bothered. I wanted to feel comfortable. Shortly after doing this, a worker there approached me asking me to put my shoes back on because it "was a restaurant". This was very odd and ridiculous to me. This restaurant is by no means the best, but the request to me felt out of place. I've been to many restaurants in LA and have done the exact thing and never been reprimanded. I'm paying an absurd amount for mediocrity and now I get to be reprimanded for trying to be comfortable.

The food was mediocre, the service was barely tolerable, and the staff was deplorable.

I will no longer be eating here and believe others shouldn't either.
