We came when it wasn't busy at all so service was good. Salt and pepper wings were on point. I love jalapeños and they definitely didn't jip us on those. I came here with my husband and four kids. Our Chinese broccoli was fresh. Oldest son liked the curry. The younger kids weren't too fond of the pork chop but I didn't think it was bad at all. Husband liked the salt and pepper pork.  Our total was $36 which is pretty fricken awesome!
