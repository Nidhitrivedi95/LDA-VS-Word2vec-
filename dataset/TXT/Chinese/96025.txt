JKTMgelIQ-VHn7SL5nyiWA This restaurant is a hidden gem, absolutely worth out for the price and service! They just opened recently, so they're still building their customer base and getting their name out. I went in for the lunch special and ordered the Pad Thai, and not only was it made to my specifications, but it was quick, and the waiter was so nice and accommodating. I really hope more people discover this place, because it really is a great little restaurant.

The lunch specials start at $6.99 and comes with soup,  salad, rice, and egg roll with sweet chili sauce. They have a wide variety of Thai dishes. Don't judge a restaurant by the amount of people inside! Small family restaurants that start out always need time to reach their stride. If this place was closer to my part of town, I would eat lunch here everyday.
