yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I love Pho Kim long the pho is really good but this time I went with my boyfriend he decided to get the fried rice and I got the vermicelli noodles with pork. My food looked really good so he wanted to trade so we did. The fried rice was so horrible it was dry and hard it didn't have any flavor barley had any fried egg in it I was highly disappointed. I will never order the fried rice again I'll stick to the pho.
