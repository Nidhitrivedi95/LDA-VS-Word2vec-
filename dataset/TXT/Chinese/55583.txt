cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw I am thrilled we found this place. Don't judge this place by its appearance. The stripmall its located in is run down, and the interior is tiny and outdated. But the food is great! I ordered the green curry with tofu which was phenomenal. Perfectly spiced. My bf had the drunken noodles, extra hot, with chicken and shrimp. He loved it too despite the tears running down his face. We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer. They were so fresh tasting and the peanut sauce was soooo good.
Our two entrees, two drinks, and appetizer only cost us $22. What an amazing value. And their lunch specials are only $3.
The service was great. They are very sweet. Also it is BYOB with no corkage fee. Next time we are taking a bottle of wine or picking up some Thai beer.
