3FekhBpUmAWXBCvXBhuqVQ The shop is located in a small and old food court and caters mainly to small he breakfast crowd, though it ip be til 7pm.

Food wise, it's delicious. The shop focuses on cheong fun (hong kong style steamed noodles); congee and fried ghosts ( hk style sweet crueller and bread sticks). I have had the BBQ pork cheong fun, beef, mushroom and plain cheong fun. The noodles are soft and the portion is generous for $3.50. The congee is very nice; I tried the pork and century egg conger and the pork liver congee. It's flavoursome especially the pork liver one which is perfectly cooked and lightened with ginger strips and scallions. This is rustic, comfort food from the streets. That is cheap, tasty and filling.

They downsides: the place is located in a food court which is poorly maintained. As such, visually, it can be a bit of a turn off. The tables can be greasy and have sauce from previous customers. The garbage bin is full the last 2 times I visited, which were Fridays at 10am.

My advice : Bring some wet wipes or do take out. Otherwise, if u can handle the humble food court, go for it.
