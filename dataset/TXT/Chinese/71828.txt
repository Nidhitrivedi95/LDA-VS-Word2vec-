FcYAwxuOys7NtnUPhRkA_Q When I say that the decor reminds me of something one one find at a Best Western cafe in Tonapah, I am by no means hating.  I remembered a more Chinese type of flare during my last visit, but that was a long time ago I reckon.

The service was friendly and while I did not particularly dig my "General" chicken, the GF's chow mein was pretty damn good.

See tips for the lunch special.
