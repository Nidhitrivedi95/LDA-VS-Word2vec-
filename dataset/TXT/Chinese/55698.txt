cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ If you want some traditional and authentic Chinese food, this is where it's at!! I was born in China and lived there for the first several years of my life, so I can attest to the authenticity of this place :) Their most popular dish is the lamb kabobs. I highly, highly, highly recommend getting this!! Lamb kabobs are probably one of the most renowned street foods in China, so I'm really glad Han Chinese is bringing them to Cleveland :) It's $13 for 6 kabobs, which can seem a bit pricey, but it's worth the splurge! The seasoning, which is composed mainly of peppers and cumin, is so authentic that it makes me feel like I'm eating in China's night market. I also tried the Dandan noodles, one of my favorite dishes of all time. Han Chinese did a great job with this as well! It was spicy (but not overwhelming) and savory :) Make sure you check in to receive a free lamb kabob with your purchase of a lamb kabob order!! 

Pros: 
- Authentic Chinese food (finally!)
- Clean restaurant 
- Price is decent 
- Waiters speak Mandarin 

Cons:
- Slow service; it took them 30 minutes to make the kabobs even though we were the only people in the restaurant. A warning from the waiters would've been helpful!
- Waiters don't speak English very well
