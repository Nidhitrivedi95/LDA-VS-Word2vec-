Hg3pn4JwDD0Mm_Hxr-at2w I'm all for an all you can eat buffet for 8.99 lunch deals!  The decor was nice and the service was very courteous.  The food was pretty good too.  I was actually expecting not so good food, but they're bound to have at least a few good dishes that will fill me up hahaha.

The baked stuffed crab was bomb!  Fried chicken wings..... mmm... finger lick'n good!  The teriyaki chicken on a stick was scrumptious!!!! 

So if you're on the strip and need a quick good bite for lunch, this will definitely fill you up & put you to sleep after hehehe

The only not so good thing is the rice.

Cheers!
