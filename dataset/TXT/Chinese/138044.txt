QmNrHxN7UahtdliH_kAuUg I came here awhile back with a group and tried the cold chicken, since it seemed very similar to Singaporean chicken rice (I spent several months in Singapore).  Although that dish is typically served warm, the flavor and texture of the chicken was very similar to it, and it was an enjoyable reminder of that cuisine.  I don't remember details of the service except that it was a bit confusing at one point since they were out of something and had trouble communicating that.  I'd come back here to try the cold chicken or another Cantonese dish again! 3.5 stars.
