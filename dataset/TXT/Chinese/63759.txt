E-wETrdq1uImd6lX6x8Qxw This place becomes my favourite spot for hotpot AYCE. It has a nice atmosphere, quick service and the staffs are friendly. 

We're always here with group of 6 and we always have our own stove. I love their spicy broth. It's amazing! You can order 3 rounds for the ingredients you want to have with your hotpot (meat, vegetables, noodles,etc...) and they are all fresh. 

Like celebrity hotpot and other hotpot places, you can make your own dipping sauce. I always make mine with sesame sauce paste (look like peanut butter), soy sauce, a bit of garlic, a bit of vinerga, and chili oil. 

Some may not like the prune juice (they also have soy milk and water with lemon), but I think it goes well with the food. It won't make you feel full quick and feel heavy like soy milk. 

They didn't charge us for leftover but friendly remind us to not do it next time, which was very nice of them.

Their ice cream is good!! I love green tea flavour. Unfortunately, you can only order ice cream for one time. So make sure you order more than as many as you want for that one time! (the waitress told me that)

The price is reasonable for the amount of food and service. Hotpot is always my top choice during those cold winter days.
