S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ It's currently a rainy day in Las Vegas and I wanted to have some hot & spicy pho.  The pho was excellent and I got some crispy pan fried noodles to go.  I would definitely recommend as another option for a flavorful bowl of pho when your body needs some nourishment.  They also had NBA TV playing  on a large flat screen, which was a bonus :)
