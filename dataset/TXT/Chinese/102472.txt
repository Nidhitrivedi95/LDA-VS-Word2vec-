This place has EXCELLENT DIM SUM!!! Starting at $1.90 for the most common items. 

Another great food find here on YELP! If I had driven by this place, I wouldn't had tried it...so, it's really true about the "word of mouth" thing. The building was once an Italian sandwich place many, many years ago, then a whole bunch of other failed restaurants over the years. It's next door to the Olive Garden.

I also double-check the health-ratings on the County website to make sure a restaurant got a Silver or Gold award before I eat at a place too...this one definitely passed that...with a Silver Award!

The pieces are bigger than the other Dim Sum place in the West Valley. Fluffy Turnip cakes, generous Sui Mei, and everything was HOT, not room temperature. I kinda like this concept of ordering Dim Sum from the menu, instead of anxiously awaiting for carts to be pushed around the Dining Room.

I like the plain decor, it's like a little plain jane Chinese Restaurant in ANY Chinatown. They do have paper lanterns hanging and other Chinese decor...but, I'd rather have excellent, inexpensive food than a fancy restaurant with overpriced entrees'. 

China Chan is clean and has friendly, cordial service. I will be back again for certain for my Dim Sum fix!
