You should be expecting this when you eat at an Asian restaurant. Maybe they are comparing it to a 5 star classy restaurant on the strip. --NO, it's an Asian restaurant, that's right, it's not going to be 5 stars, and it's not going to be clean--hence it's in China. 

We got roasted duck lo mein, beef chow fun, orange chicken. I must say the orange chicken wasn't the best, but the roasted duck was sooo juicy and flavorful! I guess you just gotta order the right thing, or just don't expect too much. 

We weren't expecting CUT or some fancy place. We knew what we were getting ourselves into, and it was delicious! I would definitely come back because hey, you can't beat the price (even though it's not as cheap as what Chinese restaurant normally would, but it's cheap for Vegas, so I'm comparing it to Vegas cheap--not OC or SD cheap). 

It is CASH only, and you can't pay by chips. So just don't expect anything, get some greasy Chinese food for that hangover. That's it.
