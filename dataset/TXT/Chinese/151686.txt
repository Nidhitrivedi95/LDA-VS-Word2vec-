t-LnJne10SHAWATKYdQdJQ Food was ok. Service at the table was fine. The individuals cooking at the grill were very unprofessional. The conversation they were having was distracting them from doing their job properly. It was frustrating watching them not focus on cooking the food. I doubt we'll go back.
