j1QfFrTE22PAak7rzD8OoQ Been coming here for many years now.. my grandma loves the Taro Sago from this place.

Last I decided to go full out and order a full out dinner..

2 Tea Eggs, 1 Large Taro Sago, Deep Fried Milk, Durian Pancake, and a 1 specialty drink.. $26.50 take-out price..


The Tea Eggs were really just so-so.. and over priced at $1.25 each plus tax.. tasted legit and flavourful.. but only the first one.. second one was a fail.. ??

Deep Fried Condensed Milk was ok.. didn't taste bad.. it was missing sweetness.. it was fried pretty nicely and crispy on the outside.. and came with some sugar on the side.. but definitely needs to be sweeter on its own..

Durian Pancake was oh oh K K.... not enough real durian.. but for the price.. it was acceptable..

The Taro Sago is definitely worth a 4 star rating tho!! Super Taro flavour and perfectly chewy and al Dante Sago!!

I would imagine the other types of Sago would be great as well..
