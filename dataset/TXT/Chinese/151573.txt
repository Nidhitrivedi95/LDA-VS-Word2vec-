SzTbr5cAfX9j8DFhIn7sDQ This restaurant has moved a few times but still with the quality.  When you go in, you can smell the hot pot. Because the previous restaurant is not a hot pot place, that's why the ventilation seems not exceptional good for all the steams from the hot pots.  

I have never seen in a hot pot restaurant that the beef is so high quality.  The meat and fat are evenly blended together.  When you order, I notice the beef dishes that come is always one less than what you order.  May be it is the way to control the waste of food.  It may also be due to the beef is more expensive.  I usually order what I like in the first round, see if I am full before ordering something different for a second round.  For hotpot, the final result is that you are always more full than expected.  Remember to order not just the food item but the quantity required.  Otherwise, every dish is for all the people on the table.  Sometimes I will let the waiter know that it is a trial dish and only a few slices will be more than enough.  In that case, there is no waste of food and you can try more.  The fish ball, beef tenderloin ball, wonton, squid ball seems like home made and are very good.

On weekend, you can add $2.99 for a seafood plate.  It includes half lobster that is not written on the menu.  This is the only seafood plate for the night.  For $1.50 you can add a pot of rice or pots of different flavor rice.  An extra $0.50 for additional drink.  Only 1 dessert for each person.  Dated back few years ago, everything is included.  These are the food inflation in theses few years.
