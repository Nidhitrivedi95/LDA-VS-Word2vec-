rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg I have been here a few times and I enjoy Sun Asian Kitchen.

The staff here is very friendly and attentive.  The last time we came I had the orange chicken which was crispy and very tasty.  My girlfriend had the beef lo main which was also very good.  I have come here in the past for various lunches and have always had a good experience.

I recommend stopping in if you are in the area.
