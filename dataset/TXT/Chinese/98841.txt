JTNdV6u3DK-wcqX7ZXl5hw Worst one we have been to. Baseline & Val Vista.

We are here right now. Husband ordered shrimp fried rice..and it is saturated with carrots and very little flavor.

I ordered the steak/mango salad and got 4 small pieces of meat..and lettuce saturated with the vinaigrette dressing..like dripping. Nasty. It's a shame, because it has been so long since we ate at one and we were looking forward to it. Watching the hubby still pulling out shredded carrots right now!

Not exactly cheap for crap food.  Won't be back.
