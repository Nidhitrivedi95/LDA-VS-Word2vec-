7wgKazvblPECOzBrd6N50Q So it all started at the University of Montreal.. Babu pissed me off and I decided to ignore him.. Safat tried to make me feel better so we came to a Chinese spot to eat at China Town.. as we read the annoying menu .. Taimoor and Farhan walked out and that resulted me getting extra annoyed because I was too lazy to walk out and now I had to sit next to this annoying Ass*.. I wanted to walk out twice after but safat stopped me as the server wasn't polite at all .. Obviously the food I got was crap .. they gave me lo Mein even though I wanted a cho Mein .. Never coming back !!!
