LsgE9TBlyvGFF2n7esSd2w This place is dirty. The soda machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a very long time. And the bathroom is really bad. Toilet paper roll on the floor, DIRTY floor. I nearly feel off the toilet cuz the seat is very loose. And the food wasn't as flavorful as the peiwei we go to in Mesa. And we didn't get nearly as much as we have at other pei weis. The table and chairs are beat up and the floor is grungy. Over the years, The first few times we've gone to this peiwei we were good with it. The last several times over this last year or so it's really bad. We will not go there again.
