WuQZ5iesON7NWTDWgwWlbQ Came here for dim sum for my Mama's bday lunch back in December (of last year ). It's always busy, so I suggest always coming here early! (Like 9-10am) The dim sum here is pretty good, not the best I've tasted though. 
It was my first time trying their {Seafood Dumpling in Soup with Bird's Nest} at Premier Ballroom. I always order this dish at dim sum to try it out!! The broth was tasty, and they were very generous with the amount of scallops outside & inside the dumpling (which I loved cause it's my fave!!) !! The bird's nest I really didn't notice, it was just sorta there. If you didn't read the menu you wouldn't even know it's there.  I just really didn't like the fish eggs on top, it made the dish taste a little fishy...

{Fried Pork Dumpling ~ <U+54B8><U+6C34><U+89D2>}  
Ok so this is my favourite dish of all time, so obviously I'm gonna order it ...I was hoping they wouldn't over fry it like other places...and it was frigging delicious!!  It's perfectly fried where the inside is still soft and chewy, and crunchy on the outside!!!  It's my favourite dish at Premier Ballroom, and the only dish I didn't have a complaint about!! So good
