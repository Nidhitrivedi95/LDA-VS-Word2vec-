0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw I love this type of hole in the wall Chinese food spot. At first I was skeptic because of the location which is hidden in a strip mall but the food and service spoke for itself. We ordered the pecking duck and the spicy egg plant. The pecking duck took a few min to prepare so the waitress offered us a bowl of hot and sour soup while we wait. The duck was prepared table side with the crispy skin served with the steamed buns, green onion, and hoisen sauce. Imagine crispy duck skin on top of a pillowy soft steam bun mmmmmmm duck skin sooo good. 

Overall this little place was comforting and the food and service exceeded my expectations. I would love to come back and try their other dishes.
