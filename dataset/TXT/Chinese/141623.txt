rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g Well done (American) Chinese and not too heavy on the corn syrup/sweetness like some places. This is probably a 3 1/2 star place that gets the extra half-star based on limited good restaurants in the north phoenix area. Their mapo dofu is quite good, and so is the walnut shrimp, along with their house fried rice. Polite delivery drivers and prompt service. Never eaten at the restaurant but have been impressed that even when delivered the shrimp doesn't get overcooked/stringy during the delivery, but still arrives plenty hot.
