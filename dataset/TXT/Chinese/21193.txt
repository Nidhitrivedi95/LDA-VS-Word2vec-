We split the Flock and Fowl Salad which was full of surprising yummy goodness. Fruits and nuts and greens and grains and PERFECTLY dressed!  Sides of rice, fried skins and Chinese sausage. Everything was absolutely tops.  I look forward to making it in for an actual entree. This will be added to the top of our regular office lunch menu.
