While visiting family here, lots of our friends and family keep raving about the new vietnamese dishes being offered at Nam Wah. We had to try it out...since my husband was craving noodle soup and I wasn't too hungry...this was the perfect choice. When my food came out it was extra flavorful and I couldn't stop eating! Mind you, I was not hungry. Not only did I eat my Banh Mi and Summer Roll, I also had a few bite of my husbands Hu Tieu. 

If you are tired of your normal Chinese takeout...try this place!
