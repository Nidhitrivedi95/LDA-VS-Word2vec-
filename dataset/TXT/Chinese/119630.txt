NVRiJkvbE7J7ddGYKPx56A I have been studying with Sifu Baugh since 2003.  My only complaint is that I didn't find him before 2003.  I have been studying since the 80's, and I have studied with some disreputable teachers.  Sifu teaches: Chen Tai Chi, Yang Tai Chi, Northern and Southern forms of Kung Fu, Praying Mantis, Xing Yi, Ba Qua, and other forms of traditional Kung Fu.  Unlike other teachers and schools I have attended, Sifu Baugh is approachable and humble.  He teaches the majority of the classes, and his only concern is helping you to get better.  He is respected by other martial arts teachers in town, and he even teaches some of them. 

If you are looking for a traditional Kung Fu school with: experienced and qualified instructors, reasonable monthly fees, no annual contracts, many different styles and classes, no ego, and a place that you can train for the rest of your life, then this is the place to train.
