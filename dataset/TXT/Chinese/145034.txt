rx1AEnleVRWMNz6vB-YhfQ Very rude employees, I came here to enjoy lunch with my wife and two kids I don't like Asian food so I went to port a subs and came back to eat with my family but when I tried to eat my sandwich while my family was eating their Asian food I was told by the employees that I'm not allowed to eat my sandwich because I didn't buy it here and even though my family all purchased food I was told I would have to eat my sandwich elsewhere. After I told him we would never come back then he said he would allow me to eat with my family just this one time. I will never bring my family here ever again
