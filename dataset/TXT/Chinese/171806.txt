VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ We moved here from Hong Kong a few years ago and were introduced to Flo's by our long time resident friends.  Mind you, we lived in one of the culinary capitals of the world, where the best of any food can be found.  Also, I am American and my wife is Chinese.  Flo has a fun and varied menu.  We are sure that the Western palate leans toward Orange Chicken and General Tsao's Chicken, along with Spring Rolls and Fortune Cookies.  However, the menu has a variety of well-prepared and tasty dishes with noodles and the spicier items being quite appetizing.  So, for those of you who have written less than positive reviews, you have certainly limited yourselves to a narrow sampling of Flo's.  The iconic Saturday Lunch, yes, has increased in cost and the portions may be smaller but, come on, what more could you ask for at $6? Flo has given us a unique place to savor Asian dishes at, realistically, economic costs.  We, for one (and our feelings are shared by our group of friends) enjoy a periodic Happy Hour at Flo's and stopping by for a nice lunch on a Saturday, while running errands.  Thank you, Flo....................GRW
