amlwSiqE8WrghAHO7AHyeg This place is really great. The food is delicious, the staff are relaxed but on the job, and the prices are just right.

We had the lunch combos, chicken in peanut sauce and a stir-fry, and they were both excellently composed. In both dishes the main course was accompanied by a good helping of steamed rice and ample vegetables.

They also explain what the dishes are just in case you're unsure, which I thought was great even though I'm familiar with Thai food.

I highly recommend stopping here on any visit to downtown Montreal.
