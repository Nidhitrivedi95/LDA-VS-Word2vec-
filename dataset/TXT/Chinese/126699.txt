P3dBcZh_Hmr1wVWFZn2b-g The best things about Hunan in order: 
1. They have old school hand crank paper towel dispensers in their clean bathrooms.
2. The soy sauce tastes great and is essential to get you through the meal.
3. A cat waves goodbye to you as you bolt out the door.
4. The man who brings plates of hot objects and bowls of liquids smiles a lot--probably because he can't believe your white taste buds can eat such garbage and he hopes you will still leave a tip.
5. The lifesaver mints by the cash register get the taste of Hunan's food out of your mouth.

We ordered hot tea, wonton soup, cream cheese wontons, orange chicken, sesame chicken, and fried rice. The hot tea was extremely dark and powdery--overwhelming and bland at the same time. POWs probably eat better soup than Hunan's hot water in a bowl. The two wontons in each bowl were hard like stale, dried-out meatballs and were literally floating in hot water with a touch of diced scallions. The fried cream cheese wontons were served dry with no sauce and tasted strangely re-frozen and re-fried. The chicken dishes looked the same--freezer-burned stale skinny nuggets with strange breading and unconvincing sauces attempting to stick to them. Neither of us could even get through half of the plates. The best thing about the fried rice was the egg if you picked it out of the flavorless rice. To add insult to injury, the cheapest fortune cookies imaginable were served at the end and I had to spit mine out. I hope that does not bring me seven years of bad luck! I don't think adding more brain-eating MSG would help this place--how do you intensify no flavor at all? At the very least, I have learned to not expect good ethnic food in Pittsburgh.
