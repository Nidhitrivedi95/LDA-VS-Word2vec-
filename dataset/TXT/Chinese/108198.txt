lh9ZqHBodHoHkRZzshaXlg Food: Because this is a sub-restaurant from Morals Village. But the soup base choice is less than Morals Village. They have the single serve toppings for you, but you can also choose additional toppings if you want. And they will charge you from $0.5-$2.5 per pieces. The sauce they give you is just a very small plate. I think you need more. And if you need more sauces, they will charge you. They are only $0.5 per serve, but need to add several times. Although the basic price of the pot is just $12.99 and $13.99, they are not enough and you need to add more ingredients. Then the price will go high. In this case, I'd rather to have a AYCE. Also, because it is a small pot, the soup will gone fast. And you need to add soup just after a while. I ordered a spicy pot, but it became a normal soup and the spicy taste has gone finally. 

Service: The service was OK. They have the promotion for 20% off if you share this place to the social media.

Location: The location is easy to find, it's not too far from Pacific mall. There is a Chatime next to the Spicy Mafia
