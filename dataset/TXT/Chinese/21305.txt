As I ordered delivery, the only really relevant aspect of this review is for the food. When I saw the delivery menu, I was slightly disappointed, as a number of the dishes that I had tried in the restaurant were not available for delivery. In retrospect, it may be a good thing that some of the items are not available, as soupy shanhainese dumplings likely wouldn`t have fared as well in delivery.

Our order included chicken dumplings, red bean pancakes, green onion pancakes, mu shu pork,  sweet and sour fish,and  apple juice (I think it might have been fresh squeezed!). The chicken dumplings were moist, and the 'skin' still surprisingly soft, definately not half bad for delivery. I would otherwise comment on the mu shu pork and the sweet and sour fish. The flavour and texture of the mu shu pork was true to its roots, albeit slightly oily (which, I suppose, is also authentic), but the pancakes included were too few for the size of the dish and had started to dry out by the time the arrived. So far, not bad, but the real disappointment  was the sweet and sour fish. To be honest, I'm not sure what the dish is supposed to taste like, but what we received was nothing close to what expected. The dish came as 2 deep fried fish filets, and a separate container filled with an obscene amount of what I would liken to bad candian-chinese restaurant lemon-chicken sauce. The flavour of the fish 
was bland, and the sauce very artificial. 

Overall, I give my experience a 3/5, which I think could have been a 3.7 if I had eaten at the restaurant.
