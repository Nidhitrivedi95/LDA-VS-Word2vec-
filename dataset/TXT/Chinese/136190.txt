Qe8vFq-3HMld-ymBQLDnpg had the lunch set here and I was pretty satisfied. I found the service a little too formal just for lunch but I guess that's just me. The food was alright. What I appreciated is that the set came with fried rice and it they didn't serve the generic kind that normally goes with combos, it was the real deal version.

The prices were a bit higher than usual (maybe 20%) but that's what the service and ambiance gets you. All things considered, I wasn't disappointed.  I would go again but with the number of chinese restaurants around thornhill and richmond hill , it probably wont be that often.
