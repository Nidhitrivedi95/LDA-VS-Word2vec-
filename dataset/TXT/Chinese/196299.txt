ZlrHrg7jrbO6blqwfa0MkQ Had not been here for several years, and my previous recollection was that its appearance was attractive but food overpriced and above average but not great.  Tonight's meal with friends changed my thinking. 

Food and service were excellent!  Appetizers included fried dumplings and lightly fried green beans, both very good. One of the main courses was Peking (Bejiing) duck. It was fabulous- best I've ever had, including what I've had in expensive New York City restaurants. Well-cooked, very crispy and served with scallions, hoisin sauce, and thin wrappers. Only $20- I'd say a very good value. Another main course that was delicious was shredded beef with szechuan sauce. 

Will definitely return and am adding Baoding to my list of favorites. Need to try more dishes.
