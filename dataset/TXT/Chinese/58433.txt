DCab_cz7nDDW-IPsnKGb_A I was really hoping to have found a decent Chinese place with all the reviews I read, but truthfully we found it mediocre. I ordered the chicken chow mien and have never had it the way the make it. It was chicken and some really slimy cabbage type stuff over rice with some crispy noodles. There were no other vegetables in it. We got one egg roll and one spring roll, neither which were stellar. Reading over the reviews I am now assuming the 5 stars were for food off the authentic menu, rather than just the regular menu. Won't go out of my way to go back, too many mediocre places closer to my house. I wish I could find a good one!
