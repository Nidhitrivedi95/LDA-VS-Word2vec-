We ordered:

Hainanese Chicken with Flavored Rice
- chicken was dry so it needed the sauce to help.  The sauce (spicy sauce and Ginger with green onion sauce) was tasty.  The rice has a nice flavor.

Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice
- it was okay but needed more curry for the amount of rice they provide.

The food came really fast so don't worry if you're hungry.  Price wise it was okay as well.
