C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ I like this place. It is quite authentic and I know authentic, trust me.

Okay, they have some of the funky things fo the Western palate, but they have geat Clams, steamed fish, ox tail soup, and fried frog legs. You gotta be geat to have this stuff, and this place is one of my favorites to go to when I can't make it downtown.

Lots of Asians dine here, which means it is good.
