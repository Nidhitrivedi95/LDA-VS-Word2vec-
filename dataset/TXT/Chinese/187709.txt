Decor: nice clean interior

Pho is always the best hangover cure, however this place is an ehh.

The broth wasn't as flavorful and I felt like they were super stingy on the meat and veggies.
One plate of veggies for 12 bowls? Really. =[ The plate of meat had 5 pieces all about half of a baseball size of the thawed frozen cut meat.

Overall - there are plenty of other Pho places that are better. Skip this one.
