-Gxe5gKrskrgbWyLkz7UGQ if you want a chinese buffet in Edinburgh, this is the place to go, this is the nicest one, with nice seats and tables, and a great choice of food, where you can help yourself to as much as you want for very reasonable prices, great for a crowd of people also, as it is very noisy place.
