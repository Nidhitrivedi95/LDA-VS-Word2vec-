jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw The dim sum food is okay, but the prices are kind of extreme. I ordered the shrimp balls over the crab. It was $7 for 2 balls! We didn't know until the bill came, so I wished they had a way of marking the prices of their dim sum plates on the carts. Another shrimp plate I ordered on the dim sum cart was $7 too, so that was a bummer. 

We got the spareribs and eggplant hot pot. It came with very little rice for the two of us to share. How do you eat hot pot with so little rice? Most other restaurants will give a large pot of rice to your table if you order a dinner size entree. 

In looking at the other reviews, I see most people say the food is good, but the service is bad. My experience was the opposite. The service was fine and I had no problem getting food in a fast and friendly manner, but to me, the food is only mediocre.
