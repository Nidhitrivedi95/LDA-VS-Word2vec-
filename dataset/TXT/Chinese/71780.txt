fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A This was a good casual dim sum restaurant. Some dim sum were extremely well made(xiao long bao and shrimp rice rolls) but there were some that weren't as good as other dim sum restaurants I've been to. Nevertheless the service was great and there were wide variety of dim sum offered.
