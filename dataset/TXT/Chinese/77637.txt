Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA I have been to both the Spring Valley and Chinatown location. Each time I have been I receive consistent good quality service and food. They use fresh ingredients. I am a vegetarian so I love that they offer all dishes as vegetarian. They are one of the few, so many places in Chinatown only have one or two vegetarian options. I strongly recommend the spicy green bean (because it is already spicy no need to go more than 3 stars on the heat) Also, the Tom Kha soup is delicious. This place could be my new fast-food go to.
