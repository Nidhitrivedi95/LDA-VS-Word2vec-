9ad0-8h-DRUheY9dF9rYjQ This is a really nice restaurant! Probably my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA or Mississauga. The Beef 7 Ways is a must try here (I don't understand how people can not feel full after eating this... You're supposed to wrap all the meat and veggies in the rice paper, folks!). They have other good dishes, including some Chinese-Vietnamese dishes that look appealing though I've never tried them. It's a good value restaurant too, like most Vietnamese restaurants in the city.
