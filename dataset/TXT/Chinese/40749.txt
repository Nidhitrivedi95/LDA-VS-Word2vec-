Breakfast:
We enjoyed this buffet over the MGM grand! 
- Bacon/sausage links were good.
- to order omelets amazing!
- scrambled eggs and crab Benedict nice touch and flavorful!
- coffee and OJ was great... Anita even hooked us up with to go cups... Well needed!
- fruit and chocolate covered strawberries were fruit and sweet! 

Lunch:
- had sushi as we were full from breakfast. The California rolls were awesome and this place also rolls em fresh!

We had a late start so were able to enjoy breakfast and lunch for the same price as we happened to dine during shift change! We will definitely return if and when in Vegas! Enjoy folks.
