SxjNgkzAlUG-wt2rSbc2HQ Best place to go to after a fun night of drinking and partying. Fresh authentic and tasty food at 2 in the morning!  

Service is pretty bad like most other Asian restaurants and the washroom is pretty dirty, but the prices are really good for the portions and i would def recommend ppl trying it t least once. 

Also, when they say it's spicy, it's spicy. i  had to learn the hard way ;)
