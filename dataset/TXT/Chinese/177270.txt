WwvSDgFkx3f0piozrdMxtQ I have eaten at the Scottsdale location before, but a long time ago. People say they are very different from each other, hmm I dunno? Don't care though. 

This one is great. They have an awesome happy hour. Half priced aps and drinks. Their flat bread pizzas are very good. Their calamari is some of the best I have ever had. Sweet spicy sauce on them and crispy. You must try! The sliders are really good too. 

The only weird part is the bathroom in down stairs, which is a bit of a hike, but not a huge deal. 

I see they also have a large private dining room, possible spot for my rehearsal dinner maybe??? hmmm! 

I am a fan!
