JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA Come and get food for two days of full belly!!  You go and pick out your meat (chicken, beef, pork and fish). Grab a wax paper and push down your meat because it will shrink so full up, push down and repeat three times.  Then grab your toppings and noodles.  You then come to a sauce bar and you follow the directions to create the flavor that goes into the food.  Take your tray to the cooks and they do their magic and cook it all up. 

Good quality food, easy to put together if you read directions. 

$12.95 includes one trip bowl, soup, drink and ice cream cone.   Not five stars only because you have to pay .50 for your to go container. 

Give me a try.
