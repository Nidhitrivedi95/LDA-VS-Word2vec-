TDgV70xYZOR5CHOqlOIYyQ OK, firstly a disclaimer - I can't exactly understand British/Scottish Chinese food (i mean.. HOT CHIPS?!@()*!()#)!(*#)(@*$ _@($*_ WTF_)*@$_@($_#$()) ... being used to your "more authentic" Chinese food from Hong Kong I was trying to keep an open mind 

We had the chicken chow mein. beef and black bean, egg fried rice and I had the equivalent to mapo tofu (pork and tofu, spicy). Food was good - my Edinburgh-born-and-bred friends said it was really good in quality and taste. Yes, it's not traditional but I don't think that's what they're aiming for (or what the local palate demands)..The tofu dish I did have had small slices of pork in it (as opposed to the "more-traditional" minced pork) however I'm assuming this is again a "regional variation :)" catering to local expectations.

Service was fine, as were the prawn crackers served before and fortune cookies served after our meal. Place was busy (with both eat-in and take away orders) which is always a good sign.


In short, food tasty, hot and fresh. Service fine. Reasonably priced. Still don't understand the hot chips at a Chinese restaurant. :P
