UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ Since moving to Phoenix, I have been searching for a good Asian Restaurant.  This is it.  The lunch special is phenomenal for $7.95.  You get alot of food. Would like to include sweet and sour sauce for the egg roll and wonton though.  As one person mentioned, I also wish they would substitute the egg drop soup at lunch.  I'd be willing to pay more. Their won ton is fabulous.  The dinners are a little pricey.  They serve a good sized portion of food but no soup included.  That would be a nice touch. It's very tasty and good quality. They also serve sticky rice which most restaurants no longer do.  Yay!
