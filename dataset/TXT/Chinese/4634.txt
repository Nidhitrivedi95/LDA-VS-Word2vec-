_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Absolutely disgusting. When I went to he restaurant my first impression of it was when I went to wash my hands in the wash room. In here toilet paper was scattered on top of everything and there were two dead and decaying baby rays in the corner. My second problem was my group was a party of 8. They refused to let us sit together and forced us to split into two tables of 4 , not even close together. I would've walked out if wasn't for my grandmother being hell bent on eating here from some recommendation she got. When we ordered, they came back to our table four times because they forgot the order. On top of that we ordered our lobster one way and the waiter said oh you don't want it that way because it was "spicy" but we ordered it spicy because we wanted it spicy. Also they took forever for our food. I know bringing the live lobster and crabs are part of their service but they shouldn't do that 45 minutes after we ordered. By that point it wasn't that amazing since everyone at our table was grumpy and hungry. The food eventually came and was ok; it would've been better if there wasn't so much drama before hand. By the time we were ready to pay, my aunt wanted to pay for both tables meals and asked the manager if he would bring both bills to her. The manager responded with " absolutely, don't worry about it." And my aunt went back to our table to finish up her meal. By the time she asked manager again for the bill, he said he gave it to my other uncle sitting at the other table. She was upset and asked why he didn't give it to her and said some SEXIST comment back to her which I will not repeat. I hated my experience here and I will never come back here again and neither will anyone in my family.
