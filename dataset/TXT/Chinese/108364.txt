liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA Zine, SHAME ON YOU for calling yourself a Chinese Restaurant and even worse an upscale Chinese restaurant... 

Some of the reviewers complain that Zine is overpriced, but that is to be expected being located in Palazzo. As long as it's good, I don't mind paying a premium for good food. However, Zine's food not only lacks in quality, but also in taste and presentation. And, as far as their service goes, let's just say I've gotten better service at my local KFC. 

I know better than to eat Chinese food on the Strip and that for real Asian food you need to go to Spring Mountain Road (8 min cab ride from the Strip). However, being hungover, I was delusional in thinking that Zine deserved another chance. Yup, I blame it on the alcohol (we'll the after effects that is).

Come Friday afternoon on 7.30.10 at 1:30 PM, my friend and I were extremely hungover, starving, and craving Chinese food aka hangover food. We were about to walk over to Noodle Asia in the Venetian, but remembered that we had a 15% discount for Zine as hotel guests of the Palazzo, so we decided to give them another chance.

When we arrived at Zine, it was once again near empty so we were seated promptly.

FOOD/DRINKS:
*Iced Lychee Drink ($7.95): Disgustingly sweet. It was a literally a can of lychee in syrup placed into a glass and then topped w/ ice. If anything, this should be called a dessert and NOT a drink. 

*Potstickers ($8): Meh! This was actually gyoza (Japanese potsticker) where the skin is much thinner and borderline translucent. Although the bottom of the "potsticker" was crisp, the chicken filling was completely tasteless. The accompanying sauce wasn't much help as it tasted like diluted sweet soy sauce.

*Siu Mai ($6.95): Meh! We ordered this the first time and it was just as bad the second time around. The skin was completely dry and so was the meat. This was definitely not homemade, nor steamed. *ahem* Microwaved.

*Har Gow ($6.95): Meh! It arrived cold and the skin was hardening on the tips. The shrimp filling was dry and tasteless and was missing the crunch from the bamboo shoots and the hint of ginger.

*Fung Zhao ($4.95): Pictures speak a thousand words, so I will let my picture do the talking. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=oX3NocjM0NOBQPQvivrsrg

*Fried Tofu ($8): It was ok. The firm tofu was battered lightly and fried to a crisp golden brown. Tofu is naturally very bland and takes on the flavor of other ingredients and sauces. The accompanying sauce was so diluted that it tasted like water.

*Steamed Pork Spareribs ($4.95): It was ok; however, it wasn't cooked correctly. The spareribs should have been mixed w/ the black bean sauce and then steamed. However, Zine steamed the unseasoned spareribs first and then topped it w/ black bean sauce. The spareribs were tender, but were flavorless unless you got a piece of the black bean which was extremely salty b/c it didn't get a chance to break down during the cooking process. 

*Salty Fish and Chicken Fried Rice ($16.80): FAIL! Everything about this dish was wrong. The white chicken meat (should be cooked w/ dark meat) was overcooked and dry. Normally, salty fish that's been soaking in a salty briny oil is used so it flavors the rice w/ hint of saltiness from the fish. Instead, they used shriveled up fried salty fish pieces. There were a barely any scallions and no ginger, so there was lack of freshness and aroma. In short, the dish was bland and I broke the cardinal rule when eating Chinese food...dousing soy sauce ALL over it.

SERVICE:
Same as the first visit; cold, rude, and inattentive. It took nearly 10 minutes for the waiter to acknowledge we were there, even when the restaurant was near empty. The staff was also terribly disorganized; every time a food runner comes out w/ dish(es) they didn't know what table ordered what. 

Just as much as a degree doesn't give you commonsense, the chef receiving a ribbon from Le Cordon Bleu doesn't give him the credibility to cook "authentic" Chinese food. Harsh, I know, but sometimes the "truth" does hurt. 

Fool me once shame on you, fool me once shame on me...NEVER AGAIN!
