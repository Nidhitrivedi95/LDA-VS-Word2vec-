cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A I've been hearing for years we needed to come here and we finally made the trek.  I'm just sorry we did not do it sooner!

I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the concept.  But the moment I tasted my first sample, I was already in love.  Rarely do I find a restaurant that gives out free samples like they do on your first visit that ends up having bad food.  This is the "hey we know our food is so good we're going to give you some before you even buy it!"

I had the carnitas with black beans and jerk fried rice while hubby had the jade red chicken quesadilla, jerk chicken, pork fried rice and black beans.  Everything was completely flavorful on their own and tasted great together; even the beans!  The jerk chicken is quite spicy - in a very good way and the carnitas were packed with flavor.
