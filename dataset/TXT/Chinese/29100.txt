8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ Actually I LOVE dim sum here. It's crazy how busy this restaurant gets.

If you come* before 11am (on any day), all dim sum items are $2.80 each (except the "Chef's Specials")
*if you ORDER before 11am

If you come at typical lunch time on weekends (11am to 2pm), expect a 40 minute wait. YEP. 

On my last visit here, we arrived at 10:50am!!!! We got seated right away, and we frantically checked off our items on the menu, then I shoved the menu in the waiter's face asking, "Are we going to make the special price before 11am!!!!????" He said, "We'll see what the kitchen says!"

He came back, and the time stamped on our menu was: 10:58am 
WE MADE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!

YES I LOVE the dim sum here! I DO!!!! I think everything is soooo delicious. My boyfriend and I are huuuuuuge fans of Dragon Boat's dim sum.

My particular favourite (I didn't expect this!) is the Steamed Rice Noodle with Scallop (#41) which is drenched in XO sauce and dried shrimp paste (it tasted like it) -AND IT IS SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!

Like everyone says... "Fusion" Cuisine???? The owners probably like the word "Fusion" but don't know what it means. The Chinese name of this restaurant is actually just "Dragon Boat" with a really cool typeface and logo.

The service is okay. If you speak Cantonese or Mandarin well, you should be able to handle them (they are the fast, hardworking Asians who are very impatient with slow, indecisive people). They are VERY quick and they seem rude, but my parents are also like that... I got used to it. Just be nice to them and they'll crack (the ugliest but they tried) smile.

CHECK OUT THEIR CLEAN TANKS OF GIGANTIC LOBSTERS AND FLOUNDER FISH!!!!
