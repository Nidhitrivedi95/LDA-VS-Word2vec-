LKuzbx5Yt3yqiokUFdjVhg - I've driven past this place a few times but was hesitant to stop in to give it a try. The outside looked a little run down so it seemed a bit sketchy to me. The inside could use a little renovating as well as putting the AC on. When we got inside it was quiet and lacked decor. The Korean food here is good, even tho the actual restaurant is deceiving. I must say the bibimbap is better than any other I have tried in the Charlotte area. The bulgogi on the other hand, was good, just average. 

One thing I would recommend is to not go on your lunch break. With only 1 person serving the whole place and what seems like only 1 person making the entrees in the back, you're time does get very tight unless you call ahead. 

Overall don't judge a book by its cover. What seems to be not appealing on the outside (& inside ) has pretty tasty food.
