uBCRRQJ4ukFaE_UyY6T1uQ Ate here a couple weeks ago, for our last night of a business trip in Vegas for a change from all the buffets we were eating the nights prior. 

Service: 
All the staff at China Grill are wonderful. We made reservations, and were taken to our table immediately. Our waiter, Lars, was very helpful, described each dish as they came out, and even gave us his personal recommendations. 

Food:
We were a group of 7, and decided to get the "Classics Tasting Menu," - which was amazing! This 6 course, pre-set menu was absolutely to die for! If you're looking to try a few of their delicious menu items, the tasting menu is definitely the best way! 

I was also new to Asian Fusion food, and will admit a little skeptical about what combinations there would be, but after this night, I am most definitely a fan! 

My favorites had to be: 
-Crackling Calamari Salad - part of the trio of salads included
-Spicy Beef and Scallion Dumplings
-Grilled Szechuan Beef - cooked perfectly and the sauce is delicious
-Crispy Spinach - not usually a fan of spinach, but it was made like seasoned seaweed. 
-Wasabi Mashed Potatoes - they had the perfect amount of wasabi, not over powering

and last but not least: (for dessert)
-Cheesecake Pot Stickers - MUST TRY! they sound odd, but after dipping these little golden triangles of goodness in the trio of sauces, that first bite is heaven!
