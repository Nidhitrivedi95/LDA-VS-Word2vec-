But overall the experience was just okay. The variety is kind of lacking for a buffet, though they do have all the (deep fried) traditional American foods that you find at Chinese buffets. And their potato puffs were the best I've ever had. The Chinese food variety was really lacking, though, and some of the food was not super warm by the time you got back to your seat to eat it.

So, it was clean and nice looking, the food was okay, and if all you want is your normal Americanized Chinese buffet, you'll get it here!
