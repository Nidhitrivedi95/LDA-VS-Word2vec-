TxNeo206T0jMvRRQ4nKSIg Fun an GIGANTIC buffet that make you feel like you're in a fancy Vegas hotel/casino. Very nice place and plenty of tables; we were 5 with no reservation and got a table within 5 minutes on a busy new year's eve night.  Grand piano in the middle with live music. Great selection with lobster, crab legs, sushi, sashimi, teppanyaki grill, roast beef, peking duck and fridges filled with bottled drinks that you can grab yourself. Although the selection and service was great, the food however wasn't the most tasty that we've had from a buffet.  Poor selection of dessert, not many cake and sweet option. Great vibe. WIll come back.
