gtcsOodbmk4E0TulYHnlHA Really wished this place was around when I worked in the Bloor & Shaw area. The last time I walked by this location it was a questionable Chinese restaurant. I couldn't help but notice there's something much better going on when I strolled by the other day.

I could sense it was a coffee shop when I walked in based on the amount of people clicking away on their laptops. I figured I would rest my feet at the bar and have my fourth cup of coffee that day. I looked around to see if there was a menu and grabbed their clipboard -- it listed all the fancy coffees they make, but thankfully they had three edible options at the bottom. I opted for the ham & swiss sandwich.

Americano was good. Girl working there was friendly, and the decor was quite nice. It's not a unique experience with lots of wood & black paint (similar to Beaconsfield or Churchill) but I appreciated the effort in making the place comfortable. Quite a bit of time passed since I finished my drink and I was wondering if my sandwich was coming or not. I was actually about to pack up and forget about it, but then a dude finally came with what turned out to be a rather delicious hot snack. Maybe not worth the six-plus dollars it cost (though it came with grapefruit which I skipped) but I was still satisfied.

Would really like to see some more snacks. Even maybe just some baked goods like muffins or cookies. I realise it's also probably a rocking bar at night, but if it's going to do the coffee shop vibe in the morning/afternoon I would like to have a little more variety. I would have killed for some soup.
