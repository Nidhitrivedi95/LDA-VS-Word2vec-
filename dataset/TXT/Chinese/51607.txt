cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A The first time someone told me about this place like twenty years ago I was like, "Ewhhhhhhhhh, Really? Mixed Chinese and Mexican food? GROSS!" However,  it works and many menu food items are very good. I am not a fan of Mexican food in general but I like most of the food here. The Jade chicken Quesadilla is my favorite.

I know this is random but they have the best Black Beans in Az. In fact I have a friend who says they are the best in America. She has tried them all over the world and always thinks theirs are the best. She has to have them every so often. Random number two, who knew? Their Snickerdoodles are the best I have found out of NY or a bakery. I know, very random.
