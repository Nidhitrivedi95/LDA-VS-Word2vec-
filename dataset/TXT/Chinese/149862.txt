sQFpfRs1Flcw3evCdI2wpA My boyfriend and I were looking for a late night dinner near the Eaton Center. It was open, with just a few tables filled- probably because of the time (9:30pm).  As soon as we walked in, a stench just hit us. It smelled like a dirty bathroom and I really wanted to leave, but my boyfriend said maybe we'll get used to the smell and we just wanted food... but sure enough, it stayed through the entire dinner. We were seated very close to the basement bathrooms too... I'm not sure if they had a plumbing issue that day...

We had the fried dumplings from the dim sum menu, which came out DEEP fried, greasy, doughy and tasteless (we expected pan fried dumplings like the ones on the picture...).  It didn't come with any sauce so we had to track down someone (there were a lot of wait staff just kind of walking back and forth... the manager was just sitting at a table across from us just watching the front door. I hoped they would have a red vinegar or something, but she offered soy sauce which just doesn't go with the dumplings, so that was disappointing.

I got the seafood pho which boasted shrimp, crab meat and vietnamese sausage...it had over-boiled imitation crab meat (if it's going to me imitation at least don't boil it to a near mush...) and it was all very bland.

My boyfriend got the yellow curry which was really sweet that came with some plain lettuce leaves so we asked for some sort of dressing/sauce (we really like our sauces don't we :P?) and it came with a semi-decent nuoc cham. 

I've been to a lot of vietnamese places and this one was by far the most disappointing.

Maybe we'll try other food items but I'm not interested in going back there...
