F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw The restaurant was very accommodating to our group of 9 adults and 3 children. We kept ordering food and they kept bringing it out. Service was excellent. Food was good but not spectacular.

Chicken Lung Fung Soup - 5 - Very flavorful

Chicken Filled Won Ton Soup - unk - I didn't try it but it didn't look like very many won ton.

Chicken Pakora - 3 - Okay. The green sauce gave it character.

Deep Fried Chicken Wings with Yunan Sauce - 4 - Slightly messy but very flavorful.

Drums of Heaven - 3 - Good. 

Beef with Broccoli - 2 - Way too much sauce. 

House Special Fish - 5 - Excellent. Was supposed to be mildly spicy but I felt it was spicier.

Cauliflower Manchurian - 3 - We had ordered it dry, but they made it wet. They noticed it before we did and offered to remake it but we opted to keep it. Next time, we'll stick to dry. 

Chicken Ying Yang Rice. - 2  - Either the chicken was cut very small or there was just wasn't much chicken. Flavor was somewhat bland and the dish was dry.

Vegetable Shanghai Noodles - 3 - Not nearly enough garlic or veg. 

Note that this restaurant does not serve pork and one of our diners has an allergy to shrimp. Otherwise we would not have ordered as many chicken dishes. We're curious as to how different our scores would be had we ordered other proteins.
