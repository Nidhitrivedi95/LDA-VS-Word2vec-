9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw Eaten here twice, both times consistent and fresh. Good flavors and the vegetables are quality - no babycorn or water chestnut fillers in the noodle dishes. Very clean, spotless dishes. (sounds weird but it is notable)

Food: The Singapore Mei Fun was great, as were the Chicken w/Garlic Sauce and the wildcard: a 1/2 order Orange Chicken Combo Special (6.95 and the size of a full order at any other Chinese restaurant) which comes with broccoli, a spring roll and your choice of rice. Brown rice is available for an extra $1. 

Service: Absolutely everyone I've interacted with at this restaurant is really cheerful and helpful, the waitstaff filled our water glasses at least 5 times over the course of our last lunch there - not so much because we were parched, but because our glasses were 2/3rds full of ice. They could make their job easier by putting less ice in their water glasses but they choose not to cut that corner and for that reason I think service at Baidu China Bistro is exceptional. 5 stars for service. You can tell there is good management here - the morale seems to be very high. No grumpy chefs slamming their woks down on the burner here!

Nice to find another good Asian eatery in the SW corridor when we need to run to Party City or Best Buy down on Rainbow/215.
