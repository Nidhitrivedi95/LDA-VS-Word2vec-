HNW4P0jAhXYRJ_op7OcWCw I ordered food to be delivered, when i opened up my bag it was the wrong order, i tried calling back but they were closed so i waited and called them the next day and i told them what happened and the guy on the phone was extremely rude and said to call back tomorrow, then he hung up on me. So i called back the next day and the so called "manager" told me he was the one to take my order and that I said the wrong thing and it was my fault... I'm not even kidding; he actually told me that the ordered being messed up was MY fault. I also had gone there a few weeks before that and i ordered in and my Lo Mein had a small wing of an insect sitting on top of it. When i tried to take it back he tried to act like he didn't know what i was talking about.  i have never witnessed customer service as bad as this place.
