There are very limited choices when it comes to finding good dining options in the Gaston County/Lake Wylie area except for Americanized Asian quality meals.  The outside is unassuming but inside is modern and inviting.  The variety and quality of the menu, from sushi to almost all of the Asian cuisines is reason to stop and come back.
