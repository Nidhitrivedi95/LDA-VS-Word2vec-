taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg Soup Dumpling...Xiao Long Bao....you want is steamed, fried, or boiled.  This place is on point.  12 guys, 1 girl, we split up 6 and 7 per table.  I was at the 7 table.  My order was pork with green onion and added shrimp.  Other beauties were lamb and chicken dumplngs.  A fried beef dumpling.  Each serving was approx 15 to 20 pieces.  The eyes plays tricks on you.  We did family style and traded with each other and sampled various dumplings.  The one key thing i learnt from my older sister in law in California is you need to make a good dipp8ng sauce for your dumplings.  Her wise words rang in my head and made due with what i was offered with.  A little bowl you squeeze this hoysin sauce, like 2 pea sizes, then the sambao or chili red sauce, drizzle hot oil with chili bits and douse with soy sauce.  Stir and taste your sauce.  Ask for a soup spoon to place a little of the sauce on the bottom, lightly place your dumpling, poke a hole to let the hot steam out, sip the broth coming out and let the flavours roll on your tongue.  Different nodes of ginger, garlic delishness.  You then deposit that 1 bite morsel into your mouth.  Savour the medley composed on your taste buds.  These guys did it right right.  The steamed lamb, you get that gamey nodes on your tastw buds.  The fried beef dumpling, the crispiness of the exterior.  You win...no matter what you order.  The pairing for me was beer.  Modello Especiale.  Bubbly drink washing down these pillowy goodness.  C'est magnifique!
