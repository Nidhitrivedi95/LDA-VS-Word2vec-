aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ No big fancy review from me this time, just the simple plain facts.

Decor: This is super fancy and upscale looking place.
Location: The location in the office building and taking up 2 levels makes it real convenient for the PATH folks and the tenants alike to enjoy a nice place.
Drinks: No booze for me this time, so good ol POP.
Service:  The waitress was really attentive and had the patience of a superstar.  Having to work with the biggest group of undecideds (us) really showed her skills.
Food: I ordered beef chow ming.  I really enjoyed my food.  The white rice was really good and sticky.

The biggest winner here is they CAN cook without MSG and that is what really sold us in going here.

Short and sweet review, nice and enjoyable time.
