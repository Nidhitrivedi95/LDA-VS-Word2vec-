IOwTrStIy6NinyquhBrLZQ I come typically come here when I'm at Excalibur because the food is decent, depending on what you get. The food is Asian fusion but some of it is way too oversauced and salty. But for some reason I still like to come here...probably because it's the only location in Vegas. If given an option though, I'd probably choose Panda Express over this Pick Up Stix.
