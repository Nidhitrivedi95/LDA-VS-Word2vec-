Considering the selection is probably twice that of any other Chinese food buffet place and about a good 80% of the dishes are very well made and delicious, you won't go home hungry.  We both really loved the food.  They also have a few dishes that are not Chinese, to add variety and I guess for those who want some regular food.  The service was also excellent - cheerful, friendly, from the front desk to the person waiting the tables.  It was a pleasant experience and we WILL go back. Oh - totally reasonable prices too.
