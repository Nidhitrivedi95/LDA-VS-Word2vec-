pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Love sushi. Love pan-Asian so I had high expectations. Absolutely amazing Tuna Tataki recommended by bartender.  See my pic. I would return here just to eat it again!Salmon sashimi was fresh but nothing memorable. Even at the bar the service was awful, quite prompt probably due to being there 3 pm but they got orders wrong on both sides of me, and not terribly attentive. Yes they're expensive but no more so than any similar quality restaurant. If you want good, cheap authentic Asian food you need to go off-strip to where the locals live.
