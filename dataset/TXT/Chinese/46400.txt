BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA Food was a-ok. Lots of selection to choose from and the flavours were quite authentically Chinese. 

Siu Long Bao was delicious and very juicy! 

My only quip is that it's expensive for dumplings, but I'm comparing to suburb prices. And I know that Chinatown Spadina strip is more expensive. But all in all, I would come back.
