gz87Wa7QUZ3gNlgE9NVPAA I was starving and between errands so stopped in for a quick chicken fried rice. Disgusting. There was zero flavor... I added three packs of soy sauce to make it taste like something. The chicken had a grayish color and no carrots, peas or egg. Only bean sprouts and onion, I ate about a quarter of it and pitched it. Never again. How hard is fried rice?
