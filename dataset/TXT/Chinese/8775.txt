1MGhb6z2XSTsyLvQgylXiA Took a chance, & I'm glad we did ! Great food, quick service & affordable prices. We tried the beef & broccoli $8.99 , teriyaki chicken $7.99 & a small bowl of egg drop soup $3.99. The small size of the soup could have served 2 people easily ! But... I hogged the whole bowl . I can't wait  to come back and try the hot & sour soup .
