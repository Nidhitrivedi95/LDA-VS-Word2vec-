6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q This is your typical overpriced underwhelming Casino Chinese Food.  When I say overpriced I mean by 200%.  Food is flat and uninspired.  The price for the Oxtail Soup 2 stars for 1 at $13 is ridiculous.  The oxtail soup at the California Hotel Casino is 10 times better for under $10 and is a complete meal by itself.  The tomato egg sauce with Taiwan noodles was acceptable but is still overpriced at $18.  If you want world class dim sum, go to Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast casino where the local Chinese go. I would never return.
