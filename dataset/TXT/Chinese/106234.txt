l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA Not my absolute favorite restaurant in East Valley, but tasty enough to keep us coming back. I will be honest though, a big reason that this place gets a 4 instead of a 3 is because my husband and I have found NO other Chinese food in the area that is edible (if anyone has recommendations, I am all ears!). The jerk chicken was chewy with quite a bit of gristle. The Jade Red Chicken is my favorite, similar to a VERY spicy combination of S&S Chicken and General Tso's at your typical Chinese hole-in-the-wall. Some people love the black beans, but they are way too salty for our taste, while the refried variety have no flavor to speak of. If you are extra hungry, you can get a combo plate that comes with your choice of fried rice varieties, either bean, and two smaller portions of a meat (or veggie). You can get your meat on a quesadilla or in a burrito for no extra cost! The decor is simple; a large number of very long, heavy-duty plastic tables, lined up in L-formation in the restaurant. They face a huge flat-screen TV, which seems to always be tuned to ESPN. Order at the counter, give them your name, and then they bring the food out to you in foil to-go containers. Quick service, moderately priced food. Would be great for a large group. Not sure if young kids could handle the spice, though. My nose ran for hours after eating here!
