a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg Big disappointment tonight here. Service was curt and unfriendly, but the food was dreadful. Even the water had an unpleasant chemical quality. Soup was thin, wantons had only the meerest hint of pork, the chips were overly greasy and cold, the fried rice was cold and tasteless and the "crispy" duck was over-salted, over-battered and unappetizing. 
We decided never to return. There are too many other good choices in Cleveland's Chinatown neighborhood.
