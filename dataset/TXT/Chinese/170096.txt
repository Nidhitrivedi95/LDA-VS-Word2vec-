VvSmE1NnTjnaTPHT0WrCaQ Great for the family!  We stumbled onto this place while walking around Kensington and it quickly became a highlight of the day.  My wife is the only vegetarian in our family, but we were all thrilled with our food.  The dumplings and soups (Hot & Sour; Udon) were all loaded with veggies and delicious.  My wife loved her curried rice.  And I was totally gaga over the spicy eggplant dish I ate with the combo meal.  The sauce was perfect - I didn't leave a drop of it behind.  If we had one in our hometown we would eat there every week!
