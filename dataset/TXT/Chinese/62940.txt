DW7ttoWMaI2jWN41gekbiA I will be very hard pressed to come back. The food is not enough to overcome the unsavoury clientele that always appears to be present at this location. I suppose the old adage location, location, location truly applies here. If it's not college students wanting to fight middle aged people, or very visible thugs trying to get out of their bills by complaining about absolutely everything (how can you possibly complain about the water not being filled quick enough at a Mandarin?!? As soon as you put the glass to your mouth, you can see a server running to get the water pitcher!) I will not come back. Not even a "free" visit would entice me. If eating in uncomfortable environments is your thing, then this is the restaurant for you! Not for my family or I.
