W9JHcg3YTWo2-gfLSS4Wlw Paul did a great job ing making me feel very comfortable during my first session of acupuncture. I was very nervous going in there, but from the moment you walk in with soothing sounds it eased my tension. The only regret I have is this was a visit to Scottsdale and Sedona and I can't go back to "above and beyond". My trip was great and with all the climbing and off road driving my back never bothered me one bit. Thanks Paul! Keep up the good work.
