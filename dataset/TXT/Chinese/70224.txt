f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ If you've been to other dim sum restaurants, you're not missing much here!

My family and I absolutely love dim sum, so when I saw this new place we had to give it a shot. When walking in, we could already tell the ambiance change compared to when it was Cathay house. Much cleaner, however very compact when it came to the seating.

Whenever we go eat dim sum, we usually order the Yang Chow fried rice from the actual menu to accompany the dim sum. There was nothing too special for the fried rice, and it was very very greasy.

The menu breaks down their prices based on the size of the dish, and it was very confusing considering some of the items weren't even provided on the break down. Because dim sum is pay per order, we usually calculate how much we are getting so we know what to expect when the bill comes. Due to the confusion in pricing, we spent over budget.

The actual dim sum itself wasn't as satisfying as we hoped it would be. We ordered the shumai, steamed pork bun, shrimp ball, and chicken feet. The best item was in fact the shrimp ball! It definitely took me back to when I use to get authentic dim sum in downtown California. 

The water was obviously from the tap, and the taste was so bad we had to order other refreshments to accompany our meal...

Overall, I would never go out of my way to come back here because there are other establishments  I enjoy like Orchid Garden. The staff was very nice in general, but it didn't compensate for the lack of flavor in the dim sum. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind coming here if a friend ever suggested to do so, but I myself wouldn't make the trip.
