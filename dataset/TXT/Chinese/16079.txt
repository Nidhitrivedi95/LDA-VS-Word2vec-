3v1c2BsFFcWlpV3S3LS8dA If you're looking for good Chinese food, it really doesn't get any better than this.  I get disappointed if I even think about ordering my Chicken w/ Broccoli from anywhere else.  As an avid fan of spicy food, it's tough to find any place in town that will satisfy my craving for heat.  If you tell Taipei Express to make it "very spicy", they actually make it very spicy!  Imagine that!  The place itself is relatively small, with very little parking.  The perfect take-out place--but if you're looking for a formal dining experience, this ain't it.
