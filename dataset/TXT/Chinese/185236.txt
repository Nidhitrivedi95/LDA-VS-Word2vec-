XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA Loved this place! Although the server was a little misogynistic with : "ladies shouldn't slurp big noodles that's for mans" I still enjoyed the soup very much. Go with spicy broth because it's not that spicy and you want all the flavor possible. Seeing the chef pulling the noodles at the front restaurant is also a cool perk.
