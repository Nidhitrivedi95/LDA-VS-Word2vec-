C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ If I can give this a zero star I will. Havent had chance to post my review yet since im too busy. But now I wanna say that its the worst buffet at asia I ever been too. My sister got food poisoned eating here like 2 months ago!  Had to take her to the ER and doctor said its a food poisoned , asked her what she ate and I remember the only thing we ate is at the buffet asia. I think its the bbq shortribs (cook to order) that she ate to made her felt like that. Its probably undercooked or bad already. Goodthing I didnt eat that or else will both be on ER. I would never go here again!
