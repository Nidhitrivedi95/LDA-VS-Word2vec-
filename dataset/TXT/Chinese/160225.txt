U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q I'm a huge fan of all noodles, dumplings and baos and after hearings our friend's positive reviews, whom is originally from Beijing, I had to try their hand-pulled noodles...   

We arrived at 4:30pm this past Sunday with only a 2 people party in front of us.  The hostess took my name down and said it'll be a 10 minute wait.  However, the restaurant was half empty with plenty of wait staff walking around and casually cleaning up.  While we are wondering why we needed to wait, our hostess was chatting it up with another hostess playing with their purses on the podium/table right in front of us.  After 15 minutes, we were finally walked to our table.  We ordered Dandan noodles, pan fried pork buns and mango pomelo sago.  The food arrived relatively quick.  The pork buns were nice and hot and was great with vinegar; the noodles were just average with minimal sauce but the dessert was quite poor with powdery tapioca.  

Overall, the food was just ok especially at their prices.  We definitely will not come back nor would we recommend this place to our friends because of their poor customer service.  None of the staff gave us a smile and we really don't like establishments that try to make themselves look busy when they aren't.   I have to say  it's a good change of pace from the other restaurants inside Casears Palace and a good back up for Bacchanal's crazy long lines but if you don't make your guests feel welcomed, it doesn't matter how "authentic" your food is.
