MNo2l4eFOOJqCo8PX0W12A Comparing it to all other buffets I have been to, the quality of food is a notch or two above average.  Value is probably one of the best I've seen.  Selection was numerous and they also had a sign that they would prepare anything fresh for you upon request.  I was more than satisfied after I left and would return when I'm back in the area again.

The one star off is that the dining area was not the most clean, but they did what they could and it was ok.
