Nsi49BE_XsjJ0oOXwhH8hA One word: DISGUSTING! Walking up to the restaurant tells the whole story. Dirty, grimy, and flavorless! Everything is greasy the floors, tables, windows, crane game, plates. 

The food is GREASY dripping GREASY! The waiter dropped the food left on the table onto the floor then swept it up. 

I was so upset I asked for the owner supposedly he wasn't there. I made sure I pointed out the filth throughout the restaurant to the man I spoke with. He profusely apologized and said they would try to solve the problems. I said, I would never find out because I will NEVER return! BTW..never did it cross his mind to take a meal off our bill (which I didn't except).

If the filth is where the public can see it, I can't imagine how the kitchen is. 

BTW..I looked at the pictures for the restaurant and the owner who 'wasn't there' is the man I spoke with the same shirt. He refused to admit he was the owner! How sad! 

Don't compromise your sense of worth for  the "value price"!
