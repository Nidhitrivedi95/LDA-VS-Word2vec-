XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA Anytime I want to go to a Chinese buffet, I go to Pacific. The sushi is good as far as buffet sushi goes. It's not as good as you would get at an actual sushi restaurant, but it's pretty decent. They have a good variety of food. My absolute favorite thing there is the short ribs. They are delicious! They have a good variety of ice cream as well! All in all, a pretty good Chinese buffet!
