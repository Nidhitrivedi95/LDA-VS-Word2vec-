Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA Great food with great time management. I come here kind of often but this time, the service was S H I T. The neglected and I find it very unprofessional when the employees are eating right in front of us.

It's a bit small but most of the time the place is vacant

I ordered the bbq Chicken over fried rice and it is one of my fav dish on the menu. It's delicious with the sauce!! ($6.95)
Rating- 8.9

Also I got the Panang curry spicy 5. I wish there was more green peppers and meat rather than sauce. It's enough to fill one to two people. ($6.95)

Definitely give this plAce a try if you're into thai food :)
