aPBTwoHvuVKHP2zkiKvwQQ This place was a pleasant surprise in Surprise! I had been to a few Chinese joints and was scared by reviews of other places. I wanted a good Chinese restraunt that offered delivery. The food was delivered promptly and very fresh and delicious.The sauces were not too salty,oily,sweet or too spicy. I ordered full dinners for 4 people soup,appetizers,fried rice and main entree. A small inconvenient fact is they forgot my small steamed rice I ordered for my Daughter but I made her something at home instead.I found my new place within a reasonable price range,so no more long drives to Glendale .Trust me, coming from a picky eater this says a lot.
