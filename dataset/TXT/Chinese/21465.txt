6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q I'm Chinese, I have to say it's totally not the real Chinese style food at all! suppose the chef is not Chinese. the Chongqing da Quran chicken is horrible. Dandan noodle is not made like that and I can't even tell it's dandan noodle. Definitely not recommend come here, if u r Chinese. The food is disgusting.
