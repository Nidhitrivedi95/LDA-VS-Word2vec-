First is the genuine creativity of the food.  Amazing.  They meld some crazy combination of Japanese, Peruvian, Brazilian and Freaking sexy.  I don't know.  But every dish, and we had MANY, surprised the palate.

The manager was caring and even offered us a free starter.  Some little piece of ocean life on top of a finely chopped pile of garlic and green things . . . outrageously good.

Then the waitress, Luara, started telling us stories.   About the foods and origins of dishes.  About the little stuff (this black salt on the filet is from . .. and one of the four seaweeds you just had was made from algae not seaweed .. . ) and on and on.  And this angel waitress has a passion for food and takes joy in making our time special.  I'll stop here, but she was so good at being THERE with us. How often do you get that treatment and it's not being faked?

The table next to us had some kind of drink tower.  Little tiny wine glasses on a metal tree full of different drinks and lit up from the bottom.  Fun.  

Prices reasonable and maybe the crowd a little wild, but it was in The Palazzo in Vegas, what do I expect!?  This place is hidden= hunt for it!!!
