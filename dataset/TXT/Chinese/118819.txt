NO-kZ9See-AXcZDtssJMmw My boyfriend and i LOVE Volcano! We are there at least twice a month! It's very clean and you don't leave feeling grously stuffed. The waiters are also very kind and attentive. The main drawback is that... THEIR SUSHI SUCKS! This alone is very important to me, and if they improved it... they would definetly get my 5-star rating. Go check it out! Their orange chx is my fav :)
