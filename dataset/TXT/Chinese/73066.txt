FiEcKfGo-rbYyhoKHw_0MA This place is fairly new and the decor shows how clean it is.  But it doesn't give me the HotPot vibe.  It  was pretty empty when I went there for dinner and it's a Southeast Asian decor.  And I thought Hot Pot is mainly a Chinese thing.  

I had the Ying Yang pot (spicy and plain on the two sides of the pot).  The pork broth produces a strong flavor for the soup.  All the spices in the two sides made the base very strong and flavorful.  Actually it almost seemed a bit too heavy for my taste. And the spicy side is very spicy (at least to me).  For the additional sauces they had their own version of soy sauce and a peanut sauce.  It was a bit sweet for my taste, so I didn't use it that much.  But the meat and vegetables dipped in the broth was definitely enough for flavor.  The napa especially soaked up the spicy broth very nicely.  I like drinking the broth after the meal to relax my stomach, but the strong broth is more like a starter soup instead of an ending soup.

We had the shabu beef and lamb.  They were sliced thinly, but the meat just didn't seem as tender as I would like it.  And the portions were very very small.  The presentation/dishes were very nice, but the food quality just isn't there.

If you like strong broth flavors, then you can try this place.  But honestly, as far as Hot Pot goes, this place is very expensive with very little portions.  For the price we paid, we could have gone to Texas Roadhouse for a prime rib.  The food provided is about average as well.  If you can't travel to California and you have a craving Hot Pot, then I guess this is the only alternative.  But it may be better and cheaper if you just set it up at home.
