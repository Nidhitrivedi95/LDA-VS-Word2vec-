Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w I ate out there a couple of times with friends and family. The dishes there are good, but not excellent in taste. I'd say that most of the dishes here are on the Americanized side because the Asian American Communities are on the small side. I guess this is what you would expect when you go to an Asian Resturant in Cleveland, Ohio.
