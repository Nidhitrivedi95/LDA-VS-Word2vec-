jvUeGNTr7M-FRyozqKRZzQ Forgettable. If I had to sum up the overall experience in one word, it would be forgettable. Actually, they are like a pricier Pei Wei, but not one of the good Pei Weis either. I took my friend out for his birthday dinner here. They are located inside of the Green Valley Ranch hotel and open at 5pm. The service was pretty spotty and slow. They start you off with the wonton chips and sweet and sour dip. Those were pretty standard. We opted for the lettuce wraps and they were okay. The sauces reminded me of my mediocre attempt at recreating the sauce for the lettuce wraps...hoisin sauce overload. I had hot and sour soup which was spicy, but it lacked the complexity of flavor that I love about hot and sour soup. It was just spicy and otherwise bland...not very flavorful. My friend had the general tso's chicken, and that was a caramelized mess that I did not even want a second taste of. The bill was still $30+ and the food came out very slowly. The server was not particularly attentive and we sat there with empty glasses on a few occasions. I would rather walk down to PF Changs next time for better quality food and equal prices.
