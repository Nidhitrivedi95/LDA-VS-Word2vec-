l-nL4BmhzpZjcavooO48PQ I am giving this restaurant a 3.5-star rating.

I visited this restaurant a while back for lunch with my colleagues from work. I have only been here once. This restaurant is a five-minute drive from my workplace.

It was a Friday. It's wasn't all that busy when we came at around noon. However, the phone was pretty busy catering to takeout orders, which fascinated me.

The restaurant has a bunch of lunch specials. I went with the crispy beef special. It came with rice and a spring roll. The beef had sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I enjoyed my food. It was tasty and filling.

My manager thought that the food was okay. I don't recall what he had ordered, though.

I recall how nice the tablecloth was. Service was fast that day.
