bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q It wasn't bad....but. we have been going to Yao for several years and it's only 2 miles away from Singing Panda. Every time I find a new Chinese place, I am disappointed...in comparison to Yao. Singing Panda was the same feeling. Plus, we spent 30% more money for 30% less food than we get at Yao AND it wasn't nearly as tasty as Yao.
