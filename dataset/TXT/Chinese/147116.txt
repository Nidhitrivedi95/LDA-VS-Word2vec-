safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg Let me start by saying that my friends and I used to frequent this place all the time for the $10 AYCE.

HOWEVER.

On the second to last visit, one of the waitresses told us that we HAD to order in a specific order:  soup, appetizer, rice, entree.
Um.  Excuse me?  If I order crab rangoon, and eggplant in garlic sauce, and then decide that I want an egg roll, THAT is what you are going to give me.  I've NEVER had to order in a specific order before.  Ridiculous.

THEN, my best friend and I went with another friend a week or two later.  
My best friend did not want AYCE, even though the other friend and myself were going to have it.  The servers told my friend he HAD to do AYCE because we were.  
He said "If I sit at another table can I just order what I want?"  They said yes.

And proceeded to IGNORE him the rest of the time we were there.  

He went so far as to take out $500 cash, and lay it out on the table, and drop the menu on the floor to get their attention.  They just laughed and ignored him.

We will NEVER be back to this restaurant.  Ever.  
Terrible service.  These people are a disgrace.
