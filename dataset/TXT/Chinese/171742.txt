VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Had dinner there last night to give it another try.  Something is going on in the kitchen as the food is getting worse.  Had potstickers, small and tasteless, lettuce wraps, lettuce wilted, chicken and snap peas, white meat not soft and tender without sauce like it used to be and lacking in flavor.  If the food was better we could put up with the noise level which is terrible, but afraid we have to find another place for chinese food.  Somehow, the place is going down hill fast.  Sorry.
