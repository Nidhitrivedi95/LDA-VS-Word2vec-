cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ While I was in Vegas for business last week, I stop by here twice. That's how much I enjoyed the food. I love Pa-Thai noddles, so I ordered (both times) the combo which has shrimp,beef,& chicken. Great both times. They give out big portions so 1 dish is more then enough for 2 with a side of steam rice. It was all good!!.. Except for an annoying customer my 1st visit who to the liberty to sit with 2 young women (they didn't ask him 2) and just started talking nonsense.. Other then that decent price and good service. I recommend.
