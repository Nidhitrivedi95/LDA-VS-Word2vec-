H2RgkjPs3W-CxbyygCJJew This review is an unusual one in that I am not commenting on the food. I want to express my appreciation for the manager on Christmas Day for selling me 4 onions! While my family was preparing Christmas dinner, my husband suddenly wailed "AAAHH! I forgot to buy onions! And everything that we're making has onions!!" After telling him that yes, he probably ruined Christmas (haha, I'm evil), I went out to search for onions. Of course, because it was Christmas Day, there were no grocery stores that were open. However, I thought that perhaps there may be a restaurant that is open and maybe, just maybe, I could offer to buy a few onions from them? Pacific Gardens was one of the very few restaurants open near me and I walked in, a woman on a mission. 

Me: "Hello, I was hoping I could buy a few onions from you because nothing else is open and we have to finish cooking Christmas dinner."
Server: "Uh, ..... let me go get a manager."

*crickets*

Manager: "How may I help you?"
Me: "I know this is an unusual request, but I was hoping I could buy a few onions from you because nothing is open today and I need to finish cooking Christmas dinner."
Manager: "You want to buy...onions?"
Me: "Yes. Just regular, whole, round onions, yellow or white or red, whatever you have."
Manager: "Let me go to the kitchen."

*a few minutes later*

Manager arrives bearing 4 perfect whole white onions in a bag.
Me: "Awesome! Thank you so much! Is $8 enough?" (that was all the cash I had, but I thought it would be more than sufficient)

So, thanks Pacific Gardens for saving Christmas! :) I will check out your place soon to enjoy some of your actual cooked food. Happy New Year!
