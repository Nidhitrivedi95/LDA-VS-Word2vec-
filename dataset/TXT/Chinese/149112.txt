sOaeX1zQWuqbPcclvjtdeA P.F. Chang's is an upscale national chain with a giant horse statue in front. I think the horse is pretty uniform of all P.F. Chang's locations. The interior is classy and contemporary, with large booths and a bustling bar. The lead singer of the local cover band "spazmatics" used to work there and I would giggle thinking about how silly he looks in their nerd stage outfits. Anyways, if you go, try the lettuce wraps and flourless chocolate cake. I have never had a bad meal there and never heard of anyone having a bad meal. Why the 4/5 stars? It isn't locally owned. Sorry P.F. Changs! Local always trumps national! 

Their menu has some constants but they do make updates often, focusing on a different regional cuisine of China. They were a true pioneer with their gluten free menu, which as all celiac's know is a godsend since most Chinese is off limits with all the wheat in soy sauce. (That last statement was meant to be educational for all the WLs (wheat lovers). Shocking, yes, but soy sauce's 1st ingredient after water is wheat (unless you get super yummy gluten free sauce that is actually a ton tastier).
