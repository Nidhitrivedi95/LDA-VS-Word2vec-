cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ Stopped by for lunch on a Monday afternoon. Place wasn't too busy. Server was very prompt. Took our orders for pad Thai. The spice scale was only from 1 to 5 which I thought was strange. 

The waiter got us water but it had no ice in it and wasn't particularly cold. Thought it was a bit weird, would want my tap water a little colder than room temperature. 

I got my beef pad Thai and I only did 2 out of 5 spices but I was disappointed as I had no spice whatsoever. And there wasn't much spice to put into the food either as the spice containers on the table were pretty empty. 

Server didn't come back much after we got our food. The food was pretty bland. The peanuts overpowered much of the meal. Beef was okay, the noodles was pretty mushy and lacked flavor. If you wanted to carbo load, it would be great but lacked flavor. I felt bloated after eating the meal, needed to take a nap. 

The place has gotten great reviews before so there must be better dishes. I'd probably say to avoid the pad Thai and maybe bring your own ice cubes.
