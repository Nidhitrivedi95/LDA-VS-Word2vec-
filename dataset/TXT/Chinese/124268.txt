oQwadWTYQWahuj9N-68yPA I wanted to go to Rice Trax but they were closed so we came here . They share the same parking lot so we didn't need to go far. I ordered the Orange Chicken which was made to order. It had that crispness that I love served with some tasty fried rice. I was happy with my order but my brother wasn't happy with his beef steak. He said there were too many veggies and not enough beef. I like that they make everything fresh.  I didn't see any food under heat lamps which I thought was a refreshing change.
