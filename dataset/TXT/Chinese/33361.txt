Operations: this is very disappointed as we took a number waiting in line. During the waiting period, I heard a lot of people missing their numbers called out and customers were very unhappy about this. We were called to a table then we learned someone waiting before us didn't get their table, so we had to wait in line again.

Food: the rice noodle rolls (<U+8178><U+7C89>) are very authentic. Hope they can give me more toppings as in Guangzhou. The rolls tastes smooth and silky as I remember, which still satisfies my crave for this place. 

Maybe some yelpers do not appreciate the rice noodle rolls soaking in the soy sauce, but it is the authentic Guangzhou way of having it. Just like people like California rolls but they didn't exist in Japan. As a person raised in Guangzhou and had rice noodle rolls almost once a week there, I find Yin Ji's rice noodle rolls are quite fair.

We also ordered fried dough stick (<U+6CB9><U+689D>), curry fish balls (<U+5496><U+55B1><U+9B5A><U+86CB>) and Hong Kong style frozen milk tea (<U+51B0><U+93AE><U+5976><U+8336>). I won't recommend any of these three, as you will not see the fish balls and milk tea in Guangzhou Yin Ji restaurants (they're Hong Kong style foods) and they're overpriced. Dough sticks are poorly executed, dough not fermented  enough and a lot of oil excess staying inside the dough.

All in all, I will give the new establishment a couple few months before I visit back and hope for improvement in both operations and localizing themselves for Torontorians. Next time I will come back and try their congee.
