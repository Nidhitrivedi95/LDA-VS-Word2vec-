AbadN65irz8uSL8z6fkoBg Went for lunch with my wife on 6/23.  I was not impressed at all.  The roast duck we had was rather tasteless, although it was juicy.  The Hong Kong style noodles were OK, but nothing to write home about.  I also ordered pork with harm har and ong choi (since I cannot get ong choi in Arizona), and that too was mediocre at best.  They also do not take credit cards which is a bummer.  The owner's previous partner left a couple of years ago and opened up another place named Anna's Garden in the next bldg to the west.  That place is bigger and the food is better by miles.  He also serves $5.00 dishes at lunch just to piss off the BBQ King owner.
