-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw Being a man of relatively relative to relativity proportions, I am pleased to say that the refreshment volumes from this fine establishment was welly sufficient for the appetite for a man of my magnitude. 

With a plethora of drinks and a myriad of topping options to choose from, you can't go wrong with any! The only botheration I do have qualms in regarding is the lack of sizing options; being that there are only two size options available, as I always find myself looking for seconds, but that's just my druthers. 

Amenities include Wifi and pokestops, as the fine oriental beverage retailer also incorporates a well stocked bakery front. 

Definitely a most wonderful experience, 10/10 would go again.
