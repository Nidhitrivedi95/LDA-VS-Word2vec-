JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw Very tasty, we ordered the Dan Dan Noodles, which was fun watching them hand pulling the noodles, but was a little greasy for my taste.  The Shang Fried rice was full of flavor, but our favorite was the Chicken Chow Mein with thin noodles.  Overall the food was very taste it and would recommend you visit.
