44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw *+*+*+*+*+*+* We were expecting a rude wait staff  *+*+*+*+*+*+*+
I felt cheated as many reviewers comment on the rudeness thing .... didn't happen in our case.

We had lunch on our visit  ...... each having one of their luncheon specials.
There are two price points on the luncheon menu ...... either $7.99 or $8.99
Each luncheon special consist of soup, spring roll and entrée.

The food was very good ..... Thank goodness that the sauces Didn't all taste the same. That in itself is a real plus ...... when it comes to a Chinese meal.

Wait staff attentiveness was something else ..... its like you don't exist after your meal arrives.

Enjoyable meal ....... will return in the future.
