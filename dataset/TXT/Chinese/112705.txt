mI2GqBeadATqOkLPhDNOfQ First and last time eating here....you know that moment you have when you regret choosing eating at place for the first time well that's what I've just had....the food is sub par and flavorless...it's set up cafeteria style so you can choose your own dishes I had the Sesame Chicken...which they purport to be the best in town(their words not mine) and teriyaki chicken with a side of their lo mien....huge misses on all points. The only reason they are in business is because they are located in the transit station uptown. Avoid at all costs.
