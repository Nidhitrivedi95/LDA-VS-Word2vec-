We were not planning to dine here, however the forces of the universe brought us here and blessed us with a new, amazing dining experience.  Cierra was an angel and everything we tried cucumber salad, pot stickers, beef noodle soup, fried rice, chicken mushroom and rice; all amazingly delicious!  We found a gem!
