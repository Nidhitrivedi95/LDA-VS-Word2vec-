1yAbNyUgJhOjCz9EcOCWdA Dim sumwhere else if possible.
This restaurant is pretty typical of many of the dim sum establishments in Chinatown.  Stained old carpets that have probably never been cleaned.  The menu has the same items you find anywhere else.

However, not all places have dim sum all day.
So, by the time we all rolled out of bed, and met in China town,  it was later in the afternoon.  By the time we were finished our meal they were actually setting up for dinner.

If you want dim sum and it's late in the day, this place has it!
Don't expect anything exciting! The carts stop around 2pm, but you can order off the dim sum menu.

The staff is actually very friendly!  But, the food is mediocre at best.

deep-fried squid =  soggy tentacles
chicken wings = dry and overcooked
sticky rice = too small
Etc.
Meh.
