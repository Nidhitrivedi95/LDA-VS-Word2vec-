4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA The chinese lady answering the phone is rude. Even in person she is rude. My husband and I had the same experience. I had a hard time understanding her broken english and she seems annoyed by that. So i told her your english is not easy  to understand , her reply?  "i know my english sucks". (Not in a nice tone btw and went to the kitchen talking in her language) I wanted to talk to the manager but accdg to the waiter she is the manager.. Made me laugh.
