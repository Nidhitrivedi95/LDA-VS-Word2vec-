I had the Mongolian Beef, which I thought was excellent..lots of Beef with green and white onion. It came with a nice thick sauce and was served with a generous portion of choice of Steamed or Fried Rice..I chose steamed..
The staff were very nice and did not try and "Hurry me up"..
I would definitely recommend the Ondori for anyone who would like Asian Food when in Las Vegas..!!
