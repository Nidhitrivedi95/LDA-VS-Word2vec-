vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I am extremely picky with Chinese food and this place definitely meet all expectations! I've taken so many people here every time I'm in Vegas and this is the place I constantly try to visit when I'm in town! Their seafood is so fresh, their preps fresh and their dim sum offers a great variety! We all love having choices. I've eaten at the restaurant before and I've also taken it out. Both options great at this place.
