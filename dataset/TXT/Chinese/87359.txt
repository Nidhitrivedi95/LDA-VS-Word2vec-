HTAAMVDZ4P0VX5F9euJBoA I came a long time ago with a friend who used to live in Sichuan for almost 2 years. He recommended this place as his go-to place base on how much he love the real Sichuan taste here. I like their hotpot which has a lot of Hua Jiao (Sichuan pepper) in it and when I accidently bit it, my mouth gets numb and it was not a great feeling at all. The dan dan mian was tasty and very juicy too, will try this one again if I come back. My friend had the order of the dumplings swimming in hot oil which to me, not a fan, but to my friend, he ordered it every time he came in so I basically had chance to try his "real Sichuan dish". I also order the Vegetable Egg Foo Young and it was unexpectedly so good, but we were too full to finish it so i asked for a togo box to have it for my lunch the next day. 
Service is great, very attentive!!
