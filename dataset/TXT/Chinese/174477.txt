WEw08dCcOiwH3Sw1f_8DKQ I was veru upset when this place took over one of my favourite chinese restaurants- RICE PAPER. None the less, thought i would give it a shot. I wasnt disappointed at all. Apparantly the owner who was a head chef in a renowned restaurant in hong kong before he moved here, you can taste the authenticity in his flavour. I love the ambience in the restaurant. Some items hit or miss but if you know you items. GRRRREAAAAAT!!!!
