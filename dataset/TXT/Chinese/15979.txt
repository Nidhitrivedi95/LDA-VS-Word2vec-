3SozmlI5K7xapJBE41Ah1g Finally good Chinese food. We have been looking for a local Chinese restaurant for the past 3 years and finally found it!!!! Great atmosphere- clean and nice updated decor. Great Service- fast and friendly. Great food- fresh  quality ingredients with lots taste.

We ordered the orange chicken, Mongolian beef, shrimp with snow peas, king pao chicken. The orange chicken was the best, but all were good. Nothing was left to take home. 

Highly recommended to anyone who likes Chinese food.
