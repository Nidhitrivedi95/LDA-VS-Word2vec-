CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw this is the best Noodles place we have ever been too, my GF is Vietnamese and she always makes home made Vietnamese food at home, and  she even told me that this place had some awesome noodle soups, I had the Pad thai noodles, which was a little spicy but very delicious, and my GF had the Won Ton Noodle soup which had shrimp in the won ton, she loved it, I had a Thais Iced tea which is a little pricey, because you can get them for $2 off the strip, but it was still good to us. 5 stars, this place is small so expect there will be a line to wait to sit especially on a weekend.   the price is a good deal for what you get on the food though. oh and one last thing, the potstickers were AMAZING!!!
