P6SBB1EPVJ6VwVnxuY0mww I like Chinese buffets as well as the next guy. You know the drill... All you can eat of modestly-priced somewhat greasy Chinese food. But honestly I lost my appetite after one plate, so they certainly made a good profit on my dinner tonight.

To be fair, a big part of my bad experience was that they seated me next to a table of 10 teenage hooligans who (it seemed to me) were having a contest to see if they could do something outrageous enough to get themselves thrown out of the restaurant.  Unluckily for the rest of the diners, the hooligans won... Nobody from the wait staff or management lifted a finger to even suggest that their shouting, singing, throwing food, loud belching or shrill whistling was the least bit unacceptable. They also left the buffet itself in a very unappetizing state each time any of them visited to fill their plates.

To give them one star because of rowdy diners wouldn't be entirely fair; However, the food didn't deliver either. Most of the dishes were quite unappetizing. Greasy, shiny & overcooked seemed to be the norm. The crispy duck -- rather unique in a buffet setting -- was acceptable, though some of the garnishes showed signs of serious aging. The inclusion of more traditional Scottish fare on the buffet -- chips, mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts -- didn't score any authenticity points. Honestly the high point of my meal was the dish of soft-serve ice cream at its end, which (though they offered no toppings to speak of) was light and smooth.

I walked by the other branch of Jimmy Chung's (down by Waverly) and that one looked much nicer.  But I won't be giving this branch another try.
