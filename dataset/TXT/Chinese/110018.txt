lSxAQR1FeSljX9zeVJTEWA We are from markham ontario, where authentic chinese food is a staple and easy to come by. Went with family of 7 for dinner. From all the great reviews, we expected a chinese menu but was not presented with one. Disappointed at this, a Chinese server greeted us very nicely and offered to make what we would normally eat. Stone pot tofu, steamed fish, yu choy with oyster sauce, and garlic onion. The result: Much better than we expected from a town with less Chinese restaurants than our hometown. This place tasted like home.
Had Good tea too.

Price: we ordered 4 large dishes , 3 large bowls of rice. 7 satiated bellies. Bill came out to about 65.

Bottom line: Excellent bang/buck for authentic Chinese cuisine.
