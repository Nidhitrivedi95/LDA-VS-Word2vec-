The portions are not huge and flavorless, but rather perfectly sized portions of food that is incredibly pleasant to the palate.  The flavors are fresh, and delicious and it's obvious that each dish is prepared individually, not reheated from a huge pot or wok.  
The service is very personable, not rushed.  Jenny's memory is amazing - she takes the time to remember your whole order and presents it with the same care.
We drive down here from north Phoenix...and it's worth it every time.
