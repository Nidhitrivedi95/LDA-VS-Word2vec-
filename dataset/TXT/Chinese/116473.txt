n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q This is one of the best Chinese food restaurants I've ever ate at. Everything I've ever tried here was delicious. Food always comes out hot and taste fresh. Best part you can dine in or take out, and did I mention it's always fresh and hottt :). The staff is always friendly and nice as well. This is the best and only chinese food I eat here in arizona since I moved here from Cali. Well atleast on the West side I don't go to the east side very often. I love their egg rolls and the Lo Mein Noodles, those are my favs, however the lunch special are a fabulous hit as well, price good and a enough to have left overs for later, I always order the #6 Garlic Chicken w/all noodles and a extra egg roll, because did I mention the noodles and egg rolls are my favs. So if your ever on the west side of town get off at Dysart and it's on the right side of Fry's. Even if your in a hurry did I mention Their Fasttt, I don't think I mentioned that :)
