Alright now down to the food small portions yet tasty so order more if you like it.  I've order a lot with 4-6 ppl noticed that some orders didn't come thru so I just  reordered and made sure they came thru this time.  The salad bar and dessert is in the back so help yourself.  The place is nice new and big.  The food doesn't look like like some of the pictures so they should work on that. Price wise not bad definitely doesn't hurt the wallet under $20 per person.  Only drawback not baby seat friend most of the booths already fairly tight hard to eat comfortable if you small kids aren't comfortable in their seating arrangements.  Good place to eat with friends and enjoy the ambience and the sports on TV. I've been here 3 times and I can see myself going here when I need that sashimi fix again.  Check it out if you're around that area
