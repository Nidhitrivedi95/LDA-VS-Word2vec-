xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I went to Lulu's last week with a bunch of my friends for dinner. The one plus side is that this place is really, really cheap. Unfortunately, that's one of the only good things.
One of my friends told that the pad thai here is her absolute favorite. Well, since pad thai is one of my favorite foods of all time, I obviously had to try it. Firstly, it was really nothing like real pad thai. The sauce was dark brown (unlike pad thai sauce should be) and it was ridiculously sweet. If anything, it tasted more like pad see-ew. Also, I felt like I was nearly eating soup because my food was swimming in the sauce.
My girlfriend got bibimbap, which is another dish we absolutely love. Traditionally it's served in a ceramic pot that keeps it cooking when you get it, and the pot is filled with delicious rice and vegetables and topped with kimchi and sides of delicious sauces and more kimchi. We got a bowl that was literally just steamed white rice and vegetables and maybe two little pieces of mediocre kimchi. Absolutely no seasoning or flavor. The sauce the served it with was ok, but it didn't make up for the lack of taste the rest of the food had. 
Oh, I did get a mango milk tea for dessert, and it was pretty good. It had hardly any tapioca pearls in it...

I'm really not usually negative, but this place just didn't do it for me. I was really disappointed with my food.
