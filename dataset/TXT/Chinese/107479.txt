Being a Thursday evening, it wasn't very busy, tables were available.  No greeting at the door or on entering, we chose our seats.  A waitress came by quickly and asked if we wanted anything to drink.  We asked for water and she handed us one menu.  When she came back with the water which was in a bottle, with a plastic cork (kind of different, however the water was luke warm) I had to ask for another menu.  The menu was on a 11 X 17 double sided plastic sheet.   Not really too much of a selection.  We decided to order the rice in soy sauce with peas and slivers of carrots However it also contained corn which was not listed.  (Some people are unable to eat corn for personal reasons).  For the main dish Beef and Ox tripe in chili sauce with peanuts, green onions and other greens.  It certainly was spicy.  These two dishes were plenty for two people.  The food was excellent however the music playing was way too loud!  Once our food was served, the wait staff never returned to ask if everything was fine or if we wanted anything else.  Once we finished, I simply walked over to the cashier, paid the bill, left a tip but she didn't really acknowledge it.  We might go back there again but other establishments on Spring Garden Avenue provide better service, quieter atmosphere, and friendlier service.
