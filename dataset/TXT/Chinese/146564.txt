S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg Law Vegas has extraordinarily diverse culture and cuisine piled literally on top of each other and Wo Fat restaurant clearly fits that description.  The restaurant is located in a diverse cultural area of Latin, African-American, and older established Anglo neighborhoods.  Yet, this Chinese restaurant with profound Hawaiian influences seems to thrive.  

There is no question that the physical restaurant is in need of a major comfort makeover ... but I've come for the flavors, spices, and combinations thereof that I overlook minor discomforts.  

The Sunday evening we visited the restaurant it was packed with mostly large parties of extended Hawiian families.  It was loud, crying children, balmy laughter and unthrolled conversations; just what a "family" Chinese restaurant should sound like. Not even sure we were below maxium seating compacity. 

Take care when ordering normally spicy dishes to express your desire level of heat.  Recommend you order to side of caution; Chef was a little heavy handed.  Nice thing about small restaurants food come out hot; bad thing food comes out when it is done even if not all of the orders are done at the same time.  My suggestion ... Learn to share!
