-Gxe5gKrskrgbWyLkz7UGQ This place is God awful!

We were quoted one price and charged  another. Before we entered the buffet area, the host asked if we were okay with the price. Less than 10 minutes later, the manager  ( I assume ) comes by to let us know that the lady on the front told gave us the wrong PRICE. It was all down hill from there.

The food was old. It looked like it had been sitting there for a couple of hours. The curry chicken was the best thing there and that isn't saying much. The food wasn't seasoned. They also didn't have Saracha/ chilli sauce. How the eff are you a Chinese food restaurant doesn't have Saracha ?

Final thoughts  : AVOID AT ALL COST!
