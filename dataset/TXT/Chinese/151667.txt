t-LnJne10SHAWATKYdQdJQ I took my guy out for dinner at HuHot tonight, and had to come home and write a review. The place was pretty full, but we got through the cooking line very quickly, and the chefs were extremely attentive and friendly (they cheerfully sang happy birthday to a girl in line, and they actually appeared to be enjoying it--which was charming).

Now the food here is good, and the best part is, you can choose EXACTLY what you want in your meal, from the meats, to the veggies, noodles, and sauces (and there is a VERY large selection). The meats remain frozen at the buffet, which makes me feel much better about food safety. The sauces are really tasty, and I love that you have complete control as to the ratio of everything on your plate.

*Pro tip: I like to just go through the line once with two bowls. Saves time!  ;)

Now, for the real reason I had to rush home to write this review:
When our server, Michael (he was tall and had a nice, mild manner), came to take our bill, he noticed that I had laid down a USAA card. He went out of his way to ask if either of us had been in the military. My boyfriend is US Army retired, and Michael went ahead and knocked a percentage off of my bill. He didn't have to do that - he'd simply noticed my military card (which I have because my father is a vet, too), and asked. I was so impressed with that!

It's this outstanding service that's earned the 5 stars. The food here is good, the ambiance is that of a national chain, but the service was spot-on. Nice job, HuHot!
