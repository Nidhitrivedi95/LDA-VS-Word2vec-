I have to say this place would be one of the goods. The location, vibe and taste all reminded me of back home (Arcadia). I felt like this place was literally a chunk taken from the 626 and put in vegas. Tried the beef noodle soup, beef rolls and xiao long bao (juicy pork bun). The beef noodle soup was one of the best I've taste. Much better than some of the ones I've tried back home. Beef rolls were good but could us soem more flavor. xiao long bao was one of the better i've tried.

Overall this place is good. if you are visiting vegas and want to try some good, cheap chinese food come here. it is a bit off the strip but i think its worth the car ride.
