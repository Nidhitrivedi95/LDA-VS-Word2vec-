dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ Service was horrible. No one took our drink orders, the waitress took our food order, but didn't ask about drinks until we had to ask someone about it. 

5 people at our table and they brought out each dish one at a time with several minutes in between. Who does that? 

Waitress disappeared when it was time for the check, the manager finally brought it over and finished for her. While we were eating we saw another party waiting at the door for their check. 

Food was great if you don't mind bad service.
