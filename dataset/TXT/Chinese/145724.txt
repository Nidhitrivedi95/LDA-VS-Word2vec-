S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ This is the first time I've ever given one star. Although the food was good, I've never encountered service as horrible as what I received at this restaurant. They took extremely long to seat us, give us menus, and take our order. At least two other tables were calling for the waiter to take their order, was given attitude, and told the other table was first. There was only one waiter trying to handle all of the tables which was why there was so much chaos.
