mFirTXxoXRloGtrxQLAvbQ I definitely agree that Yummy Buffet is worthy of five stars.  I've certainly eaten at my share of buffets and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here today!  It is extremely reasonable at $5.99 for lunch ($8.99 @ dinner) and with an additional 10% off coupon, the total was $11.78 for two buffets with no drinks.  The decor is very comfortable, pleasant and it seems extremely clean and well run.  Service is prompt and friendly.  I'm trying to watch what I eat right now, so I avoided many of the traditional entrees (ugh!) but there is certainly a very good variety along with the Mongolian grill.  My attempt at a "healthy" buffet experience included:

* Salad bar - romaine tossed w/ a light italian dressing, mushrooms, black olives, cucumber/tomato/red onion salad, fresh oysters

* Sauteed green beans (extremely fresh and delicious), sushi (no deep friend rolls), edamame, teriyaki beef on a stick, spring roll (I cheated)

 *Vanilla frozen yogurt - really yummy....no pun intended :)

They also offer "to go" boxes for $5.99 at lunch and $6.99 at dinner...with a coupon it's a flat charge versus how they normally charge by the pound.
