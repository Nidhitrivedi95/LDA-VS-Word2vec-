nTc-Qj_-ABZrpM9YSpJ6jA Chow King, like Jollibee, is another Filipino fast food chain that has made it's way to Maryland Pkwy all the way from the Philippines itself!

They have a mango shake, ube shake, calamansi tea & other asian inspired drinks.
They have other filipino dishes like palabok, bangus and garlic rice, longaniza and garlic rice, and more.

Sounds like a great idea, but the food just isn't that great. If you're hungry, you'll eat it, but you won't enjoy it as much than if you went somewhere else like D.J. Bibikahan or Pinoy Pinay.

The seating area is clean. There is a TV set to the TFC channel.

You will probably never specifically crave Chow King.
