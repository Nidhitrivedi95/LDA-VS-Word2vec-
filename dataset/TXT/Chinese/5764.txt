0c6PQILCLwRZ8FIB4AEsGw Ive been largely disappointed with this restaurant. I always order the same meal and its always a different price. That is absolutely ridiculous. I've also found large black hairs in my food twice. Yukk! I see that another reviewer found a rubber band in his meal. How does that happen? THIS PLACE IS WAY OVER PRICED! This is Americanized buffet Chinese food at best.
