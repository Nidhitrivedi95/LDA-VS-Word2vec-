C8uW23iYTDSaSSqAGIzd6g Jimmy Chungs is really nice for a buffet restaurant. The staff are very efficient and the food is good. The food is always being brought out fresh and if you require anything they are happy to help. The desserts are a little disappointing but other than that I enjoy eating there.
