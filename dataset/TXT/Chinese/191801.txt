YWm5z2mu-C-pUuL86fcFxQ Food is always fresh, ask the vegies you like with tofu and they prepare the food as you expect.  Hot sour soup is always available and very tasty.  Crispy chicken wings or eggroll is included with your order.  Limited seats but the wait for one to be available is not long.  Takeouts are ready within 10 minutes.  Food is never oily as like any other chinese place you go to.  Aimee and her hubby (the owners) always will greet you like you are family.  Have been going to this resto at least once or twice a week place since 1997.
