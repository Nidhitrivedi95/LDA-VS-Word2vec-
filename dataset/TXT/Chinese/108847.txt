lkM72Y21bjBqUGaW7iL7tQ We got here late in the morning so did not get to try the half price deal which we only heard about.  On this Thursday morning, the place was packed with mostly Chinese speaking customers, but we got seated within 5 minutes.  The dinning room looked more like a banquet room, and we were impressed with everything--the crowd, décor, stage, etc...  I felt like I was at a banquet hall and not at a restaurant.  We quickly ordered our food (mostly dim sum dishes), and they all came out in no time.  It's like they concentrated to get done with one table then move on to the next.  This was  our first time visiting Toronto, and I started to believe that it was going to be hard not to be impressed by these establishment.

The food was great, the service was quick, and the atmosphere was fantastic.  I guess it helped that we sat right next to the server station so we had no problem to get their attention.  5% service charge was automatically added to the bill.  NO, it's not a typo.  They only charged 5% service charge.  We definitely drop in again next time we visit Toronto.

Most Chinese restaurants in Toronto only accept cash so ask first before you sit down.  Also, if you don't speak Chinese, you will be at a disadvantage for sure.  So, be aggressive and take charge like waving down a server and get their attention.  If you just wait to be served at these establishment, you will be waiting for a long time.
