liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA I had the filet mignon pho and it was absolutely delicious!!! One of the best pho I've ever had. Granted I've never paid 18.00 for pho but I've also never had it with filet mignon. In any case, it was great and the service was quick and good. Can't complain. I'd go back for the pho for sure
