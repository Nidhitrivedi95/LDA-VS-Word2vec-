fcpGO67gqGptI-1vZpXPtA This is a mini review. The strength of this place are the noodles which are top notch. But the weakness is cheap ingredients. The meats were dried out and tasteless.
The beef noodle broth and noodles were quite good and
the stir fried noodles with chicken good too but the chicken tasted like garbage. A real whole in the wall but not bad for such cheap eats. More like a 2.5
