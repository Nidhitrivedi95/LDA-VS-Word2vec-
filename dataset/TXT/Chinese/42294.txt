bbr4F3c0KHU8ugn8YgEtKA This was our second visit to the restaurant and this time I thought I'd write a review.  We strolled in for a late Sunday lunch and the restaurant was empty.  From what we remembered, the food was a ok and this time, the experience was the same.  

Hubby ordered a medium special pho and I ordered a bun bo hue.  Surprisingly, my bun bo hue came out first which is unusual as it takes longer to make this dish.  It was piping hot but the meat (especially the shank) was too chewy from not enough cooking time.  My husband's pho arrived lukewarm which is less than ideal.  The portions were large and the flavours were ok, at par with most pho joints.  

I would not go out of my way to eat here for my pho cravings but it's still a decent choice if you're in the neighborhood craving pho.
