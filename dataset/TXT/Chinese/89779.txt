Ib-WbHVHp_e1PZnU0P6JfQ Was very excited to try this place! I went with my s/o for lunch so we didn't have much of an appetite we just wanted to try the food since we're not from the area. We didn't order much and I felt like we were being watched the whole time eating. We did get the lobster maggi sauce which was ok. We were pressured from the waitress to get more food, and then Got a weird vibe the whole time because we didn't eat much.
