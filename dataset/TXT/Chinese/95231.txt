jgh9iT5k7JxkeK9gu4VJAw Stopped by spontaneously on my way home from a friend's and was at first turned off to see only three of the ~20 tables were filled but I am a huge fan of sushi and am always trying to find more economical options in Madison so I figured I would give it a try and order some takeout. I ordered two roles, and within about ten minutes they were ready which I thought was incredibly fast considering I just walked in off the street. It was a reasonable price and considering how good they were I was impressed. The fish tasted very fresh and the avocado was perfectly ripe so I'd say I was completely satisfied. I hope that they will start delivering because I live far away and I could eat their sushi every night.
