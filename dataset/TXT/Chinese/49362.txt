First, food is disgusting. Everything is way too salty and my family and I legit felt like we were eating straight up salt.

But that's okay. We can get pass that. Then we ordered a mixed vegetable, and there is a fruit fly in it. The restaurant is located at a 5 star hotel, but the service is ridiculous. We showed one of the waitress and she immediately took away our dish, even we urged them to wait so we can take a picture of it. She ignored us and rushed back to the kitchen, 20 minuets after the manager came out saying "oh it's just a fruit fly". JUST? what's just? A fruit fly in your food isn't enough!? The manager didn't even apologize to us, and his attitude just pissed us off even more.

alright, when we ask for a refund, they only refunded the mixed vegetables, at the same time expecting us to pay for the other two dishes LOL. Are you serious?! We stopped eating right after finding out the fly, and we didn't even finish the dish. They just stared at us with a face looking like "we didn't do anything wrong, pay us and get outta here."

We walked out without receiving a single apology. We didn't pay for the check, but we will never come back again.
