Pu7GTgTzdjbxAhr8A73zGA We live locally and usually take advantage of the 1/2 off sushi rolls on Mondays. Their sushi rolls are the best value in town. At 1/2 off it does not pay to cook at home. Went there recently on Sunday eve and was disappointed with a regular menu item (sesame chicken). It tasted like leftovers just smothered in sauce, chicken was dried out. Portion size was nothing to write home about. They filled the plate with orange slices and a carrot the size of my fist to make it pretty. If your food is good, you don't need to fill the plate with decorations to distract me. So, if you go, stick with special sushi rolls. They are fresh and a very generous portion.
