cxq_iu2Zl5jm6qLGfff5eA Very disappointed. I got hung up on 3 different times trying to place an order for delivery (the third time I told them I would pick up)... Yes, they were busy and the roads are bad. But don't just hang up on me. Finally I got someone who picked up and was nice enough to say they were really slammed. I told him I would be ok with picking up and he was happy and said that would be great. Then while placing my order the guy (not the nice one) said "I'm just going to have to cancel your order" then hung up. Wtf if you can't handle your stuff you have no need to be in the restaurant business.
