CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA Don't go out of your way to eat here. We tried it because we keep passing it in our way to a movie. I ordered a regular size spaghetti and meatball while my gf ordered the small steak stroganoff and I swear that my regular spaghetti could have fit inside the small size. Disappointed. The food was also a bit cold and dry looking. The garlic bread made up for the portion size somewhat.  Also the tables around us were dirty, had trash and dishes were on the table from before we sat down until past when we left. Plenty of employees and no one wanted to clean apparently.
