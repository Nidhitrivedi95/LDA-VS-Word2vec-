BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA Most of the time, the most authentic Asian food can be found in really small dirty hole-in-the-wall type of places. But Mother's Dumplings is the exception, not the rule. 

So I'm Asian, I walk into an Asian restaurant in the middle of Chinatown, and I see that none of the patrons are Asian, I know something is not right (don't get me wrong, I have nothing against that, but you get the gist). 

For a tiny hole in the wall with minimal decoration and lousy service, I found the food a bit overpriced. Dumplings are really cheap to make (think about the ingredients), so they're probably making a huge profit margin by charging $5.5 +tax for a dozen. 

The dumplings were good, but no phenomenal. I've had many dumplings before and this did not stand out as one of the best. The beef hand-made noodles were decent but not particularly impressive either.
