VYByx4yXYiZDeiaVVus7HQ Writing a review after going there 4 times. Why? Because their menu is rather expansive and I gotta make sure I try most things first.
And they never disappointed! Every time I go it's mostly empty...which is a shame because their teas and food is good!
Tried the rice burger, takoyaki, popcorn chicken, crepe, and 4 different teas in different occasions.
I'm a huge fan of takoyaki, and theirs was definitely up to Japanese restaurant standards. If not better.
Also tried their chocolate pork crepe. Yeah, it sounds insane, but the chocolate sauce felt like a sweet tahini that complements the pork floss and pork belly strips.
In terms of bubble tea, their menu is on par with other tea shops. I tried a tea in which the flavour profile didn't match what I expected. The staff made us a new one and we had a conversation about tea leaves and different strains within each type. They're super friendly! 
The rice burger was a bit meh. Basically a constructed (Er...opposite of deconstructed) bowl of gyudon.
Prices are not exactly cheap, but reasonable.
Everytime, I had some sort of discount. They did half price for Chinese New Year, got coupons on apps, and has a rewarding points system. (5 stamps one free drink)
Free wifi is available as well.
My only complaint is that seating is not comfortable, especially the milk crate area. Also, their drinks are only one size.
