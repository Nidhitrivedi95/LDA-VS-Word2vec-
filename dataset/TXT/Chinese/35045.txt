aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg Horrible customer service. Do not go here unless you are friends with the workers there. We had a party of 5 waiting for a table that they were cleaning. They told us that would be our table when it was clean so we waited. In comes a party of 3 that were friends with the workers and sat down at our table. Then the worker has the audacity to tell us to wait for another table. Are you f***ing kidding me? We just left. Never ate here and never will. Only went by yelp reviews but they can forget it now. Jacka**es.
