maGqjGXYPzal3YydKu8wjQ The store is close at 9:30 and I arrived there like 8:30, the told me they don't have fried rice and no kongpao chicken because they are about to close?! And I have waited for orange chicken for 10 minute when I got home, they only give my 2 piece of Shanghai steak and 4 piece of chili shrimp. This is so ridiculous, if you don't want to run the place then don't . You guys are disgusting. I will never come to this place again!!!!
