f1K6hzQecl-sJFYRUHvDDQ Might be my new favorite Szechuan restaurant in town! I've been here several times, both for dine in and take out. I've had better experiences with the food for dine in, but it's still always been delicious! My favorite dishes so far have been the mapo tofu with fish filet (huge portions and spicier than most mapo tofu I've had in Pittsburgh) and the bok choy with black mushrooms (this was was surprisingly delicious). I also sampled my friends spicy beef noodle soup and it was amazing. Their lunch specials are a great value as well. 

The prices are a little bit higher than other Sichuan restaurants in Pittsburgh, but I think the portions are much larger as well. Definitely give it a try!
