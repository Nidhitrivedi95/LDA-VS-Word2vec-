Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg I always enjoy food at PF Chang's no matter which city,. Yes, it's chain.

We had to wait for like 20 min as it's very very busy..even around 5pm for dinner. We were seated and then no body came to us. I was very very hunry and anxious as I had to catch a flight. O waved at a manager and he came right away and took our order. I mentioned that we are in a hurry and we need to catch a flight. Afterwards, the service was up. But we had to ask for water once. 

The food- Portions are very large and we were a party of 3
We ordered hot N sour soup - good
Fried Rice with Shrimp - very tasty with lots of shrmip 
Chendung Lamb - spiced and fried - very tasty and melts in your mouth.

Overall food was excellent. Service is bit slow but can't blaim cos they are super busy.

Very nice atmosphere. We spent $30 for dinner for 3 at the Las Vegas strip for a very tasty meal.  Fully worth it
