9sFPbD1PUGmyg0CNdkBEew Compare happy time restaurant on old kenndy, this place is sooo much better. First of all msg is much much lower then common Chinese food restaurant. Quality of food is decide . I would recommend this place.

Purchasing of the restaurant was pretty reasonable. Only loss with the star rating as we discovered a hair in the stirfry vegetables there for the waiter was informed and they apologized and replace the dish. When replacement came the portion in the dish is less then the original
