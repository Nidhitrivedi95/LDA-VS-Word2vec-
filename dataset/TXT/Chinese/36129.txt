Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg It's in the Luxor and the ambience in the restaurant is pretty nice.  I only had the soup and it was alright.  Wasn't exactly something that I would get again, but it seemed like basic Top Ramen noodles that I could have cooked.  They do have a good size menu and the service is pretty good.  However, it takes a LONG time to get your food.  The ladies that work at the front are really nice and seat you.  I may come back in the future.
