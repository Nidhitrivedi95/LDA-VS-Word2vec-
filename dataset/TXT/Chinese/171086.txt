vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I'm very disappointed by the dinner I had last night. We had to fall in line to get a table and once we were seated we were giving water and ordered the soup of the day and three dishes. The soup of the day was barely lukewarm, had no flavor, and was just meat, potatoes, and carrots. The salt and pepper pork chops had tiny bones that almost chipped my teeth variety of times and was also lacking salt.  The fried noodles lacked sauce and was very bland in flavor.   I also was restless the whole night and had diarrhea the following morning which is from the MSG that you put. I am not happy about the food you serve even if the remodeling makes it appear nice
