q4QuS-MaVSXbIFkUZlxZ9g My 100th REVIEW!!! Hmm.. maybe I should of reviewed somewhere else besides this place... lol... 

It's a bit sad to see this place only have 2.5 stars. Came here for lunch and dinner. Their lunch specials are pretty good. It's very cheap. Usually I get the curry chicken with rice. It's not the greatest quality but its a good decent size and cheap. I sometimes get the singapore fried noodles which is also very tasty. The portions are very good I find. The size is above average compared to some places. 

Came here for dinner as well and the food isn't bad either. Again, there are other places that  serve up similar dishes as this place but taste better but the food here is still pretty good. I guess i am more biased since I live nearby and it's the closest and cheapest thing to grab to eat and again it's really cheap. 

-Good & cheap lunch specials 
- Convenient location with plenty of parking 
- Food is not as bad as some people say
- Service is just average, a bit lacking but it is what it is for this kinda place.
