qAJ-denev24k4RN-DMoaGA I am not ordinarily a fan of Chinese buffets..but wow.. this one breaks the mold !! The best ever, I've been to.
Everything freshly prepared and served hot because of the popularity of this place. They have huge turnover but rarely do you have to wait for a table.
Imagine all you can eat seafood.. crab legs, shrimp prepared in maybe 5 different ways, many unbreaded and stir fried with crunchy veges, shellfish of every type, a sushi bar as well, and Mongolian grill, where you can load up your own plate and have it stir fried while you wait.
Really a treat and I highly recommend you give it a try.
