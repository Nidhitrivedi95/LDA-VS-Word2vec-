Being from out of town and being used to a plethora of Asian cuisine being everywhere, I  couldn't believe how there were so few authentic Chinese places. It's like there is a drought of authentic Chinese cuisine and thankfully this was the ONLY watering hole. Their string bean with garlic dish is always a go to dish along with the ox tongue and tripe. The double cooked pork was great. The spicy crispy chicken and beef brisket hot pot was definitely a favorite with the chicken just being spicy enough and succulent. And last but not least, the spicy crispy fish as well. I really hope this place thrives so if I ever have to come back, this will be my go to place to feel at home.
