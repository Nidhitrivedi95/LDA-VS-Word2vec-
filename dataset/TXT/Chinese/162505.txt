Exciting enough, I ran through the menu and realized that there's only like 3 main course options. This left me a bit disappointed but nonetheless, I opted for their signature Lan Zhou beef noodles. 

Like the menu, I was let down. Basically, there's a variety of noodle shapes and sizes available and the noodles I received were two times bigger than the ones depicted in the menu. Not only that but my noodles were definitely undercooked. My broth was average with the oil making most of the flavor but I got to admit that the beef was tender and packed with beefy goodness. Unfortunately, 2 out of the 3 entrees that I tried had unpleasant combinations of flavors that still haunt me to this day.

There are many other restaurants in Chinatown offering noodles and Nouilles de Lan Zhou wouldn't be my first pick.
