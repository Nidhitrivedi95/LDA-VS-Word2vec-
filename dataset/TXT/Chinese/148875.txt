SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ Ordered take out from here through UberEATS! Perfect weekend treat when you don't want to leave the house. Glad we did because everything was delicious and arrived quick, hot, and exactly as requested. 

We got the cream cheese ragoons and gyoza appetizers. Both were very good. The ragoons were light and crisp and paired well with the sweet and sour sauce. We then got the orange chicken and broccoli beef. Delicious! The orange chicken was my favorite. The sauce was thick with a ton of flavor.  Of course it came with white rice that I like to add sweet and sour sauce to. Yum!!! 

Overall everything was super tasty and we will order from here again. I made these left overs for about 3 days and they were still good! I think Chinese food can be reheated 10 times and it's still good. Haha
