vYbpodi9utup_njMK5PAfw We were yelled at by a waitress... All of our food was cold, greasy, and unappetizing. As our horrible waitress poured my water she spilt it all over me, and didn't even apologize. When we didn't leave a tip, the waitress literally SCREAMED AT ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND UNTIL WE LEFT! Right in front of all the other guests. Never ever eat here. It should also be noted that the good is prepared in an Extreamly dirty kitchen, so I'm considering contacting health inspectors. Have I made it clear that nobody should set foot in NUDO
