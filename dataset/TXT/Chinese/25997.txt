7lvogweL-b7av26TUOCf4w All I can say is, so far I have been here a few times... tried their menu and I still crave and think about it day and night. 

Although they are on the pricy side for china noodle soup. But... what can I say? You make money to satisfy your stomach right?

There are a few "Hey noodles" around the block; however there is a difference if you know how to count Chinese characters or know how to read their Chinese name. I like this restaurant a lot more compared to the other one who has opened 3 different location (North York just down the street from here, Midland and downtown) I heard they are own by 2 different owners. I tried this restaurant and the other hey noodle with 3 location one. I personally prefer this one; their menu, and their flavor.

Their noodle is very chewy and has an egg taste to it. I really love how you can add noodles for free too. Their soup is flavorful no matter if you choose spicy or regular soup. 
Sour and spicy glass noodle is good too compared to other china noodle place. I love how they have a lot of soup so the glass noodle doesn't soak in all the soup by the time I'm half way done. 
Their hot pot noodle is a bit pricy imo, however it is a bigger portion with all the different veggie ingredients. Definitely can pack to go if you can't finish. 

Best thing, you can choose your spice level and if you wish to add or minus any ingredient(s) to your noodle. I haven't try their mao cai (hotpot veggie/meat) because I find it pricy and I can make something more price friendly at home. I haven't try their try their cold skewers either because I like my skewers hot. 

Anyway, definitely crave for their soup, noodles and flavor. 
Make sure you have patience to wait because the restaurant Is very small with 13-15 seat max. I got lucky, I usually go at times before or after dinner rush hour so I didn't really need to wait. At most I waited 15mins or so. 

Would highly recommend.
