iQT1y93mE8j3ZbNaXGd-sA Ohhh PF Chang's you try to be so cool yet I think you can find better asian food.  Came here with a group of work friends and I've had PF in the states but have never been a fan.  I'd rather visit an asian restaurant run by a small family not a corporation!  

Let me give you the lowdown:

Ambiance 4/5
Decor 4/5
Cleanliness 5/5 (it's not even 6 months old!)
Parking 4/5  (lots of spaces at Carrefour Laval!)

Dinner:

-  Chicken lettuce wraps 4/5 but dropping to a 3/5 as there was not enough lettuce provided.  
-  Calamari 1/5..... seriously I'm sure you can buy as good if not better calamari in the freezer section of Costco!  
- Won ton soup 0/5 okay seriously I'm biased as I had my Chinese grandmother pass down her won ton soup recipe to me.  Probably the worst I've ever had!!!
- Tuna Tataki- 3/5  5 sliver sliced pieces of ahi served with a salad!  You'd think you need a laser to cut tuna so thin! A huge peeve of mine of restaurants.
- Mixed lo mien 2/5  Looked so promising when it came out but Eeeeeeek was it ever S-A-L-T-Y!  Also you could sense that the shrimp tasted as it was just dethawed 5 min before!  

I do commend PF for having a gluten free menu.  Also there are many many menu choices so you can find something you may like.  

Not my cup of tea!
