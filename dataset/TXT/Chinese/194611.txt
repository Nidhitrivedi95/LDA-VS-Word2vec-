ZGpT6rcgSsJ4GxwTHbvvJw Huge staff. Fresh and hot. Bare bones interior, I saw most customers were doing take out. A tad oily but with tofu eggplant you expect it. I can in here on a whim as I was lost in the NW Vegas area and very hungry.  I went away quite happy as place exceeded expectations for a quick Chinese lunch. Pleasant service at counter.
