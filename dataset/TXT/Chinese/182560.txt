XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA I am told that this place started out as a great place to eat. While this may be true, things have certainly changed for Pacific. The whole place smells horribly like fish (Keep in mind that properly prepared fish does not smell fishy.) and the restaurant was gross. I spent my time trying to find something to eat that wouldn't gross me out which was a waste of time. I left terrified that my next few hours would find me hunched over a toilet bowl. Don't go here.
