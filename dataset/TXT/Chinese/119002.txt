nqnVKM55nIZn8fNH1fIJPA I'm not a vegetarian but that really doesn't matter at this joint. It's all about the noodles and fresh vegetables. They do make a variety of vegetarian protiens like duck, shrimp and beef and they're pretty good. But the real hero is the seasoning and the sauces. I especially like the soups. My favourite dish is they're version of Singapore noodles, Also they mixed veg and noodles. Great place.
