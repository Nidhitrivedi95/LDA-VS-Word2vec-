s9q3LdLgr_f8YRLpyeAK2g I have found my one and only Acupuncturist, Karla! I have tried other one on one acupuncture and community acupuncture that were good, but Karla is the absolute best. If you have stress, chronic pain, or just need a little zen, this is the place. My first appointment, I was blown away by the time she took to go over my long and sorted past of pain and misery. I had a spinal fusion a few years ago and have been dealing with some hip bursitis and upper thoracic chronic pain. The time she has spent listening to me ramble on would surpass a decade of my traditional doctor and physical therapy appointments. Her demeanor just gushes empathy and she is truly my angel with an accent :)   She provides many different options along with traditional acupuncture including Gua Sha, ear seeds (after my dental work), dietary/supplement recommendations, meditation suggestions, potential books to enjoy, and stress management. I never feel rushed (most of my appointments are 1hr) and she always asks if I am ok on time if we try another few needles. She never gives up on relieving my pain, and I ALWAYS feel completely transformed when I leave. I have tried so many treatments but acupunture with Karla has given me the best results. She offers single session payment and packages, which are very very affordable. My pain is under control but I will continue to go for maintenance...everyone needs to spoil themselves once and a while!
