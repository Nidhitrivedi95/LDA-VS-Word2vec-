5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A Lets start with the dining area. This place has more than enough seating.  The tables are evenly spaced so you can have a nice conversation within your party.  They have a nice section in the back in the event you have a large party.  They also have a stage where they have live music usually during the weekend evenings.  I love how the place is decorated.  

I enjoy the food here.  Nothing special that I would say stands out but the good thing is that its consistent in taste.  They have a large menu so you definitely have a lot of choices. They also have a lunch special during the week day so that definitely is a plus. 

The staff is really friendly although some do have a strong accent so you may need to repeat yourselves or ask them to repeat your order just to make sure they got it correct.  They try their best to assist you but I do feel they are under staffed.  When the place gets busy the staff seem to be overworked.  They try their best to serve you but I can see they are sometimes doing too much.  So be weary that during busy times your water or drinks may not be filled timely but the staff is always respectful and treat you very well. 

Price for the food is very fair.  It's about the same prices as any Asian restaurant.  Average ala carte dish is about $8.95-$12.95.  The amount of food they give per dish is a good amount.  2 dishes will usually feed a part of 2-3 easily. I do think at times the food takes longer to cook but this gives you time to enjoy a good conversation with your friend or date.  Don't go here if your really hungry and expect to go in and out. 

Overall, I do come back and forth to this location many times and quite often do take out as the food is good. Sometimes I do crave their bean sprouts with crispy pork so that dish definitely gets me to come back.  I see the owner here often and he is such a nice fella always sharing his stories.  Talks with his guest.
