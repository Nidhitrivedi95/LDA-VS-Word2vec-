rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g When I first moved to AZ 17 years ago, you couldn't even find a restaurant that serves dim sum. Now, foodies have a choice of where to eat their dim sum! This restaurant is one of the better choices. Always get my cravings satisfied here; my favorites are the fried noodles but, really, I like it all. Fun to come in a group! Many Chinese come here, which leads me to believe that it must hit the spot for those who know the cuisine well!
