JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw This place serves really good noodles. Don't get expectations up for all different ki d's of asian choices. No. This is just awesome awesome noodles.

We ordered both beef and onion & pork and cabbage potstickes. Those are perhaps the best potstickers I've ever had (I eat alot allot of asian food because I love it). They were so juicy!!! Yum. Also had Dan Dan noodles, Peking zha-Jiang noodles, and the pork rib noodle. All were so delicious. We ate everything, nothing to take home. Perfect portions and prices. Definitely would return when I have a taste for bomb noodles.
