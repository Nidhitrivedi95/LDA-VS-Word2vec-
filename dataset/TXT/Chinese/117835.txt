NImT1XHwwUmoHaPEjIIwRQ Dinner last night was excellent!!  From the friendly wait staff, to the delectable entries!  The Singapore noodle was excellent, lots of chicken, pork, and shrimp!  Lemon chicken was light and crispy, with a tangy lemon sauce, will order sauce in the side next time.  It got a little crowded, but was well worth it!  I recommend a reservation!!  They do keep them!!  We will be back!!!
