1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w Salt is jumping for joy in this place. I mean... if they had a mascot, it would be salt in a salt shaker and the shaker would have the biggest happy face you've ever seen.

I usually don't do the chain restaurant thing, but this PF Chang's is close to my residence and it was later in the night so it was the only thing open. It was an hour before closing when we arrived, were greeted politely by the hostess, and were seated on the patio. I noticed the serving did an "Oh great" type gesture when the hostess informed him we just sat down (I get it dude, it's an hour till close). He came over to us within a few minutes after that and said he'd be right with us. About 7 minutes later, he finally came back... He was friendly and didn't really rush us through the time we were there.

I ordered a glass of the Moscato (which wasn't as sweet as I expected). He asked for my I.D. and gave me "condolences" on my birthdate... which is 9/11. "Agh...." I'm used to it, but come on now... It's been how many years now?? Jeeeeez. Anyway, he tried to recover by saying he had a birthday one year that was very unlucky according to the date, I think he said 9/9. Um, awesome.

Moving on.... We ordered the Calamari appetizer, which wasn't anything extraordinary. It was a bit salty, but the sauce they bring with it was sweeter so it kind of washed that out. We ordered the Japanese Street Noodles... Hooollllyyy salt! It was THE most salty dish I have ever tried that I ended up taking a few bites and was done. I. Just. Couldn't. Luckily my date was hungry enough to eat most of it. We had the rest of the noodles boxed up, and tried to get out of there as quickly as possible since they were starting to close up. 

Soooo... Only reason why I would go back is due to having three "free appetizer" vouchers.. Hmm, maybe I'll just give them away instead? I want to give two stars, but I think three would suffice since it wasn't an awful experience? :)
