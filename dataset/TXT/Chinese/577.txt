-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw Late night Bubble Tea go to spot! Tons of positive things to say! 


Pros: 
- Drinks: Ordering Drinks here is consistent in the sense of I always know what I'm getting in comparison with other Chatime locations which sometimes mess up my order. If I order half sugar, it tastes like it! I love their selection of drinks, so many options! 
- Line Ups: Unfortunately if you go during prime time the line up usually extends all the way to the back from the cashier to the washroom. Luckily the servers work quick and your not waiting to long to get your bubble tea fix! 

Cons: 
- Parking: There is no available parking unless you park on the street and want to pay. 


Drinks/Dessert I love: 
- Honey Green Milk Tea with Grass Jelly (Warm or Cold) 
- Blue Mountain Green Tea with Tapioca 
- Japanese Sakura Sencha with Tapioca 
- Jasmine Green Tea Mousse (No toppings) 
- Honey Green Tea with Tapioca 
- Macaroon Flavour: Pistachio, Roasted Milk Tea
