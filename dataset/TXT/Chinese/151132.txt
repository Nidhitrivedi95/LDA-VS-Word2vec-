szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A Some of the best dimsum around. I have been stopping here for nearly ten years off and on!  The same people working here as ten years ago. It's crowded everytime I come with a great diversity of clients. 

A must stop if you love authentic dimsum. I would recommend this place to my family and friends.
