OUB81Dpb6m7HjW4ZmeSlmw Great value for the quality of tasty food you're getting. Had the chicken bao and the shrimp dumplings - was pleasantly surprised at the amount of sizeable shrimp stuffed in there. 

The filling of chicken bao was well seasoned. Loved the peanuts, cilantro, peppers in there as well. Looking forward to trying the quinoa-chicken dumplings next!
