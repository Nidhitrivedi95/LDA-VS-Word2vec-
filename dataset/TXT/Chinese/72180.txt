FfbBQZ85mWHEjQNzphcvKw I thank you greatly, John (the owner). I spent my Spring semester abroad in Edinburgh and now that I'm back home, upon my list of things that I miss the most, is your restaurant.

Among friendly staff and one of kindest restaurant owners around, the food here is some of the best Chinese I've ever had. It seemed to be family style, but a single dish was a perfect portion for a me.
As a primarily takeaway place, the Silver Bowl is quick when preparing your favorite dishes, mine being battered sweet and sour chicken, and pork or chicken fried rice. The menu (which I once counted) contains somewhere around 150 different items and combinations.
In my opinion, the best place for a takeaway dinner in Leith, please give it a try! I still need to try and find some half-decent Chinese food here in Southern California so I don't miss this anymore :(
