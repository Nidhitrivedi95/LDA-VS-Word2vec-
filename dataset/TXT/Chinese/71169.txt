fBmyj1okdO1p-GUzfQQohg This is a really great place.  The girl at the counter is always very friendly, and the food is authentic and freshly prepared, and definitely a great value for the price.  The drunken noodles are very yummy.  I also highly recommend the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, though it takes a while to cook.  It's well worth the wait!
