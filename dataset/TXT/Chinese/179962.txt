X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I knew I had some mixed feelings about this club!!! It wasn't what people said it would be. Long walk up to both the main floor and hip hop room. Since I'm not a fan of EDM music, I stayed in the Hip Hop room! Music was on point but just too small just how TAO and Marquee is! Layout definitely reminded me of TAO but decor and VIP tables could use more improvement. Will not comeback here again!!
