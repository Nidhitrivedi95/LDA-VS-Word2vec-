uBCRRQJ4ukFaE_UyY6T1uQ Love love love this place. It is a little pricey, but well worth it. This place is family style, so everything is made to be shared. 
We had the Crackling Calamari Salad, the lime miso sauce went great with it.
We also had their Grilled Szechuan Beef and Korean Kalbi Rib-eye. Both came out great and the potato sides that came with it were yummy too. A couple months before, I ordered the Pan Seared Spicy Tuna which also tasted great.
 And for their sides we had duck fried rice, wok sauteed vegetables and wasabi mashed potatoes. 
Everything that came out was cooked perfectly and very filling. The wait staff were great also. 
Only complaint would be that their mix drinks weren't so good. =(
