wWry6ceFOu0pSmzPpDJQcA Small restaurant with tight seating but very quick and efficient service.   Good value noodles that come with lots of side dishes and a large bowl of noodles that you cook in your own large bowl of VERY HOT broth.

Be forewarned:  the hot pepper logo is not there for show-it really means it's spicy!   And it comes on you slowly at first and by the time you realize it's spicy....your done!  But it really tastes so good!

I did chicken out the next time I went and chose a non spicy menu item.   

Great choice for something slightly different than your typical noodle place.
