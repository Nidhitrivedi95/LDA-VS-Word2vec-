gTRTzLhbl2uDd_JvB4PsyQ After reading the reviews here, I still decided to try out this place.  There are not that many Chinese restaurants in Monroeville, and I've been feeling like Chinese food all day.  I just wanted some food with good taste.
The restaurant was pretty good size.  It was clean and somewhat welcoming.  The staff members were kind and nice. Me and my husband wanted to take out couple of dishes, so we ordered combination pan fried noodles, young chow fried rice, and palace vegetable delight. It didn't take long to get our food, and everything smelled really good. It was hard not to take a peak while driving back. 
Pan fried noodles dish was packaged so nicely.  The noodle was kept separately so that it doesn't get soggy in the sauce.  The taste was pretty authentic and delicious. There was a lot of vegetable in it, but not so much seafood/meat although the price was for a seafood dish. Still, the flavor was good. 
Fried rice seemed a little too pale with no flavor. But when I tasted it, it was actually pretty tasty. Maybe I was expecting brown fried rice that we usually see at hibachi places.
The vegetable dish was probably the most bland dish out of what we got. It was just pan fried vegetable in clear sauce, and the sauce was really oily. The whole container and the brown bag was drenched in oil underneath. 
Overall, food from China Palace satisfied my craving, and I would go back for General Tso's chicken that everyone is talking about.
