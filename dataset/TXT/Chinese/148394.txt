sfGYIlU3ji6V3c0aWyny5A I come here about once a month to get my greasy Chinese food fix. It hardly ever disappoints. This is the best greasy Chinese food in the valley! 

My favorite dishes are the Chicken Chow Mein, fried rice (always ask for the fried rice!), General Tso's Chicken, and the Beef Chow Fun. They have the best crab puffs I have ever had (although it should be noted that I have a heavy bias towards greasy food). Lately I've also been indulging in their fried chicken and french fries. 

My only knock on the food is that the egg rolls aren't always consistent. Some days they're really good, and others... well more like average. Never gross, however. 

The service is always great, and you can always expect to get your drink refilled in a timely manner. 

For about $30 a family of four can eat comfortably here and still have plenty to take home. A word of caution: health nuts may not like it all that much. This is a haven for grease indulgence... and that's marvelous.
