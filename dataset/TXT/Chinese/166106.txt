VaLnPWq6cLnK5x2wXBVOKQ I come here whenever I need to satisfy my craving for hk Cafe food. The milk tea is good and I always order the all day lunch black pepper sauce chicken steak with rice. I haven't yet found another dish that comes to par. The potato wedges are very bland in my opinion. I hope they expand the menu soon because there isn't too much variety to choose from. The employees treat every customer very nicely. But the restuarant seems a bit cramped up. Their honey garlic wings are to die for! But if you ever pass by or are near by you definitely won't be disappointed by papa George!
