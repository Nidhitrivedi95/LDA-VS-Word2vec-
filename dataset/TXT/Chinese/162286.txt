uLzgiSqVg5Pr93VVXSdOlg Try if you've never been, but if you've had beef noodle soup from Asia before, this place isn't worth a second visit.

MSG soup! Maybe it's my hyper sensitivity to MSG, but I was thirsty for at least two hours after having their signature beef noodles. 

I ordered the thick noodles. Noodles were a bit undercooked and lacked elastic texture that you'd expect from handmade Chinese noodles. The beef was a bit dry.

The soup base is not made from beef; it tastes like a concentrate based stock flavored with lots of MSG and pepper oil. I'd expect something like this from a street vendor in China except this was 10x the cost.
