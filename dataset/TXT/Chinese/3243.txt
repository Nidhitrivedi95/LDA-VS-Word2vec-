_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Las Vegas no longer offers prime rib for $1.  Restaurants on the Strips, specially, the ones in the hotels can be veeery expensive.  Overpriced due to high rent and location, I understand but I expect at least a decent quality of food.  Having said that the wonton soup was decent.  A good Chinese restaurant has to have a great fried rice.  On top of non flavorful rice it had three medium size shrimps...Service needs a lot of improvement.  If you don't want to drive 15 to 20 minutes for a great Chinese food, this place will have to do.  But then again, you have Panda express on the second floor.
