PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg I wanted to like this little "Ma & Pa" place. The place is dirty. If the wall paper is dirty and the windows are dirty, then not so confident about the kitchen. My order was brought out to me with fried rice instead of steamed. However the waiter noticed it on his own and corrected it promptly. The won tons were a little stale. I liked the egg drop soup. I had Kung Pao Chicken. The sauce was good and the vegetables were cooked well. But the chicken was low-quality. Spring roll was average. The Rangoon was too much batter, a little stale, & only cream cheese, with no detectable seasoning. Prices were very reasonable and with the Restaurant.com certificate, the cost for three lunch specials and tip was just over $20. Service was fast.
