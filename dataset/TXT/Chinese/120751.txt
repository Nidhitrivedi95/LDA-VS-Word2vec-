O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw Saw this place from the street and it looked busy with lots of locals going in so we decided to eat lunch here while in Chinatown.  With so many choices in the area I am glad we lucked out and decided to come here. We were promptly seated in the back dining room area and given a dim sum check off sheet.  I would have liked pictures or something. I like the dim sum places that roll the carts around but this place was really busy and everybody seemed to know what they wanted anyway.  Taking some time to look things over and see what was coming out of the kitchen we realized quickly that the portion sizes were rather large so in order to try the things we wanted we were going to have left overs. We ordered several dishes and didn't have to wait long before our table was full of food.  Pepper ribs, ribs in bean sauce, noodles, eggplant dish, tripe and fried fish. Everything was great! I didn't eat the trip that was my friends choice but everything else had great flavor, came out really hot and was fresh tasting. The noodles were especially good and had a nice spice to them. I've added a pic of our spread of food.  Service was OK and they seemed to handle a full dining room with efficiency.  If you want fast and good food this is the place.
