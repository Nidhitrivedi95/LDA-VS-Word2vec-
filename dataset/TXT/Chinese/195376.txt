zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I'm happy I found this place during the Toronto International Film Festival '17 and tried their Pork Ramen - belly, shoulder, fish cake, egg  $16.

I was alone and sat by the window and got some reading done before and after my meal.

I came back a couple of days later to find out that the restaurant is closed to public for a private luncheon. Apparently some teenage celebrity like Emma Roberts was having lunch with some red carpet at the door and bodyguards sending people and customer away, telling them the restaurant will be closed for a few days!
