CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Skip it. My friend and I love Asian food. We were seated promptly on this weeknight, and the restaurant seemed clean, but that is where the positive experience ended. Once seated and waiting for our drinks, the guests next to us seemed to have finished their meals and were waiting for the bill. I asked how their meal was. Neither were pleased with their dishes, and wished us "luck." 

We ordered pot stickers to start, and then a simple sesame chicken, BBQ pork flat noodles and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. And then the wait began. After 35 minutes, the pot stickers came out. Then no more than 5 minutes later, the rest of the meal was brought to the table. 

The pot stickers were okay, but nothing spectacular. Sesame chicken was average. Noodle texture was good, but no flavor whatsoever. Bummer. $75 for a ho-hum dinner. I expect more from you, Bellagio.
