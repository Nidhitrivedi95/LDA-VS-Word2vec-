oAngC9V69vyzBVYwKEJQaw Today was my first time ordering from this restaurant. Quick delivery means QUICK delivery! Placed my order at 3:00 pm and the delivery person was at my front door at 3:14 pm with my piping hot order. I ordered lemon chicken w/rice and 2 vegetable spring rolls. The food was very good & enough for two people, although this order was just for myself. Recommend highly.
