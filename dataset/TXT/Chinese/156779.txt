TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ After reading the reviews we had high hopes, but they weren't met.  The service was friendly, attentive and prompt.

We tried the following:
Tempura shrimp = tasty, light and perfectly cooked.
Eggrolls = okay tasting but extremely greasy (HOT oils down the chest when biting into one not the best experience.)
Kung POW Chicken = okay flavor but overrun with cheap filler of zucchini and the peanuts tossed over the top as an after thought not cooked in to pick up the flavors.
Shrimp Fried Rice = Shrimp cooked perfectly however the rest was flavorless; plain rice with barely any color, white onions and egg.

We checked this into the "well we tried it" category but won't be back.  :(
