S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ i heard all the rant and rave from yelp and one of my vietnamese friend from dallas LOVES this place, over my favorite pho saigon 8... but i didnt think this place was all that great. 

i love food, and its not usual that i give 2 stars but... im giving this place 2 stars... because i kno where there are better places to eat in las vegas.

yes this place is in the 2nd main chinatown mall so if u are around here, order here for convienience. Its inexpensive.


i have only had the banh mi here, which is supposed to be what they are known for and i am not impressed. 

i will go back one day to try some rice plates or noodles. will update if i change my mind!!!
