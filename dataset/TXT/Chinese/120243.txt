O_Yi95nUeeqSudiMlUfttQ Pretty clean, new, fresh Cantonese style restaurant in Chinatown. I'm not too crazy about Chinatown restaurants for my own reasons, but this particular place is not too bad. The service was ok but they kept bringing us orders from different tables. I think it was a bit disorganized their system maybe. But what I ordered was pretty good. I had a char siu (sp?) very popular Cantonese dish which is bbq pork with rice and some sort of sauce...I should find out what that sauce is because it's pretty darn good. I take one star off because I asked for egg with my bbq pork dish, but what they did is give my friend 2 eggs (he had the same dish as me) and just took off his other egg and transferred it to my plate. Okay....ANYWAY, I liked the portion size. Not too much and not too little. The bbq pork was sweet but tasty according to my standards of char siu. (it might not be too high I haven't eaten too many char siu). The payment part was even stranger because they did not know what to do since we wanted to pay separate. Like I said, a bit disorganized of a system on their part. Otherwise, not bad, not bad. But not great either.
