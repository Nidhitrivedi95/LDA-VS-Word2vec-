7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. My close friend from China took me here and knew exactly what to order. I love Sichuan style food. I never order from the American menu.  They have two menus.  I always get the flaming hot chicken it comes with bamboo shoots.  They have amazing dan dan noodles.  I gave it a four star rating because one time I ordered a chicken dish and it was all bones.  It's still my favorite Chinese place though.  And they just remodeled, looks great.  Don't get the general tso's.
