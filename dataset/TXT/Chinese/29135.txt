I'm not well versed in the different dim sum styles, but I'd definitely say this is more Cantonese style.  There was just way too much sugar in everything and there's absolutely no sauces on the table or otherwise to cut through the grease and sugar. Where was the soy, the vinegar and most important to me, where was the chilli oil?  

I ordered congee with thousand year egg and somehow got a congee with clams and very little egg. Usually, I love clams, but it's quite off-putting in congee. The pork buns were a bit sweet for me but are great if you want the sweet pork buns you find in bakeries. We also ordered the baby octopus with curry, but I was a bit disappointed.  Now, I've tasted unique curry sauces on the sweeter side, but I don't have much explanation why this curry did not sit well with me.  Perhaps the octopus itself wasn't fresh and sugar tends to extenuate it?

On the positive side, the servings are large and the price is fairly cheap. The wait time was actually decent for the amount of customers.  Also, the non-cart concept works well; just be careful of over-ordering!  The chicken feet were pretty good and as expected.  The service was decent and parking went well with a guy out in the lot coordinating.
