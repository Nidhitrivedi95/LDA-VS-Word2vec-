ffUCy7Gd8Gr28oK5mHOjsw I had a very bad experience with them,. I ordered LoMein noodles and asked them to make it spicy. When I went to pick the food, I was charged $12, It sounded pretty expensive. I was hesitant to ask what was the normal price. I though I can check that in their menu and also I wanted one menu for my future ordering. I could not find any to-go menu on their counter. I could find few on the other side out of my reach. I requested her if I can have a menu. She rudely said that they don't have as much and can't give one to me. I told her, I will review and return it back t her. She rudely refused and said she can't give it me. I have never experienced anything like this. It was really frustrating. I felt very much discriminating. I am not a citizen of this country and have different country origin which is visibility seen. I assume, if it was someone else, she could have definitely given the  menu. Very upsetting. I ended paying $12+ for one order of noodle. Please be aware to check the price of your order over the phone before heading there. Otherwise you will surprised and end up paying more. This place does not know what customer service is.
