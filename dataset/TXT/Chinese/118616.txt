NMQb_TvWEOGkaZDrNC03wA I am a Kan Bai regular customer. I have tried many Chinese restaurants in Montreal and Toronto in the past years. I have to say, their food is at least the same level or some times even better than the top ones in both city. Their menu is improving as well as their service. Their Fish filets in hot chili oil is delicious! Kungpao Chicken is a must try too.
