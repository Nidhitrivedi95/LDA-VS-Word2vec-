OVVXpKIC0OGYKvvS9eJXjg For a start, Karen's Unicorn is a pretty good name for a restaurant, and it definitely grabs the attention as you walk along the road. It was back in April that I went here for lunch, and I think it was a new arrival on the scene because the place was heaving and the staff were only too eager to please. I'd be interested to see if it was like this a few months on.

I have no real complaints about the place, but it wasn't the best Chinese I have ever had. Lunch was £7.95 or £8.95 for 2 or 3 courses, pretty good value for money. My chicken noodle soup was nice, plenty of noodles and the broth was really tasty, if perhaps a little bit salty. We waited a while on our next course, maybe because the place was just finding its feet, but the staff apologised profusely for our wait so we didn't mind. I had a mixed veg chow mien which was fine, like I said, nothing outstanding, but I was absolutely starving by this point so I ate the lot.

We left full and satisfied but not particularly blown away, and we haven't felt the need to go back since. The name suggests something extra special but on this occasion, it didn't really deliver the goods.
