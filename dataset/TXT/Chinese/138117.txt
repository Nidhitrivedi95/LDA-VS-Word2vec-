Qn_mBXvKnn9VeOKym0Ussw I went in there for lunch last week and had the orange chicken with fried rice. They gave me white rice, but heck, it tasted better with the white. Atmosphere was nice and relaxing, music was soothing and put me in the mood to scarf down my meal. They weren't kidding about the "best orange chicken in town". I'm sure there's better. Way better.. In China. Satisfied customer here. I'll be back.
