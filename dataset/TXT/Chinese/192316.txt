z01_gDUfmedOuX2UZYF33w This place is good and cheap a rare combination.... Best spicy garlic shrip I've had since my trip to Hawaii. The crab legs were fresh and the buffet had a fairly good selection of Chinese food. The big hunk of beef isn't prime rib, it was tough, but nicely seasoned. The stuffed mushrooms were note worthy as well, pretty good.
  I think overall the price was great, for $8.95 It's hard to find that much decient food. 
  Growing up I ate frequently at my friends Chinese restaurant, he'd be upset with their low prices, but I'm pretty sure he'd eat here.
p.s. I introduced the owner to yelp so he'll probably be reading the reviews from now on....
