FanQrSh9QTDytonKHt9C6Q Sadly, the food here wasn't very good :/  I didn't even finish my milk tea...and I love milk tea!  The whole place was deserted at lunch time.  The food is just standard Chinese food like from Panda Express or something, except without meat.  But their fake meat recipe needs some tweaking...
