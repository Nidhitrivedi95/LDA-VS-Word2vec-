yEZn1XpLsEC9uBa-X4xAZw Holy scheisse, this place has high reviews. I pray none of them are for the Vietnamese sandwich, which was by far the worst banh mi I've ever tasted.

An array of Vua's 10" Vietnamese sandwiches are $2.95 after 9pm. What a steal! They won't toast them, though, because apparently they turn off the ovens by then. The sandwich is already pre-assembled and bagged so you can be in and out in under a minute.  

We went with the classic. Unfortunately the sandwich was terrible - did they put onion gravy in it??? There was an excess of something cloyingly sweet and sticky that is completely foreign to all my banh mi endeavors. The pickled veggies inside were mushy and tasteless instead of providing crunch or tartness. The bread, of course, was spongy and cold but didn't seem like it'd hold up as toasted baguette either. 

If there was pate in it -sigh!- then it was swallowed up by the strange gooey sweetness. Quebec, of all places to ruin a pate! 

I had neither high nor low expectations for this place - just hungry! but the banh mi was just a huge disappointment on all fronts besides price.

Come here if you just want to be full; 3 bucks for almost a foot of sandwich is a sweet deal. But if you actually know what banh mi tastes like, avoid avoid avoid Vua's offerings.
