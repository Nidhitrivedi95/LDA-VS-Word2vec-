O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw I think i can live of of dim sum so I'm quite fond of all day dim sum places. Came here with the family for a Sunday lunch and skate. From looking at other tables there were too many good looking items to try.  Had squid tentacles, siu mai, har gow, rice rolls, ribs, eggplant with shrimp, onion pancake, dumplings and tripe. I think I may have missed a couple but all tasted pretty darn good. Can't really say anything critical with any items. The place was also typical Chinese restaurant but a little more spacious. Service was OK. Some dishes were very slow and I didn't like the fact that they don't keep your order sheet on the table. It's hard to remember all orders with a big group. Other than that it was pretty good and definitely will come back.
