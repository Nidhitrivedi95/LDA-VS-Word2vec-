WfgupKdYx1h0mKBmOmNQ3g I am such a fan of this place! I usually go and dine in, the place could use a little upgrading but it doesn't take away from how great the food tastes! I've had delivery twice now and both times they have gotten there faster than what the approximate time has said. If you are looking for that yummy Friday/Saturday night Chinese take-out, this is the place.
