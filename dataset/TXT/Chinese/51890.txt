cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A somehow, i've avoided eating here for all 4 1/2 years that i've lived in Phoenix till now. And the really funny thing is, I live within a couple miles of this location. And my family eats there every once in a while. And my bf worked at a CB one summer, prior to us dating. 
But enough about me - on to the food!

I like that you can do whatever you want to the food! That's probably one of the cool things - ie you can take the Emerald Chicken (simply cooked chicken covered in a green ginger/onion chunky sauce) 'and get it in a quesadilla! genius, and pretty tasty too. the pork fried rice was pretty tasty, and the black beans? good. very good. 

and what i don't recommend? the egg foo young - pretty tasteless. and the jerk chicken is really not like the jamaican jerk chicken i tasted in jamaica, so kinda disappointing. overall... i wasn't that impressed. and if i've learned anything at all - you can't trust that diners, drive-ins, and dives show on the Food Network! that's 2 strikes for Guy F. in Phoenix, from me!

i'd come back, but only if i really had no choice. and then i'd only order that emerald chicken quesadilla.
