WbQOuI7mVST8XrJotWq9fA i walked past this place everyday for a year and never bothered looking inside. last week i had a craving for BBQ pork, saw the sign "best BBQ pork...BBQ pork on rice $4" and went in. from the outside this place looked rundown, grungy, and out of date. Shockingly, when i stepped inside the restaurant, it was PACKED at 5pm. every table was full and service was going full-tilt. i got take out and was quite happy with my meal. since then i have returned 2-3 times and have been happy with the food given the price point. solid noodles in soup with BBQ pork and veg. Cantonese chow mien was good too. warning: if you go after 8pm, it's likely all their roast meats and dumplings will be sold out.  
service is speedy and comes with soup, tea and ends with orange slices, and a fortune cookie for luck.

seeing how popular New Ho King is right across the street, this might be Spadina's best kept secret?
