I_WWH2vYccjz-QxW3u1zJA I see that others have enjoyed this buffet and had good service and food. NOT THE CASE for this guy.
W called to see what time was closing on a Sat. 10:30 is the time for closing and we arrived at 9:30. Here's what we experienced....
Upon entering the basically empty restaurant we were greeted and attempted to be seated at the only  booth in the restaurant that the pleather was torn up...not cracked...TORN UP! We opted for a table adjacent. 
Upon approaching the buffet... 40% of the hot trays had little to no food on them. Of course those were the most popular things. There were 3 in our party to share what I would call leftovers. The "Habachi" , which is the namesake of the restaurant ,was closed down!!!. When we asked... they replied...oh sorry. The sushi bar was shutting down but to the insistance of my friend, another employee other than the hired sushi maker made him a roll. The original sushi guy refused! At 10pm they closed the ice cream station! At 10:15 they started VACUMMING on the other side of the restaurant but in our section!!!
If they want to charge half price for a clean up crew from 9:30 to 10:30 fine. But if I call ahead this is not what I would expect...WTF!!!
We received no good will for our inconvenience.
What food we had was OK buffet food but for sure I will never be back and I will have already posted out to my FB about my experience. 
A satisfied diner may mention to a few people about their experience....a dissatisfied diner tells everyone twice!
If the owners are so confident that they will be busy...stop taking people at 8:30 and let them clean you out and graciously warn off later diners 
I would have given NO STARS if they would have let me!!!
