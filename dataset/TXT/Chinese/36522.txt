AKMvsVr_9meoSmawkEBe4g I visited the restaurant after maybe like 15+ years, and it was pure disappointment. Back in the days, it used to be a decent restaurant my family would frequent but over the years, it has gotten worse and has not bothered to improve. 

From the old decor that has not been updated, to the mediocre food that all taste exactly the same, to the horrible but typical asian service (the type that's just bordering rude because they've probably served too many difficult asian customers). Bathroom was unclean and horrendous - they definitely did not spend any more money on the restaurant itself. Service: asked for napkins twice, and finally decided to get up and ask the person at the front desk to get my own. The server proceeded to throw down 3 napkins 5 minutes later for our party of 10. Lovely.

It was really packed for Sunday lunch which was a real surprise because the place is really run-down from the years. We ordered 7 different "baked" dishes from the lunch menu and all the meats were fried cutlets (where the chicken, pork, fish all taste the same cause they are exactly fried in the same batter smothered in the same tomato-based or cream-based sauce).

No variation between dishes. Dishes are REALLY filling and huge while the price is cheap (probably under $10 and enough to fill 2-3 people). But are you really interested in eating mediocre, bordering fast food quality type food? If you are, this may be the place for you. If not, please stay away. I know it'll be another 15 years before I'll be back... if it still exists by then.
