MDeqp3L79cq3h11_nW5umw In the former location of Weston Produce an Italian grocer now lies T&T. 

Two asian supermarkets in this area. Just up the street is H-Mart a Korean Supermarket. 

Highlight, this is the only T&T I've been to that has a Deli department. Probably exists for the former clientele that may have frequented Weston Produce before.
