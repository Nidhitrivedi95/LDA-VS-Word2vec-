dltDW0fS4HzxZ0A7PDT5jg After searching for somewhere to have a nice Christmas lunch, my family and I finally found this place, one of the only few restaurants open on a holiday. If you are on a tight schedule but want a sit-in restaurant experience with fast service, this place would be ideal for you. From the outside, its physical appearance is not very attractive and the place is stashed away in a plaza with other stores surrounding it. However, once we were inside, I soon realized that I had judged a book by its cover. From the inside, it was the total opposite. The room was big and spacious and our wait time to get the 5 of us seated was less than 10 minutes. Their washroom cleanliness also exceeded my expectations. Our lunch was delicious too and it's so convenient how staff members pass by every table with all types of food on trolleys so we didn't have to leave our seats. I tried their sticky rice, various dim sum pieces, and duck and my favorite was the shrimp dim sum. The duck was tasty & hopefully I can come back to enjoy more of it in the future when I no longer have a toothache. Overall, I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for good quality dim sum/asian food that is reasonably priced.
