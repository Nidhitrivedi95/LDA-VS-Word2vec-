BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA They have a large variety of quite authentic dumplings but I have definitely had better (being Chinese and all). They have a fairly large restaurant but the cleanliness leaves a bit to be desired. All in all an average place however I would not go again. I think it is built up way to much.
