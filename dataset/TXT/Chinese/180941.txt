X9ftU-exKhTMOjtr3B52rw Absolutely love this place.  I come here at least twice a month with the GF.  I always get the "lo mein", B5 I believe, shrimp wonton with the beef.

Food always comes out lightening fast and blazing hot.  Portions are great!   I know this is street food but it really hits the spot in terms of flavour, quantity and quality.  Wontons are pretty packed and handmade, beef is super soft (they probably use baking soda or something to tenderize it) and the noodles are always in a heap.  

It's always packed here during busy hours but the turnover is under 30 mins per table.
