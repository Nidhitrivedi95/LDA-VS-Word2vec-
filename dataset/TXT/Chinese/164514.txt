UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ Love the Asian fusion menu.   Not the standard boring American style Chinese food that seems to be taking over the Valley.   

Love the meat and vegetables for a low carb meal,  the Thai Basil chicken and a number of other items on the menu.  Service is attentive and the Owners always stop by and say hello. 

If you want something different that the super buffets and Panda Express, give George's a try,  If you like the buffets and Panda Express, stay away :-)
