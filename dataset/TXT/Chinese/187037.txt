yEZn1XpLsEC9uBa-X4xAZw After three days of limited vegetarian options in Montreal (let alone GOOD vegetarian options), I trekked in here waiting to be disappointed. Never happened. This was probably the best sandwich I've had in my life. Ingredients were super fresh, including the bread which was perfectly crispy. The sauces they used definitely also MADE the sandwich. I also tried the veg spring roll (?) by the cash register. Good, but the sauce they give you with that is way too sweet/fruity. Really above all other details, there's: I got my first sandwich here on Sunday morning. Finished it before getting on the metro. Spent 8 hours thinking about it. Came back to Berri UQAM, got two more. (One for "dinner" and one for when I was back home.) Service was also very nice & fast both times I went in there. I can only hope a version of VUA opens up in Brooklyn soon.
