FfbBQZ85mWHEjQNzphcvKw I was babysitting a friend after a root canal on the West-End, when we decided that instead of going out to see Heartbreaker (I had to sit her down and make her watch the trailer so that she'd understand it just wasn't worth it), we'd order in and watch But I'm a Cheerleader and Ghost World. Which was a much better option. We ordered a portion of scallops in black bean sauce and king prawns with ginger and spring onions. 

My favourite was definitely the portion of king prawns, though I was highly disappointed in the definite lack of prawns. I mean, there may have been about 10 prawns in the whole meal. For three of us. Three sea-food lovers. The scallops in black bean sauce were also few and far between. The sauces were very good indeed, though I would definitely urge them to be more generous with their seafood. 

The service, on the other hand, was prompt and it was the first time I'd ever ordered anything off the internet. So I was surprised it'd actually arrived at all! Each of our portions cost just above a fiver. So, I guess it's pretty moderate for a takeaway, though I'm certain I've eaten better and cheaper.
