USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw This place was really good. We came here for a quick holiday lunch for our department. We started with an order of potstickers and shrimp dumplings. The pot stickers are huge! All combos come with wonton soup and an egg roll which is really nice as well. The egg foo young was really good but my only complaint was that I asked for the gravy on the side but it still came with it drenched on top. Not a big deal as it seems to be common to have it put on. Again, the only complaint was that a couple of orders were forgotten or wrong and the place wasn't overly busy. The waitress seemed to kind of push us through our orders. All were friendly and I would definitely like to come back.
