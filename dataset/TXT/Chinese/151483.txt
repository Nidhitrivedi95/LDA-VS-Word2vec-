szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A I came here because a friend of mine recommended it.  It's old, grubby and kinda smelly.  I could probably overlook this, if there were any kind of service to be spoken of, but there wasn't.  Half an hour of waiting (and not another customer in sight) and I decided Panda Express or Pei Wei deserved and probably would appreciate my money more.  Even when they're busy, they don't ignore customers.
