HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA **Summary**
       - Food - Everything I've tried thus far was beyond my expectations. The waitress told me the owner put everything he liked to eat on the menu. I guess this owner has some pretty good tastes.
       - Area - So this place isn't in the greatest part of town. It's in what use to be a diner in a rinky dink casino. The casino is smokey, but the dining area isn't too bad.
       - Decor - Once you get to the restaurant, it feels very cozy. It has a diner feel with Asian decorations that seemed like an afterthought.
       - Food truck - I believe this restaurant is owned by the same owners as the Great Bao. I never actually tried the food truck, but there's paintings on the walls that point to this fact.
**Ordered**
       - $10 Fat Choy Burger - I don't even know where to explain how great this burger is. Braised short rib, bacon, egg, and special sauce on a burger patty. The braised short rib they put on the 1/2 burger patty is the perfect saltiness that it almost renders the bacon redundant. Yes, I know. I said it. It was better than bacon. It is the perfect blend of salty meats, juicy burger, gooey yolk, and sweet Asian sauce to make me want to come back again. It came with fries, but the fries were just ehh.
       - $8 Shrimp Toast - First time I've had this anywhere and it's hard to describe. It's egg, chopped up sausage, and some kinda sauce on top of a toast. It sounds super weird, but once you bite into it, it all makes sense. It's like those seafood toast things at buffets, but way better.
       - $7 Peking Duck Bao - They come in pairs and they're just like the Peking Duck you'd get at an authentic Chinese wedding. The only difference is usually it's mostly duck skin. This is a lot more meatier. It's delicious.
       - $9 Pork Noodles - Dry noodles with chopped up pork on it for flavor. They were excellent. The minced pork was just salty enough to complement the slightly sweet noodles and not overpower it.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a unique Asian Fusion place. It's a hole in the wall, but it's also a gem.
