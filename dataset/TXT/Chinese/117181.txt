nChi_8Gygb6NUMa_kg_tlQ Just left from there, and was terribly disappointed. It was the blandest Chinese food I've had here. A frozen package of stir fry from Trader Joe's would be less expensive, wildly more flavorful, and not as greasy. 

We got the orange chicken, beef chow fun, and potstickers. Best part were the potstickers... but rarely does anyone mess that up! 

Go somewhere else! Plus it wasn't even the dinner rush yet when we got there.
