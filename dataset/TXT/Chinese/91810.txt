ikWa3gaWi-uaVGGtEhxhWA If you're craving delicious Chinese food at a reasonable price, this is your new favourite place. The wings and the crispy shrimp are crispy and not greasy. The chicken soo gai is another favourite. The rice is nice and fluffy, and the noodles are very well made. Not greasy at all, just right. 

They deliver, or you can pick up. Great find in Meadowvale!
