Wqdws1zeQYTzV_7jq1a0hw I used to get takeout here regularly from 2004 through 2009.  It was just fine.  I like the fact that they put the sauces out there for you to just take as much as you need without asking.  I remember good flavors here, I ate food from here a dozen times and never got sick, no complaints.
