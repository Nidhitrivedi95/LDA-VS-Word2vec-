aqszoKRB4Ol9bpemt0_-GQ While the food is tasty, service is fast, the person at the counter is a THIEF!! I went there with my friend & both ordered dishes worth 7.25 each. They don't ask if you need separate checks & usually get the check within few mins after lunch arrives. Final bill was 7.25+7.25+1.20(tax) = 15.7
We asked to split the check between 2 cards & guess what.. Our bills were 8.19 each. 
This is the second time this happened & I would suggest anyone going there watch their bill especially while splitting checks.
I went there today after around 2 years.. & same person at the counter, doing the same thing again. I just paid & walked away & I don't plan on going there again!
