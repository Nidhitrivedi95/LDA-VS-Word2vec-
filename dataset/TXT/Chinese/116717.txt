NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og I ordered dinner tonight using Grub Hub. I really wanted a good hot and sour soup. 

The crab rangoons tasted ok but should have been crispier. 

The hot and sour soup really didn't have much flavor. I took a few sips and decided against the soup. 

I like the fact that there are half orders. The sesame chicken tasted ok but was bland. The steamed rice was good. 

I ordered a Coke. On the site it stated I was ordering a 24 oz drink. I got one 12 oz can. 

Though the food was edible, I wouldn't order here again.
