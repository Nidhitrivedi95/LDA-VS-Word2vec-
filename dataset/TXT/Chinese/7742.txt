It's a very modest place with posters and photos of  beautiful Vietnam.  Canary yellow walls and tangerine color trim is emblematic of their love for free Vietnam. The loud and busy carpet is the lone reminder of the prior tenant  Beijing Noodle House once famous for their hand pulled noodles. Had not revisited this strip mall in a couple years. Then it was an odd mixture of businesses attributing to zero synergy. Parking lot remains awkwardly laid out.

The menu is well laid out with appetizers, pho, dry noodle dishes, Chinese entrees and desserts. There are a  few Chinese items deleted, perhaps an indication of low demand.  Won't be surprised if a new menu is created in the near future.

Of course I ordered the grilled pork chop and Yu-go was looking for their pho dac biet, but they call theirs "combination." It doesn't take long for our lunch to appear on our table. Both entrees are of substance, pleasantly aromatic and piping hot.  For the price, it is of excellent value. My grilled pork chop was thicker than normal, fatty sweet and not all bones. It comes with long grain white rice and  a small bowl of sweeten diluted fish sauce that may be used to season the pork and even the rice.  Yu-go's pho is clear broth, adequately flavored, hot to the last scoop and with plenty of rice noodle.  Unlike a typical pho dac biet, no tripe, tendon or ligaments. Still most enjoyable and satisfying for a seasoned pho veteran.

Their audience is non Asian. Whether they realize it or not, the cuisine is very authentic Vietnamese. I think there'll be another visit for a taste of their Chinese entrees.
