vTlIUtYXdPxCk6UB746w8w Aside from the previous review, the service here is really really subpar. The waitress was taking our order and pauses to take a call from her personal mobile phone.. what kind of waitresses do that?!? 

The drinks are still expensive and taste mediocre. 

One cool thing is they have really innovative mahjong tables that help you stack it together.
