HJ928N6c5Hh2KD3lYCuabA I looooooove thai food... not in spring rolls though... it's ok to come here for food on a lunch break maybe or while waiting for the movie at the cinema... but not the ultimate food destination.

what makes me put 2 starts is not even quality or authenticity of food but the smell of fried cheap oil that surrounds this restaurant whenever you pass it on the street...there is also a hint of that smell inside in some parts of the restaurant... 

other spring rolls locations would probably get a higher rating from me.
