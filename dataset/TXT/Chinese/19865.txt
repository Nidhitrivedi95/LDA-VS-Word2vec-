5VRLOVAZYWTyGviBoXLcmw Found this place purely by chance and I'm glad I did!

This is a take-out place ONLY.

Food is excellent, flavours are great.  I usually order the Chicken Chow Mein with Blackbean Sauce and some Sesame Chicken which is more than enough for two people.  
It's reasonably priced and all good.  I've tried a couple of other dishes too and they have all been excellent except the sweet and sour which was too sweet for my taste.

Overall, a great place to order in from.
