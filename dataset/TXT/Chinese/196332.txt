ZlrHrg7jrbO6blqwfa0MkQ Hands down best Chinese food in all of Charlotte. My family has been eating here for years and the food and service is fairly consistent, if not, at times outstanding or above average. There are definitely some servers who outshine the rest. One in particular who will remain unnamed. I'm sure the regulars know who I speak of! I'm not going to tell you what to order, it's all good, so get what you normally like and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Also, I have found that the food tastes it's best during their busy times. I also really dig the disco lighting and the techno music they sometimes play. Not even kidding. Listen carefully, I think maybe this is on Friday nights.
