2m4092MsMzEHkuxodaj6-g Had garlic noodles and dumplings. First time here and the flavor was good but the food is greasy unfortunately. Definitely too much oil used. The service was great but I am not sure I would go back. First impressions are very important when selecting a restaurant. The plum wine is strong, good balance with the greasy noodles. Would come back to the bar, but not dinner.
