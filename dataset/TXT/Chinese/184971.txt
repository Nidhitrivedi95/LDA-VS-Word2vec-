xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw Visited August 2015:  "Lifelong Customer"

I have been coming to this establishment with my family since they first opened over 5 years ago. I am a loyal customer who has brought several friends, family members, and co workers there - who themselves are now loyal customers. I have their rewards card, and I probably have received over 30 free bowls (including my birthday bowl) because of how much I enjoy eating at this place. You get to make your bowl the way you want to, with fresh products - or have one of the pre-made dishes off the menu. I encourage you to get the medium bowl, since I think the small bowl is geared more towards children. You go down the line and pick out your proteins, then seasoning, veggies, and sauces. Finally you let the cooks know which starch you would like to have with your meal, and then you can pick up crunchies or cut up peanuts to put on the final product. You then sit down at your table, and wait for the staff to bring you your meal. They have appetizers and desserts to choose from, along with a vast amount of alcoholic drinks to choose. The staff is friendly and outgoing people, who will assist with your experience if it is your first time. Mike, who has been there since the place opened, remembers us every time we come in and always finds time to say hello to us. The only criticism I have to give, are the tongs for the food. When they first opened the tongs they had were great! Now, you have to try to pick up the food multiple times because they either don't pick up the food, the food falls off, or you can't get enough of the item on the tongs. This small thing, can boggle down the lines.
