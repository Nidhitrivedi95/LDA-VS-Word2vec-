yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA thumbs down! This is the worst service in China town or all of vegas. We have been there 3 times out of convience and each visit has been more disappointing, we will not return. 
THE Service is Teribble and on our third visit and first serious offense the manager was Very Rude and basically told us he did not need us. I was polite and patient the manager defensive and rude. But it was a simple complaint we did not get the food we ordered and the manager was Very rude to us when we Tryed to get the order correct he told us we had to pay for the wrong food.
