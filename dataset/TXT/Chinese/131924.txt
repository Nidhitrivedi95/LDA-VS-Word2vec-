PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ I have to update my view!  We were looking for a hotpot place but we don't want to go to Chinatown so Sha Grill is the only one that's close to us, so we went back.  It was great this time, they definitely have improved a lot as far as the food selections and the quality seems a lot better too, no 20% off this time but $20 AYCE, can't beat it!
