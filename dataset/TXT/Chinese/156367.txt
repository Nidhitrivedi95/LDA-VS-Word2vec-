trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ We are embarrassed that we raved so much about this place to our friends. Mussels were small and sandy, air conditioning wasn't working, music was so loud we had to shout at each other even though we asked two times to please turn down the volume (apparently there is a strict management policy about volume) and the side salads we ordered for appetizer didn't show up til the entree. Sorry to say we won't be back.
