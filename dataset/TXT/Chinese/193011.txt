ZCNlRDCkDUoWmUOsSNq81g We just recently got a delivery order from here and we were very pleased with the food.  We got a lot for what we paid for and it was very tasty.  This is the first time I've eaten Chinese food in Quebec that tastes like it does in the rest of Canada.  China town is a great place and we also love lots of places there too,  but this one is close to home and we can get it delivered. They actually have chicken balls and proper sweet and sour (red) sauce,  even though they call it pineapple sauce.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for good tasty Chinese food.
