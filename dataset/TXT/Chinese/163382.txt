URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg We tried China Chili for the first time this past Monday with my family, after hearing about it from friends and family for a long time.  The place did not disappoint.  It is clean, spacious, and nicer than some of the other Chinese food dives that we love to frequent.  The service was fast and attentive.  

We ordered the following: West Lake soup, honey walnut prawns, beef chow fun (dry), sesame chicken, mongolian beef, house fried rice, garlic green beans with tofu and Peking pork chop.  Our favorite restaurant is Hong Kong Dining on  24th St and Indian School, but China Chili has some dishes that surpass them.  The West Lake soup was good, not too thick with good flavor.  I thought the garlic green beans were top notch, as were the honey walnut prawns.  Those three dishes I would come back for any day.

The sesame chicken was ok -- it was sliced chicken with sesame sauce poured over it.  I prefer the more Americanized version where individual pieces of chicken are deep fried in a sesame sauce.  I would say the same of the Peking pork chop -- I prefer the dish made by Hong Kong Dining.  CC's seemed to have too much sauce that was maybe a little too sweet.  

All in all a gem of a Chinese restaurant that we will definitely frequent when we are on that side of town!
