QpOAv584eb-ecG4TLEm95g Really GOOD Chinese food is so hard to find, even if you go to Chinatown, so being that this place was on Windmill in a strip mall, I was quite skeptical.  However, I had a horrible Chinese food craving after a weekend of too much alcohol and needed some grease to balance me out.  Since this is just down the street from my house, I decided to give a try and get delivery.

First off, you can place your order right online. It's really convenient and easy.  Everyone knows how hard it is to order Chinese food on the phone sometimes because you can't understand each other!  I ordered pot-stickers $5.95, pork fried rice $5.95 and combination kung pao chicken $8.95.  The prices were SO REASONABLE!  My order was $24 with tax and delivery fee.  But I noticed that they have these family meal combos where you get soup, an appetizer, fried rice, white rice and 1 or 2 entrees for a set price that was under $25, or a personal combo package for $9.95.  

The delivery took about 40 min, which is typical.  The best part is that the food is FREAKIN' AMAZE balls!  It's some of the best Chinese I've had in Vegas.  The ONLY thing that made me give this 4 stars were the pot stickers.  They were huge and the insides were yummy, but they were slightly undercooked so that the top part dough tasted not completely done.  If they had just been cooked more evenly, these would have been amazing.  As they were, I had to pick off all the dough and just eat the outside and the bottoms.  

I'm excited that this place is so close by.  I will ALWAYS go here when I want some yummy Chinese.
