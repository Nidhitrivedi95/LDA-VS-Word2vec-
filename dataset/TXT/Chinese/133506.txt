PXjFfAdj7ZJ6M5Rm19lw3w Solid dumplings. My kids love this place. They especially like the juicy steamed pork dumplings and the egg and shrimp ones. Service is indifferent but efficient (not impolite). I gave this four stars because it is clean and the dumplings are yummy and homemade. I must admit that this would not be my first choice in the neighbourhood  just because I prefer sushi, Thai etc... But  as I said, the kids love it! If you like dumplings, you won't be disappointed.
