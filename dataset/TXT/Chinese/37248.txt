An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg Last time I was here.. its was a Fish Soup place.. there are still hundreds of fish hanging from the ceiling.    We got a nice big booth and it took a long time to read through the menus... way too many choices and decisions.   I really like the cold drinks you can upgrade your meal to.
