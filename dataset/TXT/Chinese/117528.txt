NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ Ten rens!
Nice place, nice decor, friendly staff. 
The drinks are amazing, probably because they use legit teas and stuff instead of powders. I like my bubble tea with strong tea flavours so this is my place to be. Food is pretty good, I personally like the green tea noodles.
The only thing i can complain about is the price. Everything is mad expensive, not your average $3 bubble tea lol. Try multiplying that by 2.5 and thats Ten Rens lol. It's fairly busy still even though the prices are so high. I guess the quality is just up there, or probably just because its located in "Richman's Hill" LOL.
Good place to enjoy premium drinks and teas.
