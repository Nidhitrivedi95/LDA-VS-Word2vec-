I ordered sesame chicken and it was pretty bland and over sauced. Crab rangoons were okay, not as crispy as I like them.
Giving 4 stars based on the spicy garlic beef dish we ordered, it was delicious and had the right amount of kick. 
Overall we may give it another shot since they're so close and deliver.
