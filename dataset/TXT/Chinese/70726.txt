F9h98ZFHLCHG7SdVbXMz0g Went to Kwan the other day for the first time and was pleasantly surprised with the place.  Ordered 7 dishes, that were all very good.  The only complaint with the food was that the fried octopus and turnip pancake were very greasy.  However, the other things we ordered like chicken feet, sticky rice in lotus leaf, siu miy, and the beef rice roll were all good.

Last thing thing that I wasn't particularly pleased with was that we sat 3 tables from the entrance.  The problem was that anytime the door was opened you felt the cold breeze fully.  They should have placed a barrier between patrons and the entrance so you don't feel the outside weather.

Besides that, I would highly recommend this place.
