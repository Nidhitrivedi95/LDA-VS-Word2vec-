VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Kids meals were disappointing.  Terriyaki chicken is a basic kid meal staple but Flos kid meals only include rice.  If you want noodles instead with the Terriyaki meal it costs extra $2.  That's $7.50 for kids terriyaki with noodles.  Pei Wei much better and more flexible with pricing.
