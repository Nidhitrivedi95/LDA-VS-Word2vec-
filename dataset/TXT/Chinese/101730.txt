kbq9QlIprqKpIWXZEXtGSA The food here used to be incredibly phenomenal back over 10 years ago when it was run by a husband and wife team. Ever since they moved and sold it, the quality of the food has waaaaaay down hill. On the rare occasion that I do order, I get a young kid with attitude taking my order, and everything tastes like generic bland mall food sauce that is entirely too salty. 

For instance, one major selling point for me was that this place made their own dumplings. The other month when I ordered them, they were clearly the frozen type that you can get in any freezer section. I swear all dishes are cooked in the same three sauce categories, and delivery time can sometimes be outrageous. This place is just not good. Head across the street and grab some quality Japanese food from Tsuki before you give this place your money.
