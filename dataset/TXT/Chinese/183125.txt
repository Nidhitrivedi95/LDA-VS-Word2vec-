XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw My first impression is the decor of the restaurant with its red floral chairs is an acquired taste.

Service is slow so if you are in a rush this is not the place to go.

I had the pan fried dumplings and the beef noodle soup.  The food is okay and it's nothing I would write more about.
