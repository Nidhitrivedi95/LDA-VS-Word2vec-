EhlOUjd2dh52SV_XfoORSA My favorite Chinese in the Pittsburgh area.  Everything is top quality from the atmosphere to the food.

My favorite dish is the amazing chicken.  It is similar to general tsos but with a little twist.  I have also had the general tsos, sesame chicken, and the chicken fried rice and always been impressed.  

It is a little pricy, however the quality of food you get makes it worth it.
