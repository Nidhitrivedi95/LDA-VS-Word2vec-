SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ Our first disastrous take out order through phone ever. It took mor than 10 minutes to make the other end understand what we want. Though the chicken tempura rolls are on the online as well as their printed menu, the guy who took the call denied to place the order for the same by saying they don't make it, the only make chicken fried rice, then we had to order shrimp tempura roll which was not in our plan. We ordered a second roll which is spicy tuna tempura roll, and since we don't eat raw rolls we specified it MANY MANY times that we want tempura rolls only and he said yes. Upon reaching for pickup we came to know that tuna roll is not tempura one and is raw. The guy who took the order wanted us to somehow have what he was about to give. He insisted us to take that home, but raw sushi is of no use to us and we decided to take only the shrimp tempura roll home. Then he started saying that he heard us ordering spicy tuna tempura roll but since their menu doesn't have such item he had to make it what he wanted us to have. Then we had to show him the same item printed in their menu. Here comes his final lame excuse, it was a technical error.... wow.. he rolled a lot longer than the actual roll. Finally we ended up waiting more for our order. Food was okay but will have to think twice before next time coz its way too much tasks for just two rolls. A friendly reminder to everyone who is going to place a take out order " if you don't speak their language, then don't make it" just drive up there make your order wait some time and happily have your order, otherwise you are going to regret time you spent on phone making that order, hearing lame excuses at pickup and wasting some more of your precious time waiting to get what you actually wanted. Good luck.
