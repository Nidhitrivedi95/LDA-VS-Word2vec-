AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I have been avidly searching for decent vegetarian/vegan options since I just moved here a few months ago & don't know what's good. I noticed that this place has rave reviews & the pictures looked yum so I decided to check it out today with my mother since we were in the area. This place is 100% vegan/vegetarian so two thumbs up to that!

Despite the gritty location, when walking into Veggie House it was very clean & inviting. The two women who waited/served us were both very very nice & we enjoyed their service & conversation. Really nice people. Even the restroom was very clean which is always a plus!

Now on to the most important stuff. The food! Omg we loved it so much. We had the spring rolls for an appetizer, fish with hot bean sauce, and hot spicy szechuan tofu which were both on the lunch special. Also when they say spicy, they mean spicy. My nose was running like mad but it was worth it. Everything was seriously good. We are really picky eaters & we had nothing bad to say about the place. I see myself coming back again & again & again lol! I want to try everything on the menu eventually!!!! Can't wait to come back in the future because every time someone elses order was delivered to their table I couldn't help but notice how delicious everyone elses food also looked!!!

Really happy to have found this place & would definitely recommend to anyone!!!
