_Ss4d4dYzehTmWJGpkqL7w This place doesn't stand out among a decent crowd of Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, but it definitely holds its own among them.  The food is usually very hot and delicious.  On occasion, you may find a dish on the salty side, but I doubt you'll ever come across a dish that lacks flavour here.  Definitely worth a try.  Good food, good prices, same ol crappy Chinese service.
