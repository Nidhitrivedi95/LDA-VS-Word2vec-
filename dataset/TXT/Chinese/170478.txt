vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA You were OK this time ping pang pong. 

Pros: fast seating (we got there right at the opening)
           food came out relatively fast

Cons & confusions: 
1) Where's my dan tats and ja-leung???  :( I wasn't going to wait 30 minutes for them to come out
2)How come in the lo-mai-gai, there's only one instead of two??
