ZYyi0opV_ivODZ8bU--7Xg STAY AWAY from this place!!!! Ordered a four course meal and every single one of them were absolutely disgusting!!! The waiter was rude and just walked away. We were never given water the whole time we were there. The Hunan dumpling came with sandy/slimy peanut butter sauce. You can tell they were old and pre made. The Singapore style noodles were void of any form of flavor, not even a hint of salt. The chef's specialty looked and tasted like the chef is a 4 year old kid cooking our meal. I just hope we don't get sick from this trash. We left with some food untouched. Stay away and save your money!!! I wish I can give this place no star. They don't deserve it.
