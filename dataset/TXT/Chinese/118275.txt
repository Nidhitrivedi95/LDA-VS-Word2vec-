nl_gkvVXtsIlhGE0sP0qFw This is one of my favorite chinese places! 

I love to take my mom here. We have very different ideas of what good Chinese food is and this place leaves us both satisfied. It's very affordable - I think it's around $10 per person for dinner and that includes all you can eat Sushi!! ^0^ 

I love the soups and sauteed entrees, they're very good. In the back corner, there's the specialty items!! Some of them are dishes are a little too exotic for me but they smell amazing!! someday I'll get the gumption to try them! 

I would totally recommend this place to anyone who likes chinese food! It's a little hidden in a strip mall location. They have awesome sushi and I especially love nigiri! :) and all your time tested chinese-american favorites as well as some thing you've never seen before! oh! and ICE CREAM!! whoo!! who doesn't want to end a meal with all you can eat dryer's ice cream??? Go and get a little crazy!! :)
