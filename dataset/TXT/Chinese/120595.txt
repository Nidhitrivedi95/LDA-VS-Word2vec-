O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw While in Toronto last week we asked our tour guide if he had a recommendation for a good Dim Sum place in the Chinatown area and he said Rol San was the best.  We went slightly before dinner time so we could avoid the lines.  The place is VERY unassuming but the food was decent.

I am not a big Dim Sum person, I enjoy Dim Sum, but I don't go out of my way to have it regularly, but I did enjoy the Dim Sum we had that evening.  My favorite dish was the deep fried shrimp and scallions.  They were terrific!

When you sit down they give you a little paper to write down what Dim Sum you want.  You can also order al a carte (instead of or in addition to).  We ordered several options.  I wish was had asked what was in everything, the descriptions on the menu were minimal and when I got one of the dishes I noticed there was meat in it (I don't eat meat, so that was an issue).  I tried to send the dish back but the language barrier was so great that the waitress didn't know what I was asking.

The service was slow, I'm not sure if that is cultural.  Being American I'm used to fast service and a waiter urging me to finish and get the heck out, so I perceived the service to be slow.  They were not quick to fill my water glass which was a problem when I mistakenly added a TON of hot sauce to my vegetable dumpling thinking it was much milder than it was, and my mouth was ON FIRE!  

Overall it was OK, but I wouldn't say it was much better than that.
