cxVp-a28Cp7lavjaPMvK5w Came here for dinner on a weeknight. Ordered the rock shrimp and Brussels sprouts appetizers. Both had little flavor but tasted soaked in grease... had 2 sushi rolls which were decent but we're more rice than anything... maybe some of the other food they serve is ok but I was fairly disappointed especially for a place that is pricier than the average sushi place.

The biggest problem was it seemed very dirty. Our menu had syrupy drink splattered all over it and you could see the table was barely cleaned off. For a fairly new restaurant it looked incredibly worn.

I definitely will not return.
