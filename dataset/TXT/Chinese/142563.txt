rkTFLIt_Z1bYMIuXfSyAqg Having visited 2/3 of the wonton trinity uptown, I set on a journey try the last of the triad. It brings me sadness to report that, albeit satisfactory, Wonton Hut just did not measure up to competitors Jim Chai Kee and Wonton Chai. 

I also understand that every wonton seeker has their own preferences, so I will list out the differences and let you judge for yourself: 

- Open on Wednesdays, unlike the other two 
- More options i.e. fresh soy milk
- Wontons are smaller in size compared to the other two, think golf ball instead of tennis ball 
- Shrimp itself is less succulent

Try for yourself and get your wont on.
