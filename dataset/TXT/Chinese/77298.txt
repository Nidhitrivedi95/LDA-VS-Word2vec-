gDQlaDRAjsCx2p_p6oJLjw Reliable Chinese delivery at a good price.  Once you learn what they do well (General Tso's chicken, the duck dishes, lo mein, teriyaki chicken, shrimp egg rolls, steamed and fried dumplings) and what they do not-so-well (won ton soup, fried rice, regular egg rolls)*, you can have a pretty consistently good experience with them.  Online ordering makes things a lot easier, the delivery folks are polite and arrive within the estimated time, and the food is pretty good.  Also, one night we ordered a little close to closing time and arrived a few minutes late to pick it up, and they were very nice about sticking around for us.  

I wish I could give it a less lukewarm endorsement, but going from the Asian food of San Francisco, CA to that of Swissvale, PA has been a little bit jarring.  All in all, no major complaints; it's great to have a dependable Saturday-night-in staple for the fiance and I. 

*The won ton soup and regular egg rolls are so-so, but passable; the fried rice is just abysmal.  If you want fried rice, go elsewhere.
