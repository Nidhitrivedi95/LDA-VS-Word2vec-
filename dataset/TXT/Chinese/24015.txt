I'd highly recommend the shrimp dumplings (pan-fried) and the pork+shrimp dumplings (also pan-fried).

Some in my party enjoyed the red bean bubble tea as well. The plan was to snack hard and that's it. And this is a great place to do that. Probably wouldn't ever settle down for a full meal here - it reminds me of a Taiwanese rest stop diner where you don't really want to spend too much time there, you're better off doing the eat 'n' run thing...

Bathroom is pretty gross, not super gross, but disappointingly typical of a Chinatown bathroom. Come on Fat Dumpling, clean up your WC - people remember that shit.
