qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA The Scottsdale location was able to seat us ( a party of 5) quickly and we tried a variety of items.

The food has never impressed me much, especially the lettuce wraps-everyone raves about. The actual "meat" that you put in the iceberg shells is sketchy, what is in there? Chicken mixed with tofu and chewy bits??

I go with others and enjoy the wonderful service and beautiful atmosphere of the restaurants.

That being said....I wouldn't make the shrimp with candied walnuts and honeydew melon at home and I admit it is great tasting!
