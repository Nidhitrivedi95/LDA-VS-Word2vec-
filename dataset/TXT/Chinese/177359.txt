WWZgzuTn1k7Yn9bJ_Pr0Kg I just moved to a new neighborhood so I am on the hunt for a great local sushi joint.

Upon entering Bamboo, the atmosphere is nice. It's a little small for a restaurant but it's casual so it could work.

We ordered the basics off of the sushi menu, plus one unique roll. The basic sushi rolls (California and Philadelphia roll) were just OK - nothing fancy and over priced compared to what other places are charging. The unique roll was pretty amazing though, and priced nicely for a rather large sushi roll.

Overall, I wasn't impressed but I wouldn't count this place out for a quick sushi lunch or dinner. I wasn't satisfied with the pricing (especially because I didn't feel the quality met the pricing standard) but the service was decent and it was a clean and quiet place.
