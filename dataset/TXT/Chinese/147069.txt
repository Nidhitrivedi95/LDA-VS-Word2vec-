I was pretty disgusted as I walked in but gave it a shot anyways. I ordered what I always order, fried rice, orange chicken and cream cheese rangoons. My fried rice was average, can't mess that up really. My orange chicken was dry as all get out, just awful. Then to top it off they burnt my favorite part, the cream cheese rangoon, it was too crunchy to chew, flavorless and dry. Terrible experience by far the worst I've had here. Not coming back to this one if any. Expect more out of your experience than just average. I know it's not fine dining but it should be edible and a relatively mellow environment.
