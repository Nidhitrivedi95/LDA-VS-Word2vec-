XhMfL-6lt-prYyC9Lp02gg Best Wok seems like it has been here forever.  I don't even remember when they first opened, but I've been eating here since I was a teenager.  

Best Wok has a unique flavor in their fried rice.  It's really tasty and is dark in color.  On my last visit to Best Wok, I had an egg roll and some chicken fried rice.  It was really delicious.  

My wife ordered BBQ spare ribs, which she absolutely loves, and pork fried rice.  This was the first time she has ever eaten here since living in the United States.  There are so many restaurants around here that I can spend the rest of my life sampling new food.  That's a good thing, right?  Anyway, she liked the food and we'll return again.
