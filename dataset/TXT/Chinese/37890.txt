as5StqV9pbDhUM0AYP_j9g Aunt grabbed a bunch of baked goods for us.

We were very grateful. The bakery has a nice selection of items. Set up is similar to all other Chinese bakeries. Grab a tray and tongs. Bring your items to the cashier and check out. They have a little dinning area behind the bakery where they offer dim sum items. Tables weren't all that clean, I guess it is Chinatown.

Buns were fresh and had an overall OK flavor. Employees are quick. Don't expect great service.
