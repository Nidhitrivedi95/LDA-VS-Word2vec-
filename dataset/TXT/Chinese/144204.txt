Rtl6MbWZABlf5sU-Ni72xQ China Wok is amazing.... if you're a diabetic or have absolutely no taste buds that is.

My boyfriend bought us hot and sour soup which had NO flavor, was watered down, had barely any veggies or egg in it, chicken that was mediocre, beef wontons with way too much wonton that was all gummy, and cashew shrimp which had mostly sauce slop and barely any shrimp! The wonton crisps that they gave us on the side were stale. The shrimp dish had no flavor and we had to add our own seasonings to it to make it taste all right. We ordered extra rice which we didn't get. 

This place is the MOST BORING, TASTELESS CHINESE FOOD IN TOWN and their prices are not reasonable either. Try Asia Garden or China A Go Go instead. Their food actually has flavor and you can tell they care for their business and not just about saving money, unlike China Wok.
