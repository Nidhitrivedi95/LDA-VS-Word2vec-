Another good JK recommendation. 

- I really liked the layout of the restaurant, the seating is well spaced and comfortable... kind of rare for many Asian restaurants. I was never "bumped into" the whole evening - bonus points.

- Staff were friendly and spoke perfect English to me (I'm not Asian.... obviously).

- Kudos for good fast service.

- My new favourite wonton soup for sure. Nice chicken flavoured broth with roughly 10 large home made dumplings. Excellent dumplings.

- The pumpkin and mixed mushroom dish was an easy standout for me - I enjoyed it with a side of steamed rice. Brought a smile to my face. The pumpkin tasted better the longer it sat absorbing the heat and sauce.

- Black bean beef ribs with peppers / onions served on a hot plate was also good but a little spicy. I would prefer the meat to be slightly more tender though. 

So many things I want to try on the large menu. I will return very soon. This is my kind of place...
