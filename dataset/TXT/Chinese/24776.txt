6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ Hands down, my favourite place for Donburi in Markham.

Gyuu Don never disappoints: slice beef and onion in a dashi , mirrin and soy based sauced topped off with an osen egg (+$2.00). The osen egg is a must as it adds flavour to the rice! It's about as good as it gets. 

All orders of donburi are served with miso soup and salad.

The plaza gets pretty busy during dinner time, don't forget there is underground parking!
