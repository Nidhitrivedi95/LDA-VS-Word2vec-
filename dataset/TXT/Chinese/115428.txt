n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A Other than being somewhat over priced (plan on $125 per person) for oriental food( but what Vegas restaurant isn't) the place was really, really, good and a fun experience (try to be there at 8:00 for a little show). It's very noisy, so if you want a romantic place, not here. No menu - the "Captain" just starts bring you food after some basic questions about allergies. Food was spectacular and more than enough to satisfy everyone. Don't fret if you don't like one dish - more will appear soon. We had filet minion which isn't normally my favorite cut of beef - but wow. Nice and garlicky and melted in your mouth. No knife needed. The crispy duck was out of this world. I passed on the green shrimp - wrong texture for me. I will definitely be back!
