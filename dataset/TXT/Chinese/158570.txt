tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw I live right down the street from this location and yet I had never been to it. I have eaten at other PF Changs in the past. The customer service was very good and the managers came around and asked how we were doing several times. The Chicken lettuce wrap appetizer is one of my favorites. My husband had the dumplings and he said they were delicious. The Mongolian beef and added broccoli is delicious but they could probably cut back on some of the green onions. Overall the service was good and well return.
