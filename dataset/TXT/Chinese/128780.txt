PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Located at an old low budget Chinese buffet in a busy plaza we visited this place because we were referred to by a mutual friend. We went on a rainy Sunday around around 5pm. Was a bit dead and there were no carts of food anywhere to be seen. Thankfully we were able to order a la carte each dim sum item on the menu anytime. The service was very on point. 

We ordered the usual dim sum items such as shu mai, har gow, fried shrimp ball, Chinese bok choy, and shrimp in flat rice noodle. They were all tasty and came hot and steaming as if they were on the usual food cart. But these are made to order rather than batched prior to the usual dim sum hours. Never been to a place that will make your dim sum choices made to order. This was a definite plus.

Afterwards, we were all so full and the lady came up and gave us information on their hot dessert item. Even though we were stuffed the server was sincere about the steamed custard buns. We gave in and had one order of egg custard and two orders of the amazing sweet custard bun (can have it steamed or baked I think). The custard buns were warm and crispy on the outside, but inside was soft and filled with runny, sweet custard. Both great choices to end a well balanced meal. 

I would come back again and try the other items on the menu.
