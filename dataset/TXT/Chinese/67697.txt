eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g Very nicely decorated with Chinese art and paintings. Specialized in seafood so you can get fresh lobsters or king crabs here. Whats nice is that is they offer set menus (a multi course meal for 2,3,4...people) which is convenient. Like any typical Cantonese restaurant you start with free tea and soup and end with sweet soup <U+7CD6><U+6C34> and fruits. Food in general is fresh but taste is okay but nothing extrodinary.
