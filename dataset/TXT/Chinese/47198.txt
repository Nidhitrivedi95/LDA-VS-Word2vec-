bzMO8LJmJtgo3KuyWGKUxA We came here on a Monday. There's a good amount of seating in the restaurant and it was decently full on a Monday Night. There's relatively cheap parking walking distance by on Sullivan. We had prompt service. I opted for the braised beef noodle and the pancake. The pancake was okay. The noodles were tender and the broth was clean. There was a good amount of noodles. I opted to add the fried egg and thought it went well with the dish. I added some chilli oil for a kick and thought it was the perfect dish for a cold day. The beef was pretty tender and overall thought the meal was good value. Cheap and good!
