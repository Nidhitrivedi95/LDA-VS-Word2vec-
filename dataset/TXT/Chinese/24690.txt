6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ Came here for the first time on a Friday for dinner. We were seating quickly but service was a tad slow. 

I ordered the gyuu don and was actually surprised at the portion size. There was a lot more rice than I expected. There was a good amount of meat though. 

I like the menus here as there are pictures of everything.  You also write your own order on paper so that limits your interaction with the waiters.

I'll come back again.
