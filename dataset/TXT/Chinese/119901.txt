NYMUlUYYEb3H0nKsauj-yw Disclaimer: If you are looking for great sushi joint, this is not it.  I only come here for two reasons:

1) I am sort of craving sushi and need a cheap, quick lunch.  I can get a salmon roll and an avocado roll for about $8.  Not bad.

2) I am meeting a friend for lunch on campus.  They have a dining room upstairs with plenty of tables and it is usually pretty quiet; perfect for conversation.
