vsoEZauF4lrADIqCYXySFQ I've been ordering from this place for years and today, after getting my order in just 15 minutes (holy crap!), I decided to give a review. 

I've only ever ordered delivery so I don't know how the in-house service is, but the delivery drivers are always really nice and polite. The food is delicious (the crab rangoons are HUGE and a little sweet which is my favorite) and the dumplings are the best I've ever had. Pretty much everything I've ordered from Chopsticks has been delicious. Best part? They're open super late. I honestly don't know why anyone would eat at any other Chinese place on campus.
