xistlMeIIjG21z2SaWvfVQ This is the best soup dumpling (xiao long bao) place in town! Very very juicy and full of soup.. I am from Shanghai and this reminds me of the food I had when I was young. Barbeque is a little overpriced but wasn't too bad overall. Bottom line, Shanghainese will probably love the baozi and xiao long bao, because that's similar to how they're made in Shanghai; but that might not suit the taste of people from other places :)
