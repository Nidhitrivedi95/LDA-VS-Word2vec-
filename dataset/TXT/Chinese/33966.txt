AbadN65irz8uSL8z6fkoBg I am here again in Las Vegas and visited my usual dinning places.  That included BBQ King.  Same old same old, except...

We ordered three wonton soup noodles.  The noodle and soup are fine but the wontons were bad.  I don't know is it the shrimp or the meat.  There is that bad frozen old taste to it.  I have to split it out and confirmed with my friends that their wontons were as bad.  

Man!  What a spoiler!

The good thing is...  I found a new place with better soup and noodle.  Try Wendy's Noodle Cafe on S Jones BLVD and Spring Mountain; which is not too far away from BBQ King.

On the good side, the chicken (in whole) is really good.  It has the real chicken taste.  (It might not mean much to most of the foreigner when I say that.  Sorry!  Dude, you folks has not taste what a real rfresh and well prepared chicken taste/texture like.  The meat is tender and there is that fragrance...)

With that, BBQ King is not a two stars restaurant to me.
