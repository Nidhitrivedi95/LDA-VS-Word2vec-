By3eFOzWO9Mo0HivLhN8Sg We moved to the area in 2005, that's when we found Jong Wah. We love the food!  We have tried the other restaurants in the area, but we always return here. We are big fans of the orange chicken and their egg foo young can't be beat in the valley that we've found.  We are regular delivery patrons of this awesome restaurant.
