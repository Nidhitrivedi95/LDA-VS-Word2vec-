GfYzz2Dnnn0CqeDqROAKTQ I do not know what is happening to China Inn lately, but this is the second time that they messed up our order.  The first time we received one dish entirely different than what was ordered.  This evening, we specifically ordered a combination plate, but received a quart of the order instead.  The combination plate includes an egg roll.  When we called to inform them that the order was wrong the female person on the line proceeded to tell us that we received more of the item because we received the quart size. Really?  We did not want to order the quart size.  We had the order written down, with the number of the item on the menu and also informed them of the name of the dish.  How can you mess that up? To top it off, we were charged slightly highly for the quart size.  We ordered the combination plate purposely for the egg roll.  We are definitely going to find another Chinese restaurant in the area the next time we want to order Chinese food.  I never thought this Chinese restaurant was that great, coming from the Chicago area, but I am looking forward to finding something more authentic in Madison.
