B41kSVjdFOwOrZTuJaTF7g Tried this restaurant while in Mississauga, didn't have very high expectations as the review indicated slow service etc. I have to say, the food came out very quickly even with a full house, the flavour is authentic and service improved based on the other reviews.
Would definitely recommend
