Warning: if you don't read Chinese or have a good grasp of Chinese cuisine, you may not be able to get the most delicious things on the menu. Personally, I relied on my aunts and my brother to order everything.

Peking duck: very good. But really, I have yet to meet a peking duck I didn't enjoy. We had the meal with the wrappers and with the lettuce leaves. Very tasty.

Deep fried soft shelled crab: There had to be maybe two crabs in this order. It was HUGE and very very delicious with just the right amount of crunch and saltiness.

Deep fried oysters: Not nearly as good as the crab, these were incredibly oily and soggy, which is weird since the crab was deep fried to perfection. Not sure what happened here.

Fish and tofu... dish of some sort: Very good, the fish was excellent, but the tofu seemed a little overdone.

Service was fine, and they had the Chinese TV going, which may appeal to some. Cleanliness was on par with Chinese restaurant standards. The portions were quite huge and we ended up taking almost half of what we ordered home (we did order too much, though)

I think I would return again and bring friends!
