s9zNmeJIu83WVL56QNLD2A I came in with my boyfriend because we were craving Asian and this is sadly the only place I know of that's decent without getting food poisoning.

The fried rice was bland, no flavor.  I tried the cod they had and I actually liked it. Still went with  sweet fire (spicy sweet & sour) chicken and grilled teriyaki chicken. It was really good but I would of been happier if they had sweet and sour chicken that's my favorite. We've come here twice and both times have been good experiences. Just wish it was slightly better the food didn't seem flavorful it was just OK.  Very clean restruant however.
