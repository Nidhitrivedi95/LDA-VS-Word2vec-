TSGBM2z5BTeJvYQAznz8Fg My family and I are from the East coast. We are loyal to our style of Chinese food but have accepted, it is near impossible to find what we want in AZ. This buffet has a nice selection of food, including Dim Sum! My son loves Sushi, and they have Sashimi, fresh!!! Crab legs, Salt and Pepper Crab, Clams, Snail, etc....you want it....it's there ;)  It's pricey but I don't mind paying for quality and cleanliness.
