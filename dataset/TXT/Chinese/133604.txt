pxYqUpCz1WQU5M-1tW3-Lw Love this place! Great egg rolls, love the wonton and egg drop soups, and I have to fight my son for the crab Rangoon. The owners are very friendly people and they always recognize me.  Once they even threw in a crab Rangoon just because they know I love it! Our go-to place for Chinese
