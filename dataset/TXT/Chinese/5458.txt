0BFzeEDYXR_w9Ni6qNj9OQ I was very pleased to find Golden Palace through Yelp. To know that it's in my neighbourhood and it has such high reviews is reassuring. I was not disappointed. The order was ready for pick up exactly when they said it would be which is a great first impression.

We ordered the Dinner for 3 (A) and lemon chicken and we were stuffed before we even finished half of it. Everything was so delicious but I'll talk about two dishes inparticular. The beef with 7 vegetables was very delicious. It was not your standard beef and vegetables, it had a unique, dare I say, authentic flavour. I highly recommend it. The chicken chow mein also had a unique flavour that you probably won't find at any other Chinese restaurant. Again, highly recommended. To be honest I haven dived into the lemon chicken yet but I look forward to doing so. I also look forward to ordering from them in the future.
