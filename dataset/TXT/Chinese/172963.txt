W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ Agree with all of those who said over-priced for what you get.    We didn't study the menu beforehand, so partially our fault that we missed on that.   My husband had the ramen for $21 -- we're pretty spoiled living in the SF Bay Area where we GREAT cheap ramen, udon, and pho on a regular basis.  Not that this "should" be the same, but $21 was a bit over the top.    I suppose for "street food" I would have expected more reasonable prices.    I also had a steamed bun which was a big disappointment..again, we should have studied the menu and pictures.   To be fair, the tempura was quite good.   And the servers tried really hard.   We were there Friday night about 7pm and the place was pretty empty, that should have been a clue.
