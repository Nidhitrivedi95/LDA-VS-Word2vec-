3a3ZSTEhFNnmvBhMwW3fSA I wanted and was craving some Hakka food yesterday. I came on this site to see what was the closest to my house and was happy I found this place. Hakka food is a fusion between Indian spices on Chinese cuisine.  I ordered the Chicken Pakora, Chili Chicken on Rice, and the Beef Hakka Chow Main. All three dishes were delicious, Full of flavour, big portion size, and fulfilled the craving I had.

The Place is a tiny restaurant. I phoned in advance to place the order and the lady on the phone said 20 mins. I arrived on time as this was my first time going there so I wanted to make sure I didn't miss it. I didn't even have to tell her my name she came out of the back with my order. She was friendly, and had a very positive attitude towards her.. She quoted me a price over the phone which was exactly the same.. 

I will return here when i'm in the mood to have some spice in my cuisine..
