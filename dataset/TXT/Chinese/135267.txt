qaJ-HewyVAQCQ8C_KveZ4g Ordered delivery here for the first time at my new house as they're the closest. Ordered online with the Yelp Eat24 interface, very easy to use and it even saves your previous orders!

Crab rangoon appetizer, not the best I've ever had but fried well and had a good sweet & sour sauce served with it.

General Tso's was very good for a take-out joint. The batter was lighter than a lot of other places and I liked it, less breading more chicken! The sauce was great and you can specify your level of spiciness on the ordering menu (I think it just changes the amount of chili peppers they include!).

Got a slice of Carrot Cake for dessert... never again. I could have gotten better carrot cake from a gas station... #sorrynotsorry

Overall a positive experience, there's stuff I know I can order here and some stuff I'll stay away from. Delivery was prompt and the entree was hot and tasty.
