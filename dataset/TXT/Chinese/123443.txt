OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA I have been going to King Noodle every time I visit toronto.  I think the food is great, especially the shrimp-laden wontons.  The bbq fare is good as well.  I would caution anyone to try more than the casual chinese cuisine.  I ordered the "BC clams in black sauce" for about $12.  what I got was very few clams on a bed of lettuce!!!  I could not believe what a scam this was.  About 1/3 what other chinese restaurants in the area would serve for that cost.  That said, stick to King Noodle's bread and butter:  noodle soups, noodles, or BBQ duck, pork, or crispy pork and you will have a delicious meal.  also, when you pay up front, there is a place for you to deposit your tip.  Don't leave it at the table.  I noticed the person who cleared the table taking it and not our waitress.  Also, the decor is much nicer than it used to be but if you are single or with someone else, expect to be seated close or even at the same table as others.  No big deal...
