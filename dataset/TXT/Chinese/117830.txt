NImT1XHwwUmoHaPEjIIwRQ Came here for lunch to try this infamous Ginger Chicken dish that's been yelped so heavily about. 

So out it came. It was chicken breast strips, coated in a light crispy batter. Deep fried and liberally splashed with this intensely sweet and spicy dark brown sauce. 

At first, like tequila it's fun the first time. But after awhile it becomes tiring. I felt the need a little more variety, perhaps some vegetables or something else to counter the flavours. 

After a while I felt like I was eating Ginger Chicken Candy. Crunch, crunch crunh.

It was alright,  but I'll have to go back with some people to try some other dishes.  My Ginger Chicken combo came with soup to start (choose from wonton, hot and sour, egg drop) plus a bowl of white rice.

Oh one thing I didn't like during my meal, the lady at the front booth, just stands there staring. I was being watched my every move..  Hmm..
