fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ Horrible experience!

My reservation at 9pm, it close at 10pm.
Before my group was seated, the assigned waiter approached me and said, our kitchen close at 9:45 n you need to order quick.

I was reading the menu, the waiter came twice and rushed me to order, I immediately felt uncomfortable n don't know what to order.

About the food: price ranging from 36 to 42, the quality is terrible, you can get 12 to 18 out site the strip with much better quality n taste foods. The steam rice is $5/bowl which I am fine to pay for that price but they use a lousy rice.

I am not a cheapskate, I have dine and pay for $900 per meal per person n consider myself as aficionado foods connoisseur.

About the service: this is the worse part of my experience. 5 stars rating fine dinning but the service is equal or perhaps worse than some of lousy Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. How can a fine dinning restaurant's kitchen close 15 minutes before it closing time; this is only happen at the money pinching lousy Chinese restaurant where all their kitchen crews must be out by certain time to avoid paying OT. 

The waiter was very unprofessional n I felt the discrimination on his looks. The manager was equally arrogance n discriminating. This is what I called "reversed discrimination" when these Asian manager, waiter(est), server were Asian themselves n look down upon their own race, thinking that only the Caucasian can afford in their establishment.  

Wynn management, you need to seriously review Wing Lei establishment n major training to avoid the reversed discrimination.
We, your Asian customers might not look n dress like the Caucasian but trust me? We are equal or maybe more in spending for luxuries n fine dining.
