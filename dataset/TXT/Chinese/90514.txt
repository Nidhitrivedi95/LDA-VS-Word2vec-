Ih7a0qOMLFnYAec8qyq2Gg This little gem took over the spot immediately next to No Frills in Bloor West Village. We've only been once so far...but we'll be back to sample more of the menu. 

Tonight, we had crispy ginger beef (and the sauce comes on the side). Tasty, tender, and with bits of ginger in the very light breading. Recommended. We also had Szechuan noodles, which were excellent, with enough variation in the spicing that each bite tasted different from the last. 

Clearly family owned and operated, this is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.
