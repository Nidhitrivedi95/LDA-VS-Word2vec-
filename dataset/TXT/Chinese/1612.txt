-RmFfWUyUU1RPIGtih7J-w I thought  the price was a little high but then i picked up the to go box. You get a ton of food and it  is exceptional! 
I ordered the chow fun  with veggies,  full of flavor, not salty, no msg.
I think I have found my new favorite dish! 
Friendly staff, talked with the cashier while waiting for my order.
Good food, good prices, good people.
