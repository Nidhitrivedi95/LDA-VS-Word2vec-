1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I found this restaurant a couple years back when we were trying to actually go to the Asian BBQ & Noodles but the line was too long. I have a deep appreciation for this restaurant as it shares the same last name as me so I held it to very high expectations. 

The place inside definitely reminds you of a "cheap" Chinese restaurant as it is pretty basic inside and they use styrofoam cups for water and plastic utensils. They actually just got new menus and some new pictures on the wall I think. Passing the savings on to the consumer? I am all for it. One small thing is that the prices have increased on their menu over the past year or so. 

All in all, you can never go wrong with their hainam chicken or soup noodles especially for the price! (~$6) I wouldn't come in here expecting even a four star quality meal but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. I recommend getting the dark meat with the rice since it's a lot more tender than the white meat and not typical dark meat in chicken. Also the stir fried veggies always smell SO good when it comes out on the sizzling platter and the smell permeates of garlic throughout the restaurant. I always gotta stop by BIG WONG'S when I am in town!
