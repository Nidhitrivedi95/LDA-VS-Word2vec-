oVtnnGat2Wco0ksQT1cGCA Alright, I'm going to be straight up and probably offend some people with what I'm about to say... but if you're a "I love sushi", from a NON-Asian descent, kind of person, then you'll be fine eating here. However, if you are of Asian descent, and I'm assuming you know your sushi tastes, then this place will be a huge disappointment for you. 

Service - 2/5. All the servers are non-fluent in English, which is totally fine. However, it seems like they're all international students from China, which is also fine. What is not fine is taking China's customer service and bringing it here. For my fellow Asians and travellers, you know how restaurants in China operates; fast, rude, rushed, literally doing whatever it takes just to get you eating and getting the f*ck out the restaurant while collecting your cash on your way out. This is exactly that kind of restaurant. Yes, I know AYCE have never been known to have satisfactory service, but this is a real real real disappointment. Food was being slammed on our tables as they came. We weren't even done eating some dishes yet and the waitresses would say "Can you put this piece of sushi onto this other plate?". Unless you're extremely low on plates (which you should not be), then there is no need to disrupt my family's eating environment. 

Food - 3/5. Honestly, I've had better sushi rolls from a grocery store. The only reason I give them a score of "3" is because there's variety. You have everything from Kalbi, to hand/maki rolls, to vegetarian rolls, to general tao chicken. Hand rolls were plain, nothing special. Kalbi, great, although a little fatty. General tao, although unsure why I wanted to try it, was not good. I've had better at Panda Express.

Decoration - 3.5/5. Beautiful, comfortable. Sadly the service and food just aren't on-par. 

Overall, would never come back. There are way better AYCE restaurants in Mississauga.
