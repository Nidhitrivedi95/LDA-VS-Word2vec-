ABRgXNwdOX_JyqChNr8IYw Been here a few times and ordered dozens of dishes. None of them were disappointing. Everything was well made and packed with flavour. Price is very reasonable and you get pretty big portions. You can't go wrong with the food here! The place is smaller than expected and there might be a bit of a wait but it is definitely worth it. Servers are friendly and attentive. Definitely recommended. Cash only.
