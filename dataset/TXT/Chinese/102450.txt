kHZeGxR7zkW0T5Nym0NjCA I ordered take out, so this review won't include customer service, etc. My coworker and I ordered orange chicken, fried rice, egg drop soup and crab puffs. Every single thing was completely disappointing. The orange chicken had a thick marmalade texture and did not taste very good. The fried rice was just what the name is--fried rice. There weren't onions, scrambled eggs, peas or carrots. I would have been better off ordering white rice; pretty much the same thing. The egg drop soup was not very good either. And the crab puffs hardly had any filling. I was really craving Chinese food at the time and I was so disappointed when I took those first bites. I won't be trying this place again.
