Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA Being a huge fan of Thai cuisine I was looking forward to trying Thai Style Noodle house. 

I unfortunately was not impressed at all. My order consisted of chicken satay, crab Rangoon and pad Thai chicken spicy. 

The chicken satay was made of chicken that had the texture of cardboard and was bland. The peanut sauce didn't do the satay any favors either. The crab Rangoon was ok, nothing special about it nor can I say it wasn't good. The sweat and sour sauce that came with it was watery. The main dish, the pad Thai chicken was mediocre. There is a distinct difference in pad Thai from a Chinese restaurant and pad Thai noodles from an authentic Thai restaurant, these favored Chinese, which was very disappointing. The spicy was rather weak and the chicken in the dish also had a cardboard taste.

Unfortunately, I would not return nor recommend this restaurant. On a positive, the host and server was very friendly!
