8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ A bit pricier than other regular dim sum places, but you get traditional dim sum dishes with some twists to them. So if you prefer classic dim sum dishes, I wouldn't recommend this place. 

Nice ambience, very crowded on weekends (expect a huge lineup), OK service, nice tea (you open the package at the table on your own)
All the dishes we tried were solid, but we especially enjoyed fried dough wrapped with rice roll. They sprinkled some bonito flakes on top which was a nice touch. Their deep-fried taro dim sum had a hard-boiled quail egg in the centre. 

Overall, if you want to experience dim sum with some twists at a nicer place, this place will do. It still is not so pricey because our bill was about $27 (six dishes for two). We usually pay about $22 at other places for dim sum.
