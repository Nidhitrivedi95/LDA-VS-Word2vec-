3Ru1_F8GoUcV-QwhX378hA Went here the other day as a co-worker suggested it... got the shrimp and veggie with fried rice...... ehhh... the rice was super dry  and the shrimp and veggies had no flavor! I will say...a little disappointed. Well guess i will venture on to another spot and try it...  EEAY (Explore Eat And Yelp!)
