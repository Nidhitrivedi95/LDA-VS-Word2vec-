fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA It's been tough to find a place with good soup dumplings and dtf has been my favourite to go back so far. There's a whisper that it is not an original dtf franchise but I still think they do a good job nonetheless!   This place is packed. Because first Markham place is always packed, parking is a little hard to find. Their hot and sour soup is OK... I liked their broccoli egg white scallop dish. More egg and scallop and less broccoli made it awesome.
