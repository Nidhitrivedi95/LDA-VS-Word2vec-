They were the landmark that spawned the rest of the Chinatown neighborhood, which made this place a bit old.  The cars can get a little crazy in the parking lot, and me being Asian did not add to the solution, which I recall one time speeding into a spot at 40~ mph here.

On the very south, they got a Chinese medicine store with dried seafood, and a Ranch 99 grocery store next to it.  The middle section has a mixture of stores and restaurants, places that sells boba tea and restaurants with mixed reviews.  North side has one yucky dim sum restaurant on the outside and an indoor area with many small stores including bookstore, bakeries, more boba teashop, and a cafeteria style restaurant in the center.  I think they also have a fishy looking massage upstairs...

Chinatown Plaza can be a great place to shop for Chinese culture items with the exception of Chinese food, since most the restaurants here are "meh" at best.  Other than that, they do make a decent touristy site.
