joMyW9KcBEsHJxQuAMulaQ Great little place in Toronto if you're looking for a night of fun with friends!
One of the walls is lined with board games that you are invited to play at your table. There is an excellent selection, with some classics alongside some newer board games I hadn't heard of.
The food was great, drinks were good, and the staff was amazingly accommodating. If you're looking for a fun time with some friends, you have to try Roll Play!
