D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA Average dim sum and terrible wonton noodles. At 2am, the steamed pork ribs and siew mai are pretty good. Definitely avoid the noodles. I wouldn't eat here in the day but it's a good late night grub spot. 

Service is slow. Some servers are friendly while some are grouchy. It's hit or miss.

I would eat here again at 2am.
