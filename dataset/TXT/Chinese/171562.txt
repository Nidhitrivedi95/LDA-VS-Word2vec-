vYzcDDVv4MqPOt46rl2kYg Tasty Joes just reopened after being closed for a year with new ownership and great tasting food. We have tried the orange peel chicken and Mongolian beef which has a hint of spice and a few other dishes at different times. The portions a a good size, let's say enough for at least 3-4 people. You won't be disappointed. A lot of people do take out also. :)
