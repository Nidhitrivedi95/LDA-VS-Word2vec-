vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Went there following the las vegas half marathon. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the place is listed as a dim sum place. At 10 pm on a sunday night, they operate only as a chinese restaurant. There were noodles and fried rice but no carts.

The shanghai noodles were delicious. I had just finished the half marathon, so everything tasted even better. I also had a plate of the chinese sausage fried rice. It was so good. SO good.

I'd go again to try the dim sum. But, for a late night fried rice snack, this is the place!!
