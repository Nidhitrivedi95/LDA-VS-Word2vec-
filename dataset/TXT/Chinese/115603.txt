N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ Yes it's good quality and tasty food.  It's a nice place inside with an energetic, casual vibe.  
However, I'm by no means a glutton but I thought the portions were extremely small for the prices, and $8 pre tax pints is ridiculous and so typical (not just here) for  trendy Toronto spots.   This city's famous for it though so it's not just Patois.  Beers in decent London or NYC spots are more reasonable.
