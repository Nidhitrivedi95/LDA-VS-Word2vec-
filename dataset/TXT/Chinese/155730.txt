Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w Certainly the best Asian food I've had in the Cleveland area, but I've mainly been frequenting the "All You Can Eat Heart Exploder" places. Seriously, this place has the largest and most expansive menu that I've seen outside of San Francisco. 

I went there on a Sunday afternoon during the brunch rush but still had no problem getting a table quickly. Service was good, but the first sign that things were going to get wacky was when one of my friends was served a bowl of wonton soup about twice the size of her head. The serving sizes only got bigger from there. The crazy portions of garlic chicken lo mein and random fried rice we all shared were miles away from your normal sodium-soaked strip-mall fare.
