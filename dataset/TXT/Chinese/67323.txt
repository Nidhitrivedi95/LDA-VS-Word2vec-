EMh5InDTEfGGCowRy_pJZA Really 3.5 stars.  Came here for a late night dinner (read after 10pm), 50% full and was seated at a front both which is OK with me.  Was asked what broth ib wanted and that the 15.95 price includes a few of the small snack  dishes, everything else was to be marked off ourselves.  The soup base came promptly along with a flask of plum juice.  Took our order for v snacks v and also the order sheet.  The food came quickly and everything was very fresh.  I really liked the freshness of the vegi's and the fresh home made dumplings.  The beef was top notch and nothing bad to be said.  They do have quite the selection of items and for what we ordered, no complaints.  If you are one that requires an egg to accompany your dipping sauce, you need to ask them.
For the price and variety, I will be back.
