S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ The place smelled fishy when we first walked it.  Curious about why this was the busiest restaurant in the strip mall we decided to eat here and ignore the smell. It took a ridiculously long time for our waitress to bring us water and take our order. 
We ordered the house special appetizer, one seafood soup and some fun chow noodle with pork. The appetizer came 40 minutes later when we were about to leave. It looked really good, but we had cancelled and send it back. I don't know if it really takes 40 minutes to make or if they were just making excuses for it being so late. If it does take 40 minutes to make then it shouldn't be an appetizer and it shouldn't be on the menu. The soup I had was good but I wish our waitresses asked me the type of noodles I wanted because I would have preferred the egg noodles. The chow fan noodles with pork  was really good. They have so many dishes to choose from it is a bit overwhelming. I would go back and give them another try. I think we just caught them on a super busy night. The waitstaff was friendly.
