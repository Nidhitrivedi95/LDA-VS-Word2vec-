uTlDVK8-7VwpLhHnCRTCLg The last time I went here it was the old Bamboo House restaurant and we weren't fans but on a white we stopped today for lunch seeing it said New Bamboo hoping it improved. It has!

We had the lunch special which includes a cup of egg flower/egg drop soup and the entree has a cream cheese wonton, an egg roll, and fried rice. The portions were large and the food was good. We tried the orange chicken and the sweet and sour chicken and enjoyed our meals. Actually, the egg rolls were very good.

The service was good but since there was only one other table I would expect it to be.
