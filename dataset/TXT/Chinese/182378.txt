XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA Had crab legs on my mind for two days as I couldn't make it here the night before to check it out. Being a bit later than usual (walked in around 830p) a buffet like this may have been the only thing that could properly stave off my hunger. The place was fairly jam packed this Friday night, and a decent portion were of Asian descent (good sign).

  A previous Yelp raised suspicions on whether this place would even deliver on the legs once it got late, and a few people waiting by the empty station had me worried a little at first... until a cook came through those doors wielding a big pot full of bright red steamy shells. Even being of the first pair of people to load my plate I saw how quickly the whole lot can disappear...It was gone within two minutes! I skipped the skimpy little plastic cups and grabbed a soup bowl to fill with buttery business.

  Trip report: 
- 3 plate-loads of crab legs
- Loaded shrimp/scallop stir fry (mixed in with my last batch of crab meat.. yumm)
- Sushi: This is up to your ability to discern old from new - they DO seem to leave rolls sitting there but they are constantly making new ones (to order!)
- Steam bar: Savory sui-mai, pork buns, and some sweet donut-tasting hot pastries, etc..
- Steamed mussels on ice
- Roasted duck - maybe 5-spice seasoning? Tasted good (note: no knives supplied to cut meat from bone!)
- Steamed/grilled sole fillets and (dry) baked salmon

  All in all, its fairly standard Asian buffet fare unless you consider the snow crab to be enough to justify the upcharge from the average $10-12 to $18 per adult. Until I find a better price this will remain my go-to spot for bottomless snow crab.. Though for around this price there are better buffets (See Wandering Horse Buffet in Scottsdale)
