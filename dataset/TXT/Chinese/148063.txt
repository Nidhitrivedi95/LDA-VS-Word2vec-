sePTDv1dGHPID7kwuNzXaA We've been wanting to come back here ever since we were in the area 2 years ago! We got here around 10 right after it opened so that we didn't have to wait on line. We ordered the sticky rice, fried sesame ball, fried fritter in rice noodle rolls, fish shu mai, and dried shrimp rice noodle rolls. The fried sesame ball was different than what I was used to. It didn't have the red bean fillings. It was pretty good, though. Everything was delicious and we love the fact that everything was freshly made. We were happy the rice noodle guy was still working there when we got there. Will definitely return when we go back to Toronto! I'm missing this place already!
