eI1ZHGOr2Pus842KrZD5ZQ My family and I came here to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday. Casa Imperial was the perfect choice. It is a very elegant restaurant inside a beautiful Victorian mansion. I was pleasantly surprised as I took a step inside...

My brother made a reservation during the week and we were given a table upstairs. With my grandpa a couple steps behind, I quickly noticed the number of stairs inside the restaurant. It is not really senior-friendly, especially with the washrooms located in the basement level (there was a strong odour there too). There is a dining area on the main floor but there was an oddly quiet wedding party going on.

The ambiance, full service and table setting truly made it a fine dining experience. The only problem I had was the children running around. I was surprised the parents let them and the manager never said a word to them.

My brother called in ahead of time and they prepared a set dinner for us. It included the following:

- Barbecue suckling pig with jellyfish (The skin was crispy and the meat was not too salty)
- Sautéed scallops and prawn with salted egg yolk in a crispy nest (All of us enjoyed the deep-fried prawn because the batter had salted egg yolk and we have never tried anything like it. It reminded us of moon cake with egg yolk! Yum...)
- Braised shark fin soup with fresh crab meat (Sorry but we did have shark fin soup. The shark fin pieces were surprisingly long and thick, and the soup was tasty, not fishy at all)
- Braised whole abalone with vegetable (I found the sauce to be a bit too salty but the abalone was nicely cooked)
- Deep-fried crispy squabs (These were very flavourful, moist and tender)
- Sautéed snow pea leaves with assorted mushrooms (Nothing special but we love mushrooms)
- Poached lobster with supreme stock (We usually don't order lobster but this was pretty tasty - it must have been the "supreme" stock ;) - and the lobster was cooked perfectly)
- Steamed green bass (We also love steamed fish, so as long as it is fresh and does not taste fishy, we'll take it!)
- Braised e-fu noodles (E-fu noodle is our favourite kind of noodles. It was a nice, light ending before desserts)

Especially for a milestone birthday, ordering Chinese birthday buns (<U+58FD><U+5305>) is a must! The buns were not the prettiest but they were soft and the lotus paste filling was not too sweet. The egg yolk inside each bun really made it seem like we were eating mooncakes except it was bread.

Overall, it was a fairly grand experience. I loved the decor inside and out, the food was mostly good, and the service is decent. I did not pay the bill but I know it was pricey. But it's nice to splurge a little and enjoy an amazing meal for someone's milestone birthday!
