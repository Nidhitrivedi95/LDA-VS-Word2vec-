ssksLNNDZZfh_ydI78kDfg We had a craving for some authentic szechuan cuisine, we wanted spicy spicy spicy.  This is where we ended up and man were we happy.  We knew we had to get the spicy boiled fish because that is always my favorite, but we also got a spicy chicken dish that was "dry" and just tossed with a ton of chiles and szechuan noodles.  Of course the fish was fantastic and obviously my favorite, but everything was great.  I loved the chicken, very spicy in that way that only szechuan peppercorns can be spicy, and very crispy and crunchy. It was like the best chicken poppers ever :)  The atmosphere is what you would expect and you get free hot tea, they do serve beers but not much else in terms of liquor.  I had a milk tea that was delicious and we walked out happy, stuffed, and not too much poorer.  I will be back soon!
