e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg I didn't exactly come in with high expectations but I was interested in some of their summerlicious menu items so I decided to book a dinner during that time. 

To start off, the decor inside was quite rustic, giving me a feeling of a redone old warehouse feel. They have an open concept kitchen and bar along one side of the restaurant. One of the downsides for me was that we were seated in front of the bar area where the seating was sofas with a low table. I found this to be super awkward to eat at. 

We ordered from the summerlicious menu: potstickers & beef satay to start, beef curry & torched salmon for our mains and the panna cotta and chocolate brownie for dessert. For the starters, we thought they were well seasoned and presented but it was nothing too special. When the mains came, I thought the beef curry was a little awkward to eat as it was tender beef served in ample curry sauce with uncut rice cakes. When I ordered the curry, we expected it to be traditional curry where they would either serve bread or rice with it. Since we didn't want to waste any of the curry sauce, we asked for an order of rice on the side but all they had was coconut rice. 

My favourite of the night was the chocolate brownie with ginger ice cream and blueberry compote. There was a nice balance between the refreshing ginger ice cream and rich warm brownie. Mmmm
