46LhKfz6MPaLYoS0jegsdw Ordered family style which started off with a little something from the restaurant - Deep Fried Won Ton which you generally see with egg drop soup.
Our order were for appetizers, the Pot Stickers which in an order came with 8 good size jewels. They were good size pan fried nicely with a dipping sauce.
We ordered family style and had the Singapore Noodles, Orange Chicken, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Mongolian Beef and Half Duck. Would recommend the Singapore Noodles, which had shrimp, beef and chicken in a thin Noodle which was very tasty, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, which was probably the best dish as the Shrimp were medium size, shelled and a light crisp sauce applied mixed in a chopped array of vegetables of a stir fried blend. The Orange Chicken was also a nicely prepared dish with a generous serving.

The Mongolian Beef was flavorful but was okay and as for the Duck, once you have had the traditional roast duck, you don't want it prepared any other way and it came pan fried or something other than the traditional way and was more bone than meat.

Overall it seemed as though this restaurant may better serve the Buffet style crowd during lunch time rather than the old traditional Chinese people looking for old style Cantonese food.

I will say again, the Pot Stickers, Singapore Noodles and the Salt and Pepper Shrimp was something I would recommend you try.

Honestly not my first choice for Traditional Chinese Food, but will keep them in mind.
