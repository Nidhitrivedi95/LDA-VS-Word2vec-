This is my first time dining at this place. I love all the dishes that I ordered. I ordered fish fillet with silk tofu and shredded pork with seasoning tofu..
I really love the fish fillet with silky tofu dish. The fish is so tender and full of flavor...This dish is usually really salty.but the chef here made it just right..the tofu is really silky and has great flavor ..I have ordered many fish fillet with silky tofu dish at different Sichuan restaurants and I would say that this is one of the best fish fillet with silky tofu dish I have ever tried. 
The shredded pork with seasoning tofu is great as well..but personally i think it is a little bit too oily..but overall is great

Both dishes are relatively big portions ..we could not finish both dishes for 2 people..

The service is prompted..they served 2 dishes within 10 minutes from the time we ordered..

I would recommend this authentic Chinese restaurant in this city.
