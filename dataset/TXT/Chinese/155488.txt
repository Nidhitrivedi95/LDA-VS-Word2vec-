TkXbFJtFCdM_WTLkHa6Erw I normally don't give bad reviews after only one visit to a location but this was unacceptable... first of all, it was 7pm on a Friday, and have the entrée were old and/or running low... we waited 15 minutes after paying for them to complete our order. When I opened my to-go container and began eating,  the first thing I noticed was that the quantities were much smaller than normal...'next I noticed  my vegetables were undercooked and most likely expired.  The beef was chewy.  

Bottom line... don't go to this Panda Express. There's many others within a few miles.
