_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg One word: GREASY. The meat and vegetable dishes are so soaked in oil that you can't even taste the food anymore. Sushi is crap, and nothing on the buffet line seemed freshly made. I guess for 10.59 you get what you pay for. Better off buying a good piece of steak and cooking it at home. The only thing I enjoyed eating was fresh fruit and dessert
