bsjBLLHR4TMVR5eAeLAI9w Excellent Authentic Chinese food.    I took some friends and we all shared the following:   EIght treasures Clay Pot, Fish with baby Bok Choy, Steak with Peppered marinate and Ginger and Scallion Steamed chicken.  

All items were prepared very well.   The service was prompt and attentive.   This could be a problem sometimes when the lounge is fully occupied, but our waiter was very good.     They also serve Americanized Chinese, but the Dim Sum and the Authentic Chinese dishes are WNNERS..
