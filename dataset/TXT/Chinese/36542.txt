AKMvsVr_9meoSmawkEBe4g I love this place, it's AMAZING for delivery, late at night and always consistent quality.  One of the ONLY places I miss in Mississauga since I moved in March!!!

I always delivery order the Cantonese Chow Mein, 2 different kinds of fried rice, Cantonese Sweet and Sour Pork (Yippeeee, it's boneless!!!), Spring rolls, plus extra sweet and sour sauce (for the rice of course!!).  

They are very generous with the toppings for the Chow Mein, and the Cantonese pork is always great.  Really great reheated too!  

If you want great Chinese delivery in Mississauga, consistent, quality, AND open VERY late, call them!!!!!

Hey Phoenix, open a NEW location in Etobicoke soon PLEASE!!!  I miss you.
