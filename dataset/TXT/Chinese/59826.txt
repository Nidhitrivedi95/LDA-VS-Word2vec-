Dl-hhPCjRJM221XSwiuTbg Never! Never! And never come here again.  Come here on Easter Sunday group of 8 people at 7pm, not busy at all, half restaurant empty, was very surprise cause used to be a long wait at this restaurant.  When we sat down ate we realized why the not like busy like before.  Everything we ordered they cut our order just brought out half, Tom yum were crazy salty, event to others soup.  We order juice brought it out to the table very quick but when we asked to refill water 4 or 5 times they pretend they busy not let us have water cause water can make you eat more.  I didn't believe be cause the service were bad, I knew that the owner want them to service the customer like this all you paid but can  not eat more.  Even dessert we ask for 8 pieces each but end up only brought out 4 pieces each order.  Never ever come here again. Never
