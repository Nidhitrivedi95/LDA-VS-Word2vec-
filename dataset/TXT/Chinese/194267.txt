ZEITJ0inX8sR5temoACElA Been coming here for 2 years now and Perry sure cures what ails ya!  I first saw him when I was in debilitating back pain on way home from ER where they did NOTHING! I had to use a walker to get into Perry's treatment room and was carrying it when I left!!!  I was pain free!  I followed up a couple more times and was right as reign!  He has performed his miracles on me several test for headaches, colds, allergies and other body aches/pains.  I HIGHLY recommend him and when you come in...tell him Joe from Yelp sent ya!
