ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg If I can give this place negative stars I would. They don't even deserve this one star. But oh well. 

To start off this place is nice, but the service is SHIT. Second the server named Elisa was extremely bitchy. I don't know what crawled up her ass that day but once we confronted her and her manager to apologize to us.. the manager didn't handle the situation well...! This place is overrated. 
This place is a DUMP in terms of "service" for las vegas. 

I'm saving you TIME please go to another restaurant.
