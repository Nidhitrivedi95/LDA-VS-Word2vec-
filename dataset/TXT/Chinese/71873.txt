FcYAwxuOys7NtnUPhRkA_Q Visited this place for a quick lunch. BIG MISTAKE!!
Haven't been here in some time but suspect it may be under new ownership. The place is filthy and the manager???? thought it was funny that there were bugs in my water and on the lemons commenting that I was " getting extra protein " from them. I have since learned from a person that works in the courthouse downtown that  in the past this place was shut down by the board of health!! YUK !! Apparently it was closed and board of health stickers were placed on the door. Sure wish I knew that before eating there. I will occasionally give a restaurant a second chance for food or service issues but not on health issues. STAY AWAY !!!!
