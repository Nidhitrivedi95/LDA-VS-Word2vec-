bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Loved this Place!   Had read the reviews, but just tried it for the first time. The service was excellent, very attentive.  We tried a variety of menu items:  Crab Angels, Chicken Egg Rolls, Orange Chicken and the Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles.   All the food was very good.
We were also there on a Thursday, Piano Night !  Entertainment was fun and the crowd seemed to really enjoy it.  The crowd was mixed; families, couples  - younger and older !
We'll be Back !
