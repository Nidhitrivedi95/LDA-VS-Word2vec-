Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ We were driving down the street the other night and saw this beautiful building with a lot of cars in the parking lot. So we stopped and grabbed a bite. The dining area is very large, I was quite surprised. They do Dim Sum all day, which is awesome. The ladies who go around to the tables know what is in each of the dishes too. That's unusual for some of the places I've been. 
We ordered egg rolls, shrimp in lobster sauce, sweet & sour chicken & chicken fried rice. The egg rolls were good, nothing to write home about which is sometimes a good thing. The shrimp in lobster sauce was a little more soupy than we expected, but it was a new dish to us so it was worth a try. The sweet & sour chicken, though, was AMAZING. I have NEVER had such tender chicken in my life. I seriously asked the waiter if this was really chicken. He laughed & said yes. I was completely blown away by how delicious this dish was. For that matter alone, I would go and will go back again. 

Great service, amazing sweet & sour chicken & Dim Sum all day! Plus it's 5 minutes it from my house. Gets a good review in my book!
