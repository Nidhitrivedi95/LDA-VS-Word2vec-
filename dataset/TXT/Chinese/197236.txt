zQlaDJqp3c_HAuYP5Ukk3w We ordered chicken Lettuce wrap for a meal and needed little more lettuce.
So I asked to bring more , was told they don't give out free extra lettuce.
I said ok just bring some we'll pay.
We got about 5 tiny lettuce leaves and they charged 2 dollars for that.
I talked to the owner that charge was too much.
She completely ignored me and walk away.......
