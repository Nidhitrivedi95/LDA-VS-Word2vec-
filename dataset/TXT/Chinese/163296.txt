UpXigk3SzQR9v4xct_xEVQ Went there on a Thursday for lunch at 12pm, it was very busy and almost half of their hot food trays were empty. I can understand that it was busy, but they left those trays empty for a while, maybe for 20 min or even more. By the time I saw some of my favorite dishes, I was already full.
