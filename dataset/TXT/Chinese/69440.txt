eZQbDYQTZk0_cBroVxnPWg Decent spot for Chinese delivery. Our delivery options downtown are limited and believe it or not, pizza every day does get tiring. Delivery is usually pretty fast and the food is better than most chinese take out in the area, especially for the price.

Here's what I've had
Orange chicken - pretty good. I ask them to make it spicy
Sundevil pork- meh
Lettuce Wraps - worth it and cheap
Hot and Sour soup - standard
Pepper Beef - pretty good, sauce is flavorful
Tofu lo mein - I ask for it spicy and it's delicious!
Crab puffs - standard
Eggroll - standard
