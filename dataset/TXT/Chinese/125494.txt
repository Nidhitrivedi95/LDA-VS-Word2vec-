OXyPh_Jm159lwMlebtDeeg Service here is like no other restaurant in our area.  It's simply the best.  

Food is excellent.  Seems to be authentic Chinese food to me when compared with something like P.F. Changs or other Americanized Chinese restaurants.

We most recently visited on Christmas day for lunch with the family because NOBODY else was open and our major extended family gathering was set to be at supper time.  What were we to do for lunch.

Jade Palace to the rescue.  Though we did not have reservations, we were seated right away.  Orders were taken promptly and we did not wait long for our food to arrive at our table.  It was a happy day.  

Prior to our Christmas day visit, my husband and I have been there many times, ordered to go from there many times, and had taken my immediate family there once as well.  We will continue to dine @ Jade Palace regularly.  Thank you for always providing a fantastic dining experience.  No complaints - ever!
