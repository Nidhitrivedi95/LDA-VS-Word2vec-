YTfXZ9tbTBJkWsDI7cMDWQ Service when I went last week was bad. Came in on a Sunday afternoon. It was empty yet they sat me in the back, barely paid attention to me. I had to get up to ask for a menu. The two sets of other customers were sat in the front, they were serviced pretty quickly. There were a good amount of items on the menu they were out of. The food was okay. I ordered dan dan noodles and whatever dumpling they had available. I also ordered the beef roll and another dumpling to go. Beef roll was great but they didn't pack any condiments with my food to go.
