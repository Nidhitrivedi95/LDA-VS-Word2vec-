AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw I placed a couple to go orders and found out that they had a new special price on their free crab puffs.   Instead of being $15 as advertised on their old menu, it's now $20 on their new menu.

The manager was extremely cool and still offered the $15 price since it appeared on their online menu.   

Happy customer, happy tummies.  Next time I want to dine in.  LIke others have said, the ambiance is kind of retro California surf.  Great vibe.

Keep up the great work!
