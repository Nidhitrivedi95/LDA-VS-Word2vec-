xk4QOTqQHb8FQjge04x_tw I thought that the food stalls might be closed on Saturdays but of course not the stores are open for business all week.

A popular place for workers during the week but I was nearby and was hungry.

I had their BBQ pork dish and it was moist and juicy with a ice crispy skin.

Simply chopped with a sharp cleaver and served over rice and bok choy.

I filled the little paper cups with hot garlic sauce and siracha to dip the pork in.

They offer a ton of dishes and look at the photos and wait 5 minutes for your order.

The staff was busy filling up catering trays with food so it looks like Saturday they tend to a bunch of parties.
