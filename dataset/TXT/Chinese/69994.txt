F1vdFYr7P4Xb3uAQ2AYgzQ Very very pleasantly surprised!  I've driven by this place literally hundreds of times on McKnight Rd. and always thought to myself "self, we should try that place sometime."  I finally did. Me and my husband went for dinner on Christmas Day and it was awesome. I'm not really sure what I was expecting, but it surpassed whatever expectation I had in my head. People were really nice who worked there, very nice inside. We got pork dumplings as an appetizer and they were really, really good. For an entree, I had the Amazing Chicken which is what I get every time I go to another Chinese place nearby and I gotta say, I was impressed. It provided worthy competition to the other place. Cheaper, too. Always nice. Recommend!
