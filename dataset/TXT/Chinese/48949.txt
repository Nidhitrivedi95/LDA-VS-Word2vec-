CbsS6VvPsIvpytUbLAu71Q Came here for my son's 8th birthday dinner (  per his request ) this place has gone way down hill.  Ripped seats through out all repaired with grey duct tape.  Greasy, nasty, slippery floors from the front of the house to the back.  Only half of the food selections from the past visits.  I literally lost my appetite while looking around.  On the up side the staff was friendly as usual but with that said NEVER coming back.
