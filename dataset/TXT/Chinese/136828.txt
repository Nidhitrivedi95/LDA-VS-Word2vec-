qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A I don't know what's up with this location, but every time I visit, I feel like the quality of the food and service gets worse.

We went today for lunch because I was craving my beloved lettuce wraps.  When they arrived, I was just kind of bored with the flavor of them - it was like they were hardly seasoned.  I also ordered a cup of the wonton soup, and the wontons were slimy and overcooked.  I tried to eat it, but I had to send it back... it was a no-go.  However, worst of all was my fiancé's sweet and sour chicken.  I don't know what happened this time (we've ordered it before and know what it usually tastes like), but it was like someone dumped a shaker of thyme in the sauce.  It was so strong that I took one bite and my mouth STILL tastes gritty.  My poor sweetie just kinda sat there and sadly stared at his plate.  

I really don't think we'll be back.  Grand China in Henderson is far superior and is very close to our house.  I don't really see why I would return to a restaurant where I pay so much and get so little in return.  Not a fan.
