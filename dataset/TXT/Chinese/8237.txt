1Cylq9rdQ0JUgXsvvGtDBA I've been here a few times for dim sum more so for its convenience than food since it's in Pacific Mall. 
The last time I went here was probably the most "meh" experience. The dim sum here is usually okay but there were a couple stand outs (for not so good reasons) this time. The "steamed rice noodle with fresh dough wrap" wasn't fresh at all. The dough fritters were very hard so it was probably re-fried. My family didn't even finish the one plate we ordered. 
I also found their dumpling wraps very sticky so when you picked one up, the skin would tear and the filling would fall out. 
One interesting dish that I actually liked was the green tea pancake (picture uploaded).  It's not really a pancake, it's more so a dough ball stuffed with a green tea filling. It was pretty good as it wasn't too sweet and I liked the doughy texture of the 'pancake'.  
Service is sufficient...but take that with a grain of salt as I have lower standards for Chinese places.
