r9x6Pvgh7SH7TInybHtl0A On Friday I came to Oriental Express to have lunch, thinking it was just another normal fast Chinese joint. I was surprised to find plastered on their windows:  (which reads Chung-Hwa Roo - Chinese Food) ... Korean people! So I thought that I might be able to find some good Korean fare. Which I did, in part.

First, the restaurant itself was very clean, very organized. There were two very nice Korean ladies at the counter. One was apparently responsible for the sushi bar, and another was taking food orders. I was disappointed to find the amount of Korean fare very limited. The menu was chock full of the typical chinese dishes: rice plus meat plus sauce. On the specials board I did see the all important  (Bulkogi - Korean BBQ beef) - which I did order to go (due to the short lunch break at work). They did produce the dish very quickly (within 5 minutes or so) 

So, the quality of the Bulkogi was a C. It was good, bona fide Bulkogi. It tasted pretty good. But it was average, nothing special. The rice was done well. I did admire their packaging though. They made a little aluminum foil bowl for the bulkogi itself so it didn't bleed into the rice (a very Korean and Japanese thing to do).

The overall grade is a C. 

Breakdown:
Food -      C            (See above) 
Service -  B            Service was good and efficient. The ladies 
                               behind the counter were very nice. 

Demerits:  Average, typical "Chinese" menu, no real Korean food other than the Bulgogi.
