XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw For being the self-proclaimed dumpling king, I would have expected way more dumplings.  We had the juicy beef dumplings, no pork option.  Salty meat and thicker skin than I prefer.  The string beans were money though.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had the onion pancake but did not like them too much because they were too bready and not as greasy and flaky as I am used to.  Everything here is freshly cooked to order.  

The whole time I was here they played Calvin Harris "Blame" on repeat.  That was the worst part.
