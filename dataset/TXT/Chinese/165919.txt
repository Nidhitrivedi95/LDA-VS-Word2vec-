vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw I have some go-to spots when I am in town off the strip.  Food Express Chinese Restaurant is one of them.  Be sure to ask for John when you're here, you're guaranteed a good time here with John.

The food is great.  I come from SoCal/SGV so I am picky when it comes to Chinese food and this place does not disappoint.  I've tried many different dishes here and I can safely say you'll be happy with whatever you get.

I highly recommend this place to anybody who wants great food and great service.  It's located in a strip mall, easy to find with a lit up sign.  

The food is fresh and has a great portion size, three plates would easily be enough for three people.  Priced very reasonably as well.

Do come here!
