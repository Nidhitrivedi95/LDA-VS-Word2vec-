eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ Whenever I visit Madison this is the one place I must go to every time, if not twice! The ambiance is nice and relaxing, was able to get a patio spot last time which was very nice. Patio is a nice size and is great on a nice day. The service has been great all times I've been, very polite, attentive and timely. The food never lets me down, dumplings are great and come with a couple diff dipping sauces, all the ramens are good but my fav is the tonkotsu. The pork buns are interesting, veering away from the normal bun style and is more like a wrap or taco. They added a few new types as well which haven't tried yet. Only complaint so far is that they replaced the apple walnut frisee salad!
