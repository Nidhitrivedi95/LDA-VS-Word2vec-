_ONkRPvpIYdCuj9u6cIPeA Today I came here with my friends for dim sum and we were very disappointed. First of all they charged us $0.60 per person for tea ..... and all of y'all that eat dim sum regularly know that that's a giant red flag. I honestly think that's such a cheap tactic to get more money from their customers, I mean what's next??? Am I going to have to pay a rental fee for using chopsticks too???

As for the food, all of the dim sum items were very low quality. They were either stale, hard, or had a weird texture/consistency like they were leftovers that had been reheated. Perhaps it's because we went in on a weekday but that's still unacceptable. I'd be better off ordering dimsum at a grocery store tbh

Also when we ordered deep fried shrimp wontons, they served us mayo with it that was crusting and dried up around the sides like it was old .... gross. Plus the fried dough in the zhaliang (<U+70B8><U+5169>) was very tough and stale so I'm almost certain that it was a leftover that was refried.

TLDR; LOW QUALITY DIM SUM. DON'T COME HERE UNLESS YOU'RE DESPERATE.
