X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Absolutely the worst club in vegas! I wish I could give it negative stars. First off, the wait was incredibly long and strenuous. My group and I got in through a promoter who had a comped table. But the Hakassan people overbooked tables that night, so we ended up not getting a table after an hour wait. Once inside, I felt as if there was nothing special about the club. The dance floor was too crowded for life. You were constantly being pushed against another person and tiesto had not even come on yet. In fact, I left before Tiesto came on because it was too crowded, the drinks were not good and too expensive ($18 for a vodka red bull), and it just really didn't seem worth it in the end. Lastly, like every other review mentioned, there are way too many stairs. I thought Marquee was bad. I definitely will not come back to this club in the future. It is way overpriced, overhyped, and not worth the money. I think I'll stick to XS or Marquee next time
