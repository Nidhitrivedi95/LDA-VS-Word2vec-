K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw The prices are good, the food is authentic and the portions are big.

The laksa is flavourful and quite spicy (even when we ordered as mild as possible). 

I liked the durian shake because I could taste the durian. This is definitely not for everyone.

Only a few seats available so it's best to get it to go. 

Call and order ahead because there is usually a wait, especially around lunch time.
