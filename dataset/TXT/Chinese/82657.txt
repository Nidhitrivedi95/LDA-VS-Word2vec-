HAzqPzwxiSu2-XhJkz8ntQ This place was ok, I'd give the Shanghai noodles 4 stars, but the other dishes weren't that great and the price was steep.

For 4 of us for lunch, it cost us $50. Usually for lunch at a chinese restaurant, 4 people can dine for $20-30. So I wouldn't say it was worth the cost, but wouldn't be opposed to coming here again if the prices dropped by 10-15%.
