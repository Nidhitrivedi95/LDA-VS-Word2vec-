qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA I'm going to stop going to these restaurants since the company must be training their servers to make the guest wait as long as possible before approaching the table.  ITS RIDICULOUS that we have to wait more than 15 minutes now for someone to take our drink orders while  watching servers chat it up with the hostess and the manager. I'm typing this review STILL waiting for a server! This has been a problem at 3 of the the PF Changs I've been to recently and 2 of them were in Scottsdale. THIS IS A PROBLEM MANAGEMENT SO FIX IT.
