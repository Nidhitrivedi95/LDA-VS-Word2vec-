6qkNhpgMYE6y3eHurFq6yw Currently eating some of the best Canadian-Chinese delivery I've had in a long time. Yes this place looks sketchy on the outside but every thing is fresh tasting and hot. the delivery was quick and the delivery guy was polite. The spring rolls are HUGE and the wonton soup has bug pieces of pork in it. This is my new Chinese place!
