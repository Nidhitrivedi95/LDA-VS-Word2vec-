9q0qW2sbI147hAaUVfVUqQ Went here with my family before it opened. There was a crazy long line up during the long weekend to take advantage of the early dim sum specials for $3.  You need to place your order before 11 am on weekends.

Service was not great. Some dishes from our first order came after the ones from our second order. That does not make sense. There is lots of parking and the layout of the restaurant is very narrow with 3 floors. Food wise was average overall but great given the price.  I would not come during the regular price hours. Some dishes are not available until after 11 am.
