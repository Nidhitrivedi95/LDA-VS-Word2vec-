eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g I went there with my family of six. It is a little bit pricey but worth the food quality, service and decor. Good for a family or friend gathering.

We ordered the combo for five people, including lobster, crab, shark fin soup, steamed turbot fish(I guess), scallops and shrimp, Pea Sprout and etc. All of them are well prepared and taste excellent. The texture of the seafood is great and seasoned just right. Thanks to the freshness and perfect flavor, I really enjoy the seafood delicacy here.

Wanna try their dim sum next time.
