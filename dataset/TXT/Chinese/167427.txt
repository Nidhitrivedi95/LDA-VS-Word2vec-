VGxJbglGlx-a7Gdc55Q6jQ I have always  been a huge fan Katana to the point where I ordering from there at least once a week.  About 3 weeks ago (around noon ) I placed an order totaling forty some dollars and it took almost 2hrs to be delivered.  It was cold and tasted old.  I live 3 to 5 mins away from this restaurant.  I thought to myself things happens, i use to work in a restaurant. 
  Well last Saturday it happened again! Now I'm starting to get upset because I'm spending close to $50 every time I order, I expect my food to be on time and hot! So I'm really hoping that this will never happen again because other then those 2 bad experiences, i LOVE KATANA. I HAVE never eaten inside i always have it delivered.
