X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg On my final night for MDW 2013 we went to Hakkasan to watch Hardwell!

For this event I also bought a pre-sale ticket, that had it's own line, and it moved quite quickly.  After being escorted through what seemed like a mini-maze and a few more "check points" Hakkasan patrons are then put into an elevator where you ascend to the main dance floor.

The main floor is similar to Marquee, but just bigger.  The DJ is in the middle with the dance floor, VIP tables, and walk way circling around it.  Thankfully the night I went wasn't as crazy so we were able to get in and out of the dance floor with no problem.

There are a lot of ramps and small steps with narrow hallways so I can easily see those being a problem (choke points) when it nears capacity.

The lighting is great, the most notable are the integrate lights on the ceiling that look like veins and pulse to the music.  I'm also glad that whatever speakers Hakkasan uses didn't make my ears ring for nearly 24 hours after we left the club.

All in all, check this club out!  But also expect the typical hoops and "politics" people, mainly guys, have to deal with it when it gets busy.
