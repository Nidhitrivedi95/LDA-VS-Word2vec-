zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Celebrated my sister's bday with a summerlicious dinner at momofuku noodle bar. If I can describe my visit in one word that would be BLAND. I don't think my taste buds have changed but I tasted all three noddle dishes from my sister and girl friend and I found that they were all bland. I think the chef that night ran out of salt. The place itself was nice. Glad I didn't get the stool chairs. I hated not having something to rest my foot in front of me and my height does not really make it that easy to climb those damn stools. I always feel like I have to have a running jump just to get on. We ordered and for being a higher end than most noddle bars you would figure order of food delivery would be followed. Nope. I felt like I was in Chinatown after they served all of our dishes in random order. They didn't even ask who the dish belonged to. Just drop it on the table. The best part of my meal was probably the dessert. The panacotta didn't have the texture I expected. This was more in the gelatin side. Harder than I expected. Tasted my gf cereal and milk ice cream and that was good. It tastes like corn flakes in milk but in an ice cream. It was pretty good. However not good enough to redeem itself of the night. Not what I expected from momofuku and it is hard to justify coming back.
