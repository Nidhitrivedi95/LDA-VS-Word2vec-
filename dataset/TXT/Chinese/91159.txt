IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Lunch was actually really good.  It was at the Mandalay Bay.  I had the Hong Kong style crispy noodle with beef.  Lots of tender beef with mushrooms.  Salty base, hard to eat as soup.  The noodles were awesome and the beef very tender.  I think a few too many snow peas.   I could of had a little more beef.  Dish overall was a winner.  Staff was helpful.  Overall I recommend
