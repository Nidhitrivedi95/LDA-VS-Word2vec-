Some Chinese food places do to much breading. It was kind of a panko like crust too. Very good. I am pretty sure they make their own noodles there. I really liked them. It's a great lunch spot with their special. Be expected to pay $2 more to upgrade to the noodles. A little pricey, but I think worth it.
