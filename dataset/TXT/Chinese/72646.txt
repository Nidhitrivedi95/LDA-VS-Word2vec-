fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA After the Koffee Krawl UYE, we all huddled over to the Dumpling House Restaurant.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table, which was not bad, considering we were a group of 11-12.

For $5 a head, we had happy tummies without feeling like we overate.  Jennifer K. took charge of the ordering.  We got to taste a variety of dumplings: pork, beef, shrimp to name a few in addition to a pan-fried onion cake.

The pan-fried onion cake was too greasy for my liking.  The moment I bit into it I could taste nothing but oil.  Albeit that it was very flavourful, but extremely extremely greasy.  To iterate, when we were passing around the onion pancake, it almost slid off the plate because it was that "slick."

The steamed dumplings were very "wet" to the point where even skilled chopstick users had trouble picking them up.  Judging from its presentation, and being sans bamboo basket, I would most probably conclude that they boil as opposed to steam their dumplings - which is probably why they are so hard to pick up with chopsticks.  

The pan-fried dumplings were quite tasty, although I deduct points for only frying one side.  Laziness is a peeve of mine.  A pan-fried dumpling should be fried all around, not just on the crusty side that is presented. 

I would probably walk a bit further down the street to Mother's Dumplings for my dumpling fix.
