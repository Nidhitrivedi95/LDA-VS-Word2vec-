h0Wmyzb8q0bXbrqmWqVvfQ I have never taken the time to review a restaurant. I have been going to Dragon Towers for 20 plus years. It NEVER disappoints. The portions are generous and the food is the best I've ever had. I will drive 30 min just for take out. It is a hidden gem of West Park. The guy at the register is not rude just all business. I can appreciate that. He never gets an order wrong. Love the wonton soup, egg rolls,cashew chicken,fried rice sweet and sour chicken! SO GOOD
