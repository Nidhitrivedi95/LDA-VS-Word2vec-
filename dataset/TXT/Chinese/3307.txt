_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA My family just got to the Venetian and we were very hungry. We ordered some food, but 40mins later our family didn't get our food. People who came 20 minutes after us already left before I even got to eat. My husband argued with the manager and she said that they were out of the food my son ordered. They replaced it with some dry noodles! The food was disgusting and the service, it was horrendous. I will never come here again!
