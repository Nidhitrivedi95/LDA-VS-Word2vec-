_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg One thing you should take into consideration before going in...1.) This place is located across the street from the abandoned Festival Mall. 2.) Sit in the parking garage lot and watch the clientele that enters. Yeah. So, one the hostess was terrible and rude. Did not greet us. We walked the buffet line. Very odd dishes to say the least and disorganized in the way it was presented. I wish I could have taken pictures. Tacos next to soup next to crab legs. We sit down at a table and look up--spider webs, dust, table was terrible sticky. Think of the worst episode of kitchen nightmares and times that by 7. Food was the most store bought garbage. I've definitely had the same spring rolls in a sample station at Costco. At least those were warm. So unless your into taking risks and eating sketchy chinese/ taco/ store bought macaroons would not recommend.
