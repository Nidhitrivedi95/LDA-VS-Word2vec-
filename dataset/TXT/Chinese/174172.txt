wC-wLFVCIjXArsrMuUJdYQ Dinner entrees are not quite as cheap as other cheap Americanized Chinese places, but the quality is a little better than most.  I looked around as I walked in and saw there was some effort into decor, but I did not pay that much attention.

They have a happy family entree, but for a couple bucks more you can have it with Lobster and beef.  It was pretty good, but I'm not sure if I like the idea of eating Wang's special sauce, lol.  I also got the general Tso's twin delight.  Basically a chicken and shrimp version.  Both were above average.  The soups were all fairly priced and tasty.  No real complaints on anything other than 2 entrees, 2 soups and a crab rangoon was $37.
