uU8up3hGwW9qnzQD1HZsMQ I ordered take-out tonight. The food was good but this review for 5 stars is for amazing customer service.  I stated I'd pay cash but realized I only had a $50 bill so I call into after placing my order online so I wanted to make sure the large bill was ok. I'm unsure who I spoke to, the receipt said boss but the gentleman was very friendly over the phone. When my food got delivered, my cat Boston always runs out the door & this time was no  different.  He runs out & just plops down on the ground and rolls around. He never typically goes anywhere. Once  I was finished paying & getting my food, I stepped outside the door to grab my cat & in a blink of an eye, DODGER runs out the door (my dog). As the delivery guy is ready to walk down the stairs at my apartments my dog flies by him & takes off.  My boyfriend goes outside & I run after to try & catch our dog.  We found Dodger & what my boyfriend heard 1st was the pitter patter of steady feet hitting the pavement.  Shawn (Sean...spelling?), the delivery guy was sprinting down the road after my dog trying to catch him. When Dodger heard the squeaky toy, he immediately returned to my bf. All I can say is WOW! Thank you to this delivery guy for making such an effort to help get our dog back. He went above & beyond & acted like it was no big deal that he did what he did.
