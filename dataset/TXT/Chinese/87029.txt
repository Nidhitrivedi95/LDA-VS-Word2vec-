HQpMwOOrGND3GaRqMNV9ig I would give this place a five, but the decor is non-existent. Service is fast and staff are super friendly, but it's a lot of serve yourself (get your own tea and go up to the front to pay). 

Classic wonton noodle soup place. Wontons are delicious and quite large. Soup is super hot and noodles are real, and fresh egg noodles. Plate of veggies is small, but exactly like every other Chinese restaurant with the oyster sauce. 

They have their own special chilli sauce that they sell at the front, so I had to try it. It's super flavourful and got a strong kick at the end (if you can't do spicy, it may not be for you). 

Quick in and out kind of place. Will definitely be coming again.
