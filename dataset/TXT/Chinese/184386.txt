xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I personally love the bubble tea that Lulu makes so I'm a frequent customer. But today's trip to Lulu's was disastrous.

So I came to get 2 mango smoothie bubble tea today. It was ridiculous that I ended up waiting 40 minutes just for 2 bubble for to go. And when I received my order, it was 2 strawberry--not 2 mango.

I proceeded to tell the lady that she had my order wrong, but was told that she heard me say strawberry. Aside from the fact that mango and strawberry sounds nothing alike, she rudely insisted that I told her strawberry. I also did not appreciate the dirty attitude I was getting from her when I was trying to talk to her politely...

So after a while, it seems that my order was going to be fixed. But after waiting some more, I only received 1 mango and was given 1 strawberry despite telling her I ordered 2 mango, not 1 mango and 1 strawberry. This time, she was obviously being a b*tch asking, "so are you going to take it the drinks or not?"

Based on my past experience with other people there, I might come back. But if I do, I absolutely refuse to have her take my order  again.
