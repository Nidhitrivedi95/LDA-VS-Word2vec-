n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A I recently went to Mr. Chow with clients that have been to the Beverly Hills location.  First of all, the space is unlike any restaurant I've been to in Vegas.  The beautiful circular dining room and what appears like a chic space ship that opens up and descends then recedes back is amazing to see.  The food and the vibe was exceptional as well.  The dumplings (water and dragon), Mr. Chow noodles were to die for.  We also had the steamed sea bass that was so light but immensely flavorful, the velvet chicken with what I think was the best fried rice and great vegetables.  My clients were very happy as was I.
