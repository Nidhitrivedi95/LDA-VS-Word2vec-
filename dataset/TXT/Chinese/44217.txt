BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg Maybe I keep ordering all the wrong items here, but everything from the hot and sour soup to the fried rice to the entrees have been really inferior to all the Chinese places I've had across the country. 

The cheng-du chicken was had a weird after-taste, the hot and sour soup needs more sour, the fried rice was bland, and the salt and pepper squid was underseasoned. I think overall, the flavors here are all underwhelming. 

I very much prefer Sichuan Gourmet on Murrey.
