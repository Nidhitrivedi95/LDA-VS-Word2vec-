aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg We got the 2 meat platters, crispy pork belly and barbecue pork, both meats are really good and the platter comes with rice and vegetables. We also got chicken porridge due to my wife has a toothache, surprisingly the porridge is really good, you need to put soy sauce and a little bit of chili sauce for the kick.
The last thing we got was wonton noodle soup, I personally enjoy that the most out of all the dishes, the soup is tasty.
