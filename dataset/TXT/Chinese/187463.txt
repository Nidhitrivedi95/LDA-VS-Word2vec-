yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA This is place is so busy, it is almost like someone is giving free food.  

This place is crazy busy at 9pm in the night and the service is was super quick.  

The chicken wings, calamari, soup & pad Thai is a must to try .... FIVE STARS.  

Fried rice was not great to my taste buds, but my friends enjoyed it.
