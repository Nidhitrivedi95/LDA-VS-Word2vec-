3ot6ucvk6eG6Zgtzc2-gwg A Chinese Canadian restaurant? THAT I had to see, heh! I checked in today. Green pass from health Canada, that`s good enough for a test, and I was hungry. The place is bright and clean, lots of teens from a nearby school come by for a snack, poutine or whatever. It is run like a take out-place with some tables in the foreground. It is operated by a sort of squirrely couple, not unfriendly, but shuffling around quite a bit. They dont accept cards which is strange for a restaurant on the Danforth. Oh well.

I had the beef on rice with spicy sauce and black beans. It was a quick lunch grab and I did not expect much, but I thought it was decent. Not great but decent. The vegetables were crunchy, the beef alright and the rice fluffy. It is certainly a far cry from some greater other Chinese restaurants, but passable considering far worse places and the great value ($5.99 for a lunch main!). 

Worth a try! Bring cash though, no card machine available.
