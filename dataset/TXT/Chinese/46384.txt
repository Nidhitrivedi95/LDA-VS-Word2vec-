BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I went to the place a few days ago with a friend of mine.  It's an alright place to go for authentic dumplings.  

The wait was not long at all, the restaurant is longer than it looks from the outside.  I enjoy the fact that you can see the chefs making the food.

The dumplings were so-so to me, I wasn't wow'd by the flavour.  Perhaps I'm not so well versed in eating dumplings.  The presentation was not special at all.  I did enjoy the atmosphere, the waiting staff was very nice.

I'd come back here again, if I ever get that dumpling itch.
