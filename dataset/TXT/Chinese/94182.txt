JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A This is a second visit to this restaurant, I must say I had a lasting impression of the cham pong the first visit so I decided to put it in the list of restaurants to frequent. The food tonight 2/26/13 is just mediocre, the soups are more watery than the first time. I ordered the kimchi chigae (kimchi stew) and my boyfriend ordered the cham pong. The middle aged owner brought out only pickled daikon for my boyfriend, and pushed the banchan(side dishes) to my side of the table. That was fine, but my food came first, so I offered some of my sides to my boyfriend who was still waiting for his entree. She threw us a look of distaste.

When we finish some of the sides, I asked for a refill...and she told me "We don't do refills, it's too expensive." Fine, if  she had left it at that, I would have waived it off...but she refilled the sides of the table next to us after she told me that. I've never been to a korean restaurant where they don't refill the side dishes. And on top of that I've never been to a korean restaurant where they discriminate between asian customers and white customers in the next table.

We finished our meal, and asked for boxes for leftovers. The lady shakes her head as though we shouldn't take out our leftovers and reluctantly brings us two boxes. I've never had such poor service at a korean restaurant...and I probably won't be back for this type of treatment.
