D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA Outrageous prices for flavorless dim sum.  My ramen was overcooked and also had no flavor.  Maybe this is a kitchy place to try out for folks who have never had dim sum - but don't let this sway you from never trying it again.  Dim sum should be a great experience of trying out samplings of delicious food at a very reasonable price.
