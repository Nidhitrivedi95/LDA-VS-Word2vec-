ywtDqnrLeWzG7Q-9ORmSsA A coworker had a very nice looking lunch special of Mongolian beef one day and I quickly decided I would try this place. The portions are huge! In this area of town, this is the best place for a cheap Chinese lunch special. I've tried the cashew chicken and the generals chicken and both items were fresh, hot and flavorful. The order time is short and it's a quick run inside for pickup, which is a plus when having to dash back to work quickly. The portion is honestly enough to last 2 meals. It's easy to order, and so far nothing has been bungled on my multiple lunch special orders for the office.
