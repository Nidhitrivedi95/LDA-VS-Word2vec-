1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I came here yesterday on Thanksgiving day and the food/service was excellent!!!  I ordered the beef brisket/tendon noodle soup, the pig's feet entree, and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  The owner came out of the kitchen to talk to my friend and I and complimented my taste in ordering off of the menu.  He was extremely friendly and you can tell he really takes the time to craft the menu and dishes carefully.  We also got a sampler of deep fried Thanksgiving turkey and it was so well done!!!  I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back next time I'm in LV.
