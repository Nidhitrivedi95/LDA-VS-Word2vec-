N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ Food tasted great! - like I'd go back for sure. It's a bit pricier than I'd like to pay for any of these kind of items - it's kind of like how you pay more for tacos at La Carnita kinda thing- but I don't feel too jipped bc everything was cooked really well, tasted awesome, service was on point and they were timely with our reservation. It's a casual place despite the price point and didn't feel pretentious to me.

 O.g  fried chicken with the sweet and sour sriracha tasting dip (yum!), jerk chicken chow mein & the pinepple-jalapeno sorbet with coconut panna cotta & shavings were all delicious and noteworthy to me, and I'd eat again. Definitely try all of those if you are dining there!!

Overall, I'd give it a 7/10. I think they played it a bit on the safe side with the menu and tastes (nothing is overly spicy, a bit mild for my taste)...not as "jamaican-y" as I was hoping for?...like i didnt see any ackee anywhere...i didnt see any collard greens lol..but I get that it us a fusion resto so perhaps that is why. 

I think they should have more items on the menu definitely and I think they really could be more affordable. ($20 for chicken jerk chow mein? Forreal?!)

 So yeah...overall cool place to check out once or twice...save it for something eventful or when ur in the mood to break the norm.
