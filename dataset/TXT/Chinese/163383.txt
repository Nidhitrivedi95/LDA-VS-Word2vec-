URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg China Chili always has good Chinese food for when I'm in need of it. I love the fact that they also do catering, and I was able to cater a big party and they made accommodations to substitute two dishes that were not on their catering menu. It was a huge hit, and everyone loved it. I've also ordered takeout a few times now from them, and I've been satisfied every time. Their portions are pretty large. One dish plus a box of rice will last me three meals! Although the taste here is a little Americanized, I do like their chicken with black bean sauce. That is usually my go-to. The vegetables are very fresh, and the meats are always cooked well. When I order ahead for takeout, they have the food ready in about ten minutes. Even for catering, I think I only had to put in the order a day or two ahead. The staff here are usually pretty friendly too.
