cykzJbkgweJvZsvkrHMR7g I was in the mood for Pho. I saw they had it from the pictures. Andrea was quick to tell what they had since I didn't have a menu.  Our order was ready for pick up when promised. I like that they pack everything separate and you put it together yourself. Can't wait to go back and try other items.
