VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ I know everyone and their grandmother has already reviewed this place, so I will be quick.

I love this place.

Yes it is more "western" chinese.  But it is light years better than PF changs, or other chain type places.

Every time we have been going we get something different from the menu and have yet to have anything less than a fantastic meal.

It is also very affordable. Plenty of things on the menu for under $10 per plate.

Me likey...
