Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA What a little gem of a place! They put some unique additions into classic dishes, that take them to another level of deliciousness. Like sweet potato & avocado in the Massaman Curty or pumpkin in the Red Curry. These make the dish not only taste amazing but also make them more visually appealing as well. Best of all the service can't be beat, very friendly and efficient. Almost felt like I was in Thailand, "the land of smiles". ;)
