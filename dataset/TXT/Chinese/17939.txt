$16 plus tax for AYCE hot pot. I've never had Chinese hotpot before, but I was totally impressed. The menu had LOTS of options. About 10 different broths (you get to pick 2), 25-30 meat and dumplings selections and another 10-15 vegetables. There were some premium meats and seafood items that cost extra.

We chose satay broth and a "Mala Spicy" one which was INCREDIBLY spicy. Super good. 

The restaurant is huge. By the time we left (8:30pm or so on a Thursday), it was nearly a full house. No whiteys (except for our table!) It was a bit slow getting the bill and paying, but we weren't in a hurry so no big deal.

What a feast. We need this shit downtown!
