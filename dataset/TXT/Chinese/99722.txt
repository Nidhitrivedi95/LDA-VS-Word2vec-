jvUeGNTr7M-FRyozqKRZzQ This place was the restaurant my uncle chose for his daughters wedding dinner. The decor is nice and the volume of the music is not too loud or too soft. However the reason I gave them such a low rating was for plenty of faults. 

Pros: decor, music, and atmosphere. This place has a lot of potential to be successful with an Asian authentic cuisine. 

Cons: food was suppose to be some asian fusion for more of the Caucasian population. But I think this worked against them. The waiters couldn't even explain to me what we had been served. The food tasted below average to me. The drive is decently far from the strip. 

Like I said maybe if there was quality food in sizable portions and knowledgeable competent waiters  this place has a huge amount of potential. Maybe in a few months I'll check it out when I come back.
