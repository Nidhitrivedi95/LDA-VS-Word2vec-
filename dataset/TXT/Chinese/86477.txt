They each had great flavors and were very fresh tasting. The sesame noodles were also very good with just a little spicey kick. My wife and I shared it all and left looking forward to our next visit here. Very nice staff. I would probably go on an off time since this is a small restaurant with limited staff if you're inpatient.
