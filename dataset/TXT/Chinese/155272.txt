tjaPPgXtVnP8RYmSqlsGww unfortunately Pick Up stix is closed all their locations in AZ and in NV. I never understand. I loved this place. 1000x better than the Panda or Pei Wei.. heck i liked it better than P.F Changs which all belong to the same company. put it this way... its where I spent my 2008 Valentine's Dinner I liked it that much. Ah well.. I guess I'll have to hit up San Diego to eat it once again..
