mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w Food was okay, not too expensive. We had the half fried chicken, minced beef lettuce cups and pork shumai for $30.81. We wouldn't get the shumai again, it was just not anything special and tasted kind of weird for our tastebuds. 

The service was good. We got checked on more than enough and everyone was polite and all smiles. 

We would probably come back, but not anytime soon.
