jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw Stumbled upon this restaurant by accident (my mom wanted Chinese food). First impression was that it was a bit of a shabby atmosphere. The cup had a bit of veggie or something stuck to it so first impressions were not great. The food we ordered was mediocre. The salty meat was a bit strange. I tried it a bit but didn't want to continue eating it. 

This place is not my first choice of place to choose. I guess if you have a large family or group, it's doable.
