6tY0tn39Mb8FCLYBAXXOUw Best Chinese food in Northeast Ohio by far!
 Our family has been enjoying their fresh and delicious food for over 20 years. We've tried other places closer to us, but it was so worth the longer drive to have a meal prepared by Gary and his wife! Now they have moved a little closer to us,but only offer takeout and delivery (no more dining in) so we will definitely be doing that and enjoying their food at home more often!
