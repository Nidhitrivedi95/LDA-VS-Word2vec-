CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ I only go here because my mom likes this restaurant, but honestly I think it lacks in quality. I went with my mom and boyfriend 2 weeks ago and the mushrooms had dirt on it. It looked like those mushrooms have never been washed...at all.  Also the cauliflower had black mold on it. It's pretty disgusting. I don't understand why they even decided to put those out there on the rack of "fresh" food to put in your hot pot. Did they even bother checking?

I have nothing else to say except to add that the waiters look like they are very unhappy to work there.  I really highly recommend those who want to try (if you really have to)  the hot pot to eat with caution. And for the rest of you who want to just eat hot pot, avoid this restaurant at all costs. They do not take hygiene or safety measures in mind.
