HJ928N6c5Hh2KD3lYCuabA I've been to the Spring Rolls near Yonge & Bloor, and another one near Yonge & Dundas, those seem to be ok. I mean don't expect authentic thai food, it's more like thai fusion.  

I was quite excited for the Spring Rolls being opened here, so I went for their opening. I was sadly quite disappointed.  The inside interior of the restaurant is so fresh and sexy, but the food is mediocre at best. I tried their tom yum soup, which was actually the best thing I had there (minus the coriander - which I hate).  We had the mango salad (bland, have better), as well as the pad thai.  The pad thai wasn't the greatest, you can definitely get better in Toronto.  

Next time you pass Spring Rolls, just walk by and go to another thai restaurant up Yonge Street.
