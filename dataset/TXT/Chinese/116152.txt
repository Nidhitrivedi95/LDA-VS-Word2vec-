n5jTCFF6LqNIAz6Jx5-3tw For me this is as good as Chinese food gets on this level. 

They use all white meat chicken. None of their meat is fatty or full of grease either!

Vegetables are cooked to perfection.. cooked to a perfect crispiness. 

The ordering & food serving concept is efficient and great as well. 

Price isn't too bad either..A couple dollars more than those nasty C rated places but WAY worth it. 

This chain is owned by PF Changs so your always guaranteed to get a consistant, good quality meal here :)
