c1VhAIzfRqnYUao6RQmjQw Just had Lotus Inn delivered. This restaurant should be listed as "$$$" with very little in terms of quantity. 

Took a chance on the "Buddha's Delight" which, is far from what is advertised. Where are all the Asian mushrooms? You have to dig to find any. No noodles. $9.25! 

Deep fried wontons usually have a little bit meat in them. Not here. Sauces are very generic. Chicken Soo Guy is OK. 

Felt ripped off after spending $30 + tip. 
Chinese is usually at least that much but you get containers full of food. I'll be heading to Buddha's Vegetarian ar Dundas & Bathurst next time I get a craving.
