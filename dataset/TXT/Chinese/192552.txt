Don't know the name but their main thing is a build your own dish (pick from a large assortment of veggies, meats and sauces give to chef who cooks it for you on this 6-8 for wide circular flat top stove) which is incredible... and the food too. And there is also a good size buffet that is well with exploring. And even though I go overboard, I try to stay close to the boat.
