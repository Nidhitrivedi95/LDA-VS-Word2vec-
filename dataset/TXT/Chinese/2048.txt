-XtCi1S3tcHsKVGac3naWw Great food! Fast delivery and it was still warm. I tried the egg rolls which were yummy. The curry chicken was pretty good, though I had to use some extra hot sauce to make it spicy enough for me. I also tasted the hot and sour soup, which was full of tofu, mushrooms, pork strips, and a couple other things, but again, I had to add hot sauce. It was by far the best Chinese food I've ever had delivered.
