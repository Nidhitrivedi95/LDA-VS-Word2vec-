The wontons were soaked in chili oil and salty, which I do not prefer. The noodles and fried fish were okay. The lamb chops were too hard and salty. This place lacks service because when we asked for boxes the server asked us, "don't you think our service is good?" while she packed our food. She didn't look happy, probably that we didn't give any tips. She left without even giving us a bag to put our boxes in. One of my good friend's friend opened this place, and she agrees with me that the food was better back then than it is now.
