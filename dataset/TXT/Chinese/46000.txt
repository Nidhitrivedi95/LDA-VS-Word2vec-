BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA The interior of mother dumplings looks like my busto lower middle class apartment kitchen and dining room except for the fact that there at 5-6 Asian people cooking dumplings in there full time. The decor is not why they are hot, it is the amazing dumplings. You can choose from 18 kinds of dumplings fried or steamed with my favorite being fried pork & bak choi which create little mouth bak choi juice explosions when you pop them. They only give 1 small shoyu and hot suace w/ takeout orders regardless of order size so make sure to ask for extra.
