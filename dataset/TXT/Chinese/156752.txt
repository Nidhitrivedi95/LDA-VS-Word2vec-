TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ I used to come here with my parents weekly growing up and always loved it. Recently however, it's changed a bit.

Service is ok, hit or miss depending on what day you go in. Sometimes they are super quick, other times not so much, take out is usually slower than dine in.
Food... not as good as it used to be, but still decent.
Overall I would give it a B
