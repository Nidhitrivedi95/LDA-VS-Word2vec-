_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA You'll get good service if you're Chinese.

We were seated and ordered waters and various drinks.  After 5 minutes, we flagged down a waitress to ask about our water.  After another 5 minutes, we got the hostess' attention.  It still took another 5 minutes before the drinks appeared.  15 minutes for water?  That's bad.

We then ordered our food.  Another 15 minutes go by.  Two separate groups of Chinese guests are seated in the interim (including one group of 12+). They order and receive their all of their food before anything of ours comes out.  They are literally being served at light speed.  We are still sitting at an empty table.  That's very bad.

So we finally get our food after about 35 minutes of waiting and watching everyone around us, including those who came afterwards, get their food first.  I can't speak for what anyone else ordered, but the orange chicken ($19) was atrocious.  Watery, lukewarm, and not flavorful at all.  The "jasmine rice" was badly overcooked white rice.  The spring rolls were terrible.

If the food were just mediocre and overpriced, I'd give the place 2 or 3 stars for convenience alone (it's in the middle of the casino) but I really was not impressed with how horrible the service was.  It wasn't busy or late at night; there were no extraneous circumstances.  They just decided that they would serve everyone else (who just so happened to be Chinese) first, and keep us waiting.  

So now, I will decide to never eat here again.
