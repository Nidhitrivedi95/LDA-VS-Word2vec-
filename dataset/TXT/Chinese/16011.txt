3TRgD3KLVis61eGvMZrykA This is my favorite chinese food restaurant out of all the ones I've tried. Everything we have ordered here has been good which is rare. Usually restaurants will do a few dishes well, a few dishes not so well and everything in between.

My parents and I always hit up here when they're in town visiting. Highly recommend.
