GhWMl0J2gOOH61BhBMTAAA Decent stir fry for this type of place. Not my favorite type of food, but it got the job done. I liked being able to choose your starch, including cabbage if you're low-carbing it, and the servings were pretty generously-sized. Plus you have the option to make it bottomless for an extra $5 apiece or so. The sauces seemed bland, but maybe I didn't mix mine like I should have.

Service was...odd. Not bad considering it was pretty crowded. Our waiter was super friendly, but when we went up to fix our plates the servers bussed and cleaned our table. It was all cleared off when we went back, and the waiter was as confused as we were. It made me glad I had taken my purse up with me, and glad there weren't people sitting at our table when we came back. The whole place was a bit loud for my liking, but between the crowds, the fans, and the sounds of cooking that isn't really surprising.
