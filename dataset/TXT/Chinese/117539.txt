NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ This bubble tea shop is one of the more pricey ones. This goes for everything else on their menu - including small dishes like popcorn chicken - $8.99 without tax. 

That said, the ingredients used at TenRen are all real and freshly made. My friend's yogurt banana slush was awesome because you can actually taste the fresh bananas (and not powder). Well, the price for that drink was $7.79 for a large. 

I came here around 11PM and it was packed, and really hard to wave down waitresses. It was awhile before someone took our order, but our drinks arrived pretty fast afterwards. 

The Taiwanese experience here reigns over any other bubble tea shop in the GTA (ie. 168 Tea Shop, Destiny, Go For Tea).
