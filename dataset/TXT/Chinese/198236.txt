zXjA4Jms2jCAP09EO7Ghfg Small and simple place. Very clean and proprietors are friendly.  Order at the counter and they bring everything over to you. I ordered the Orange Chicken. A good sized dish cooked very well with a spicy sweet sauce. What I loved about this dish is that the coating around the chicken was light. None of the three other Chinese restaurants can match that. All white meat chicken. I will go back again. It got 4 stars because the it is not a full sit down restaurant. 

I am from NY and they have a NY style egg roll. It is a larger egg roll and pretty good.
