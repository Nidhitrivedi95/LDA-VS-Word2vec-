z9lOfnUorcbWR_xS0DSeHw Oh Fugu, I used to HATE spicy food and now I'm falling in love with them. It's usually always crowded in Fugu, and most of their food are spicy. Here are what I usually order:

Lamb Cumin
Spicy String Bean
Mapo Tofu
Fried Crunchy Pork Intestine
Braised Beef in Hot Pot

If you're not used to spicy food at all, be seriously prepared. I cannot imagine how many pounds of chilies they order every day to cook their food.
