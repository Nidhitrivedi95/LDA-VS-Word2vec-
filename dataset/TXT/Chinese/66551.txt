EHKzu5r2NEz5Zq2R84J4ow My family and I were in the area looking for somewhere to eat dinner on a Sunday, and we came across this place. I wasn't expecting much--just the usual Americanized Chinese food--but that's not we got here. Granted, my experience was a little unusual.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite nice; it's pretty large. A few minutes after we were seated, the owner came by and started talking to my parents. He was very friendly, and recommended a lot of authentic Chinese dishes that weren't on the menu.  In the end, we ordered completely based off his list, which included items such as pork belly with mustard greens (<U+6885><U+5E79><U+6263><U+8089>) and bok choy (<U+767D><U+83DC>). It was a very satisfying, delicious meal. (However, it was only when the check came that we realized how much more these dishes cost.)

I realize that this was a rarer experience, and that the owner would never have recommended these dishes had we not been Chinese. However, this was the only time I've eaten here, and it was a fantastic dining experience, so I feel that this review should reflect that.
