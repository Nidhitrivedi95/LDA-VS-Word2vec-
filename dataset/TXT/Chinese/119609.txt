Nvd7jbpKcFhpFlWOivEH6A We usually do take-out from Chows and this is a pretty good indicator of the quality of the food, I find.  My General Tao chicken was terrific; not little nubs of batter with a hint of chicken inside.  The General Tao consisted of large pieces of chicken, fried perfectly and the sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and of spicy.  I was a little disappointed with the chow mein, it lacked flavour.  The egg rolls were crunchy and the cabbage was fresh.  The pineapple chicken was delicious and there was a row over who would have the last piece.  The garlic spareribs were also very good, the meat was not tough in the least.  

The rice was good if a bit average.
