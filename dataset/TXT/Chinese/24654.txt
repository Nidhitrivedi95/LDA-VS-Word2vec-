6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ I really do love this place! 

Right at the moment from entering, I felt welcomed, all the way until the time I left. Where you get a huge Japanese goodbye! And it really felt genuine too! 

Service is outstanding as other Yelpers have said. The waitress even apologized for the long wait on the dessert which took me by surprise because I think only a minute passed by since I had ordered my dessert! 

I got the curry Katsu, and I loved it! (I've had a lot of curry katsu's in my time). Perfect crispy katsu, with rich thick curry sauce! 

My boyfriend got the hamburger don, which was so so for him. But I really liked it! 

He then got the green tea bruele and I had the Japanese special cake and they were both superb! 

I think it's a combination of the extremely friendly staff with a great atmosphere and fantastic food that has tied it all together for me. 

Definitely recommended, and I will be back in the near future! I'm really happy I found this place while looking for places to eat at midnight! Haha xD
