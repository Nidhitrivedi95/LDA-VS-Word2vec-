PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ When restaurants advertise a certain service or product, consumers will expect them to deliver. Yum Cha is advertised as an all day dim sum; however, this place did not fully live up to that. Many of the items were not available upon request and we were, instead, forcefully advised to try alternatives. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing bad about giving suggestions, just don't be pushy and annoying about it. 

There are definitely better dim sum options in town in comparison. We tried this place out because friends suggested it. They raved about the quality and price. We, on the other hand, did not have the same quality experience they had. Orchids Garden will be our go-to spot for quality dim sum the next time we need our cravings fulfilled!
