-GDfRHphXjccSWhliFHnzg Really boring and low quality food with bad service. We came in for dinner after decided to try Chinese food. We ordered special congee, sliced chicken noodle, curry chicken rice, satay beef rice noodle. All very discounting.

The special congee has no flavour, taste very boring.
The sliced chicken noodle had too much Monosodium glutamate, frozen chicken tasted like wood piece. 
The curry chicken used starch to mix the flavour, yuck!
The satay beef rice noodle probably the best of 4 terrible dish, no much satay flavour. 

The waitress spilled tea on my daughter's pants and didn't even apologize. Terrible service
