HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I'm hooked on bao! We came here especially for their duck bao and pork belly bao but they were all out of the pork belly so we settled on two orders of the duck bao and an order of the short rib grilled cheese. The waitress was very nice but she must have misunderstood us and only gave us one order of the duck bao instead of two orders. It was near closing time so we didn't want to say anything. 

The duck bao is definitely something I would get again on my next visit. It was very tasty but small, I guess that's why it's listed under snacks on the menu. Two pieces of bao come in one order so the boyfriend and I shared. We also shared the short rib grilled cheese, and OMG, I want all my grilled cheese sandwiches from now on to taste like the grilled cheese sandwich I had from here. The meat was so tender and tasty.

The restaurant is small and very casual, and is located inside the Eureka Casino which is a small, smoked-filled casino on East Sahara. I don't usually come to this part of town so I had never even heard of the casino until I read about Fat Choy. The cigarette smell/smoke is horrible inside the casino but once you're in the restaurant, it's not too bad. 

There were many other things on the menu that looked really good so I will definitely be returning and hopefully they won't be all out of the pork belly bao.
