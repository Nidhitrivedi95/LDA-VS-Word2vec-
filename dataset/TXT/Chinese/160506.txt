U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Every friend of mine (and granted, most of them are FOB Chinese) that has visited Beijing Noodle Company has complained about the place, citing that the food was terrible, the service was terrible, etc.

However, I decided to visit anyways...needing a quick place to grab something to eat for my little toddler. Expecting the worst, I came out of the experience pleasantly surprised. 

The decor will get you the first time you walk in...it feels like you are eating inside a giant egg, with millions of goldfish surrounding you (yes, I know eggs and fish don;t necessarily go together - but someone should have told the designers of this place). 

The food though, was not terrible. Sure, it was not super authentic, but it wasn't tasteless or horrible. It reminded me...well, it reminded me of something I can find at any Chinese Cafe in Houston. I ordered both a stir fried noddle dish and a veggie dish, and both were good enough to continue eating.

The prices are steep...as all Vegas prices on the Strip are, so let's just stop complaining about that. Having said that, the service was the only thing I was disappointed about, but not so much that I have to complain on Yelp. They were slow, but not so much that I was wondering where my food or water was at all times. It just seemed odd that it took as much time as it did with a half empty restaurant to bring two dishes out...but that is all I will really say about the service. We all have our off days and times during the day when production is not what it should be...I get it!

Either way, this is not a bad place to spend some time, especially if you need a quick bite and you happen to find yourself reliving the Hangover Part I. Not to mention, noodles are good eats especially if you find yourself pulling out your own incisor just to win a bet or prove a point!
