I7eqTdTmRTWYwF9HNZAHxw Totties. .. oh how to explain the greatness.
my most recent order was:
I got the lamb salad. It was regreshing, filling and loced it. And I hate salads. 

I am also a huge fan of their curries. Whats best about this location is that it isnt as "sketchy" on the outside add the south Scottsdale location. Yhe outside matches the inside on this one.
