kHZeGxR7zkW0T5Nym0NjCA Had to find a new place when Golden Star on Bell rd. closed. My family and I have eaten here 4 or 5  times.

The staff is friendly and courteous, the restaurant is clean.

The food is served quick and is always hot and fresh. The Orange Chicken is the best I have ever tasted anywhere. My wife and I usually enjoy the Shrimp w/vegetables and our kids split a large Orange Chicken. I must admit the I find myself sneaking pieces of the chicken throughout the meal. The crab puffs are good but the egg rolls are not really impressive.
