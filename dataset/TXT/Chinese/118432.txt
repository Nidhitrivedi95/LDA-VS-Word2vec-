nMo0ozHO7cqsPaxw_7N6ow Still one of the best dim sum place in my view. I've had plenty of dim sum in other cities before and most were alright. The servers here by far are always nicer than most place.  It's not stellar service but trust me, most Asian restaurants have horrible service and takes forever to bring small requests such as hot chili oil or just a water! Be prepared to come early on Sunday morning if you don't want to wait for a table since that's when they are busiest. They do serve dim sum during the weekdays but it's as ordered.
