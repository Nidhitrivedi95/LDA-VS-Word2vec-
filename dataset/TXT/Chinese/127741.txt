pdr6U7qSa9jIivVy_glF-w It had been awhile since we ate here. The hot pot and buffet were decent before. We came in during Thanksgiving weekend and everything was bad. We don't know if the place has changed ownership. We do know for sure that we'll never eat here again and won't recommend it to anyone. Save yourself,  don't eat here!!!
