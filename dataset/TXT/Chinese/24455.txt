6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag A totally authentic Chinese Restaurant, I felt I was back in Beijing vacationing, although this was not as fancy as the upscale as the Renaissance Hotel in Beijing. 

My waitress barely spoke English and attempted to speak to me in Mandarin, I'm Chinese but was born and raised in the US and my parents both speak Cantonese. Enough personal chattering. 

Since I was dinning myself it was a difficult choice dumplings sounded good but there were ten to an order and that would be just to filling. 
I went with the tofu seafood soup a small order which when it arrived it was large. Nice amounts of shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, eggs and some diced veggies gave this a nice soothing flavor. I ordered the fish with spicy sauce as my main entree. It arrived in a large bowl and it looked SPICY - chucks of tender fish with napa topped with cilantro. the broth had a nice flavor but there was so many red peppers I had to remove some before eating the fish BC I no I would be coughing if I didn't. The fish was so tender, and flavorful and went great with the steamed rice. 

I'm looking forward to coming back here with friends or clients so I can try some other dishes.
