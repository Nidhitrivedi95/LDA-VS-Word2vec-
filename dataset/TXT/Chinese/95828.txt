JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA The worst restaurant in Vegas. I never gave negative feedback before but this time I hope I can give "0" star for this place. Horrible service. Sit down for 10 minutes but nobody came to service us. There were 3 ladies working there. One of the customers complained about some thing and then all three servers argued with that customer. Very rude. Just argued and argued.  Left at least 3 tables unclean and the rest of customers waiting. <U+672A><U+898B><U+904E><U+9019><U+9EBC><U+5DEE><U+7684><U+670D><U+52D9>!!
