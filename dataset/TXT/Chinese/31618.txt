9rzfGwR--QUGn7BZJdm-Sw I came here at 1AM  in hopes of a better alternative than fast food places. I think I should have went to Wendy's instead. I am an avid traveler and often check in many restaurants and expect simply good food and good service. I am pretty much easy to please.

I ordered Seafood Chow Fun.However my dish came out, and it didn't match the photo, and the manager who was also my server told me to just throw soy sauce on it. Keep in mind he didn't even hand me soy sauce or any condiments to at least enhance the dish myself. He said it was "the same thing".  I was tired and I just wanted the dish in the photo and I asked him to remake it and I even pulled up several other images via google search on my phone to show him exactly what I wanted. It is a simple dish to make so I didn't see the problem.

He snarled, and make a snarky face and took back my dish, unwillingly. I even offered to pay for both dishes. 

On top of the bad service, the place seemed a little outdated. I mean I am not used to eating on plastic lined tables and stained porcelain plates and tea cups.

The restroom was unsanitary and the servers seemed to ignored me the whole time. I had to get up off my seat twice just to get their attention. I must remind you that it isn't busy or rush hour at 1AM on a Tuesday. 

I don't recommend this place in general. However if you're looking for a simple dish that can't be messed up anywhere else then go for it.
