3SozmlI5K7xapJBE41Ah1g Stopped in late on a Monday night, only people in the restaurant. Very nice and clean. Had our mainstays when trying a new Chinese restaurant, Mongolian beef, sesame chicken and pork fried rice. All came out quickly, portions were large and all the food was delicious. Plenty leftover for lunch tomorrow. Will definitely be back. Highly recommend you try this place.
