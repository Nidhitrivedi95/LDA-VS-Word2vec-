R4EhR8xhONLFqqI6ZnzNWw My second visit to this restaurant in the last week. This is the only dumpling restaurant I've seen that sell chinese dumplings with Korean food.

I have an assortment of Dumplings from pork, minced beef, mushroom, bok choy, vegetables, chicken, lamb. Apart from the pork, I've tried most of them. They are juicy and amazing. 

Their stir fried noodles was kinda bit oily. Also tried their lamb skewers on the second visit. It was a bit fatty but probably not the best but can't beat $8.99 for 8 skewers. 

They have other things I'll like to try, but I think they are the best for the dumplings. Will definitely come back again.
