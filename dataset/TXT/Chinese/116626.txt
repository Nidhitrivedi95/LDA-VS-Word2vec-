n9WOZlk5k868HXRVhKp5IQ Try the "Singapore Mee Hoon" nice and spicy. 
Their Pineapple Fried Rice is awesome and a great change from ordinary (Beef, Pork, etc.) fried rice.
 If you are not sure you can order the "House Special" fried rice, It has a little bit of everything  Chicken , Beef , Pork, Shrimp...It is sooooo tasty.

 The Orange Chicken left me speechless..It was dry and was nearly tastless. 

The owners and staff are friendly and wonderful with thier dine in experience being quite nice.
Take out food from here losses something during the packing and transportation. I definitely recommend sitting down and enjoying this wonderful restaurant.

 The staff is attentive and patient and the prices are very fair
