XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA We came here because of the good reviews on Yelp (and elsewhere).  DO not believe any of the good reviews!  The food was mostly disgusting!  We tried a little bit of everything and none of it was any good.  My son wouldn't even eat the ice cream.  It was the cheapest kind you could buy.   I complained to the manager and he just offered a 10% discount.  Which means that we paid $48.00 for 2 adults and one 11 year old.   WAY too much for this s-hole.  I would stand out in front with a sign warning people if I thought it would keep people from wasting their money.  However, the restaurant was jammed full....  So, I can assume that the locals either have terrible taste or EXTREMELY low expectations.  Either way, I may have to move to a different city.   I think I have said enough...
