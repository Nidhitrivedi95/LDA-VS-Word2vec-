3-HFGxmbzSax-NySJ_LzDg I've had a chance to visit VIP several times now, I've only really tried the sushi here and nothing else.

1 included side - miso soup
1 appetizer - sweet potato cakes
3 roll lunch - 1 eel roll, 2 shrimp tempura

The miso is actually quite good here, with their seaweed packing quite a bit of flavor. The sweet potato cakes may not be for everyone, as they're soft, chewy, and can be unnerving to the wrong palette.

From a sushi perspective you can't really beat 3 rolls for $13-$14. Most of the sushi bars in Madison on the West side have frozen their prices right around this mark. VIP's offering is really standard in terms of what everyone else offers, the difference however falls on portion size and overall taste.

Comparable to Fuji in Greenway, but from a taste standpoint VIP takes it by a nose. Affordable, but you might be waiting for a while as it takes time to make a fresh roll. This is about the case in any sushi house you visit.
