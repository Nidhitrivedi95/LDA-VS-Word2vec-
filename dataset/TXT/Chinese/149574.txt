sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg After a week long stay in Los Angeles and eating exceptionally great Chinese food I came home with a craving for more. Due to sparkling reviews of Tott's and the fact that it is located across the street from my home I decided to give them a try. 

I phoned in an order for stir fry Mongolian beef with brown rice.  The order was ready upon my arrival so there was no wait time. The guys at the counter were friendly so no complaints about customer service. 

However, I was somewhat disappointed in my Mongolian Beef as it was extremely sweet. It was full of tender slices of beef and lots of veggies but entirely too sweet for my taste buds.

I will definitely return and try other items suggested by fellow Yelper's but I will definitely stay away from the Mongolian unless I am craving dessert.
