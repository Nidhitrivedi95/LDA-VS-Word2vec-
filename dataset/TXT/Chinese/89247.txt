I6oxEn1HT41S2GPrDKPPvA Been to many dimsum place... but still Perfect is the best in food taste, service, variety and the price....   Imagine $1.80 per dimsum order just a 10cents increase from $1.70 last year.  If you go there in between 10am  to 4pm you also get offers for other dishes  at a low price.   It's a long wait during weekends but it's worth the wait.... the best place ever to have dimsum....  :)
