lbdW9Ex2xjYbVJaHgWwe7A Food so so. What really bother me is they have 2 different menus for different patrons for the same food. Notice that they only give out their "lunch specials" menu (in which from 11am-3pm, you get an entree and a glass of soy milk for $4.99) to some chinese with or without the expensive nice-looking menu while the rest only gets the expensive nice-looking menu. So in this day and age, this restaurant has the gut to enforce such practice i.e. different pricing and also service for customers of different backgrounds. Will not go back again.
