BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg "The New" How Lee is a great example of just how much the food scene in Pittsburgh has developed and grown over the past decade. Not so long ago, How Lee's was a down-and-dirty corner joint turning out strictly mediocre Americanized Chinese fare for take-out only. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that it has been transformed into a sit-down restaurant serving exhilaratingly spicy and flavorful Sichuan dishes.

With two dining partners, I sampled the dan dan noodles, the garlic eggplant, and the Sichuan prawns. The noodles were pleasantly chewy and luxuriously bathed in the sesame-rich sauce studded with bits of ground pork. The eggplant had a tinge of sweetness nicely countered by the sharp garlic and swirls of chili oil. The prawns were dry-fried with several cups of dried chilis. The fresh sweetness of the shrimp balanced perfectly with the saltiness and spice of its seasonings.

The service was friendly and prompt, and our server checked on us several times to make sure we were pleased with our meal and to see if we needed anything further.

The New How Lee is a wonderful addition to the Squirrel Hill food scene and I'd be more than happy to dine there again.
