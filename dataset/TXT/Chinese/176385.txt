wNya6ItPXXde2ulzm_tNQw Finally reviewing this place after five or so visits. 

I don't know what they do but their orange chicken is ridiculously good. I just can't say no and it's the only orange chicken my toddler will touch. That says something, considering she's a super picky eater. 

Love the green beans but I wish there was less chicken and more green beans. Give up the veggies you whores! J/k 

Glad they've added more seafood options, aka shrimp.. they're delicious. Never fishy, more sweet, salty tangy fatty goodness. I've always believed they have a secret ingredient. Favorites being crispy shrimp, and orange shrimp. Boom baby, the sauces are the key. I've boughten the sauces and cooked it in my shrimp or chicken at home and it's just as good as panda. Especially if your looking for a cheap or healthier alternative then eating Panda Express a lot. 

Love the veggies egg rolls. Mine never come out like that at home, so I have to buy them. They practically throw them in my face and scream at them to bite them.

The decor is cute, the panda is adorable, and I love seeing all those fresh ingredients chopped up and in plain view next to the kitchen Near the glass slider. No secrets. 

Got to ask for chop sticks, they aren't for grabs cause of those sticky rice handed thieves.
