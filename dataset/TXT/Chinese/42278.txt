BbPVtY7hzBPnpRrZMBElIg First off, we come here often and have enjoyed eating here for the most part, but now I'm not so sure we will be back.. We ate here tonight and all of the food was pretty decent, but one of us got food poisoning from the raw salmon and/or raw tuna.. 
We really look forward to the sushi buffet, but after tonight, never again! 

Update: Two days later and still violently ill from the seafood from this place!
