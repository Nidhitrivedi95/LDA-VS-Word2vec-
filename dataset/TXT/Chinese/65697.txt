ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw Pei ... have you lost your Wei? 

Not sure what was going on last night... working late, so called over to "my" Pei Wei to grab a Pei Wei spicy Chicken with Brown Rice and Salad Rolls... Well, they have the Chicken, NO Salad Rolls... funny....now I don't even see them on the menu... So, with great disappoint I ordered pot-stickers... guess what... out of them also... weird... how do they run out of these items at 7 PM? 

So I just go with the Spicy Chicken ... fine, but noticed a lot less chicken and MUCH smaller sized chicken chunks then normal... The host assured me that this was an isolated instance... but I wonder... things seem to changing everywhere. The favor was the norm... sweet yet spicy glaze with breaded chicken... my favorite... not bad all in all... I'm sure my doctor would say otherwise!... ENJOY!
