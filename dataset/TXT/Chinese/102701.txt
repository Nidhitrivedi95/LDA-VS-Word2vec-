The Hakka cocktail is pretty unique, the dim sum was great and the hot & sour soup was the best I have ever had.  We had the Pipa duck, the beef stir fry and a noodle dish and all were tasty and well prepared, but small for "family style" dining.  My adult children shared the dumpling desert and they enjoyed it.
  The ambiance was very nice, but quite dark, it was difficult to read the menus.  Also, I've seen this a couple of times; what's with serving normal water without ice?  I guess we could have asked for it, but this is the third nice restaurant I've been to that served luke warm water.
