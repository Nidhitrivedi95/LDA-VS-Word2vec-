JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA Service: very quick - we ordered our breakfast and it came in less than 5 minutes even when it was a rush hour
Hospitality: family like environment
Food:delicious Taiwanese style breakfast
 Cost: decent less than 15 dollars
Overall: will come back for more but out of the things I ordered I would not order oyster omelet ... It's a little too sweet for my taste. The rest: saltly soybean and egg wrap is very good ... I would recommend it
