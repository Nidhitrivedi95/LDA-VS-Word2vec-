1DkpdmcxLCRXAdEi6TdOFw I got the coconut bubble tea with the white and black tapioca pearls. I liked it, the milk tea itself reminded me of a rice pudding dessert and I thought it was fun having two different kinds of boba. Their cups are also really cute and the one I got was actually a medium so the large was huge. It's a cute little place and if you're looking for bubble tea this could be a nice stop.
