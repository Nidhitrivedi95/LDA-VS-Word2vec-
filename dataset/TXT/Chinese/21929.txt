Do not order this, it is a total major rip off.  Felt for my brother since he recommended this restaurant and I was afraid to askhim  what the total bill was.  I'm guessing $300 for three people. The rest of the meal was minimal and left us hungry.  Had to go to place in the food court nearby later for a snack.
