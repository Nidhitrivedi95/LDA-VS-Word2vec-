We had duck noodle soup (I didn't get a taste, my daughter became quite defensive after her first bite), orange chicken and red curry with pumpkin and chicken.  Orange chicken was the bomb!  Tangy, crispy, and light - the breading enhanced the flavor rather than acting as filler.  Red curry was marvelous, with carrots, green pepper and basil.  I've had a lot of Thai curries and this was one of the better ones - light on the coconut milk, nice variety of textures and flavor.  I ordered it medium hot which was right for me and I eat spicy food.  I suspect the hot would be very hot.

Only criticisms are that the orange chicken was simply chicken and rice, it would have been nice to see a bit of garnish with carrot.  And they didn't offer condiments, which I suspect we could have gotten if we'd asked, but the food didn't need it.
