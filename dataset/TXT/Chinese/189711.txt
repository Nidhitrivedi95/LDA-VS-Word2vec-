yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Nice place for a Vietnamese Restaurant near the Las Vegas strip. The service is fast and when I mention fast, they're very fast. They take your orders, your order arrives shortly after, and they pick up your bowls after you're done eating. I appreciate the speedy service, but I think they need to slow down a bit so they can catch a breather and for us to take our time to enjoy our food. If you like fast service at a nice restaurant, this place is for you. I would definitely come back to Pho Kim Long as my choice of Pho for the next time I go to Vegas.
