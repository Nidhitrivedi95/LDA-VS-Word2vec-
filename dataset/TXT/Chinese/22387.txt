6MhY_9EkUkKCvvN8rzXZzg I am going to start off by saying I am an egg roll snob and they got 4 stars alone on that yum! The location is a Little scary I'm not gonna lie but once you get in it is very cute. The service was great I was a little nervous when we walked in and no one Else was there I had the sweet and Sour chicken and my boyfriend had the Duck, My chicken was very tasty as far as the duck the skin was good and crispy but to greasy for the actual meat and would not really recommend that but the egg rolls and sweet and sour sauce were out of this world I can't wait to go back again...
