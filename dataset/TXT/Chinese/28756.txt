8xPmlVJy2o6x0J04CBpEMQ I like the variety of the Chinese bubble waffles. They have a gourmet selection, every time I go, I order the truffle cheese and it's so unique and tasty. They have other flavours such as Ferraro Roche, many to choose from. I would suggest that once in made, just let him let the bubble waffle to sit on the pan for awhile to let it cool down before it gets placed in a bag as you don't want it to go soggy. Worth coming to try if you haven't been yet!
