Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA I hadn't been to this place in years but went for a visit due to a gift card. It was a fairly slow evening and service was right on point! 
The fish options were really exciting. The fish was tasty and fresh. If I go back I will ask them to leave off the sauces as they were too much sugar for my low carb diet! With the quality of the fish, they really didn't need to drown the food like you would expect at A fast food joint.
