XE97VxjZoRxV6IM05grY0g VEGETARIANS take note...are you sick of bland steamed vegetables and fried rice? So were we. Based on the Yelp reviews for Sizzling Hut we decided to give it a try. And wow, what a win! We were the only diners in the dining room so we asked the server/owner which dishes were vegetarian. Since we mentioned that we like spicy food she recommended the vegetable moo shu (4 heat stars) and the mixed vegetables and tofu with Szechuan sauce, which is not actually on the menu and was totally worth the dollar up charge.

As if the service couldn't be better, the server then proceeded to roll our moo shu for us. She couldn't have been more friendly or attentive. 

Apologies for the lack of photos but we were so caught up in the experience that we neglected to take any. 

In short, make the trek to this hidden gem in DeForest! Even though there aren't many Yelp reviews, Sizzling Hut has been in business for 14 years. Let's keep it going!!
