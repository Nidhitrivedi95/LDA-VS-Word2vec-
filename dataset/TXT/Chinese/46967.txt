bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q We went for a late Friday dinner and loved the food! We had the crab angels which were crispy by not greasy, and shared huge bowl of chicken egg drop soup and an entree of kung pao chicken. This was plenty and we still had leftovers. Our server was attentive and the owner Sherry stopped by to chat and check on our service. Our only disappointment was that we had just missed their Legends performer, Elvis, sing. We will be back to hear him on a Tuesday or weekend evening from 6pm-8pm!
