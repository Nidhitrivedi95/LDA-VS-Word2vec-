He came back in a good amount of time and took our orders. We got our food about 10 minutes later, which we thought was great. As we started to eat.. We realized we had no water. So we had to ask twice for water. And as we bit into our delicious looking food... We found it wasn't as yummy as it looked. The noodles were too fat, the veggies were cut wayyyy too big and it was almost impossible to grab them and chop it in half. The decor is amazing and the iced coffee was good, but don't eat here unless you want soggy noodles in a slow joint.
