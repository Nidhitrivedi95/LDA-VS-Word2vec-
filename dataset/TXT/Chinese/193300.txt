ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ I don't think I say anything bad about my experience here! Everything from the atmosphere to food to service was amazing.. Did I mention the food? My mouth is still watering from finishing up those delish banana fritters.. Save room for desert!! I went with a larger party and we had a handful of small plates, pig face dumplings, and pork belly and soft shell crab steamed buns to start. Everything was so yummy I wanted to lick the plates. Love this place and can't wait to go back and try more!
