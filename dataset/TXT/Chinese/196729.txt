ZOAid_xX3q85wAkBWtFDPg This place is the same owner as the Pmall location. This place also has cold sides now and alot more noodle vdirty. However, my go to is always the chinese burger and cold noodles. They are always great and consistent in great flavour! This location is a restaurant, it has modern decor, clean and pretty busy during off peak times even on a Tuesday. The owner lady works. Here now and she is so sweet. Try the lamb puff!! So flavourful! Will be back soon :) they open longer here than PMALL.
