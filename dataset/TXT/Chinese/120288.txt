O_Yi95nUeeqSudiMlUfttQ CONGEE CONGEE CONGEE!

I am a self-professed congee lover, especially with the century egg in it. There I said it. It's my go-to comfort food, and I will say that Ethan does congee well! You might be wondering what the difference is with other places. So here goes:

1) Good amount of ginger slivers
2) Nice consistency: not too thin, not to thick
3) Good ratio of congee to side ingredients (ex. century egg)
4) Always has chinese donuts available to go with it

When I was child I knew I could spot a shop that served congee by whats hanging in the window. (The rack of bbq pork, crispy pork thing, bbq duck) and the first time I saw Ethan, I saw this, and it was congee love at first sight. :)
