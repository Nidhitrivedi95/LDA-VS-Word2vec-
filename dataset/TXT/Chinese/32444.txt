9Z7JJvzB_5FG27QrTiws3Q Why am I eating at Kowloon Dim Sum Restaurant out of all these restaurants lining along Baldwin Street?

Can I tell you I was forced? But really no one can be forced!! I went in because I was following my Yelp eating Buddies.... and when it was 3 against 1......... 

I really don't want to eat dim sum at 9 PM at a strange place so ended up we ordered

Lobster in Black Bean and Garlic Sauce ($13.99)
Oyster with Green Onion and Ginger ($11.99)
Vegetables with garlic ($11.99)

All was Meh!! And heavy on MSG, I was thirsty for the whole night!

Oysters were not too fresh and were overcooked........

Staffs are friendly and speaks good English so non Chinese speaking would feel right at home!!

I think I would not be coming back to Kowloon again............ oh please Yelp eating Buddies, can we go somewhere else?!!
