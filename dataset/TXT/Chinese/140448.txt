r6WO_jkx4rkMMauvPvMDeQ I've never been inside the restaurant, which truly doesn't matter because the looks are not going to fill up my stomach. 
I always order to go and man I will tell you that their delivery is probably faster than figuring out what to order and placing the order. So far I have ordered about 3 times from this place and their consistency to deliver is always A1. As much as I always want to try something new, this place shook me out from my seat because their food is incredibly delicious.
From the 3 times I have ordered, all 3 times I have ordered the Wor Wonton, Chicken Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, and Mongolian Beef.
Let's get with the Wor Wonton. I love how it has all the meets of chicken, beef, and shrimp. I don't know if that's how everyone has gotten theirs but mine always has all three meats. Like I had mentioned about consistency, they are killing it with the flavor in that soup. Though Vegas has its hot weather year round, you cannot go wrong with their Wor Wonton Soup!
Chicken fried rice now. You order you regular, which ever meat, friend rice, but they always gift you plain white rice, I never asked why but it definitely came in handy for a different mean the next day! 
Now with the meals of Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian beef! Let me tell you that there is a warning sign of the food bein spicy hot! They are not lying! Those two combo plates are HOT! The flavor is of the roof! Just amazing if you love spicy food! 
Next time you want Chinese food, it should not take you long to decided between places, head to CHINA A GO GO, it's a MUST GO TO place.
Enjoy and Bon Appetit!
