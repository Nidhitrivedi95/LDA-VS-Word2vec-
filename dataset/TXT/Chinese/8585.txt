1jNteKQ2JuF6Sk1SI9X23Q Finally a PF Changs in TORONTO! Been to the one in vegas and the one in buffalo. My favorite asian restaurant has finally come to Toronto, ya I said that twice. 
I give this one a 4 because we waited 2 hours for a table!!!!!! Ok I get it's not their fault that they are busy. However there were empty tables!
The food was amazing lettuce wraps are a hit! Our server SUNNY was friendly and engaging. The manager kept coming to our table to ask how everything was. On one of the busiest night that really does WOW me.
I highly recommend go during a down time to avoid the line up.
Great place and great location
