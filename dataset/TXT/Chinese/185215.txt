- langzhou noodles with xi size noodles, spicy. The noodles were very tender and the soup was tasty. The soup base was a good level of spiciness. The beef was very thinly sliced and lean. I prefer my beef with a bit more fat on but it was delicious nonetheless. 
- noodles with pork sauce, noodles were kuan thickness. The sauce was delicious and there was a good amount of pork and sauce to coat the noodles. The carrots and cucumbers added a nice crunch and was refreshing. This also comes with a side of plain broth.
- jellyfish app. It was crunchy but didn't find anything special for this app when compared to other Chinese restaurants.

Service was also good. They were quick to take our orders and the food came quickly. Restaurant is a bit on the smaller side so we ended up sitting at the bar. However, I didn't mind too much as I could catch glimpses of the chef making the noodles. 

Overall, it was a good price for fresh noodles especially around the Yonge Dundas area. I even had enough for leftover lunch the next day. I would definitely be a repeat customer.
