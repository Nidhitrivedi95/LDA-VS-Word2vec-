tH_ObhULoHCb1n08pbHgHQ On entering the restaurant, it is immediately apparent that the owners have "high class" aspirations. The decor is more elaborate than that of your average Chinese restaurant, and may border on the 'fussy' or 'kitschy'. 

We were there on a weekend morning and dim sum were on the menu. I selected my usual: steamed tripe and sticky rice in lotus leaf. We also settled on a very tasty congee that was extremely tasty. To this offering we added crispy fried squid and a nice jasmine tea. 

All in all we had a nice alternative breakfast, and we enjoyed it. The prices are a wee bit more that let us say the Congee Queen, but it will not break the bank. The service is good.

Glancing at the menu we knew this restaurant offers a full array of Chinese Food, take out, and some interesting combination menus. That will be for another time.
