drIFrAyZnyismS1ArZlmAg My son took me for Mothers Day and it was awesome. First time ever at a Vegan Restaurant so as you can expect I couldn't decide what to order, everything looked so good. I could choose anything on the menu versus having to sort through a menu when eating at regular restaurants. I had a cup of soup, orange chicken and sweet potato fries. There was so much food I had lunch the following day. Hostess/waitress was extremely polite, friendly and helpful. While waiting for our orders she checked back with us frequently. As for my son (the meat eater) he really enjoyed the food as well. Great job "Loving Hut"!
