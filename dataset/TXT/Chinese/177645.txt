wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA Yowzers, this place was great! 

Awesome food, awesome service...awesome everything. And for as much as we ate, and even had a couple of beers: $71. 

Favorite things: Kabli short ribs, Japanese street corn and the kurobuta smoked rib. The kurobuta short rib is amazing. 

This review is short. The only thing you need to get out of it is to go to eat here. Your mouth and tummy with thank you.
