bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A I have been a regular customer at Pearl Wok for many many years and I absolutely LOVE it.  I'm a Vegetarian and they are always VERY accommodating - I get the Vegetarian Chop Sui (brown sauce - I didnt care for the white sauce) and either the vegetable fried rice or the Vegetable Lo Mein (soft noodle) and its always brilliant.  The food arrives in minutes (granted, I live very close by) but its always hot, the service is friendly and the food is excellent.

Back in the day (before I was a Vegetarian...in the "before time") I used to really enjoy the Lemon Chicken, Orange Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken (spicy!) Mongolian Beef, and the "Happy Family."  My roomate recently tried the Moo Goo Gai Pan and said it was delicious.  I'd say anything you get here is a sure fire win.
