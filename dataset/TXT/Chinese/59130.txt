DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw Cute little market off of Russell & Boulder Hwy. It's   a little tight inside. Very difficult to maneuver from isle to isle. I did find an organic all natural coconut water in the small refrigerator towards the back of the store, some tamarind candy, and plenty of soup mixes. When I got to the counter, the young girl doesn't even acknowledge your presence. No hello, hi, how are you?....nothing! She looked down then began to ring up my items. It was a little awkward. Note to the owner, teach this young lady some mannerism in customer service. Always greet every person that walks into your establishment. Greeting your customers goes a long way. Needless to say, I will not return. 
I went next door shortly to check out their new restaurant, but the food was just swimming in fat and the smell was not appetizing. I was hoping to try out some of the food? :( 
I'll continue to go to the new Mabuhay Market next to Sunset Station, it's so much cleaner and bigger. And yes the owners greet you. :)
