5O_PnqfRXSHPaw_2DMAimA I had my first experience ever with acupuncture at Sun Tree Healing Arts.  Though nervous initially, the environment and doctor was amazing.  I was put at ease and I knew she would be able to assist me in feeling better.  I have opted to go back several times for a variety of body work modalities and cannot speak highly enough about the practice!
