Hot and sour soup doesn't contain any wood ear mushrooms or Chinese pickles, but had equal parts soup and tofu plus veggies. Consistency was thin. Wonton strips accompanied the soup.

The fried pork dumplings had generous filing and no traces of mystery meat. The wrappers were thick and it came with a garlicky, sweet, soy sauce based dipping sauce.

Yay! Cheat day lunch!!
