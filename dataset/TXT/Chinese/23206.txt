6sATfFam9_q9uod0I2aCsg The restaurant manager was RUDE and shamelessly RACIST. I will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again. The table next to us was a Caucasian party and the manager went out of his way to pleasing that table the entire time, meanwhile neglecting us completely! His need to pleasing the other ethnicity was completely shameless and disgusting. What made this outrageous was that he had mistakenly given OUR dishes to the other table without so much as an apology. At the end of the meal, we had an issue with the bill, and he marched over and used an uncompromising and condescending tone towards us. He was blatently unappreciative of our business, so I will  not contribute even one penny to his profit. I feel badly for the serving and the kitchen staff who have to work alongside this racist petty little man. The way he treated us was entirely unacceptable.
