y1PXa8oQSnEHuL7AmwOP5A Ok folks sorry to say but here we go again! This place Sucked! What is the meat in the chicken lettuce wraps? I've been a chef for a long time and never seen anything like that . This is not a Japanese sushi restaurant this is a Korean restaurant which is not a bad thing but it's definitely not a place you want to go for sushi as far as I'm concerned if you want the real deal.
