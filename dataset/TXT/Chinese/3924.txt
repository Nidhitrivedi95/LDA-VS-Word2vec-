_PKXarw3GjlbwbXhjdpUMA Had it a few times, was good until about 2 weeks ago in a Friday at about 8pm.. I guess the cook was in a bad mood...chilli chicken and fried rice dinner meal..basically the lunch special and add an extra two bucks.  After the first 2-3 spoons I noticed the huge chunks of chicken, decided by looking at the pieces I would rather throw away the meal than risk getting sick- but I guess I was 2-3 spoonfuls to late. Will not be going back, 1* because I can't give a zero
