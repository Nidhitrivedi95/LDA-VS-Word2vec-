HV3Q2JYwK9AvMHPYXcxzag Ok folks great Chinese food here!!!! They have a really good walnut shrimp aka crystal shrimp aka mayonnaise shrimp aka honey walnut shrimp. Lots of aliases for one dish! Not as good as Gina's from Big Wong moment of silence........... but very close! I definitely recommend ordering off the Chinese menu! The French style filet is sublime! The filet is tender and delicious! The beef chow fun doesn't disappoint either delish! The Singapore rice noodle is sooooooooooooo good.                                                     I highly recommend going here be adventurous try the Chinese menu the dishes are way better!
