zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ Service was slow in the beginning. Dirty dishes all over the place. However this was disregarded with TWO free appetizers and HUGE portions of the most amazingly delicious Pho! This is worth coming back! Customer service at its finest. 

Turns out they were short staffed this evening. Hence the tables not being cleared when we came in.
