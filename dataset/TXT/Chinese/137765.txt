QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw This is the new location for the old double 10 restaurant on University Avenue. They do individual hot pot, which is great, but for me the biggest and best news is the array of home-style dishes: spicy pork with dried bean curd, eggplant, and delicious homemade steamed dumplings.  We're glad you found a new place, and we're happy to be back!
