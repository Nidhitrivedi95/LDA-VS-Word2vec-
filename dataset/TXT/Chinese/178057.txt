x_4gEfC25uiX21NyYdohgQ I used to live this place but the more I come here and he kore I see the poor mess of customer service. When even I ask for something they look at me as they didn't want to do it. The cashier never gives me any sign of appreciation at all. When I asked for receipt she through a fit. How is that right? 
So I'm not coming here anymore.
