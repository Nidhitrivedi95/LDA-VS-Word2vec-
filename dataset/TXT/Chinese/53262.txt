cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw After reading all these "wonderful" reviews and having a hankering for chinese food we decided to try Yao out. We regretfully ordered somewhere near $60 worth of take-out for the 4 of us tonight. Long story short all of the food was very bland, the shrimp were NOT deveined and FULL of poop, the chicken in the kung pao and chicken chow mein pieces were tasteless and scarce which I'm assuming was because the few pieces included were HUGE, the crab puffs were SWEET and lacking "crab meat"? Why I'll never know, the beef skewers we outright NASTY! Tasteless and tough, the shrimp fried rice was bland and full of bean sprouts which was very unappealing in itself. Our food was also lukewarm and it wasn't from the 1 minute drive home. I will give them 1 start for friendly customer service. Quite grankly I feel that some of these reviews may be fake or paid. If you are craving chinese I would do further research before coming to this place. I honestly feel like we should have just drove to panda express instead that way we at least know what we were expecting. Now I'm out of $60 and all 4 of us are out of a dinner as we refuse to consume any more than the few bites to sample the food. I forgot to mention that after 2 bites of my shrimp fried rice I ended up extemely nauseated and vomited several times. If you do decide Yao you have been forewarned.
