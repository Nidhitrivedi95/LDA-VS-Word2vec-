They take MasterCard, not Visa, but always bring cash just in case.

For native people, I recommend hot and sour sweet potato noodle, hot oil dumpling( hong you chao shou), double cooked pork( this quality is a bit inconsistent), suan dou jiao chao rou mo (the best)

For others, kong pao chicken

Go for lunches, they have great lunch special combos, very good prices.

I don't like their dishes involving spicy pungent sauce, but it's a long time since last time I tried them so I don't know if there is any improvement on these dishes.



PS. I consider myself a pretty native Sichuanese, reason is my parent were both born and raised in sichuan, I was born and raised in sichuan till I was 5 and I used to go back sichuan every 1 or 2 years till I turned 18 and got sent to Canada.

Since I live Downtown Toronto, I used to go to this place when I misses home, back then, Sichuan House does not exist and i haven't visited Hot spicy spicy. Now I have more options, other options like Sichuan house, hot spicy spicy are all pretty authentic, they taste different coz the chefs are from different part of China, for example, hot spicy spicy is Chongqing style, it's a city got separated from Sichuan Province and now it is directly controlled by Beijing, the capital city of China.

And I got a feeling the chef at this place is from Chengdu. But I maybe wrong. lol.
