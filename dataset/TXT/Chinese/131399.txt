Pj9DDbTmjBEKXezLb0qmTw BP street cafe is hands down on of my favorites in Tempe.

Their portions are HUGE and cheap! Some other reviewer said this place is over price?!? I shared an entree , a drink, and an appetizer with someone else , and the total came out to be 11 bucks! 

I'd recommend the laksa and the Malaysian fried noodles for entree.
