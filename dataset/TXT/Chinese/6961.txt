0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw Good food off the strip! The lady who waited on us was the owner I believe she was very friendly and the sweet & pungent chicken had a unique taste unlike any of the typical sauces most Chinese restaurants use. I would definitely recommend checking it out!  I will add that there were a couple ladies in the booth behind us who were complaining that the food tasted "fake" so I guess if you're looking for some fancy Asian bistro this isn't it. But if you want some good Chinese take out style food this is the place to go
