LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA I was so excited to go to this restaurant, based on a recommendation from a bartender in the Grand Canyon.  Unfortunately, after reading the great reviews about the food and the service, this experience really ruined my last night in Scottsdale.

We ordered a crab delight appetizer and the crust was chewy & heavy, instead of light and crisp, which took awhile to arrive.  Fifteen minutes later we were brough the Spicy Thai soup, which wasn't great, yet the best dish we had.

Sitting at the table, being ingnored/forgotten, after we were asked if we wanted the soup boxed up, we sat comtemplating leaving before the rest of our food arrived.  I told my boyfriend that a gal had come (who wasn't our server) asking if everything was okay and I told her we were waiting on 3 dishes and it had been awhile.  He told me he already watched the people who came in behind us eat and leave.  

Our server then glanced our way and made a comment under her breath - 'no food?'.  About another ten minutes, two of our dishes arrived by the hands of someone else.  The cashew chicken was okay, the Mongolian beef was unedible and the lemon chicken tasted like you could get it from a grocery store.

All I can say for the good reviews if that these people must not have exposure to much Asian foods.  We are from Seattle, where there is a huge Asian influence on the palette.  So, if your city is known for Asian food, I recommend skiping this place, if not, you might like it.  However, the poor service was inexcusable and they didn't even apologize for the hour+ wait in a non-crowded restaurant!
