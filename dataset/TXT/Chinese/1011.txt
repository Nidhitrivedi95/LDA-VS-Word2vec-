-Gxe5gKrskrgbWyLkz7UGQ I'm not a fan of buffet style restaurants, so after wandering the streets of Edinburgh looking for somewhere cheap to eat, it was with trepidation that I ended up here.


 This is just the sort of restaurant that I try to avoid, but I absolutely loved this place! The selection of food was incredible and food was served hot unlike some restaurants that use bain maries to heat the food. As well as Chinese food, Jimmy Chung's sell dishes from around Asia. The Thai yellow curry was amazing and I just couldn't get enough of the Mongolian lamb. The dessert selection is a little on the small side; but lets face it, with the amount of food on offer, whose going to be saving themselves for desert! Jimmy's is a chain restaurant, but for Londoners like me the closest is in Scotland- if I'm ever in the area again I won't hesitate to return!
