AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Holy holy holy sweet baby Jesus!!  My prayers have been answered. As a vegetarian, finding quality food that tastes bomb and still aligns with your moral compass can be challenging....which is odd to think, considering that Las Vegas is one of the culinary champions in the world.

Well, after reading many wonderful reviews from my fellow yelpers, I had to wing it.  Because I salivate on a daily basis for delicious Chinese cuisine. Low and flippin' behold VEGGIE HOUSE (angels just floated out of heaven and sang), I'm impressed, I'm happy and I'm in a food coma. 
I literally had to ask two times, "are you sure this isn't meat?"  That shizznit is too legit!! 
If it looks like meat, tastes like meat, then it MUST BE VEGGIE HOUSE!!! They should pay me to let them use this as a logo!

I'm going back for lunch tomorrow, and the next, and the next.

SO down to the facts, 
China Town. 
2nd floor above the market.  
I kinda struggled a wee bit to find this gem, since I don't read Mandarin.
Not a bad place to actually eat. Sometimes, when you find a diamond, it's in the ROUGH, realllll ROUGH.  They have a large selection to choose from...my personal fave so far General Tao - I salute thee.  And the Orange Beef is palette pleasing too!

I got a groupon and they had a yelp coupon, this girl bought them both! 
Go, you definitely won't regret it.
