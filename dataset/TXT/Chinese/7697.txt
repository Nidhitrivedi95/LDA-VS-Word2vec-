0VjHFdczi6Nln_nn8bucJQ I gave Pho Bistro a try and sure was a great choice. Situated on the Eastside, it is the closest Vietnamese restaurant to my home.  I called in my order for take out and the owner took my order. He was very polite on the call and gave me a total on the phone. Bonus points for that. He was very confident on the phone that it was going to only take 7 minutes. That make me smile.

When I arrived, parking was plenty and restaurant sign was visible. it is between Salsa Loca (which I've been to) and a tattoo parlor (which I have not or will).  The aroma of fragrant broth filled the space. 

The owner greeted me by my name (which I thought "how did he know"....but I might have been the only one with a take-out order.) He made sure I have utensils with my order. I ordered A4 2 pc Fried Eggrolls and P1 Special Beef Combination Pho.

Once I got home, I unpacked my dinner and was amazed at how everything was prepared.  The broth was in a stryofoam container/tall bowl with a bag around it.  The Pho veggies (beansprouts, jalapeño, basil and lime) where in a small bag.  The beef/noodles were in a compartmental box.  The noodles were not over cooked and stuck together (another bonus).  The noodle broke up effortlessly once mixed with the broth.  The broth is not overly fatty/oily/salty. The only negative was the fried egg rolls.  They were on a bed of lettuce and the condensation made it not crispy once it got home. Taste great still.

Overall 5/5.
