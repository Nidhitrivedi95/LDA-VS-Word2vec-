8ci0d-HKFK8MgHrf8kPF8g I was on my couch, late at night, pondering what to eat. At that exact moment, a late '80s cop movie was on the tube... I was unsure of the name, probably a lethal weapon movie. Anyway, the scene was two cops on a stake out, peering through closed blinds, waiting for the perp. What were they eating you ask? Chinese effin take out. So what do I do ? I go to yelp.. I find pong pong and boy did I order some stuff. 

The food was VERY hot after being delivered. Pong Pong beef, Pong Pong chicken was ordered... apparently their egg fried rice comes with it. I tried to order it, but the lady wouldn't let me. We shared a laugh. The beef was pretty good, but the chicken was spicy and amazing. I was thinking about giving 4 stars, because the egg fry ry wasn't so great... but It was included so I'm not out anything. 

return customer? heck ya... I love pong pong.
