ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ You can't go wrong with this place as it is literally up the street from my apartment.  The flavor of the broth on the Pork Ramen is very similar to my mom's cooking and it's just perfect!  Loved the soft shell crab they have as an appetizer and it taste similar at an authentic Chinese restaurant with slight alteration to the taste but still LOVE IT!!  I would go there at least once a week if not twice since I can be a little lazy to cook at home after coming home from work late.  I recommend this place to anyone.  The staff is amazing, they know my name, and always excellent service every time I am there!  :-)
