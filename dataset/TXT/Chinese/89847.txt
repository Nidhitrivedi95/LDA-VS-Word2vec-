IBNWrN1k9E0E_bMcRD-GwA Friendly greetings right away! I have been here several times, always at night. NOODLES! 

Anyways, Today we will do lunch special. Server brought out small complimentary "small dish appetizers" where other places normally charge.

I got the tomatoe & egg lunch special. $4.25 !! What??? So cheap!! Yummmy!!! Comes w rice, egg roll, and sweet/sour soup.

Wife got the beef w mushrooms! $2 more but yummy too!!

Hidden away so doesn't have the overcrowded feeling when you go into Chinese restaurants nearby.

Chef/owner cooks the food, Chef Ching, does not have a hired cook, there is a helper sometimes though. But Chef Ching definitely in the kitchen for quality.

Good for groups and table for 4 as well.
