T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw used to love this place, not so much anymore.  The recipes or dishes changed.  The lettuce wraps sauce changed, now it's too hot for us.  So that dish was out.  Shrimp dumplings, changed sauce, not same delish sauce as before, so that dish was out.  actually everything we had was either too spicy now, didn't taste that great or was loaded with cilantro, not everyone loves that herb.  Whoever changed their menu is an idiot.  We wont' be back
