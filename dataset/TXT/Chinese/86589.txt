HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Puttin the burger to the test!

Fat Choy Burger : 1/2 lb Certified Angus Beef Patty, Brioche bun from La Brea Bakery, Aged Cheddar Cheese, 6 hour Braised Beef Short Ribs, Onion Jam, Grilled Tomato and Iceberg Lettuce, Sunny Side Up Egg, Bacon, and Secret Sauce! This was a solid, all around burger with great flavors! My only complaint would be that I requested medium rare, and received an almost Medium Well burger. Didn't care enough to send it back, since I was so hungry and it still tasted good!

I also shared the Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich on Sourdough, Onion Jam, Provolone and Cheddar Cheese. I also liked this sandwich...all the flavor was definitely in the short ribs, just like the burger. I'd recommend the burger over the grilled cheese!

I'd definitely check it out if you are looking for inexpensive eats, and you don't mind the neighborhood and the scenery!
