Ok, everyone is right about the food. However, that is not the prize at Cafe Evo. Now listen, I recently moved here from Oakland, CA. The Bay Area knows alot about killer bubble tea, with tapioca pearls. No one can challenge this. But let me tell you something, Cafe Evo is the only bubble tea within a two hour drive to Chicago that is worth finding. I recommend Banana, Taro, or Coconut and you have to order it as "banana snow with pearls." Shake it up before you plunge the straw in, and try not to suck it all down in the car before you get back to work. I for one, have always devoured the whole thing before I can get five minutes back across town. Pitiful, but incredible. Oh, and don't expect them to be nice.
