TTVXY5vOJDqC0_Je8UhK8A Im in town 8 times a year for the past 4 years. I've eaten at all the Chang jiang in Madison area..   The food is absolutely amazing, tasty and addictive.  Their brown sauce taste very unique in a good way different than any other Chinese cuisine I've been.  They are a carry out place, wish they had an actual dine in area.   Forget all those other Chinese fancy dine in place.   Chang jiang tops them all.
