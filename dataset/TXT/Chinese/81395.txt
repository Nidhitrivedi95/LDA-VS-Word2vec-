gyDTYm_NDWXEHBPGnL-oRQ very crowded but great view of state street.  All the food is very good and inexpensive.  They bring the food to your table after you order and you can leave the dishes and go when you are done.  No tips required which is nice for us but I wonder if it is nice for the employees.  you could leave a tip anyway.  Clean bathrooms are very important and theirs was good last I was there.
