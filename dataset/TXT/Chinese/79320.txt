GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog First off , the food sounds better than it actually is, then the portion are way smaller than average and finally the price is really really over priced. 

The Food isn't really fusion mix, the food quality is so-so. 

The Portion are super small, salad, 4 bites. Pork bun thingy, 2 bites, 

The Price is very expensive for 4 bites of salad. 

I understand the whole concept of quality vs. quantity, but this doesn't apply, quality isn't really there, and quality isn't really there. After eating here, we had to go else where to find a quick bite, because we were still hungry after, and this was a $80 bill lunch.

Seriously, do not go unless you have money to blow! and time to go eat after!
