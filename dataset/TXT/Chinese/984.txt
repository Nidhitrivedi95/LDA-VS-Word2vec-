-GDfRHphXjccSWhliFHnzg My family and I have been coming here for over 10 years.  We've stayed loyal even with our new healthier eating habits,  but we do come less often.  

To be honest dinner service is the best time to go because the servers then are superb!  They are on the ball,  always smiling and remembers previous guests.  The food comes hot out of the kitchen and they are popular for their large King size bowls of congee. Their food is Hong Kong style,  lots of rice,  noodles soup,  stir fried noodles and crispy snacks.  

For lunches they have lunch specials for around $7. They have great Hong Kong cold and hot teas and coffees. Hot coke and lemon drink is great for a sore throat. Although service during lunch is less stellar,  only 2 people serving. After the owner saw us waving someone down to take our order, she ignored us and didn't pass on the messagetop any servers.  Slightly frustrated...

 They have a mean wonton and I almost never order wonton noodles.  For something new you might want to try their baked rice and spaghetti dishes. It's definitely a Hong Kong dish,  fried rice smothered in tomato sauce and cream sauce.  
I recommend the beef brisket and wonton noodle soup with flat noodles (ho fan). Also the seafood congee and fried rice dishes.
