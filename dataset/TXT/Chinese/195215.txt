zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Came in wanting to see what the hype was about with momofuku. Ordered the momofuku ramen ($15) and when it came I was a bit underwhelmed. The bowl was big yet when I saw the actual portion size, I was already desiring for something more. 

In terms of taste, I was quite impressed. The varying flavours complimented each other very well and the dish had many technical aspects to it that had me excited to keep eating. Unfortunately ramen is a comfort food and small portions aren't necessarily comforting. Too bad. 

Service was average at best, but it wasn't bad. 

Would give it a 4/5, mostly on the flavours of this dish, but with the price and service I feel it is a bit undeserved.
