PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Very roomy, well organized and clean were my first impressions of this place. There are several dim sum carts that keep coming around with many classic, basic dim sum choices. The dim sum "specialties" are served at the counter and you can walk up there to order or wait for a waitress to come around and order with her. The owner was very nice. He came over several times to check on us and made sure we were happy with the food as well as the service. He also asked for our suggestions and constructive comments. I have been to so many popular dim sum places in town and generally I never get good customer service. If they're not ignoring your request then they're basically throwing the food on your table and walking away. This place was an exception. I was very happy with the service I received today. Overall, I think the food was good in flavors, selections were various and customer service was outstanding. I will definitely come back.
