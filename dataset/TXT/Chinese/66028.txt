EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw Great food, crappy service.

I really love the dim sum, the fact that it's closer than china town and the that they always have EPL, but it's just the service in this place is terrible.

I'm gonna start picking my servers like gladiators from now on. There's an older south East Asian lady that won't stop talking and the stuff she comes out with is just plain old awkward. She once stood at the end of the table telling everyone how I looked Chinese. I'm European. I think she meant the way I used chopsticks but like I said, you could hear crickets. There's an older south Asian guy that works on the floor too; he just comes across like he's really unenthused to be there, you have to wave him over constantly and he's the reason I'm writing this review.

The owner and his sons are really friendly and hospitable but between the rest of the people working there it's a real crap shoot. I'd give em 2.5 stars if I could because it's 50/50 if you're gonna have a good experience or not.
