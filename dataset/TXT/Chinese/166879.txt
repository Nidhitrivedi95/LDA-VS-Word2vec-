VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA So I finally made it to the DumplingHaus. Tucked away near Macy's in Hilldale mall with a very German name is not where one would expect to get some good dumplings - but here we are all the same! 

The whole place feels very modern with a red and white Ikea/Crate & Barrel feel...it's set up like a standard fast casual restaurant. Order, they have everything written on a board as well as a bunch of specials!

Once you decide grab a table and set yourself up. Grab some utensils, chili garlic sauce, soy sauce (if you need), and some napkins. Have a 5 minute conversation and your order will be served up - piping hot!

We tried the House Bao as well as the Xiao Long Bao. They both were amazing. I loved the Xiao long bao - the ginger really came through. I do think they could have included more soup and they were not served with the correct spoon - but this is minor note as I was having soup dumplings in Madison! 

The House Bao had a light and fluffy dumpling quality with a very good quantity of filling. I loved dunking it in the vinegar with a little of the chili garlic sauce - so good!

This place became crowded quickly but turnover is also pretty good so not too bad of a wait at any given time. A lot of people had noodle bowls so next time I will get some of that action. But as far as the dumplings go - yum!
