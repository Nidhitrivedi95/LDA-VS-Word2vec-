6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ 3.5 stars! I decided to try Donburi for the first time and ordered delivery. Service was great, food was pretty good. Not sure if the lotus chips went soft because it sat in the container for some time (it was at least a 10 minute drive to get to my place) but it was very flavourful. 

I ordered the Curry Katsu rice and the Don Katsu. Seaweed salad, and Lotus chips. All were pretty good for the price. I wasn't over the moon, but I'd  definitely order again if I get another Katsu craving!
