W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ Well I don't know why is this place called Japanese restaurant cause its dishes are so not Japanese. I ordered marinated eggplant and spicy shrimp ramen. The ramen tasted like Thai Pho except they used ramen noodle instead of pho. It  actually tasted like Tom yam gong shrimp instead of Ramen! As for eggplant, I have never ate any Japanese eggplant like this. 
Never gonna step into this restaurant again.

Anyway, it tasted Asian, that's best I can say.
