6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ I love the papaya, avocado, strawberry, banana & watermelon boba and the Singapore noodles. We tried the pork and cabbage dumplings and ehh, I'm not too crazy about it. The wonton noodle soup was ehh too. For a dumpling place I was expecting to be wowed and was disappointed! I would only come back for the boba.
