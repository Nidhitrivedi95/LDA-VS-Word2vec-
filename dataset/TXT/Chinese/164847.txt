UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w After checking out of my room at the Rio, I had about 2 hours to kill before heading back to the airport and car rental place to return my vehicle. 

Yelped up a cheap breakfast buffet and found the Ports'O'Call which was right across the street from the Rio. I was shocked at the price..came out to $8 (taxed too!) total on a weekday, so I wasn't expecting much.

But I was actually surprised in a good way, maybe my expectations were super low but I genuinely had a good meal here. Typical American breakfast food..eggs, waffles, sausages, hams, breakfast burritos, etc Nothing stood out about it, but it was solid. Decent amount of selection..food was HOT. And you can't really go wrong with donuts and breakfast danishes with hot coffee. I fixed myself about 3 plates of breakfast food and was full until I headed back home!

Restaurant is brightly lit. Tables are spaced out and there's a lot of room to sit without being cramped up. Service was good, honestly I had no complaints.

For cheap eats, if you're staying at the Rio/Palms. It's worth dropping into if you want to save some cash (I believe lunch was around $10, dinner $12) I don't know if I would venture all the way out here from the Strip to eat, but it's worth checking out if you're in the area.
