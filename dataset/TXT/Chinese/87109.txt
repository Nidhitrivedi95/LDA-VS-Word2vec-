hRbUkwU9awUan32CD-mdHA I was here for dim sum around lunch time...we got here around 11am.  My friend comes here frequently so the staff were particularly accommodating.

It's child friendly.  Well, technically it's loud, so it's easy to bring kids since it's loud anyway.  They have high chairs and can easily accommodate strollers.

We ordered the typically fare...sui mai, cha sui bao.  It was tasty.  

They have a menu where you tick off boxes and they bring the dishes to you, rather than having the carts that drive around.  I kind of like the carts myself, just for the novelty of it.  But it was still good.

The sign outside is loud and obnoxious.  The interior is a bit more refined.  It would be nice if they changed the sign to reflect the interior, but I guess that's not something that concerns them.
