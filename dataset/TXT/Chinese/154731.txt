This was my third time getting food from this location, the first two times weren't great. The food was okay but the service wasn't good. I thought I'd give them another try since they only opened a few months ago. I placed an online order and when I got there they told me that the chicken and string beans I wanted wasn't available. Okay, no problem, so I picked the broccoli beef. When I brought it back to my office for my lunch, I was disgusted! The broccoli was basically raw, barely even cooked. Some goes for the chow mien, the noodles were undercooked and the cabbage was essentially raw. 

There really is no excuse for such undercooked food! I definitely won't be going back to this location.
