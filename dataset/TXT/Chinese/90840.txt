IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ I cannot for the life of me fathom how such an overpriced restaurant with less than mediocre food and SLOW service has succeeded here in the Mandalay Bay. 2 beers, a flavorless dim sum sampler for 2, and a very fatty, poor quality pork belly bao appetizer results in a $65 bill? VERY small portions. Staff were also unbelievably rude to the hostess, who was about the only one genuinely trying to accommodate guests. Come here again? GTFOH...
