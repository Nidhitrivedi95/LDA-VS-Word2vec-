The menu is easy for a Westerner/Vegetarian to enjoy dumplings at. They come in orders of 12 for pan fried and 15 for "steamed." I was sad that my "steamed dumplings were in fact boiled, though they were still tasty. I especially enjoyed the egg, chive, veg. "steamed" dumpling. 

My friends Singapore noodles looked really tasty as I love curry style noodles. 

They did not take credit card.
