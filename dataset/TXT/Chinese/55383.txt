cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg We are local as in we live less than 3 miles away..i find this irrelevant as if this cozy little family owned and operated little place were 30 miles away, I would certainly make the trip ...but i am so fortunate as to have the advantage of being so close ...a warm quiet atmosphere...but at the end of the day thats not why I am here. It's for the food and oh my ...all the seafood entrees are as fresh as can be as well the extensive  diversity.....it's really hard to recommend a Single or even a couple dishes as all of them are excellent ...it's strange that the best chinese restaurant would be way out on the outskirts of town... but it is..such as it is with all gems..their hard to find. i was just one of those lucky enough to find this one!  .portions are huge as well so the only thing better than really excellent food...is more of it !!   Oh and no msg!!    See you here!! ..chris
