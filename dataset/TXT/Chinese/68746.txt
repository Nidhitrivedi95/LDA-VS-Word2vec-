eV-5b1Bjtnn-QePN3t3taQ What a trek to get to this place. A little ways from the strip but 100% worth the visit. We went to Walmart and thought this place wouldn't be to far or a walk to get to. I was wrong, it was a little bit of a hike on a really hot day and I tell you when we arrived I had definitely worked up an appetite. This food was so good and so fresh. Also very cheap. We arrived shortly after lunch and either could have the lunch deal or get the all you can eat. Coming from Canada we have very few things like this. I'd highly recommend. So much good fresh food cooked in front of you. Odd orange noodles but still tasted great!! Only thing I'd recommend is if they had a premade sauce for you after your stir fry is made.
