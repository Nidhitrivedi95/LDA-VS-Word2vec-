kF1Rr2bMPujucUihlitT2g Excellent!! They just opened so we tried a few different things and everything was really fresh and delicious. Its got a great atmosphere with modern decor for a nice casual dinner. Staff and owner were very friendly. They have a large sushi menu and chinese menu, limited thai (i.e. curry and pad thai) The sushi was great! Same with the curry, it a perfect spice and heat. My nephew had the General Tso's chicken and thought it was really good. The table next to us got Udon noodles that looked amazing and must have been good as they were none left. Thinking it will be my goto restaurant for Chinese or Thai but I need to try a few more things on the menu (especially those noodles). The owner said he's been trying to open it for 2 years but was held up by the city. http://asiagardenoh.com/
