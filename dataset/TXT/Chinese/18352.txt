5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A Easy online ordering. I ordered the pad Thai and pot stickers for pick up.
The workers seemed very confused on who ordered what and who was there to pick orders-- needs organization. They helped others before helping me and I had been standing in line first.
The food was probably some of the worst Thai food ive had. The pad Thai was SO dry and unflavorful, I evn asked for EXTRA spicy. It was not spicy at all! The pot sticks poured out water upon biting or cutting into them, disgusting! 
I will not be going back nor will I ever recommend ppl to eat there.
