hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q This place is a really sweet addition to Pittsburgh's dining options. I thought everything was a cool experience for me because I have honestly never seen anything like this. 

Since I'm not very familiar with Chinese food like this I had a ton of questions on exactly what I was ordering. The waitstaff were very helpful and introduced us to some great eats. We ordered Wood Ears & Sliced Tofu kin appetizer which was very tasty and an ample size for two, keep this in mind when ordering that the noodles and dumplings are very large portion sizes so don't order too many appetizers or you will have to bring home food, we did.

As our main dish we tried the Braised Beef Noodle soup and Dan Dan noodles. The Braised Beef Noodles are in a huge bowl of broth with a ton of noodles. I loved the tenderness and subtle flavoring of the beef that was in the soup. The Dan Dan noodles are "Dry Noodles," but don't let that be misleading you still get a hefty bowl of noodles that are coated in a sauce similar to a peanut sauce with a little bit of kick. 

I'm a big fan of Bubble Tea, and fortunately it is offered here and have to say that your options to customize your Tea to what you like are available. I have actually never had been offered so many options for my bubble tea.

On another note I wasn't sure if they offer forks for us lazy folks, but I suggest taking your time through your meal and sticking to using the chopsticks. I have never  used chopsticks for noodles and it was certainly an experience but fun and made our lunch stretch out a little longer than normal. But if you want a fork I saw some folks using forks on our way out.

Another cool thing is the dudes cranking out in- house noodles and dumplings,it sort of reminds me of making taffy. You should Check it out!
