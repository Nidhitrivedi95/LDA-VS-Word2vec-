M0A8RFdN1UqSd-tIqXFEBQ My Husband & I ate here tonight for first time and we're both impressed. We ordered egg foo young with chicken. They were really light &fluffy with no heavy fried taste, the sauce was right there too. The price was awesome $9.95.. can not be beat the taste or price. Beats Aimlee Chinese by far and half the price. Also had some sesame chicken, cooked to perfection. 

The only thing I would suggest to the owners is ion blinds, people drive by all the time because they think it's closed. 

Looking forward to our next visit,close to where we live and great to support a business that is worth while.
