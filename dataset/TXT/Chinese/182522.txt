XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA This is the best buffet I've ever been to in Arizona.
LOADS of different and rare seafood items including welk, which is pretty flavorless and takes on whatever sauce you decide to have with it. I recommend you dab several different ones on the side of your plate and experiment.
So much to describe, and there are also a lot of standard Asian buffet items.
There's also a sushi bar and oysters. Maybe find out when the oysters come in so you get them fresher. I went there one time and I think the oysters might not have been as fresh. The sushi is professional and made right in front of you non-stop.
It's pricey but totally worth it. I recommend going in for lunch on the weekend (don't eat breakfast) right at 11am and make your experience last over two hours. Trust me, it IS an experience. That meal will last you all day. Don't feel guilty about gorging yourself. I hope you go with an open mind and try something you've never had. Everything is worth a try, just have a plateful of spoonfuls. You never know!
