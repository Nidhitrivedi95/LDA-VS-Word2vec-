W_nU2qtu1AEDDCgkCo0gJg I used to come here a lot but haven't come back until lately. The food is good, hk cafe style with yummy food. Wait for food can take a while esp if busy but it is worth it. The fried pork chop is fried to perfection, moist and nice panko crust on it. The chicken rice dish is amazing as well as a variety of items of dessert they serve.  Good Chinese food for Markham
