KK7H1bVOMAJnDqMhBv2zpA Heard a lot about this place, so decided to give it a try. Like many others who have reviewed the place, it's not much to look at from the outside but once you walk in, it's a whole different story. It looks like it's been recently revamped and most of the diners there seemed like regular patrons. Service was good and the food was outstanding. I was only disappointed with the masala fried rice that I ordered based on the reviews here of that dish. I think Bao Shin in mississauga tops the list for the best masala fried rice in the GTA. Was very impressed with the dry chilli chicken and the yung chow fried rice. A must try if you're in the area!
