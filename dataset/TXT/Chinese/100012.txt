JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA Let me start out by saying that this is the first negative review I've ever felt compelled enough to write after eating at hundreds of restaurants with my girlfriend. Also, as a server for multiple years I know what it takes to give good service. I visited with my girlfriend at 8pm, on October 23rd. I had already eaten dinner and was just going for a quick bite for my girlfriend after her shift at work. We go in and get greeted by a tired sounded host. I still gave him a 20 percent tip because I know how hard work can be sometimes. The total came out to 16 dollars! 16 dollars seems a little pricey for chicken and noodles but it's okay because it was only place nearby and she was hungry. After sitting down and letting her eat a bit, I get a fork to try a bite of her food. Once again, I already ate so I'm not hungry just wanted a bite and I get told, "if you want to buy a bowl you can but don't eat off hers. WTF. The only time I am spoken too for my 20 percent tip is an inconsiderate comment about not be able to try my girlfriends food I paid for. Again I work in the food industry and I know sometimes there's bs rules but there has to be a better way to word that to someone who just tipped you. Ex, I'm sorry to say this sir but company policy says you can't share food, thank you. Well I was offended and my girlfriend knew so she just asked for a box. The same 'friendly man' let's her know that we usually have to charge for this but just this once he will give it to her for free. Like what. This is a consumer world so I urge all the consumers reading this to take your money elsewhere where it is valued. Believe me, I live in this area and there are about a million other places that treat you better than this. And you get more food at a cheaper price! Never again.

UPDATE: the owner has reached out and offered to make it up to me for the visit. I'm impressed with how quick they responded. I'm hopeful my return visit will be better.
