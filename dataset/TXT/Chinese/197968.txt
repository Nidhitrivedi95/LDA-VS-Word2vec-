ZuNJelvkJD4wsXNBRg6t5w AWESOME! The dinning room is nice, very clean. The service is friendly and quick. Our drinks never went bellow half full, our server came by to make sure everything was ok very often and the food was ready extremely fast. The food is on point! Tasted delicious. We had wor wonton soup and yellow curry. Broth and pork are the two complaints I usually have at other restaurants but I didn't have any complaints here. Asian woks broth AND pork was flavorful, delicious! Their chicken yellow curry had the right amount of spice, came with chicken, carrots, potatoes and onion, all cooked to perfection. I am so glad to say that I've found my new favorite restaurant in my neighborhood. I will be dinning in and ordering out very often. Will definitely recommend to a friend!
