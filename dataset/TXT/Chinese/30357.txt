9ad0-8h-DRUheY9dF9rYjQ Used to frequent Pho Dau Bo on Dundas E as my mainstay Mississauga pho for years. However I moved away and during that time my parents updated me that I Love Pho has now taken the cake for best pho in the city.
I arrived on a Sunday evening and there was definitely a lineup, waited about 15min which is unusual for pho in Mississauga I've found. However was it ever worth the wait! The crowd is super Vietnamese, be prepared for lots of fake handbags, wildly painted toenails, and loud sharp voices. The waitstaff speak an obnoxious Northern Viet tone. It's all part of the fun. 
The pho here is definitely the best in the city right now IMO. Great flavor profile with lots of beef taste and just enough msg. 
I haven't had the non-pho dishes so I can't comment on the quality of the menu across the board. I'll come back here for the pho again. 
(on an off note, why is the category of this place listed as "Asian Fusion"? That's an insult, this place is super legit. I hope it's not a lame attempt to be in a Yelp category that non-Asians frequent, in order to get hits.)
