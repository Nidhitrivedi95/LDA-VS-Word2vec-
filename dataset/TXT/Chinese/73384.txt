fJCsDc353UC6eUn-kCBrGw This rating is more for the service and attitude than the food.  Started off by hearing our waitress complain that she only made $150 last night.  My opinion, if you have a complaint like that, don't let your customers hear it.  Service after that was OK, nothing special. Food, as always very enjoyable.  I do agree with previous raters, it seems like something small having the sauce made up at the table, but I know I miss it also.
