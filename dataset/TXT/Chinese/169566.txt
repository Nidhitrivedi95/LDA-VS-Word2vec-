vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q Wasn't really planning on Dim Sum in Vegas but dad wanted to try the dim sum in this county so I was like ehhh okay....he even bought with him a Chinese newspaper that listed some Asian restaurants in the area...therefore we ended up in this restaurant for dim sum. The place was easy to find....pretty much all the Asian restaurants are located near or on Spring Mountain Rd. This is a small dinky restaurant but I was surprised by the hours they are opened - from 10:30 am to 5 am 7 days a week....I figure they don't make much money. We got there just 30 minutes after opening and it was quite and there were already some patrons.

They have the dim sum carts here not the ones you order on a paper so that was good. The food, in my opinion was pretty bad....the lady was telling us the food is fresh and just came out but it was warm instead of steaming hot. The skin of the rice rolls were too thick and the sui mai and beef balls lacked taste. The only dish I liked was the Shredded pork and thousand year old egg porridge...that was hot and just the right texture. The Sticky Rice with Chicken was okay but there was more radishes in the beef tendon bowl then there were beef tendons. 

The selection of food was meager and not a lot of unique dim sum choices but that was expected I guess. The service was eh...they weren't busy but took a long time for them to refill our tea pots. By the time we left, they got a few more diners. This place was pretty weak - but eh I really didn't expect much in the first place.
