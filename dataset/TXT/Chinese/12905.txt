Located in the PATH in the food court underneath the Sheraton Hotel on Queen street. I come here about once week for my noodle soup fix-rice noodles paired with pork wontons with a scoop of spicy broth for an extra kick-for $4.75! Prices are cheap here, everything here is under $7 and although the lineups can be long from 11-2 the service is quick and efficient. I come here for my noodle soup fix and this place kicks thai express's butt any day.
