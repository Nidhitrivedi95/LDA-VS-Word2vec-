n5jTCFF6LqNIAz6Jx5-3tw I eat here a lot. The food is consistent and good, but the service really sucks. About a third of the time I call in to place a to-go order, my call isn't answered within 5 minutes. When I'm at the restaurant, they either seem to be lacking one person up front to handle expediting, taking orders, and handling to-go pickup customers. Today, my food sat at the ready counter (for pick-up) while 3 other employees were hanging out on the other side doing nothing pertaining to work with one cashier trying to handle everything up front. Poor management of resources over and over again. Regardless, I still go back because the food is decent and relatively inexpensive. I would really like to see their customer service improve.
