Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA One of the best bangs for the buck in the Las Wegas!  No that's not a typo even though there currently is a red squiggly telling me to fix that.

Thai beef salad, if you were a woman, I would compare you to Paris Hilton... you are cheap and delicious!!  

Side of fried rice, damn you I can't stop eating you!!!!!

I have nothing else for you, this restaurant is the bomb, it has multiple locations, that's how good it is, people just can't have it one spot.
