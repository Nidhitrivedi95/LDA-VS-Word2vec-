zs710LuQ8y10YsQHIjxjyw Although it's been bookmarked for some time now, my experience with Chinese Dumpling House was the result of a friend questioning my dumpling knowledge on the basis of my European ethnicity. After a fair shake, I still stand by my faithful dumpling purveyor.
Worked my way across the menu and made sure to hit all the quintessential dumpling house classics. Standouts included the pan-fried pork dumplings, cold sliced pork with soy and garlic, and the crispy sweet and sour pork. Heads up on the sliced pork belly, it's sliced thick, and it's covered in almost a full head of garlic, so make sure you're ready to commit to that dish. The crispy pork was out of left-field for me, but it would be a wasted visit if you didn't check this off the menu. Crispy, tender, sweet and savoury - I shamefully admit it was my favourite dish ordered.
We also tried the pancake with shrimp, egg and chives, pork and chive dumplings, lamb dumplings, pork wontons, and shanghai noodles. I was a little disappointing with the stuffed pancake, it fell a little short for me, wasn't that tasty and didn't hit the spot. The dumplings were fine, but not my absolute favourite. The wraps were fairly thick, and had a distinctly floury flavor and the filling on the pork and drive was a little dry. The noodles were fine, but again didn't really standout to me.
Definitely worth a try, the food was fine but just not good enough to steal my fidelity. Surprisingly low prices compared to what I was expecting.
