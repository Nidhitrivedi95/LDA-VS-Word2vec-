awZx3Y1PAwhCUpt3WGZhKg One of the best Cantonese restaurants in Markham. Their menu is HUGE & everything we order here is always spot on. We usually come here when we're looking for some good Cantonese food. Customer service is also not too bad it being a Chinese restaurant.

They renovated 2 years ago, however for more improvement I would suggest a restroom renovation. Overall, a really good restaurant, will come back again  in the future for more!
