njngMI0mhAGJ-kH0oo68Ow Ate here a while ago and didn't really like the food. Read the bad reviews. Knew it was not going to be that great. Decided to go again because I wanted to try something different.

Got this Chinese fish dish that was just absolutely horrible. Fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste. I could make something better at home.

Avoid at all cost. Why go here when there are much better restaurants around.

On another note, apparently they have hotpots there now? Maybe I'll stop by there again just for the hot pot even though I'll probably end up regretting it, again.
