My uncle treated my entire family out when we visited from Orange County.  I was immediately impressed by their cool menu concept.  I have seen tablets where you can order yourself but never for an AYCE place.  It makes it much easier because the chef can get your order in quicker and the waitresses just brings out the items fast.  It was also nice because our party was eight people and they gave us two tablets to order off of.  The menu was organize and easy to find what you wanted.  There was a huge variety and all the sushi was pretty fresh and tasty.  There were also a lot of non-sushi items as well, such as udon, and meats on sticks.  There were a few of us that didn't eat raw fish and they ended up also enjoying themselves and loving the food as well.  We ended our dinner with lots of complementary ice cream.  Overall we had a great dinner and would be back.
