It is fair for me to rate Taste Good B.B.Q. just based on breakfast with no BBQ items at all?? 

Breakfast Special starts from $2.50 with plain congee and fried dough, you will be full with carbs...I am not complaining. 

I am cheap but I am not that cheap...so I opt for the most expensive breakfast choice on the menu!!! Congee with choice of noodle for $3.99! 

Salted Meat with Thousand Year Old Egg was quite disappointing as there was hardly that much egg inside.. to some of you it might be a blessing as they are really high in cholesterol. The congee itself did taste like homemade, but is it good or bad?? Noodles were kind of stale and feel like it has been under the heated lamp for awhile... 

Taste Good BBQ serves food at food court prices and with food court qualities...so If you looking for a cheap meal, you won't be disappointed! 

Lunch Specials starts at $4.99.... but would I be brave enough to try that? I might just stick with their BBQ next time!
