dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ After trying literally EVERY all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant in greater Phoenix, my oldest daughter (my sushi buddy since my wife won't touch any salt-water creature with a 10-foot pole) and I had basically given up on finding a local restaurant with a sushi selection worth the $20+ price.  I am so glad we found Orient Sushi & Grill.  Not only are the sushi options extensive on the AYCE menu, but a wide selection of appetizers AND ENTREES is also included!  We were able to even get Orange Chicken as part of the AYCE sushi menu.  This is more-than-worth the $23.95 price, and for us, the 1-hour drive.
