cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg OK...I've gotta give it up for G&S.  I finally tried it after I had heard from a few reliable sources that it was the place.  They were sure right.  But before you plan your Saturday night around the place I've gotta be clear that the atmosphere isnt going to blow you away when you walk in the door.  It sits in a strip mall between a pool supply store and a Blockbuster and there isnt any of that fancy new Zen asian stuff going on.  Well...at least not well done.  There are a few tacky fountains and some circa 1985 booths and chairs...but that's not what you're going to be going there for anyway.

So we sit down and and inquire about a Happy Hour.  I guess that they dont do that anymore.  OK.  So our first 5 minutes made us think that maybe we should have done Flo's instead despite the fact that we wanted to finally give this place a try.

So I ordered the Chef Special Noodles as well as the citrus chicken thinking that we've gotta go for the specialties if were going to give this place a one time shot.  Two minutes later our waitress tells me that they are out of the noodles so I am already doubting the recommendation.  So I ordered the beef noodles (chow fun) and sat back and waited.

5 minutes later the food comes out.  That was when I figured out why I had heard such magnificent things about George and Sons.  Wow!  The food was amazing!  The portions were wonderful and despite the fact that it tasted so fantastic I still have leftovers for tomorrow (or maybe when I am done with this review tonight!).  Just wonderful!

It was so fresh and so unique in flavor.  You could tell that their "citrus sauce" was the real deal.  It was created there by a cooking genius.  The chow fun was fantastic and although the service was simple...it was wonderful.  No attitude, no ego and very little trendy atmosphere.  Just awesome food in a low key environment.  I will be back!  Oh yeah....I will be back!
