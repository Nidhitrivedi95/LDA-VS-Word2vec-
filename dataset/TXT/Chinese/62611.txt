dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw When you can find authentic Chinese food, Szechuan food to boot, it's a place that you should always remember as a go-to. This cuisine is effing delicious and little havens like this restaurant just aren't too many places.

Not only are they rare, but to experience the food well you really need to be open to new experiences and have someone there who speaks Chinese. It's hard to thrive otherwise.

Anyways, what kind of food can you expect? Well ... let your Chinese friend handle it or go with anything with noodles (they're made in-house) and order some of the cold plates at the counter to start.

My absolute favorite dish was the Szechuan style spicy fish soup. Get some rice to eat with it and you have some TASTY stuff. Order this even if your Chinese friend doesn't want to.

If you're in Vegas for vacay you'll probably be busy with restaurants on the strip. But if you want something different then come here.
