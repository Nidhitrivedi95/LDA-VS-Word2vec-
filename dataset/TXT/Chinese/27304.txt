88RkIuXwJeDzfzSu9xsyzw My favourite restaurant in North York. I have never been disappointed. Large selection of menu items, all of which are delicious. Great Chinese food without the snobby prices of, say, Pearl or Dynasty.

Be sure to try the Peking Duck, Deep Fried Tofu, Beef Noodle Soup, Dong Po pork, and Crystal Pork Aspic.

Or, just order whatever and enjoy it.
