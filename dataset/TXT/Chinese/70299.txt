I got the tofu w/ vegetables special, which was not only tasty, but also the tofu had an amazing texture that I've never found in other restaurants. Unlike most restaurants that have unreasonably high minimum order values for delivery, China Palace has a more reasonable $12 minimum. I'd definitely order from them again on cold evenings.
