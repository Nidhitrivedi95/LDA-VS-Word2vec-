DN4FY9ZLe4TGPtGtQtNhaw hmmm.......... just 2 reviews and 2 stars?!  Guess I came here on a lucky day with good service and picked the right dishes.  "Saliva" chicken is the best.  Don't be scared by its name tho.  It's poached chicken in chili sauce (for most restaurants), but Hot Taste has added sesame sauce.  This is the first time I had this chicken with sesame sauce and I just love it!  The sauce was real goooood!!  Tomato egg noodle and spicy deep fried beef are highly recommended as well.  The spicy deep fried beef was loaded with red chili peppers, and we had to dig out the beef from that mountain of red chili peppers.  The tomato egg noodle was such a refreshing dish after all those spicy food.   If you like spicy, this is the place : )
