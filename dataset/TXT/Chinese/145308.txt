s-p2hqOR47ffQKYzZtMV-A I went here with my friends not too long ago and it was great!

We ordered the baked fillet in white sauce rice dish, and Cantonese fried noodles, as well as fried dumplings to eat. The portions were huge (and we all had to pack it home cause we couldn't finish) and it was very good.
