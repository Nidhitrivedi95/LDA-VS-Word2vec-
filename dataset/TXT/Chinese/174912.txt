wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw This is seriously good Chinese food. I find it difficult to make a trip for a sit-down Chinese meal with my picky-eater friends. So, this rare trip to a real Chinese restaurant with my super-adventurous family over the Thanksgiving day weekend was a real treat. 
After a visit to the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame and not wanting to rush back to Mashed potato and stuffing left-overs, my parent knew there was a good Chinese noodle place with lines down the street most weekdays. My trusty Yelp app gave me turn by turn directions to Wonton Gourmet in Cleveland's "Chinatown" (it's like 5 buildings with Chinese writing within a few blocks).  The photos were really helpful, except the portion sizes were deceiving in that the objects in image may appear smaller than real life!
For 3 people, we ordered the three flavour shrimp dumpling soup with noodles, stir fried noodles with seafood, and MY FAVE: Szechuan fish. 
The fish comes with rice and about 6 whole fish worth of bone-free fish steaks swimming in a bright red garlic and chili broth. There are a few slices of cabbage on the bottom, but this one came home with us and was a huge hit! 
When we got it packed up to go, the server gave us some extra rice! 
How's that for supplementing Turkey Day-after leftovers? Yum!
