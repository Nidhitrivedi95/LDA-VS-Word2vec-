ugksuz0bu6spRFVQE57S2A Ordered through Just-Eat.ca because it was open and our usual Chinese takeaway had already closed for the night. Tried orange beef (good), bbq pork fried rice (better), and General Tao chicken (BEST!!). Good value and order came with free chicken wings, which were good, but just plain. Will order again, and next time I'll be sure to get a side of sauce (honey garlic? sweet and sour?) for the wings.
