8xPmlVJy2o6x0J04CBpEMQ Toast Delight is a tiny, tiny unit on the second floor of the plaza.  The second floor has nearly no traffic and is almost all empty, but luckily you will see the store right away when you enter and turn right.  It's owned by an older asian man who's quite friendly.

Their menu is plastered on the window/wall on regular computer paper, so this could certainly be improved.  That being said, they have an extensive menu of asian waffles.  Besides the original (still my favourite) there is at least 20 other flavours including conventional ones like sesame to outrageous ones like kimchi.  I admire their creativity and appreciate the wide selection.  The waffles will range from $3 to $5 depending on the flavour and as far as I can tell there are no 2 for $5 deals (common for waffles in Pacific Mall).

This tiny space will not have any seating (barely has a little stool for people who are waiting) so this is strictly take-out only.  I'm hoping this store will expand!
