Wu_OmrEyhpllBnTNvOYSGQ One of the cheapest yet most delicious homemade Chinese food places in Montreal. The restaurant is modest and served in a fast-food style counter. The dishes are authentic in flavour and hits home in cooking style. Many students come here for lunch because of its low price and "homecooking" feel. A 3 dish combo is only $6.89 +tax and the same price range goes for everything else on the menu :)
