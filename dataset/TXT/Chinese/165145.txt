UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw Stuck in North Scottsdale at 4:30 when you live on the south end of the 101 is not a good place to be.  Rather than fight traffic, we opted for an early dinner.  After driving around for entirely too long, we settled on Bamboo Club, which I had passed by several times and heard good things about, but never actually tried.  Plus, there was a $10 for $20 worth of food Yelp deal, so we went for it.  
The restaurant is a bit upscale, not your typical fast food chinese.  We were sat in a booth and our waitress came to take our order.  Since we were starving, we had already decided on an appetizer as well as drinks.  This seemed to confuse our waitress, along with several other things throughout the meal.  
We ordered the sampler and everything on it was good, but the honey chicken was amazing!  It made me wish I had ordered it for my entree.  
What I did order was very good, but that honey chicken sure did stay with me.  I actually ordered the Hawaiian macadamia nut chicken, which was in a type of brown sauce with a nice caramel finish.  My boyfriend ordered the Mongolian beef, which is lightly fried and served with a side of crispy spinach.  I did really like both dishes, but I secretly wish I had stolen more bites of his.  
The food was good, but the service was weird.  Our waitress just seemed very strange.  She would walk all the way to our table, then look alarmed and turn in another direction.  When I tried to use the Yelp deal, she wasn't sure what to do.  It might have been the first day of the deal, but the rest of her behavior was really just....strange.  Maybe it was just an off day for her.
The restaurant was good, but I'd say I'll probably just go back for happy hour and that sampler platter, rather than a full on meal.  It was a bit on the pricey side even with the deal (not surprising as we were in North Scottsdale), but I'm not entirely sure it was worth it.
