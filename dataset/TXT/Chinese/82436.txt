H94fBucKEuNKsjbSy7WODg Honestly this place is great!! Me and the Hubs stopped by here to get some food an hour before our movie. It was not terribly busy and they were able to sit us down right away. We ordered Egg Rolls to start us off. Which they were amazing nice flavor and decent size.. 

For the meal I ordered the MooShu with Chicken. 
Hubs order the Kung Pou chicken

So we got our dinner.. the MooShu came with 5 rolled crepe burritos with MooShu sauce.. mouth watering goodness and it was a bite of heaven. 

The Kung Pou chicken was good says the Hubs.. which by the way he downed and took my MooShu sauce. Ha 

Would definitely come back and we made it in time for the movie!
