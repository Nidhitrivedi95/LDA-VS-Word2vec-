5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ I am Chinese, the bf Japanese, and we both LOVE Asian food.  Trust me, we can tell good from bad.  I was pleasantly surprised here!  I really was expecting the worse after reading all the Yelp reviews.  

The bf and I stayed at the Monte Carlo so we did pass it a few times earlier.  Each time looked dead inside, which is a tell-tale sign of a junk restaurant.  There was another party that was just being seated, so we figured it can't be that bad.  We said F- it, let's go.  The waitress led us to the back room which is completely hidden from the front, and this room was PACKED!  Every table was filled, so that gave me hope that maybe this won't be that bad after all.  

We ordered a few orders of Hamachi sushi, the Tiger Maki roll, char siu bao (steamed pork buns), and Hong Kong Style Chow Mein.  The Hamachi was OK, I want to say just a little better than Genki Sushi quality, but I did like that they added avocado on top.  Everything else was fantastic.  We tried the HK Style Chow Mein because we are used to having all the other noodles so often back home, so we just wanted to try something new.  It was pretty good!

Service was acceptable, our waiter wasn't super friendly (not smiling, not really talking story or anything) but he was professional and didn't give us attitude.  It was busy so I didn't expect the server to be waiting on us every moment but he made sure our water was always filled, and brought me green tea when I asked. 

Prices are a little expensive, but hey - we're in Vegas.  Gotta enjoy yourself!  I would come here again.
