HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ As much as I really enjoyed my sushi roll and my service... My entree was just sad. I ordered chicken teriyaki and when it had arrived to the table i was instantly disheartened. The chicken that was supposed to be fresh (you would hope) and made to order, was indeed hard, dry and cracked when you folded it or cut it. I would compare it to a wood chip or a match. I had brought this to my servers attention and he got me started some steak teriyaki instead which was nice of him and very considerate. By the time my remake was arriving to the table, my lunch break was about to be over and I was unable to eat it anyways. Moral of the story: the server was great, the sushi was yummy, the chicken based products... I don't recommend.
