My husband and I got Dinner for 2 (A), which includes: 2 Egg Roll, Chicken Fried Rice, Sweet & Sour Pork, General Tao's Chicken. It was awful. We couldn't even finish a quarter of the meat and the rice was terrible.

The 'egg rolls' literally only have bean sprouts inside. The chicken fried rice is basically MSG and soysauce with tiny pieces of chicken, peas, and carrots mixed in. The General Tao was not in the least spicy as it's supposed to be. The actual sauce was super sweet and they doused it onto the chicken so you could barely taste anything but the way-too-thick sauce. The Sweet & Sour Pork was by far the worst. It tasted fine for the first two bites, but then when the sauce started getting colder, it was horrendous. Again, they smothered the meat with sauce, though not as much as the General Tao dish had, and again we couldn't finish more than a quarter of the dish. Both of us felt sick after having this.

I've had a lot of Chinese food, but this was by far the worst. I'm 100% sure they cater to non-Asians, who either haven't tried or don't like real Asian food.

My recommendation, stay far, far away from this place.
