6W20fKnjqPTSU2irnSVmSQ Went pre theater and pre Tour de Tempe recently and we were seated at the bar. On both occasions the service was lackluster at best. The bar was not clean. There was a cast of characters behind the bar that stumbled all over themselves attempting to serve people but the result of this totally uncoordinated effort was that none of the guests received good service LOL. We waited over 10 minutes for one of our cocktails and it was not a specialty drink. Soup was ok but not hot. Spring rolls were good lettuce wraps were what you expect. The shrimp fired rice dish was terrible. So I am over PF Chang's. Plenty of local restos to support!!
