ZNwEK2OWihq9h8rEUUh_BA This place is simply amazing. I am not one to normally write reviews but I just had to sign up on Yelp in order to give this local business some well-deserved recognition. We live around the area and have always seen this place on Main St. but never actually gone in....we were definitely missing out! The food is to die for. Sushi and sashimi are very noticeably fresh. Portions are generous for the price you pay, not to mention the plating is spectacular. 

What always makes or breaks it for me is the service. The staff including the chef are extremely friendly and attentive, never overbearing. My boyfriend and I are sushi fanatics and we've tried every single sushi place in Newmarket. We normally go to AYCE but after discovering this place, this will be our new spot. 

If you are looking for a reasonably priced sushi restaurant in the York Region area with high quality, this is it! Has a MI-NE feel to its dishes. Doesn't get better than that! We will absolutely be returning.
