01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ My father wanted to try this Chinese restaurant after seeing it so busy a week ago while passing by.  Food was just ok. Most customers in here are from China . So if you are not used to bland I wouldn't be eating here. 
Waitress with short hair and glasses was very nice and friendly.
