Food is probably better than the choices we made. War of wanton soup was delish. Sheschuan  chicken is not tasty, bland, throw away bell peppers, small portion.  Then there is this shrimp dish in "Grand Marnier" sauce, although the shrimp itself was yummy and well cooked, it was smothered in a white mayonnaisy kind if sauce which was NOT appetizing and nothing like Grand Marnier, and made it very hard to enjoy if eatable. Came also w some throw away broccoli. 
I wouldnt order these two entrees again, but will be back to try a couple of other things before making a final verdict, as i am hoping it was just a miss and we will have a hit the second time around.
