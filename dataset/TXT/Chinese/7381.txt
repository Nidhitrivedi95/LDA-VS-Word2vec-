0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Good food at really good prices. I've been here twice now and both times have been consistent in quality and portion (both times at lunch). The hakka fried noodles is a fantastic deal. It's not part of their lunch menu but the portion size is a fantastic deal for the price. The chili chicken wet lunch combo is fantastic - the spices are just right. The combo comes with a spring roll or a pop, which isn't really the best of a side offering but it's a good addition to the main and rice. We usually get the spring roll, and it's a pretty generic one.

The mains are always good - there are so many we want to try when we go back. I'd gladly come back here during a dinner to try their food. The place is always busy and noisy, so be prepared to make friends with your dining neighbour! The owners are nice and the staff is always friendly. I'd say you really should give it a try if you're on the fence. It's probably the best hakka place I've tried in the GTA :o
