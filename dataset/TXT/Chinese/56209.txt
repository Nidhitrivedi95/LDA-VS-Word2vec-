cykzJbkgweJvZsvkrHMR7g Wanted to eat pho but didn't want to travel, this place popped up as closest to us. The Service was ok. Food not great. I ordered pho beef meatball and the noodles were overcooked and mushy. We probably won't be coming back here again. Taking the longer drive is worth it for better quality food.
