_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg The food was ok. I came before when they had just opened and food was great, now they've gotten comfortable and lazy. The "Mexican food" you can tell had been sitting for a while, some trays were empty while others were cold. I stuck to the lo mein, orange chicken, and sweet and sour chicken the whole time because those seemed like the only things being replenished regularly. Getting ice cream is a pain when it's low. If I ever come back it'll be during the dinner rush when the food is fresh I'll assume. I did come about 5pm on a Wednesday.
