VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng The past three times that I've been here, I leave with the worst stomach pains I've ever experienced and the past three times that I've been here, I ate basically the same food. My dad even got the stomach flu from eating here. I guess it's just bad luck on my dad and I's part.

However, I give one star for the service which were always quick to refill drinks and ask if we needed anything. Another star for the readiness of the place for getting new trays of food in and getting the old ones out.
