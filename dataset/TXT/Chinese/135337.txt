QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ This is a quaint, hole-in-the-wall, mom and pops type of place. It's usually not very busy, which baffles me cause they make the best damn baos & dumplings in the city. The owners are very personable and friendly, although there are a few communication problems if you don't speak mandarin. 

As someone who has had fresh off the steamer bao from vendors in China, I can vouch that this is probably going to be as good as it gets for authentic food in Toronto. I am pretty sure their the flour is home made, and bonus points for their Green Onion Pancakes that doesn't taste like someone dropped the salt while making it.

Edit: 
Pro-tip : be patient or speak mandarin since there might be a language barrier when ordering online!
