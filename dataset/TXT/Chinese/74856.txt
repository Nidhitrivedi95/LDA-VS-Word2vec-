fUjMxTfQ72XsoQRUP2tHmA I was skeptical at first but after my first visit my back started to feel much better. And after my second visit my headache slowly starting to decrease in frequency. I would recommend a visit here you are seeking an alternative to surgery and drugs. I would also recommend a visit here for acupuncture versus a massage as acupuncture actually takes the pain away where as a massage is only a temporary relief.  Dr Kim is excellent.
