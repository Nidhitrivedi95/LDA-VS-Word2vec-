VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Having lived in the near Flo's for over ten years, we frequently (twice per month) have gone there or ordered via telephone since that time.  Most of the time service is good; however, I have had my trepidation since they typically hire 14-16 year old employees working at the counter.  Tonight, I ordered sizzling rice soup via phone and when I got home it was definitely not sizzling rice soup.   When I called letting them know there was a mistake, I was placed on hold and then the gal who took the order got on the line, and said, "I repeated your order twice, and that is what you ordered."  I was taken aback, since that is not what I ordered and it was not repeated.  Again, since I have ordered here, so many times, I expected to politely disagree with her assessment, and then be compensated for what I ordered, however, she was really rude.  At that point, I hung up and agreed with my wife to not order from Flo's again.  I was so frustrated that they would argue over something like $2 or $3 difference in price for a long time customer.  Now,  they lost over $100 per month (small, I know), but my neighbors and customers will also learn about the rudeness and arguing that occurred. Again, I am usually very tolerate, but don't need to be treated like a moron (and basically called a liar) to pay money for food.
