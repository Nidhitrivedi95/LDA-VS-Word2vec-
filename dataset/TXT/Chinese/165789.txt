V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA Great food at reasonable prices.  
Had dinner last night - kids had pasta & breadsticks, and I had pasta primavera.  Great flavor, veggies were fresh & still had a little crunch to them- not over cooked at all! My kids loved the pasta & breadsticks.  Restaurant was busy -it was 7:30pm Monday- but there was plenty of seating.  Noise level was loud, but expected in a casual, order & sit family friendly place.  Tables were cleaned immediately by staff, and the soda fountain area was also well stocked & clean.  
Desserts were really really good (cannoli & chocolate chip cookies), but I thought a little expensive (abt $5/cannoli).
Overall, a great place to eat!  Definitely coming back!
