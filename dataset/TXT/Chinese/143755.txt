rQ6C54q1N2iq9iDKSA3QGA I have been ordering from New Dragon for years! They have never let me down! My fiancé and I are within their delivery range now! Great for my taste buds! Bad for my waist! It's damn good food. 

My best friends own a Vietnamese restaurant. I'm a little bit of a food snob. Their Kung Pao Chicken (no celery, spicy 20/10) will feed you for days. Get the Thai Spring rolls too! Omgosh, Egg Foo Young too! 

Just order everything and have a buffet! You will not regret it!
