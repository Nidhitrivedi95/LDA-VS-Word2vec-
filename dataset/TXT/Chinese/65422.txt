EbgUkmDxPUa2fr0rc8EFJQ Great service!!! Average tasting food. I personally prefer the taste of my hometown "happy china" and was disappointed because it was talked as if it was soooo superior but it wasn't bad at all. It had a ritzy feel and everything was really nice and clean. Service was great!!!
