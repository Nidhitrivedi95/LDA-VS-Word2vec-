U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ I work pretty close to this restaurant and came here on a Tuesday during my lunch break craving some pho. To my displeasure, it was closed! :( Tuesday is such a random day to close for business especially with all the tech companies nearby. 

I came back on a Monday with about 1.5 hours to do lunch. This time, the whole place was packed to the brim with people spilling out the door. Oh no! I hurried to a server asking if I could be placed on a list. She pointed to the door where people were scribbling their names down. And of course several parties who came after me were writing their names down. But, I don't blame them, being busy is a good thing! 

After waiting for almost 10 mins, I saw someone sitting alone on the counter bar. I asked a server if I could sit there solo. Not particularly pleased about the confusion, I decided to give the food a chance.

It came out within 10 mins of ordering so I was happy about that. I ordered the pho with everything in it and thought the meat and broth tasted very authentic. My server was also really nice and made sure that I was doing okay perched on the bar. The quality of food and the kind servers will definitely be bringing me back for lunch in the future!
