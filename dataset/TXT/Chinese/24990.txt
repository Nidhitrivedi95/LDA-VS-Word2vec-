74wRr6PP6lbaL1YzUcYGAA The owner cracks me up lol I managed to call the fax number and not phone number a couple of times when tryng to place an order, now he always jokes with me when I come in. 

I have been going there since I was in highschool and all in all it's solid food nothing exciting but you get what you paid for. 

This resturant has a lot of sentimental value for me. In this resturant  my boyfriend first said he loved me. So Golden Palace Buffet will always have a special place in my heart. 

 The food is okay I especially like their combination lo-mien I have never had any of their speciality menu selections.

I enjoy their hot and sour soup and orange chicken is tasty hunan shrimp and beef and brocoli. 

For Chinese food downtown it's pretty okay
