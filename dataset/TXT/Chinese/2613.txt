_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and did not have to wait. The restaurant is roomy, nicely laid out and attractive. I particularly liked the pretty changing lights on room dividers. There were so many rows of items to choose from that everyone found lots ot love. My dad had steamed crawfish, a surprise he was really happy about. He said they were very good. They serve lots of good seafood, including crab dishes and a baked salmon that my son said was "amazing." My brother liked the sushi selections and all the fresh fruit. I even saw enchiladas and pizza! There was also a grill section that we didn't try, being overwhelmed by all the other yummy dishes. The waiter who brought drinks and cleared away plates was very friendly and attentive. At $6.99 for lunch and $9.99 for dinner (excluding drinks), Hibachi Grill Super Buffet is a winner! We're planning on going again this weekend.
