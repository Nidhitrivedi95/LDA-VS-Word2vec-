XGX5LW0s-OpjmOpVXXYshg When I want to take one of my less-versed-in-chinese-food-and-very-white-relatives to a place they can feel comfortable in, I take them here. The menus are easy for them to understand, its clean, well decorated and modern feeling inside and the service is accomadating (if a little hard to attract sometimes). For me, however, the food seems a little overpriced for what is, in the end, pretty good (but not exceptional) non-region specific chinese fare. The dumplings are good, as well as some of the fried noodle dishes. Also if the restaurant is at all crowded, expect it to be loud.
