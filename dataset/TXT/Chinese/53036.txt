Being from NYC I'm very biased when it comes to Chinese food. Admittedly Joyful is better than all the other Chinese restaurants I've tried here in the Scottsdale.
The shady practices come in when I placed an order to go. Total, $42.40.  Seems there credit card "swipe" machine was broken and had to make an impression by hand. Ok, no problem.Order was filled I signed the receipt for the $42.40. Two days later I go to my bank to withdraw money and check balances. To my surprise Joyful took the liberty of charging me $742.40!!

I'll cut to the chase. Joyful denied charging me this amount even as I showed them my bank statement and had them speak to an associate from BoFA. 5 days to clear up by stopping payment, filling out reams of paper work etc. A nightmare that could have been handled easily by Joyful by looking at the facts/checking them and refunding my 700.00. 
They've lost a customer. Unfortunate because it took me a year to find adequate Chinese here in AZ. 

The search begins anew.
