yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw It's been awhile since I've gotten Chinese take out.  After a long day of hiking and exploring in Death Valley, this was my option to relieve me of any cooking duties that night.

I did not phone ahead but walked in cold.  I ordered the hot garlic chicken with no spice level for my wife who doesn't do spicy.  For myself, I got an order of Singapore noodles.  I had a seat at one of the tables and in less than 5 minutes, one of the employees was there with my order.

The rice and garlic chicken were packed in standard take out containers now made without wire handles.  My noodles were in a styrofoam box.  The bag had napkins, soy sauce, and plastic spoons.  

Both meals were good.  There was a good amount of chicken, beef, and shrimp with my noodles.  The sauce with the garlic chicken was OK.   My wife liked it and I took a taste.

I'll return to China Gourmet.  It's not a far drive and it's another option for a quick dinner.
