As I got older and busier I discovered this place.  WOW. It's great.  My friends and I come here and order a dish each and we share. This is a typical family style Chinese Restaurant.  I love everything that my friends and I have ever ordered here.  

The reason I gave it 5 stars is because they have good service and it's clean but still have that legitimate Chinese food.  I have never waited to get a table.  I recommend Salt and Pepper anything: from Pork Chops to Tofu, its all good.
