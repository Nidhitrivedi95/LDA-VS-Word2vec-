L_tieGcFMQVSmk7XiA093A I've had a lot of hot pot in my life all over Canada and the world. This one was a huge let down.

The spicy broth is lethal even at the mildest level, so I would recommend a cleaner broth.  

Freshness-wise, not bad. Ventilation is really bad so if you're going in on a hot day, prepare to suffer as there are no overhead vents or air conditioning: the sauce selection is decent but a lot of it isn't fresh. A lot is pre-chopped and packaged. The satay sauce is also a bit off.
