2Q89PhkcyT9uZnQORmqMKg I went there to get a quick snack on a Sunday afternoon. It was packed with people.

ENVIRONMENT
It was very loud.  All I could hear was voice of people from other tables.

SERVICE
Service was horrible. When I was asking what size of congee to order, my waitress gave me a shrug and didn't seem to care. When I asked her to show me size of bowl that comes with small congee, she went to table beside me and yelled at me.
She was yelling at me entire time I was ordering.
It seemed to me that she really wanted to order faster or she wanted me to get out of the restaurant. 
When I finished eating, I saw her yelling rudely at other customers as well.
Definitely I would not go back to this restaurant again in the future.

FOOD
I've ordered their "Singapore style fried turnip cake" and their Congee. I've had much better food.
Turnip cake was over-fried. If you go up in North York, I can at least list two places which has much better taste than their turnip cake.
Congee was decent, but the meet inside it was a little bit undercooked.

PRICE
To get full for one person, you need at least $10.
Turnip cake was $5.99 and their small congee was $6.99
