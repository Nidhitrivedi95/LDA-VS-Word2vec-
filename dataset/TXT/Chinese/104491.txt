KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ Beautiful restaurant, unspectacular food, absolutely not worth the price tag.

Ok, I get it.  Vegas is expensive.  Sure, fine, no problem, I can deal with it; so long as I'm getting something great for my money.  The problem with Pearl, is that I wasn't amazed, impressed, or surprised by anything.

Came with my wife and her sister.  We ordered spring rolls, dumpling sampler, and minced shrimp (lettuce wraps) for apps.  Spring rolls were good, but basic.  Dumplings were good, but there were only 3 of them.  3?  Really?  Isn't it like $10 for those 3 dumplings?  The shrimp lettuce wraps were good, but i was surprised they came with iceberg lettuce and not bib, or something a little nicer.  Again, this is supposed to be high end stuff, isn't it?

We ordered 3 entree's and shared.  Some sort of shrimp and some sort of chicken, can't ever remember names or specifics because they were boring.  Paid $25-$30 each, same stuff could be got at PF Chang's for $12-$15 and twice the amount of food.  Ordered the one duck entree on the menu and was informed that it was a cold dish and more of an appetizer style, server offered to make an off menu hot duck dish; this ended up as the one highlight out of the entrees.

Split some cheesecake for dessert, above average.

The restaurant is beautiful.  The service is fantastic.  But the food falls a bit short.  The simple fact is; this is Vegas, one of the highest concentrations of high end dining in the world.  Several of the best dishes I have ever eaten were had in this town; but none of them at Pearl, not even close.
