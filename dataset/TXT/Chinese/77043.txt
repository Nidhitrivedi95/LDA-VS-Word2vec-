gdb4gmSI5eJcuXLZ3BfgtA Super disappointing. I've ordered from this place twice now. First experience wasn't great but thought it was a bad night. Tonight ordered almond chicken, chicken chow mein, and pot stickers. Took an hour and a half to get my food after calling back and being told 20-30 minutes. Food was cold, pot stickers soggy, most of the food was carrots and celery. Fried rice is literally just rice pan fried with maybe a little egg, don't expect actual fried rice. On top of this all, they spilled the soy sauce and the entire bottom of the bag was filled, and food containers soaked in soy sauce. I will never order from here again.
