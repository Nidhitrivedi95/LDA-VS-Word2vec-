U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q The decor and atmosphere of this place is awesome and that's what initially attracted me to in while staying in Caesar's. Cool fish tank, nice decor. Everyone is dressed in all white and the entire restaurant is decorated in white. I tried a beef and noodle dish which was just okay, lacking any real flavor. I was really hoping for more and since it's Vegas it was pricey. I think my bill was somewhere about $35 for my meal and a beer.
