QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ Yummy Yummy Dumpling certainly lives up to its name! I came here for dinner with my husband on our last night in Toronto, and it impressed us so much that we came back the next day before we left to get brunch! Each dumpling is handmade with care and cooked to perfection - I really liked how the wrappers for each type of dumpling (steamed, boiled, and fried) are made differently for each different cooking method yielding crisp potstickers, delicate and toothsome steamed dumplings, and tender and tasty boiled dumplings. We also ordered some appetizers while we waited as the owner made our dumplings - all the vegetables were nicely seasoned and incredibly fresh. Overall, a wonderfully homey and delicious meal - I wished that we could have bought a bag of their frozen dumplings to take home!
