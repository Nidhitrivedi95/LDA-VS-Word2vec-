PTPd2xamYtUCH00NqML-YA Came here during Chinese New Year with a friend who recommended this place.

We ordered 2 X 4 lb lobster specials along with several other dishes.

One of the orders was prepared fried with Maggi sauce which made it crispy and the other one was your regular green onion/ginger sauce.
