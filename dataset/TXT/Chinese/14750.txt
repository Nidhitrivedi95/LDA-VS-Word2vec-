Our favs so far are China Chili on Flower Street and Shangri-La on Cactus Road - neither of which are near a hop-skip and a jump from us. We tried this place and while it was not bad, there was nothing that stood out about it. Flavor wise everything we had was bland and lacking seasoning. We had the pupu platter (basic fried items served with jarred sweet and sour sauce), sizzling rice soup (with barely any chicken - basically all rice and the rice was over cooked, perhaps even slightly burnt), orange chicken (mild flavor with more veggie than chicken), pork fried rice (slightly greasy and bland) and crazy hot beef (which was neither hot nor crazy with more veggie than meat). On a positive note, despite the food, the service was great! The staff was very attentive and friendly and had it not been for the mediocre food, we may have gone back based on the service alone, but alas we continue our search.
