ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg The food was prettyyyyy damn good.
We had spring onion vermicelli which were de-lish, some congee, bubble tea, pork chops and shrimps. All of this was pretty good and cheap.

The service however was real bad. The waiter was very rude to us even though we're really easy going customers. 

Don't know if the food balances out the bad service :/
