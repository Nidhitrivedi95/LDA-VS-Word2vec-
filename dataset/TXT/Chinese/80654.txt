GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g Having Been to Many 5 Start Restaurants and this place is NOT one of them. Food was nothing more than Panda Express at $26-40 a Plate. Was not worth it. Went on 5/28/2016 and there were only two other customers inside. Asked for condiments, which was about a 10 minute wait. Food was not good. Nor was the service. Host was awesome! Will not recommend this place to anyone. Try Samba, CPK or others. FIN is a NO GO!
