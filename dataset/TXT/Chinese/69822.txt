F06m2yQSPHIrb1IT7heYeQ No need to go to china town or Gold Coast for cantonese style Chinese food, if you live on the south west side of town (the new China town). The food is very clean and tasty, doesn't seem they use MSG and if they do, they don't use a lot of it. I got the beef stew noodles and it was pretty good. The service was excellent along with the tea!!!! Don't drive to china town and check this place out!!!
