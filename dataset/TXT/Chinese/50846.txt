Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA If I could give my experience here as a to-go order a 0 star, I would.

READ: For all CES attendees 2015, please do not frequent this establishment. Go to Cioppino's (sp?) just down the block - half price, three times the food (and they actually will fulfill your order).

The context:

I called PF Chang's to-go # after a long day of travelling. I waited forty minutes, which wasn't a big deal, and arrived on time. This is on Sunday, January 4th at 8:40pm.

At 9:10 (yes, thirty minutes after I was supposed to be out the door with my food) the bartender told me she "just entered it into the system."

Honestly, this is what happens when a chain centralizes ordering.

I have never had such a cold staff respond to my very even-tempered feedback that it is unacceptable to be thirty minutes late - and not to fulfill an order! I mean, I was just SITTING there for thirty minutes and no one followed up??

Shame on you. I'd fire your manager and the entire chain of ticket-holding for this transaction. I'm glad I left, and got twice the food at half the cost down the street.
