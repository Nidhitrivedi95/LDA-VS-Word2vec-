DPoXCmKt5PNXEpZNirg96w Delicious food. Super clean and attentive server. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge! I had the chicken fried rice and my friend had the spicy shrimp noodles. As an appetizer, we went for the chicken pakuras (I think that's how you spell it). We has a wonderful time and are definitely thinking of visiting<U+200B> it again! 

I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a nice Chinese/Indian restaurant
