IDPbmH1OIhEbb9OIQyDJgw this place is probably one of the, if not the, best vegetarian restaurants in toronto.  they do dim sum too although it can be quite starchy.  they do lunch and dinner.  this place will get very busy when there is a full moon.  reserve when that is the case.  i think they have cut down on the msg but gourmet vegetarian rest uses a lot of mock meat stuff from taiwan which do contain msg.  they make an awesome eggless fried rice which is hard to do without eggs.  the menu can be quite daunting since there is so much stuff on it.  also be aware that some dishes are really the same but cooked in a different way or made with a different sauce.
