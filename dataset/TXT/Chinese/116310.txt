n72smZw1iVORdnjGfFT0FQ Although I couldn't savour Richmond Court's array of in-house treats, I had the opportunity to taste their Mango Mousse cake, which, I must add was the ultimate desert option and immediate salvation to thine soul. I must've experienced divinity everytime I took a bite. The 5-star rating is, as a result, exclusively for their cake. A wise man once said, " to predict the quality of a crate of apples, just sample one." I am sure this would apply in this case as well.
