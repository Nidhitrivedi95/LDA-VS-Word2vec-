fvnaLCkyIyCw7vQuO8-H3g Amazing food here. Service even better. Main waitress is able to speak in different languages. Think this place might have the best sweet and sour pork. Their seafood dishes are all good too. Super good and quick service. I'm usually here with my family and get the waitress to recommend dishes of the day. Never disappointed!
