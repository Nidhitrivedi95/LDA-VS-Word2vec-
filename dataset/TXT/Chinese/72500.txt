And that's when I say, "Thank God for the sampler plate."  This enabled us to try three different kinds of the steamed ones and three kinds of the pan fried.  My favorites were the steamed pork and cabbage and the pork and chive, which if combined, remind me of the soup dumplings that I love, minus the soup.  There was also a pork and fennel dumpling that I ordered out of curiosity, because I didn't know Chinese people ate fennel.  I am not a big fennel fan and that didn't change my mind.

 The fried ones were good, too.  I liked the way they were presented on the plate; served upside down with the brown bottoms all somehow melded together into one continuous surface until they were manually separated. 

I have definitely had fancier gourmet dumplings with thinner skins and more interesting fillings, but this is still a good place to have some old fashioned dumplings, the kind that remind me of the ones my grandmother would make at home.  Besides, there is a picture on the wall of Lang Lang with the owner, so this place has to be good, right?
