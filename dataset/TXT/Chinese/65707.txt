ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw Went in for a Sunday afternoon lunch about 1 PM. The place was about a third full so no wait time at all. It must've taken 20 minutes to get our food and half of the food came out cold. What's wrong with this picture? A mostly empty restaurant with late food and cold food.  And customer shouldn't be treated like this .....get your act together Pei Wei.  You are a national company that should have much higher standards across the board
