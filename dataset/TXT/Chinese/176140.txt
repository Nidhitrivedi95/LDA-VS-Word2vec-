WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg If you are in downtown Toronto and want to grab some cheap lunch. This is the place to go. Lunch special is about $6.99 and they have like 30 items to choose from. From their famous chilli chicken to some crazy ass Chinese shit. 

Just one advice. Stay away from this place during pay day. That will usually be Thursday or Friday :-) This place is like a zoo during those days.
