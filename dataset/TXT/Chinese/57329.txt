I still LOVE the Thai beef jerkey and the nasi goreng. I order these every time without fail. Their Boba slushies are also very good. A friend of ours who has come several times seems to really love the curry. 

The staff here are always friendly and attentive. I like that they will still refill your water even when you've already paid the bill but are just hanging out catching up with friends. It shows that they appreciate their customers and are not trying to rush them out. We have used the point card religiously and have gotten the $10 off coupon 2 or 3 times already. 

My dad is one of the pickiest eaters out there and when he and my mom visit from Hawaii, this has been one of his favorite places. Take it from me, but also take it from my dad, when we say this place is awesome.
