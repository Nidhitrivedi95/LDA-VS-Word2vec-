-M9S1wlZTvv6T9EOo5X2Yw Came here on a Tuesday around 10 am and waited for about half hour for a table of three. Which isn't too bad.
Place is nice with great lighting and environment, like a typical dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong - busy, a lil nosy but fun!
Service was kind of slow, food took forever to get to our table.
After a while we looked at our bill to see what was missing to realize the waiter at the beginning who took our order forgot to circle 3 items on the menu, therefor it was not entered into the system.
We bought it up the manager, Ken, who had to audacity to blame us for not checking and bringing this up a hour later after we sat down. First off, it's not our fault, I should not go to a restaurant and check our bill ever so often to realize things were not entered in your system when it is your job to check this over.
Secondly, it wasn't till we bought it up that our food was taking slow that you finally mention to us that the system is down in the kitchen hence the slowness.
Thirdly, he never apologized for a mistake one of his staff made.

Overall, a decent place to go to go, would definitely go back, but very very unsatisfied by the attitude of the manager.
