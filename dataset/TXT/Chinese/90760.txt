IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Please read, and listen to the reviews already published.  We, unfortunately did not.

Our review is primarily based on one menu item that we shared ... Malaysian Laksa Rice Noodle Soup.  This is described as a "Fragrant Coconut Curry Shrimp-Based Soup Served with Assorted Seafood".  $21,00 and plenty to share with an appetizer.  Sound great, right?

Reality .. a faint hint of coconut or curry, four medium shrimp hidden among the noodles and some "balls" of something.  With inquiry of our waiter, these were described as "Fish Balls".  This is considered ASSORTED SEAFOOD?  Really?!!

We asked for the manager to discuss the total mis-representation of this dish.  Fish Balls count as assorted seafood.  

He offered a minor discount, but should have just comped the entire dish.  We were too disgusted and disturbed to argue and continue a pointless conversation.

Don't go here.  There are better options.
