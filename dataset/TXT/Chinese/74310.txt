We came with our baby and we felt so unwelcome. They offered a high chair and it was the most unsafe and annoying high chair I've ever seen. It came with a silver pan tray so anytime she pounded on the tray, it would make this loud sound that bounced off the walls. It was quite annoying and people in the restaurant seemed annoyed too. So we told the waitress we will just order take out, which made us feel more awkward while we waited for our food and service practically ended while the employees just watched us - my hubby sitting down in the booth and me trying to console my fussy daughter, walking in the front of the restaurant. Awkward. 

We ordered the shrimp fried rice, the shrimp with lobster sauce and house special beef. The food was delicious! The fried rice had whole, tender, succulent shrimps. I was pretty satisfied. I just know I'll be just ordering take out and not dining in next time.
