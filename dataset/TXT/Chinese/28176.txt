8keN8Z2sylAEXgMCJMQpDg We have been there about 6 times since it's opening. The food is perfect each and every time. The owner is a great guy very friendly and he will custom make an order if it's not busy. But if you go during busy times have some patience because they get really busy. Thats because it's so good you won't be disappointed.
