CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw Came here to eat here on a whim, since I heard from few friends that the food was really good, arrived here got seated quickly and were provided excellent service from both Catherine and Bailey. We ordered the shrimp and pork shiu Mai, Dan Dan mein, Hakka fried rice, and the superior wontons, everything came out on a timely matter along with being delicious!!

Would definitely recommend!
