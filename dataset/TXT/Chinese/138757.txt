Qqu_MRaus17-4VVmzXq1_g 5/6 of us got food poisoning after a seafood combo lunch from this restaurant. The egg yolk battered oysters had lobster shells in them. 
The male server was extremely rude--asked us to pay the bill when the last dish wasn't even served. I actually wanted to call the manager and complain about him, but didn't want to ruin his livelihood if he has a family to take care of. But a restaurant that tolerates his kind of behaviours and serves food that's gone bad will not survive long.

This wasn't my first time here but will be my last time.
