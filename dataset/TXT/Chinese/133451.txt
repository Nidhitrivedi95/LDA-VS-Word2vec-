px2l_fl2_LlVthj50T7o2g Cashier is very unethical. The cook was very nice & hospitable, he brought the our food & offered if we needed anything else, thats why I am giving a 2 star. But I have to say the food they serve is nothing to have me come back. I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad. Literally, school or hospital food is better then what I got. My salad was just lettuce & fried chicken on top. Literally.
