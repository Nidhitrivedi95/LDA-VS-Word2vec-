liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA If you have read my reviews on regular basis, you know I rarely pay for food at Vegas Casinos.  In my opinions, you can get much better food/values dining else where, i.e., not in the casinos.  

This was an over due review as it was part of my birthday offer (along with $$$ slot credits) from Venetian/Palazzo back in March.  I used it twice so I had dinner here twice.  I agree with some of the reviewers that the price is high for what you get (thus, why I don't eat in the casinos unless it's free).  Although this restaurant also calls itself a Dim Sum restaurant, I would not recommend having dim sum here. (Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast offers much better dim sums)  The selections are very limited and I don't think they were made in-house (judging from the appetizers we had).  

The decor is very typical Chinese, red and dark wood.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=x8ygrCywG3_FWAUwKibbmw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=akOesnzeDGBQ0AXJvXos6A.  We had the Ultimate Dinner for 2 (Prix Fixe) as followed:

1)  Course # 1 Appetizer - Egg rolls, Sui Mai, and Pot Sticker.  Like I said, earlier, these taste like store bought.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=NZO7p2uF35vjc-pXrXaXxQ

2) Course # 2 Chinese Lobster Salad in Citrus Dressing - You get about 3 little piecesof lobster.  Dressing is a bit tart.  I think they could have used better salad for this dish.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=TMj9z4crBk4a3qJ_IxUHUw

3) Course #3 Soup - I chose Hot and Sour Soup and my fiance had Wonton Soup.  Both are pretty good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=UaH4RErpnUy1YWgXD_3VXw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=L9XBjVOcoFG-T4Si3I7FpQ

4) Course #4 Entree - I had Prawns with Candied Walnuts, Fried Rice (with Shrimps and Scallops), and Veggie.  I thought they were very good.  The mayonnaise was just right http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=I2qhcjAAmLmhfh_mH20JgQ My fiance had Pepper Crusted Beef Tenderloin, Frid Rice, and Veggie. The beef was melt-in-your mouth tender with great flavor.  One of the best cooked beef I've had.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=oBYWMt8cnovjjuYwbjtzgw

5) Course #5 Dessert - 1 tiny piece of mochi ice cream.  I love mochi ice cream.  They should have given 2.  :) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=Xtvk_sDxgkMn0gpx9wxFmw

I might be biased in giving this place 4 stars because I didn't have to pay for the meals.  But I thought the quality of our meals was really good and price was on par with what you'd expect from casino restaurant.  Service was very attentive.  Come here for their regular entrees and not Dim Sum and I think you'd be fine.
