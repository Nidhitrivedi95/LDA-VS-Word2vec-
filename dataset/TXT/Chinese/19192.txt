She took very good care of our order, and recommended the beef noodle soup. The soup was fantastic! The broth was flavorful and rich, and the beef, despite having some parts that were difficult to bite through, was very good. We ordered some dumplings as well, which the cook came to let us know that they were out of, so it was deducted from our check, but they gave us some other dumplings instead. It was unexpected and pleasant.

I was a bit surprised to see hot tea in plastic drinking tumblers, but it was still good, and I've seen it done in a few other restaurants. Use your common sense and don't just grab the cup immediately if you ordered hot tea!

Definitely a good place for an evening meal, and I want to go back and see what their other menu items taste like.
