7toYPf5ZAjCkEuwaMPtDwQ Wow.  I was really surprised to find any positive reviews for this place, let alone so many.  This is overall one of the very worst restaurants I have ever been to.  We stopped here on a whim just because we saw it as we drove past and we were hungry.  This experience makes me understand the people who prefer to always eat at chain restaurants so they know what they're getting.

My companion had wanton soup and szechuan chicken; I had hot and sour soup and vegetable chow mein.  Her soup was so bad she didn't eat it; mine was also not good.    Hot and sour soup is one of the things I always get to test out a new Chinese place, and this is one of the worst I've had.  It had a very cloudy appearance, almost like gravy.  Neither of our entrees were good.  Mine was almost exclusively bean sprouts, and had not much flavor at all.  Hers just had a bad taste.  The worst were the sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard they keep on the table.  They were so watery and oddly dark brown.  I didn't want to eat anything on my plate that they touched because it seemed like they must certainly be spoiled.

The service was fine.  The bathrooms looked clean, but smelled awful, like rotten food.
