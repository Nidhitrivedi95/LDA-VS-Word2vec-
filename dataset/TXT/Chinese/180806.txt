x8O-Mll5ksDpeIgtA0XY-w PEOPLE! DO NOT EAT THERE! They are NASTY! I went into the men's room, saw an employee leave out a stall and just walked out! NO HAND WASHING AT ALL! After wards I took the issue to the Manager/Supervisor and she got very indignant with me! She said if I don't know who the employee is, to mind my own business! I said maybe he's in the kitchen...HELLO!!! I told my wife about it and we DID NOT finish our meal. The people there are RUDE, the quality of food SUCK, they have no people skills at all! I was once told by an older Asian man, if the Chinese restaurant is not frequented by Asians...GO SOME WHERE ELSE!

I've made a formal complaint through Clark County Health Department. Hope they do their job for the sake of those still dumb enough to eat there!....
