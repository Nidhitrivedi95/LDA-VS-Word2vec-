When your soup is served, go ahead and add half a soup-spoon full of soy sauce, an equal amount of vinegar, and a tiny scoop of chili oil.  Taste the broth and add more if needed.  After you've achieved perfection, sprinkle some white pepper on there.  It's so much better than ground black pepper.  Trust me.

Especially with the soup, they're pretty much handing you a blank canvas.  It's up to you to personalize it to suit your taste.

For those who like to order appetizers and have a little time between your first course and your main course:

In this restaurant, you have to be proactive.  You have to take the timing of your meal into your own hands.  Order your drinks and appetizers first, nothing else.  Wait until you finish your appetizers before you order your main course.  It usually comes out very quickly anyways.  If you order all of your food at the same time, most likely it will all come out at the same time.
