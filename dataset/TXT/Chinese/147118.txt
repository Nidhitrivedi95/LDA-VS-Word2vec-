safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg I revisited the buffet after reading some of the current reviews.  I was surprised.  The food had changed for the better.  The food overall was tastier.  New cook, maybe?Not much selections.  No sushi like other Chinese buffets.  But for the price($7), can't complain.  Beat other Chinese fast food places, where you may pay the same amount or more for one takeout entree.
