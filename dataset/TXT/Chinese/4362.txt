_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w I came here a few weeks ago for a bday dinner. The restaurant is VERY busy so reservations are a must especially on a weekend. 

The food here is pretty tasty but there was a hair in the lobster dish which was very disappointing especially given the prices that they charge. For a place that tries to pass itself off as a more high end seafood restaurant you would hope that some extra care could have been taken. When you order the lobster the server brings out the live lobster to show you and tell you how much it weighs. The thing that bugged me was people/customers would pose with the live lobster. I find that really distasteful and disrespectful since the poor thing is about to give up its life in the next few seconds so you can eat. Please show some respect.

Anyway on to the food.

Hong Kong style lobster - very tasty and I love the small fishes that it's cooked with. Eating this can get really oily and messy so make good use of the disposable gloves they provide.

Steamed fish - was generally okay but would have been a nicer touch if the servers would have deboned it at the table. 

Lobster roe fried rice - really yummy. I like how they try to make as much use out of the lobster that they can. 

So I would probably come back again given that the seafood is very fresh and tasty. However I hope they can be more careful w the food prep on the future.
