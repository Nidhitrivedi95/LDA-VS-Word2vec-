CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw It was the third day away from NYC food in combination of eating Vegas style steak+eggs-ish meals .... Noodles really hit the spot, even at $15 a small bowl of noodle soup (which would easily cost $3.75 in NYC chinatown).

The food here isn't your typical Americanized chinese take-out.  Believe me, there is NO SUCH THING as sweet & sour pork or general tso's chicken in real chinese cuisine....  Noodles is on par in terms of taste.  If a restaurant can make money, have customers return, and write good reviews by serving food with 800% mark-up, bravo to you, seriously.  And for that, I refuse to give more than 2stars for such an establishment. 

The only complaint I had was the bowls were rather small compare to what I'm use to (Universal order of #1 at any Viet pho restaurant.... Taiwanese noodle shops... or even Korean naengmyun noodle bowls), and they don't give you much broth.  

Being that I was pretty sick of buffet foods and rich french (Vegas-style) cuisine easily price at $40+ per person, paying $15 a bowl of noodles was fulfilling.

PS - my Chinese parents would have died and hit themselves in the face with bokchoy and hot sauce if they knew I spent $50+ for a bowl of duck noodle soup, chicken congee, and roti canai.  Seriously, yo.
