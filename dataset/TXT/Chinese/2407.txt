_aX7bPzYQdrIVUJpG_-0zg Nothing says yummy like a full color food service poster advertising crappy pseudo sheet cakes... complete with case count of slices.

Crab, oysters, and peel your own shrimp were all on ice... but the "melted butter" container was just sitting on the counter... not really sure what it was... colored oil? Did not risk it.

Shu Mai was average commercial and the glow in the dark red teriyaki chicken stick was moist... but other than that not much that I would want to even think about eating. Everything else on the 2 hot buffets was either dried out or lost in huge amounts of fried breading.

Hubbie decided to try the "hibachi" station... not really sure if it was a flat top, wok, or some other Mongolian heating contraption because the "chef" took his plate, disappeared into the back, and did not return for 10 min!

There were 7 or 8 large parties and a couple of couples... only the table of Asian speaking people got any attention. the staff jumped each time they pointed out an empty tray of food... the rest of the dining room was lucky to get their plates picked up.

Several other oriental buffet options within an easy drive with more selection, friendlier staff, and identifiable food.
