uLUl_dMl6a9m774LGReDVA Paid a visit this past Saturday  It was myself, my husband and my brother.  Service was very pleasant.  Food not so much.  The potstickers and egg roll were fine.  The problem was in the entrees.  My husband had the sesame chicken.  He has had this dish hundreds of times from NY to SF and many place in between and this was the first time it was served more like a sweet & sour chicken.  This was not the way sesame chicken was meant to be served.  My brother had a Chinese restaurant staple, shrimp with lobster sauce.  He too has had this dish many times, mainly in NY and he said the lobster sauce left a lot to be desired.  I had the cashew chicken and there was just too many vegetables in there and not enough chicken.  This was our first time here but sorry to say, probably our last.
