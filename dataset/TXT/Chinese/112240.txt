mF2EW3twSrFPmT_RVV1-Qg First time here for dinner. Service was slow at first. Took them about 7-8 minutes to have a server come over to our table. There was no explanation of food specials or drink specials. 

Ordered the Crab Rangoon  and edamame for an appetizer. Crab Rangoon had more cheese and very little crab. The edamame came out partially cold. 

For dinner my wife got the Pad Tai and I had the Mongolian Beef. Her Pad Tai was very heavy on the fish sauce. The beef was supposed to be spicy, but I didn't taste any spices. It was also very heavy on the green onion tops. 

All in all, the food was acceptable although my wife couldn't finish her meal due to the fish sauce taste. 

The restaurant was kept up fairly well, however there were noticeable issues. A mixture of lights, upholstery missing buttons and areas needing paint. 

If you are looking for authentic food, skip this one. It ranks up there with airport or shopping mall Asian restaurants in food quality. It was inexpensive though. At $37.00 for two dinners and two appetizers (we drank water) it wasn't bad.
