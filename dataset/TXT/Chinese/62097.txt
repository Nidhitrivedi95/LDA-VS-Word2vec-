DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA Too much oil and msg. I asked for crispy chicken fried noodle, and it wasn't really crispy. The wonton noodle soup was too salty, and the noodles weren't crispy. The wontons were a slightly below average. They included the tip on the bill without telling me.   (I prefer to give my tip willingly not forced with groups less than 7) the only good thing about this place is that the food came out pretty quickly. I would rather go to other chinese restaurants than to come back.
