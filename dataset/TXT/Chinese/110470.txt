LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA I've been obsessed with Flo's for years and have never had any issues until recently. I so want to leave more stars but I've been dissatisfied the last 4 or 5 times. 
- there has been a mistake in my take out orders 3 out of 5 times. The hostesses sound 15 yrs old and rush the call resulting in errors with my food that I can't send back bc I'm already home

- the portion size has dramatically downsized. I asked the waitress last time I ate there and she said "yes, there have been a few changes" 
Now, instead of getting a basket of won ton chips on the table, their new technique is to put a pile of them on one side of the entree plate so they take up space so people hopefully won't notice the skimpy portion size. I'm an average person and don't overheat, but for these prices, the amount is very skimpy

- lastly, flo has raised her prices to the point of being absurd. Maybe her locations cause her to think all her customers are rich, but I seriously can't afford to get take out anymore. Tonight I ordered 3 basic dishes for my daughter and I and it was $40 before tip.  The average dish is $12-14 which is ridiculous. Most other restaurants are $8-11. I noticed tonight the lack of flavor in the lo mein and the small number of cashews in my cashew chicken. 

The sad thing is, good chinese is so hard to find in Phoenix, but that doesn't give Flo's the right to take advantage of that fact.  2 years I wouldn't have complained but now I'm in search of a new obsession
