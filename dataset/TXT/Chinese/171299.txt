vY2xyGR4zpZTv5o9oQlgAQ Wasn't impressed by the food here but the owners were very friendly. My bf got the red curry with shrimp and I got the chicken pad Thai along with some wontons. The wontons weren't very good and the dipping sauce looks weird. The pad thai was not very good. It's easily my favorite thai dish so I'm no stranger to the dish and this was a let down. The chicken tasted kind of questionable. On the other hand the red curry was very yummy. Inside is very plain, more of a takeout place. The prices were pretty typical for takeout.
