nChi_8Gygb6NUMa_kg_tlQ I had been passing this place by for two months on the way to Tea Swirl, when I decided I would gather my courage and try this place myself. The prices are pretty high, but that is understandable when it comes to fusion cuisine places making specialty foods. The dishes I have tried so far are the curry fried rice, Hong Kong style French toast, condensed milk toast, shaved snow, and Hong Kong milk tea. The curry fried rice was excellent, the right combination of spiciness with flavor. The French toast and condensed milk toast were interesting, having a filling makes them taste like a pastry. I appreciate Asian Fusion Cafe for having a greater variety of shaved snow and is the only place I am aware of near ASU Campus that has more than two flavors. The Hong Kong milk tea was great, especially with a spicy dish. I could taste black tea, condensed milk and evaporated milk, all components of Hong Kong milk tea.
