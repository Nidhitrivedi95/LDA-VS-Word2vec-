Roast Pork!!! The skin was so so crispy and the meat not too fatty. I also tried the BBQ pork, the salted fish fried rice, Dumpling noodle soup, and the duck. Everything was pretty good I have to admit. I wish there was more places in SD that have the crispy roast pork like here.

Wait was not too bad, only about 15 mins or so
