wZvSsHFU0NdyQ03625kh6g Came here after Mother's Korean disaster and am thrilled. Had house squid special, pea shoots and green beans. Server stopped us from ordering another entree because it would be too much food and she was right !  Delicious flavors, enough food  for 2-3 more meals and great service. We will be back with pleasure!!
