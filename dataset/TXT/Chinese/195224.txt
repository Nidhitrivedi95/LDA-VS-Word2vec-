zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I ordered 2 dishes of noodle. One is spicy which is not spicy at all. Both dishes are too plain. The soup tasted like soy sauce and chilli oil.

Bbq pork bun is good.

Okonomiyaki is fine. 

Rice cake is crispy outside which I think it is nice. But the overall taste of chilli sauce  is not that impressed. Taste like Sriracha sauce.
