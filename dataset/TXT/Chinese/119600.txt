However, unlike the other restaurants that offers a cuisine that has been done time and time again, Fu Jia offer a beautiful and delicious northeast chinese cuisine. Think spice, texture and flavors that are unfortunately not present enough in this area. Yes the place and the sign looks like nothing, but please don't be fooled, take a chance and take a seat, and you will be surprised.
