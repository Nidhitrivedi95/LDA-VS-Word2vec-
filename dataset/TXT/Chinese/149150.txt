sOaeX1zQWuqbPcclvjtdeA The food is usually great at PF Changs in different States and thought would be the same at this location and went for Father's Day but we were very disappointed. The calamari tasted like it was freezer burnt and was very bland. The beef and broccoli was very salty and just tasted like it was drowned in soy sauce. Everything else was ok. Not good. The portion size was tiny for what they charge. It is very over priced for mediocre food. Needless to say it was a waste of $90. We would've had way better Chinese food at our local Chinese place for a lot less money and a lot more food.
