rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg My review is soley based on the food, I have only had takeout here I've never dined in. I like Sun Asian, its good for a quick meal for pick up and a better alternative to Panda Express. I really like the honey chicken and the orange chicken, and it comes in a combo which is great.  The crab wontons are my favorite to order, full of cream cheese.  The sushi rolls are good also.
