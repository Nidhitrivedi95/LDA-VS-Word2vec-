6Bmq3b91hqTwMFn5cpPWzQ Being from Flushing, NY, I love how this is a place with good quality food and it's cheap.  I got the 3 combo meat -- beef, shrimp wontons and fish balls with my egg noodle soup and I love how the broth wasn't salty, it was a plain soup with noodles and toppings.  Today, on this Christmas jolly cold day, my fiancé and I walked to the restaurant and ordered one portion of that to share and it decongested our nose and warmed our feet up.  $7.25 for the combo, with tax was $8.16 and after tip, it's $10.00 which isn't bad.  I'd recommend this place to family and friends!  Though, the decor of the place isn't modern, it's okay.
