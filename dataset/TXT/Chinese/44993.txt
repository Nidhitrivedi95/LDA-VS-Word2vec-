BmSLyxm8b86dtzwuT7LqBA Heard that there was a hand pulled noodle place  in the upstairs food court in pacific mall. I've been looking for this place for 4 years and visit pacific mall at least once a month.   Once I found Sun's Kitchen the food did not dissapoint! Amazing hand pulled noodles and a variety of delicious looking dishes, I order the beef soup. 

Will keep coming back.
