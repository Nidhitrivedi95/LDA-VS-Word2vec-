3fw2X5bZYeW9xCz_zGhOHg So I speak Cantonese.. I can speak it fluently. But I have an accent and I wouldn't understand well if someone speaks to me too fast.

The place was packed so we couldn't sit down, but it want busy because everybody already has their orders. So when we ordered (takeout), she was rushing me, rude to me, had me repeat things as if I was speaking French. I ended up speaking English and didn't smile.

Dessert was okay though :) +1 star
