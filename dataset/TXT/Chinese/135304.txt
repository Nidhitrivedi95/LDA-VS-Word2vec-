QaxDKkqYTtVYZJcqBNTnvQ I dropped by for early dinner, and enjoyed the time being to the fullest! 
The owner lady is really nice and friendly, even though she doesn't talk much english. I went there alone but she still gave me the bigger seat, and was always smiling while I asked for their best menu.

I ordered boiled chive&egg dumplings and a small sized sour&spicy soup-The soup had a funny smell to it but was enjoyable all the same, and the dumplings were nicely hot and delicious. Would definitely come visit later!
