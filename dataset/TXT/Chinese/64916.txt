eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ Service was impeccable last night. I got the Vegan Dumplings. They were recommended by the person who seated us. Super tasty with their hot sauce! 
I also ordered some of their Sake. Very good too. They always came by and refilled our waters, too. That was very nice. 
Definitely coming back to this place
