3G_wGIblXDNRYg4xIe9VZA I had the Appetizer combo platter, a bowl of Egg Drop Soup and The Wor Siu Duck...
The appetizer platter came with an eggroll, 2 bbq ribs, 2 fried wings, 2 fried shrimp, 2 numaki, and 3 fried wonton. it was all served hot from the kitchen and the price was $6.95
The soup was in a good sized bowl, was piping hot and cost $1.10
The Wor Siu Duck was a little bland, but there was plenty of it, and the price was very ecenomical at $6.95
