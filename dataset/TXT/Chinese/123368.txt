OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA One of the better Chinese restaurants in downtown Chinatown. Similar to House Of Gourmet and Golden Stone both just down the street.

They renovated not too long ago so it looks nicer than the other places and their name on all of the dining plates, bowls and chopsticks are a nice touch.

It gets busy and loud. If you're there at lunch, don't be surprised if you have to share tables with strangers (not unusual in china/hk) 

Food I would say is better and general hygiene is better than the other mentioned restaurants. Downfall is that they're closed on some days and their hours are not as flexible compared to the other two that open to the AM.

If you're looking for a place to eat in Chinatown, give this place a go. If you have a car, time and planning then go up town to Scarborough (the foods much better).
