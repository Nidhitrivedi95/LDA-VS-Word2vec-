bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Haven't had a chance to write a review but it was last month and we didn't feel Like cooking so we decided to try singing pandas. We love Chinese food but it's so hard to find a good clean place with great traditional food. Just so tired of pei Wei and pf changs to salty. We ordered take out and brought the food home and everyone loved it! The manager was very friendly on the phone and helpful describing the items on the menu. 
The King pao chicken is delicious, the curry chicken is amazing. The hot and sour soup is delicious she even told me it had pork in it when I ordered and she said she could do it without pork. 
I love the calamari and chiles just wish it had slices of hot peppers. I highly recommend singing pandas, didn't get a chance to dine in yet the restaurant itself is clean and nice inside.
