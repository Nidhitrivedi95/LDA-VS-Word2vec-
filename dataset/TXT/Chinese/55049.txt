CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw I'm sitting here eating at Ku Noodle and paused to write a review, it's THAT good. We are being served by the nicest, observant and prompt waiter,  Haptu. He immediately greeted us with a smile, asked if we've been here before and proceeded to explain every dish on the menu (so patient). I chose the chicken sui (appetizer) and he recommended the lettuce cups......Both ARE AMAZING,  the flavors but especially the freshness of the food. My husband had the lo mein and he also loved it.  

We will definitely be back for more. Thank you Haptu for being a great waiter, you are an asset to Ku Noodle.
