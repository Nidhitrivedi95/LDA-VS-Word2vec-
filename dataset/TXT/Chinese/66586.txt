EhlOUjd2dh52SV_XfoORSA A small group and couldn't decide what type of food to get...so we went to Sesame.  Fun place for a small group, you can share and try different items on the menu.  

The Thai items on the menu caught my eye or was it my taste buds.  Enjoyed the Pad Thai Shrimp, while the menu states it is spicy, not to much, was expecting more spice.  Sampled another Pad Thai, forgot the name, and it was not as spicy as I was expecting but good.  The Amazing Chicken turn out to be not so amazing.  It was OK but expected more.     

SI is popular and I can see why.  Nice place and good service.
