FIs33y1BVzzcfrDDHh8O5g I have to revise my last review. I had given this place 4 stars but after the last couple of visits, I must rate them down. Food has been terrible lately. I don't know if they have changed cooks or what but my pad see ew (sp?)and it was saturated in oil. I could not even eat it. The waitress was not our regular girl and did nothing to resolve the issue with the food. Just took it away and charged for full price for it.
