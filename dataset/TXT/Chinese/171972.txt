VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg The people here were very nice.  I got the chicken noodle soup bowl.  It was a huge portion.  The chicken was tender and had great flavor.  My only complaint was that the soup was a little too oily.  I also tried a drink with mango tea.  It was good but a little too sweet,  even at 25% sweetness.
