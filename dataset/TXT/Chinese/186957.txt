ye62ltisuIosDq5F_6V25w Inexpensive at $8.99 for dinner.  We went on Christmas night and the food was pretty bad overall but some of the items were good:  fried chicken wings, bok choy, shrimp, daikon/beef soup, and the soft ice cream machine.  I thought the waitresses were efficient at taking the plates, too.

What can you expect for $8.99 dinner?  It's just mass quantities of biomatter when you come down to it!
