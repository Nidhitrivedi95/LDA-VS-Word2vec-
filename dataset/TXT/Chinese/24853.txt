6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ Dropped by for dinner after wanting to come for a very long time. Ordered the unagi don and it was very delicious. I'm not one for rice dishes unless it's sushi so this was quick to impress. The unagi practically melted in your mouth and there was enough to accompany the rice. 

I also got the scallop ($3 ea.) and beef with ponzu sauce ($2.45? ea.) skewers which were okay but not worth the money, in my opinion. Beef was tasteless. 

Next I got the ikayaki which was a bit salty than flavourful. It's not bad but I probably wouldn't get it next time. Service was great, and despite the dinner hour, it was fairly empty on a Friday evening so I was well-looked after. And of course the complimentary Yelp ice cream you get for checking in finished my meal nicely. 

Overall I'd come back but not for their other dishes, just their dons.
