cTkya76AXsXylIyl5bFn4w Love this place. I always get house noodles and house rice. Only one time the food has been off.  Yesterday I ordered again the usual, and I asked for sweet and sour and chili sauces, I got an earful about next time I order make sure to ask for them so that they are in the bag. All this because I asked for a small bag for my sauces and he refused to get me a small bag instead he took 5 min to undo the maze of a knot he had tied on the bag. All the while he is going on in his native tounge I think he was telling me how much he appreciated my business, finally got my sauces in the bag and I asked him to not tie the bag. Are you sitting down he tied the bag double knot. Beside that great food. I still love that place just chill sauce nazi
