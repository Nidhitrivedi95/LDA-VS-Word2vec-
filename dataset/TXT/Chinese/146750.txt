S6dARuOrrOXd4xSiTHti8g I've gotten delivery from here twice.  Both times the estimated delivery was 70-80 minutes (grubhub) but the food arrived in approximately 30 minutes.  

The double cooked pork belly was good, maybe a little dry, but had the right amount of fat/meat ratio.  The Kung Pao Chicken in Chengdu-Style (C1) was absolutely fantastic!  But you REALLY need to like spice and numbing peppers.  

The only "miss" so far was an order of P9 - Cold Sesame Noodles.  No spice - just peanut butter and granulated sugar.  baaad.
