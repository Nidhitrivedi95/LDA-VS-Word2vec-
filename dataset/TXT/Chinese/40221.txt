AYr2URtjoQ8Toh8_Jr4G6A This place is very convenient for having a quick dinner or lunch! I love their noodles, but one disadvantage of this place is that they do not have lots of vegetables for most dishes :-/ the bubble tea is not good as that in Rose tea cafe in squirrel hill. It's not easy to find a seat here also.
