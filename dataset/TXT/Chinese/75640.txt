The dining room is rather spacious with a high ceiling. On a weeknight at 6pm we found the restaurant to be half-empty and the waiters were standing around attentively waiting for customers to request things - that was a refreshing change from the typical over-busy restaurant.

I personally found the food to be on the oily side, and because I've had the same Chinese dishes at other restaurants before, I would recommend going to other places instead, where I think the food and prices are marginally better than what you find at Ding Tai Fung.

Strangely enough this restaurant <U+9F0E><U+6CF0><U+8C50> has the exactly same Chinese name as an international chain, but the logo has a different design. My best guess is that these companies are indeed distinct, and the same name is either a coincidence or a deliberate knock-off. I'm not sure what's going on here.
