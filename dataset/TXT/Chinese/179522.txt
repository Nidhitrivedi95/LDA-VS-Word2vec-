X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg The Hakkasan SUCKS!!  The dance floor is ridiculously small. You leave there with a sore throat and burning eyes because of all the cigarette smoke. You wait at the bar 30 minutes to get a very expensive drink. 
We went there Saturday to see my favorite dj,  Hardwell,  who by the way is absolutely amazing. Since we couldn't get on the dance floor we had to dance by one of their way over priced bottle service booths. The people who paid for this booth arrived late and didn't stay very long so they didn't even put a dent in the bottle of Grey Goose they paid for. Anyways they saw that my boyfriend and I had been dancing all night so when they were leaving they invited up to make ourselves drinks so the vodka wouldn't go to waste. We thanked them and they left. Not even 5 minutes later the guy that was working that booth came up to us and literally took my drink out of my hand and told me I couldn't have it. I told him the people told us to finish it and have a good night. His response was I don't care you can't have it. Totally rude and so unprofessional. For as much money as we paid to get in we should not have been treated like that. 
We will never be going to this greedy place again. The only reason I even gave them 2 stars was because of the big name djs they have play there.
