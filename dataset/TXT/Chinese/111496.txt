m9iqRUgclcsQs-z8c2FTeA After 4 phone calls from them requesting different information from me prior to my appointment, 1 day and time change I finally made it to my appointment.  I was given nuerous packages of paperwork to fill out prior to my facial skin tightening laser.  I was informed the person I was booked for was running behind.  It was 30 - 40 minutes before she saw me.  They took a photocopy of my drivers license, not happy about that.  I had the most painful experience of my life with absolutely no results other than I am out money and wasted 1 1/2 hours between phone calls, paperwork, waiting for my appointment and having the proceedure.  

I will never go there again, waste of time and money.
