The line is there for a reason though - it's good food at decent prices.  The place is also clean and comfortable to sit in and would be above average for a "fast food"-type Chinese restaurant.  There is a large menu with a large variety of different dishes - good for two or good for a giant table to share family style.

On my last visit, I did take out, and the following cost approximately $35 total including taxes:
 - preserved egg and pork congee
 - half a roasted duck
 - black bean and beef rice noodles
 - yeung chow fried rice
Takeout wait for the above was approximately 15 minutes.

This place is solid.
