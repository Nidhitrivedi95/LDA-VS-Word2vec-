BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA Extremely RUDE manager! The manager asks to see my Canadian issued debit card before I can order! Unbelievable!! This was probably the rudest customer service I've seen anywhere in Canada so far, I'm asking all my friends to avoid this place and will post this review on every website possible, save your precious time and money and enjoy your time at another place, AVOID this place!
