I6oxEn1HT41S2GPrDKPPvA I've been here twice and both times weren't the best. It isn't a question of the quality of food which I would say was decent at best. It was more of the customer service. 

My family and I had ordered too many orders dimsum and failed to realize that each order came in threes or fours. We had also ordered 3 more entrées in addition. So when the heaps of trays sat down on our table we had called the server and asked to see our order sheet. We had received half of our order and more was to come. She does so grudgingly and I requested to cancel the entrées because there was obviously too much food. She calls another server and tells him something quickly and sharply, then tells us that the rest of the order is already cooked and are on their way. 

I expected the rest of the food to come immediately since they said it was on the way. Nope. They came a little over 15 minutes later. 

There was a confusion with asking for boxes for the copious amount of dimsum as well. When our table was full, and there was absolutely no room for the entrées, we asked for boxes to put the left overs in. Our server once again started angrily saying things in her language before AND after telling us to "wait, later."

Later, she did give us a stack of boxes to put our leftovers in, but she was hella rude about it. I was also pretty doubtful of whether or not there was spit in our food because of how angry she was...

All in all, it's safe to say I'm never coming back here again.
