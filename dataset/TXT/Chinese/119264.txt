Nsi49BE_XsjJ0oOXwhH8hA Just disgusting. Super old food, not kept at proper temperatures. Cockroaches runing around, chasing the flies around the food islands. Awful tasting food, awful environment, awfully dissapointed people eating food I wouldn't feed my cats. We didn't pay for dinner because we complained to the manager. Turns out, when we got home we realized we did pay for dinner, if you know what I mean...
