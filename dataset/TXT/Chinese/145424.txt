S0Z8fKAUYTd2MKUuez-evA I'm giving it 4 stars.

The portions are large, prices are decent and the food tastes good. What I really like? The food isn't salty and oily which is rare for fast food Chinese Take out. I've had a couple noodle and rice dishes and the bbq and looking to try more items on the menu.

I will be going back.
