U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q I had stayed at Caesars Palace and wanted to dine somewhere close. I dined here twice. I had the beef brisket noodle soup, shrimp dumplings, and Hainan chicken and rice (my favorite). They were delicious. Service was excellent. Yes, it is pricey but I had expected it because of its location.
