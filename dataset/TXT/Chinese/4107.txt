_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg Had lunch here yesterday, service wasn't impressive during lunch and they were out of quite a few things. I was expecting a more impressive egg roll given the name of the restaurant. Would not eat here again. Especially after seeing this place was listed on the Dirty Dining report for 4 health code violations the SAME day I consumed their food. Horrifying!! I ordered the Mongolian beef, wasn't any different than any other place I've ordered it from.
