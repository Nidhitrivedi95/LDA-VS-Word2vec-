VGZ_MJ7P3vSQMYyQf-mNjw I've been here for both Dim Sum and Dinner.

If you come before 11:30am it's cheaper.
however there is a very long wait, and those that made reservations have priority, I would NOT suggest waiting... just go somewhere else, it's not worth the way. The Dim Sum is nothing fancy or special. Just like all other Dim Sum menus.

The dinner, they have a lobster special, if you order $100+ you can add +20 for a 5lb lobster (and yes it's very big and delicious)

they will up sell you on the order of $100, so you will order over that amount, and it doesn't included fry noodles/fried rices etc, so after you order that $140 worth of food for the lobster, you have to order extra plain rice if needed. Comes with your family of 5 people +

the Peking Duck was pretty good, you see the person in front of you carving the duck, and the skin is very crispy, with nice thin wrappers.

however the other dishes lacked in skill, the honey oysters was gross, $20 for 6 pieces of mushy oysters, it was not crunchy/crispy with sweet honey taste like it supposed to be. The individual steamed oysters are a better choice in this case.

I enjoy the dinners here more than the afternoon tea.
