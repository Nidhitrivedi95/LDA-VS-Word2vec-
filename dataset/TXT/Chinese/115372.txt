n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A My husband and I were so excited to come to this restaurant in Las Vegas. In a nutshell, what a disappointment. Thanks to Charles, the service was incredible, however, we would have been more content being served Panda Express. First, the walnut shrimp was ok. The pork and noodles were not good at all, very bland and tasteless. The lamb was dry, it tasted like a raw lamb without any seasoning. The filet was soggy, undercooked and it tasted like they dumped condensed beef broth on it. Again, the service made the night bearable, but the overpriced, tasteless, raw food gave us a lot to talk about and a night to never forget. My husband eats everything and has never been more disappointed with such disgusting food. After spending $320 on a dinner date, the expectation is to be pleased with not only the service but the food and unfortunately, this overcharged restaurant was nothing but a flashy money collecting house. I will never return or recommend Mr Chows to anybody.
