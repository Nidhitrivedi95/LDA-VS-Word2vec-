alWRFbDdU3_F1c2C4nG2dw OK with the caveat I have only ordered take out since the reno, but THE NOODLES ARE BACK & GREAT AS EVER! So I'm confused by so many reviews, some I just had to post to contradict! Henry IS there! Mr. Wong was there! The noodles were still the best I've had since San Francisco. One reviewer cited the old reliable servers vs. the new, which ironically I had chided Wong's for before they closed (they had some old dependable servers who were awesome, they also hired some new ones who - were NOT!) so service varies. The decor is updated as was needed. I AM SO HAPPY THE NOODLES I GOT WERE GOOD AS EVER! I WILL be going back when I have more time to try their other fare, see what's there. Their online website menu seems pretty extensive, so not sure what some said was missing. I'll have to try some of our old favorite dishes, see if they're still the same. 

I wonder where  all the naysayers posting here negative comments now, claiming they were such fans of old Wong's WERE when Wong's was open, don't see their glowing praises of Wong's then, but see some negative comments, even then... so now we claim to gain respect as a responsible reviewer claiming we "were" fans for decades, citing such a contrast now, but no evidence of glowing reviews supporting them then? Something smells fishy, & it's not Wong's fish. & HENRY is IN the building! & the NOODLES ROCK!
