YBIhTjmEH3IEZW4Dr5ReRA I've been craving good Chinese food. Specifically sweet and sour chicken. Being Thai I'm very picky about Asian restaurants. There are very few I like. I guess I'm an Asian food snob but growing up eating the best home cooked Asian food especially Thai spoiled me. Anyway I read the review for Wongs and it's less than 2 miles from my house so I thought I'd give them a try. 

I ordered the salt and pepper wings and sweet and sour chicken but when I brought it home it wasn't sweet and sour chicken it was orange chicken. Luckily I like orange chicken and this orange chicken was flippin' amazing. It's so good! Almost as good as my orange chicken. The salt and pepper wings were really good too and not spicy unless you eat the jalapeños that come with them which I did cause I like a kick. 

I was not disappointed taste wise and that's saying a lot. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I received the wrong entree. But I was pleasantly surprised with how good the orange chicken was. So I have high hopes for when I return to try  the sweet and sour chicken.
