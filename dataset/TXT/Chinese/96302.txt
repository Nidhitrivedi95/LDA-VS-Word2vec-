JkzqS4JDOpoHrj534rzvAA I was actually surprised.

I wanted Chinese food and my wife wanted anything but. So she found this place on yelp.

First of all, the service was excellent. But that was just the beginning ...

I have traditionally avoided places that serve different cuisines, because I have found that these kind of restaurants try to be all things to all people, and everything turns out mediocre at best.

Well, this place really surprised me. I got Hawaiian Fire + Fried Rice + spring rolls. Very tasty.
My wife got the guacamole burger, with onion rings and she really liked it. I got the Watermelon water -- oh my! You have to get this.

Next time, I am coming for breakfast!
