-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ Maybe my mistake to order the "house fried rice" - It is rice + salt. While once in a while I found tiny string of egg, vegi. Not taste better than the "Free " side order in Panda Express. Come on, I understand that you need to make profit, but for $10, add a bit of tofu, egg, more vegi, maybe cost 50 cents more, I will be a much happier customer.
