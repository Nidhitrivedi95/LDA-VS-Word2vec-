l5NUIeAo6Fk-Vx4nm3Xqfg China Ginger South Fort Apache is a tastefully-decorated, clean place with a quiet atmosphere and low instrumental music. Each dish that we have ordered there is perfectly prepared: orange chicken, crispy-fried tofu, spicy string beans, and fried rice. We do tend to stick with those items, but after reading other reviews here, I'm going to try the noodle dishes next. The staff members at China Ginger are consistently courteous and conscientious. I am giving five stars to the operation, because it has always met and exceeded expectations. One caveat: they do not have red chile oil here, so if you are used to that as I am, prepare to instead be given some very thick, vinegary red chile sauce that alters the taste of the dish instead of merely adding heat and nice texture to your food. The leftovers I took home were great out of my wok the next day, and hey--I added my own red chile oil for maximum satisfaction.
