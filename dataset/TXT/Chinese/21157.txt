68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw Cool hipster foodie hub w/ Friendly staffs. I like how this is not your typical restaurant. They take inspiration from different countries and put it on their menu. You can have a Thai or Singaporean version of chicken if you like. If you're looking for traditional authentic versions, you may not find it here as they are more Americanized. I wouldn't say the food is within my flavor palette. The menu was cool but the sauce and seasoning weren't innovative enough for me.  The sauce in the Bao tasted like burnt soy sauce. The other dishes we had were on the bland side or something we had already. I like the fact that they're doing something different but it's not a place I look forward to eating at again.
