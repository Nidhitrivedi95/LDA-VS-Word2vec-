JUI0-5ENNGAoqSF8v1LO8Q For us, it is a take-out restaurant.  We will pack lots of dishes away. 

Some of the dishes are not available every night but also has a limited quantity if available.  The yam duck is one of them and is done very deliciously.  The fish tail fin is another such dishes. With the tofu soaked in the sauces mixed with the fish, it is one of a kind, though it has nothing to do with fins.  

This restaurant has less salt and less oil if you such ordered.  At least after the meal you won't feel thirsty.  

The service is average and don't expect much.  Make your decision before ordering or the waitresses will be too busy to wait for you and will come back later.
