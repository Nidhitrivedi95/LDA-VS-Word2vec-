BZ8nUf9R4sa1S-9sU6AjRg I had a harrowing experience today at China Town Chinese restaurant near Harris teeter in Steele Creek. Last night we ordered take out, and when we opened the bag at home I noticed a huge amount of thick black grease all inside the wanton soup container. It was disgusting. I figured it was an innocent mistake so I decided to take it back there today and ask for a refund. Well, I never expected the treatment I got when I walked in with the soup. The workers all gathered around & began shaking their heads denying that it came from their place, even though I gave them the receipt. They kept saying "this didn't come from us" and "we didn't do that!" They never apologized, but in the end I got the refund. It killed them to give it to me. All I can say is never again.
