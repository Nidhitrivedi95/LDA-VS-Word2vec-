m9iqRUgclcsQs-z8c2FTeA I have been to quite a number of Spa's in the last years. But the hot stone massage at Suddenly Slimmer was outstanding. Due to accidents my back is quite messed up and some therapists try to "cure" me instead of trelax me. First time in years that I did not have any back pain after receiving a massage. Overall great ambiance and very nice service! Will definitely go again when I am in Phoenix.
