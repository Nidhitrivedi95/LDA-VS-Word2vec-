AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Taking the Vegan plunge a month ago lead me to discover a whole new world of food!
  My third visit here in a month and in a huge fan. Lunch specials  are at $7.95 and this food has so oooo much flavor . 
Today I enjoyed the curry chicken with potato.  Yes yes and yes. And the Chicken tastes like .. well.. Chicken ! 
The vibe is friendly and kicked back with just the right amount of elegance.  Wait staff are extremely attentive. 
I made a 30 day vegan comitment that expires today. Places such as this are encouraging my girlfriend and I  to continue the journey. That and the 8lbs I've lost this month. :)
