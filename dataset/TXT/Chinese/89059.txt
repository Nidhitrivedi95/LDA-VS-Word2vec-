i4ZLquZaqB7dCu4P6gHGDQ Alright, so I've only had one dish here... and that's the General Tao chicken. I'm on a little quest around Mississauga to see which place has the best General Tao - and so far, this is BY FAR the worst General Tao I've ever tasted; even perhaps the worst thing I have EVER tasted.

This is the most spicy, vinegar, 'garbage' relat-able food item I have ever encountered. Absolutely do not get the general tao here. It's a shame I threw it out in the garbage after one bite... didn't even take a picture of it.

But I am sure they do other things (things that are traditional chinese and within their realm of cultural comfort. Example: Sweet & Sour Pork, Been Curd with Beef, etc) fairly well... just don't order anything American-Chinese here because they will make a huge fail attempt.
