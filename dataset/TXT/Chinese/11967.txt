2meb5cwKh125tF5IwUiIJA Saw a few reviews on yelp about this Asian bakery and had to drop. Out of all of the Asian bakeries that we saw in chinatown, this one had the most variety.

Taro bun - the taro was abundant and the sweet flavor was great, but outside texture of the bun is a little bit more firm than what I'm used to.

Red bean sesame bun - the red bean had the perfect texture and the sweetness was just right. The sesame seeds on the outside gave this bun a lovely nutty taste.

BBQ pork bun - the pork meat was shredded and the sauce was a little bit too sweet for my taste.

Red bean mochi - the mochi was soft, but the dough itself was a little flavorless. 

Scallion bun - the texture was soft and the green onions and hint of salt on top made the perfect combo.

Scallion and pork floss roll - I didn't taste this bun, hubby picked this one, but didn't eat it until a few days later so the taste wasn't the same if it were fresh

Pork and onion puff - another item that the hubby picked out. I didn't get to taste it, but the aromas were tantalizing. 

Overall, since chinatown is so small and doesn't have that many bakeries, I would drop by again to grab a few pastries if I had a craving.  Richmond, BC definitely beats Montreal in the Asian pastries department.  I would recommend the taro bun, red bean sesame bun, & the scallion bun.
