EnOCjP3wBpoICvEZXil4Cg The food is good here, I got the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special, the flavor was really good of the chicken. And I really like how they have the sturdy plastic chop sticks. The reason for the 3 starts is because on Yelp it says a free order of potstickers with check in, however once you get there, it's free order with check in and purchase of 2 entrees...I felt that was a little misleading.  But the food was good and there was a nice crowd during the lunch hour but the food came out promptly and was hot.  I would recommend this place just don't expect the promo if you're alone...
