v_xuLfW7TXBsQctpOuPvQw As a loyal customer to the Richmond Hill location, this downtown one disappointed me twice. 

The service was horrible the first time I visited, but the food was alright and made me happy. 

The second time I went with my boyfriend, my soup was service barely lukewarm. My boyfriend did not get served his soup until 30 mins after mine, even though we ordered the same thing. Even then, his soup was just warm at most. It was -20 degrees outside and I was thoroughly disappointed. 

I don't think I'll be returning to this location anytime soon.
