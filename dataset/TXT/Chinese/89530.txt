I7eqTdTmRTWYwF9HNZAHxw Went here for a Happy Hour with people from work and we had a good time. The drinks menu was quite good and some very interesting cocktails. A couple of us had a lychee cocktail which tasted like a mojito flavored with lychee . The appetisers were also good. We had the salmon satay, chicken salad, dumplings, chicken wings and calamari. The dumplings and the chicken salad were the best. 
Service was a little slow . The decor is very interesting. 
Did not try anything from the Dinner Menu. Thats for next time.
