YKHCSOBLCHpb5K6GgaabCQ Anytime I'm feeling good old American Chinese I try to swing by here since it's close to where I work. Aaaaand everytime I come in at lunch they're out of half of their food items. You wouldn't believe how many people come in, see half empty trays and just walk back out again. It's like this location doesn't want to make any money. I don't think I've ever been here and not had to wait for something to be cooked or just left so I don't waste time.
