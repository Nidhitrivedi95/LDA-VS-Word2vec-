WAb6ox5RrBtF7m5Cb6p56Q A coworker of mine recommended this place while I was craving some Chinese food. Made it in time for their lunch specials. I ordered the shrimp stir fry and fried rice. Their fried rice was very different from the usual I wasn't feeling it. 

However their shrimp stir fry was pretty good the sauce was the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. 

Very friendly and quick customer service.
