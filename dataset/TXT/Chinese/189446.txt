yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Ok I have had a change of heart. I really like this place. I have tried Chinese food in other parts of LV and so far this has the best tasting food. I love their Wonton soup, shrimp with honey walnut and mixed veggies. My family likes the pork chop. I also like the fact they have fresh coconut which I am a big fan of. It is open 24 hours and the service is great.
