X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Tiesto was playing but not advertised last Saturday.  The show was awesome - Tiesto himself, the music, the LED light show, everything.  They even passed out Tiesto bracelets that coordinated different colored lights at the same time.  It was a sight to see.  Luckily we had a view from a table on the second floor - it was perfect for all the fist pumping and dancing without the crowd.  I would definitely come back but only if I had the same view.    

I didn't bring my iphone so it was not stolen.  WIN.  But none of my own photos =(

If a big DJ is playing, get there early.  If we had not seen our friends and then got in front of the line, we would not had gotten in by midnight (we arrived around 10:30a and the line was OUTSIDE IN THE COLD).  

If you want to get on the guestlist, then look for the guys in suits in front of Planet Hollywood across from Bellagio.  They were handing out ads for Chateau and when we told them we wanted to go to Hakkasan, they put us on the list.  When we walked into MGM from the taxis to the club, the Asian guys in black suits ask if you want to be on the guestlist as well so you can go that route.  Girls are free before midnight and guys are free before 11p.
