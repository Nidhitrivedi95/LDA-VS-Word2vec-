bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ My boyfriend and I just moved to this side of town. Over on the other side of town we tried several different mom and pop Chinese restaurants and we were left feeling rather disappointed or maybe grossed out.

Last week we drove by and saw the New York Chinese restaurant and decided to give it a try. The first time we tried it we walked in to place our order. We ended up only waiting 15 minutes. The food had much higher quality than what we had experienced from other places in the past. Hot and fresh too.

We definitely wanted to try it again so we called in an order the next time and it was a 30 minute wait. So we were glad that we called that order in. I noticed that they are consistently pretty busy at night. But the wait is worth it to me.

The crab rangoons are my favorite. The egg drop soup is mild but delicious. Last time we tried the sesame chicken and loved it as well as the orange beef.

I recommend this place for Chinese takeout for sure.
