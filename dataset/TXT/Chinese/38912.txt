AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA This place is truly as good as it gets. The crispy eggplant is sooooo good and the serving of it is soooo huge that I couldn't eat it all in one sitting but it made for great leftovers.
On top of that the staff is a delight and the chef (and I would assume owner) came out and explained his cooking and food we were eating while giving us a sample of something else. 
Just everything is great about this place. Very much look forward to our next visit to Las Vegas just so we can eat at Veggie House.
