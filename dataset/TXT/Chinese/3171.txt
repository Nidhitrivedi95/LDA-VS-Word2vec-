_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Came here late at night. the food is reasonably priced (especially for Vegas) and it tasted delicious! Any of the soup noodle bowls looked good. I got one of the beef soup bowls and it was yummy!

I love the location and I love how they are open late and there is plenty of seating. sorry for using too many "ands" in a sentence.
