He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw Had to come here based on all the photos that I've seen on IG - I was rather disappointed with my experience though.... but keep in mind that I did not order any dessert this time. 

I ordered the steamed rice rolls, Japanese gyoza, pork cutlet omurice and sliced beef teppan. My favourite is definitely the beef teppan! I added Kim chi and fried egg with it which blended the flavours of the dish together really well - just enough Kim chi to keep it a tad sour, just enough soy sauce (?) to give it a saltier taste and the egg and the rice complimented all the different ingredients and flavours. 

I was most excited for the steamed rice rolls, yet this was the dish I enjoyed the least. I didn't expect it to taste so.... peanut butter-y? LOL I'm not a big fan of peanut butter and maybe if they added less of it it would've tasted a lot better. My friend and I didn't finish this because it was just WAY too much peanut butter. It was too overpowering! It was like we were eating straight out of a peanut butter jar. 

The gyoza was ok, it looked and tasted a bit undercooked though. Also instead of the typical sauce that is served with gyoza in Japanese restaurants, hot sauce was provided. It tasted pretty frozen, especially at the white part Seen in the picture I'll attach. 

Onto the last dish, the pork cutlet omurice. The egg and rice was flavourless & the curry was so thick!! You know the sauce is too thick when it looks like the dish has been left out for so long right when it is brought to your table :( 

Even though I really enjoyed the beef teppan, the portion is small and for the price that I had to pay for it - it doesn't seem worth it at all. If I did return, I'd probably still re order this and just try their desserts.
