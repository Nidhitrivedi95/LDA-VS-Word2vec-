n9WOZlk5k868HXRVhKp5IQ I placed a pick up order at 4:30 to be picked up 6:30. I arrived at 6:00 the lady running the desk put my order in immediately. One of the males, possibly the manger came out and told me the order was being worked on and would be out shortly. It was a HUGE order. They sat me while I waited and asked if I wanted a drink. Definitely customer service focused. That they serve Thai, Hibachi and Chinese is a huge bonus.  The food was excellent and abundant. They have a life long customer!
