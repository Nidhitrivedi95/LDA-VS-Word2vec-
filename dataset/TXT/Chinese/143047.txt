rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g The dim sum at phoenix palace is pretty good, we enjoyed everything.  I ordered something new in my book and that was the curry tendon- it was a bit chewy and was lacking the curry flavor but overall not bad.  My favorite part about dining here is when you sit down and all the ladies with their dim sum carts flock toward you!!
