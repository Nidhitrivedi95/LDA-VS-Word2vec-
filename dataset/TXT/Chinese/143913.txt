rsQAS-k7GldsJm7UAtVyYA Very limited parking in this dingy plaza...upon entering this place we were not greeted by anyone at all, the cashier didn't even bother saying a single word, Infact the entire time at this place the only word that was spoken to us by the cashier and waitress combined is $15.50.....there goes their tip and customer service, we decided to just seat ourselves where a table had menus on it, the waitress didn't give us tea and ordering slip til 10mins later....typically pho place that's very cheap like $7 a dish depending on what you order

The whole entire time I didn't hear a single word from the waitress and she looked so pissed off, didn't break a smile but oh well
Mediocre food, nothing special and honestly I've tasted better bun and com dishes elsewhere
