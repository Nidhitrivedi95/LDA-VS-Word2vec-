GxzEsd-81hVP6C2h6wMvBw Amazing Chinese hand-pulled noodles (la mian).  I'm not much of a noodle person but this place has totally changed my mind.

The place was really small with a few tables and 2 counters.  We managed to get 3 spots at the counter for lunch today.

The menu is basically a selection of braised beef noodle soup but you choose the soup style and noodle type ( round, flat, etc) for about $8.  We got the classic beef with medium round noodles and the pickle mustard with mushroom with small round noodles.  The soup noodles was served  piping hot and flavour was very tasty with a peppery taste to it.  I really enjoy the noodles with pickle mustard.  We also got two appetizers - cucumber with black fungus salad and chicken hearts skewers which were also really good.

We will definitely be coming back soon.
