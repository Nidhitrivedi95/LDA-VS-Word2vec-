OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Couldn't get near Ping Pang Pong,  so came here after seeing good Yelp reviews.  Despite a modest language barrier, service was fast and efficient, though a couple of times we had to flag down carts.  Everything was very fresh and hot, with the exception of some of the fried dishes. The ha gow was especially good.
