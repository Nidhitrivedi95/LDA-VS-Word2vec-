zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ My fiancé and I came here for summerlicious lunch and we ordered:

Marinated cucumber - thinly sliced cucumber marinated in vinegar and sesame. It reminded me of a Chinese cold noodle dish minus the chicken. It was nothing much to boast about.

Inari - I've had their Inari before and quite enjoyed it. It hit the spot this time and nice balanced flavours.

Jajang noodle - I know it's a fusion dish, but I much much prefer the jajang mein at a Korean restaurant. I really disliked the citrus peel flavour in this jajang noodle. Overall it wasn't that great in flavours, but the noodles were at least cooked properly.

Ginger scallion noodle - again, nicely cooked noodles and nice flavours as you get to the bottom, but a bit oily.

German chocolate jimbo cake truffle - I've had their birthday cake and strawberry truffle in the past, and didn't have high hopes for these chocolate ones, and I was right. People say good things come in small packages, yet these clearly aren't working for me. It's super sweet and dense, and not even in a good way.

Overall, my fiancé and I are a bit disappointed in momofuku noodle bar in general (we've been here at least 3x), and every time the food just isn't up to par and flavour combinations are off.
