Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Thai style Asian food.  Unique flavors found no where else.

This is one of our favorite go-to mom & pop restaurant for the family.  Simple reason, and our son sometimes want stir fried noodle plates and other times get food envy and end up eating our entrees, we have to like most of the dishes on the menu in case he gets adventurous when he orders.

The spice scales here is serious!  Do not, under any circumstances, ever get beyond a spice level 4.  Trust me I'm Asian and I know these things.  

My favorite dish:  Beef Pho Noodle soup, spice level 2, with extra slice beef.  It is pho noodles, but the cut of beef is slightly different than Vietnamese pho and the spices are more Thai style too.

Husband's favorite: Fish Pad See Ew, spice level 3.  The sliced fish is deep fried in a seasoned batter before being mixed into the plate of noodles.  It has very good flavor and adds texture to a plate of soft flat rice noodles.

If your kid eats spicy, get them spice level 1 here.  If not, don't just ask for zero, tell them your kid can't eat any spicy food.

Service, seat yourself and be patient as they do a lot of take out orders.  Chef Lisa is the chef owner along with her husband David.  Food is obviously the best when she's cooking in the kitchen and when David is working the front of the restaurant.  We've been there when neither of them are there and food / service drops to about a 4 star.

Highly recommend this for another who's looking for Asian fushion.
