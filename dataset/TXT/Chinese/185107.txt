xYe-LX3lSKlNS3Wp29_YyA From entry to exist this was a poor culinary experience.  No one to greet and seat you even though servers/waiters were available.  Menus were brought to the table and left for the patrons to distribute to each other.  A jug of lukewarm water was left on the table for us to pour for ourselves and no other beverages were offered.  The food was ok (for what was avaialble) nothing special when compared to any other Chinese restaurant in the GTA.  The icing on the cake was the delivery of the bill. When we had asked for change it appears the server decided to take his own tip (more than 30% of the bill). When he was asked for the remainder of the change he claimed that he thought we gave him $40 when it was clear that he was handed a single fifty dollar bill.  Needless to say we definitely won't be returning.  You would expect to have a better experience when enter an establishment with the word Palace in their name!
