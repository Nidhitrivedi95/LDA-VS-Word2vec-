GkY6UWWn0Fz2ehcuBp66pg Great service and great food! Large menu means plenty of choice - something vegetarians don't often get! This is often our restaurant of choice for special occasions.
Attentive servers - all questions are answered respectfully and their recommendations are helpful. Ask for the "special" menu if you want something different - there are even more traditional dishes that aren't on the English menu.
Love the chicken with black bean sauce in hot pot, chinese broccoli with ginger sauce and beef with black pepper sauce. Great place!!
