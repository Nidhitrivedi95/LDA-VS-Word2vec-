wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA For Asian tapas in Chinatown, Ichiza is the gold standard.

But Inyo was pretty darn good. Folks were fairly mixed on whether they preferred the food there or Ichiza, having done Ichiza Wednesday and Inyo Friday. The vibe at Ichiza is way better; Inyo was dark and quiet, so we -- a table of 10 -- were definitely the rowdiest table in there, and we were on pretty good behavior. Everything we ate was good, though. 

For sure, though, if you are looking for Asian tapas and don't want to wait an hour at Ichiza, Inyo is a good bet. $40pp out the door, and we overordered and had a bunch of large bottles of Sapporo, so priced very comparably to Ichiza (maybe 10% more expensive -- maybe).

Things we ate at Inyo:

* Crab fried rice
* Japanese, Thai, and Korean chicken wings
* Kara age
* Mix tempura
* Oshinko
* Tako carpaccio
* Edamame
* Miso black cod
* Char siu bao
* Assorted kushi 
* Char siu egg rolls
* Chu-toro tartare
* Maguro & avocado
* Whole yari ika (squid)
* (god damn you?) half Japanese sweet corn

I'm sure we also had some of the specials. I don't have anything bad to say about anything we ate. The whole squid I thought was pretty well-prepared, and I generally was a huge fan of the chu-toro tartare and the maguro/avocado mix. But I like raw fish quite a bit. I'd say everyone in our group really liked something different (one was the corn, another was the octopus carpaccio).

Anyway, it's a cool place to check out. I'll definitely be back.
