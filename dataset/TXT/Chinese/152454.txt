T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw My sister and my son and I went in tonight for just a quiet dinner, we love the sushi and the fried rice. Now my sister is picky and so is my son, now our server Micheal, was one of the best servers we have had. He made my sisters requests happen and even admired my son who loves to make conversation with everyone. His kind heart and just overall tenderness was something that we couldn't ask more of. We live right down the road and will be back to see him! Not many people out there like him and I just want to recognize the food service industry for what it really is. I'm in the food industry and it's a tough job and you have to have the right outlook at it and micheal had that and more tonight so we thank you so very much!!
