pAQwza9U8OLY65Q73pAnxQ This restaurant is fairly new compared to the rest of highway 7 congee ones, but my family and I decided to come and try it anyways. The food is very similar to Power King in New Kennedy Square.

Other than that, the food was good and the waitress was helpful in terms of recommending food. Unfortunately that day, I was wearing white pants and while she was packing up our fish, some of the soy sauce splashed on my pants. I knew she saw it happen, but she didn't say sorry. On top of that, when we decided to tip her, she was complaining about the amount of tip we gave her. I believe tip is a reflection in how great the service was and the service wasn't great considering the sauce spill.
