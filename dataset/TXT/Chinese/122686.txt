OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Some of the food is extremely salty. I don't think anyone is taste testing any of the dishes.  I've been here 3 times and each time a few of the dishes were too salty to the point I couldn't eat it. One time I had to wash the beef tripe in water and I couldn't even taste any pork at all with the crispy pork belly because it was just pure salt.  Overall the dim sum dishes are good but I have no intentions of returning with the food being so salty and inconsistent.
