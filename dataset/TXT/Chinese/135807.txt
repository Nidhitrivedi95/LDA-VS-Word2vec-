QDJBn7I1EdtP9w4nYT24Pw We ordered orange chicken, egg rolls, crab puffs, veggie lo mein, and wonton soup. Sadly the wonton soup was the best of all it and it's just wonton and cabbage. The lo mein was very bland. The orange chicken was soft for some reason and didn't have any crunch to it. The egg rolls were super greasy. And the crab puffs didn't really have any cream cheese or crab in them. The only positive thing and why it got 2 stars was because it was cheap and it delivered.
