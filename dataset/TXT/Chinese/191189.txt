ysaGG0hm7-ug-IuRd-8_ew Great affordable price,
You can't beat the price
we always have leftovers
portions are huge
I have been to this place a few years ago but they changed owners 
I was a little hesitant to eat here because most chinese places are kinda pricey
I usually only eat chinese if it is a buffett (good price and lots of variety, all you can eat).
I heard they had a $2 teriyaki bowl,
I ordered it and it was so much food,
We go there about 2 times a week for lunch,
The food is ok.... Lo Mein was not that great but was only $1.65 small it was missing the usual veggie, cabbage carrots onions. But it was a lot of lo mein for a small.
Orange chicken was ok...I like Pandas better but Panda charges you $5 for a small bowl and I only paid $3.88 for small that was a lot bigger.
Chicken Katsu was really good, the sauces they make are delicious they have a chile sauce that is wonderful.
Crab puffs are amazing you can actually taste the crab. its not all filled with cream cheese like other places.
I love this place because its affordable and food is good.
