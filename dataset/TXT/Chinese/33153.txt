a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg LOVE LOVE LOVE the Hangover Burger and I am not a Burger person at all when I am home.  When in Vegas I must have IN & Out Burger and the Hangover Burger from Binions Cafe.  Whats better then Eggs and bacon on your burger.  YUM!  It is just perfect there.  Every trip to Vegas this place gets hit a couple times.  Once we sat at the Bar area and got to talk to once of the cooks who had been working there for over 20 yrs.  He was amazing and being a Vegas History Geek myself he had a lot of insight on the things that have changed there etc.  

I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this place no matter what you order you can not go wrong.  Make sure you get a players club card before you go so you can get a major discount on the food.
