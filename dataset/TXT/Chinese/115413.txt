n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A Just had dinner at Mr Chow at Caesar in Vegas.  The food and service was really bad.  Ordered the noodle which didn't have any flavor and only lukewarm.  The filet mignon and chicken were ok only.  The service was slow.  When the main courses came one was missing and I had to remind the head waiter twice and when we got it was chewy and had it return to the kitchen.  

I was so looking forward for this dinner and so disappointed with the food and service.   I will never go back to this restaurant ever again.  I don't recommend this restaurant!  I would rate this 0 Star!
