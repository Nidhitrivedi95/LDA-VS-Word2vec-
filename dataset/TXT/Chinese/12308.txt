2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w Well have been here several times last year and a half, both dine in and take out.  The food is getting more greasy each time.  Also seems the prices have been upped slightly as well.  For dining in the options for kids are pretty rough as well.

The dine in experience can be very hit or miss.  The younger girls are very pleasant and attentive, and believe me this place keeps them busy, between running their tables and the endless stream of take out.

Unfortunately the older severs (owners?) are not as friendly.  Had a pretty bad experience there today.
