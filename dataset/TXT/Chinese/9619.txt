1uPQTz5XZSWr0ti7kUpaDw We use to live in China, and these were as authentic as they could be.  They are made fresh when you order them.  The orders come in 15, and it's a $1.50 more if you want them fried.  These are northern style dumplings, as the style changes depending on what part of China you are in.  So friggen good.  Super friendly staff.
