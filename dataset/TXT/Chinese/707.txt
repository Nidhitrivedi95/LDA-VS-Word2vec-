-cuzw1pcZ_UcdA4Qxc5YYg Cute place! Absolutely love their cute logo - which is probably what drawn me into coming here. I ordered pepper beef rice (can't recall the exact name but the egg on it was a nice surprise) and their popcorn chicken! I love their popcorn chicken and would return for that. The rice dish was just okay - the flavours weren't for me. I did see other tables trying their beef noodles and that did look yummier than my dish. I might give that a try next time! There is definitely room for improvement with their service and menu items. It almost seems like their appetizers are better than the mains. I'm hopeful they will sort the kinks out since they are a pretty new establishment. For now, I'm open to giving them another try but not handing recommendations to this place yet.
