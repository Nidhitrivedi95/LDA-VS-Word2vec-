HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA A must stop every time we come to Vegas! Wonderful attentive service. The pulled pork belly bao never disappoints! I wanted to order their signature Fat Choy burger but since it's a substantial large burger I settled for their famous baos (two boas come in one order). We definitely be back again next time we are in Vegas!
