oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q A staple of middle class Mississauga. This place has been around forever, and it's definitely had its ups and downs.

Lately, my go to Hakka place has been Chilli Chicken House. What I've found is that CCH has now become wildly inconsistent due to its popularity. I have started visiting Eddies more and more and have found that;

1) The consistency is considerably better than CCH. 

2) The appetisers are better at Eddie's.

3) The quality of meat is better at CCH.

If you need a respite from CCH because of the insane crowds and wait times there, check out Eddie's (again).
