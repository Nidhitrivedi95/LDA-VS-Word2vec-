K3J4zvnQ_G1d5xfffPf2Wg I really love this place. But I ordered their spicy chicken rice ball to try it out. And when I bit into it; I learned there was spam or a fishy smell. It clearly wasnt chicken. (I have a pet peeve for businesses who don't accurately  describe what's in the food as I try to stay away from certain foods) I wouldn't have purchased the rice ball if I knew there was spam or some sort of fish. It's really gross.
Other than that: the food is awesome. I wish they would bring back there cheesecake or have it in stock.
