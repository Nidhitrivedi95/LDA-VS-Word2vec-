DDAGwRR0SypD47XD7-ytjA Today is my first time to go to this restaurant, and I was so disappointed by the service ( the old lady who always has a bad mood). When we just walked into the restaurant, she didn't take us to the table, instead she kept telling me to control my kids. What do you mean control my kids, B? They were stand beside the table.
I'll give 4.5 stars for the food. But I told myself I will never go back to that restaurant again until the old lady is not working there anymore!
