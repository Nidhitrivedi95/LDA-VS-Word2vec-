DDdX9rGk5v6OVoH9VMkk4w This place is nasty. I got the chicken and broccoli, it had way to much sauce on it and let me tell ya there was a bone in my chicken. I aslo got the teriyaki chicken on a stick and it was gross really salty it was deep fried with some nasty seasoning on it. If I could I would give this place no stars I would. Never eating here again.
