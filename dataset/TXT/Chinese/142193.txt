RJKbewB0SzRZpIvQmiF-dQ A couple of weeks ago I found a menu for New North China on my door. First off, how long can a place be open and still be new? Anyway, I wasn't in the mood for pizza and didn't want to go out. I ordered some General Tso's Chicken, a dinner special, and a small order of house lo mein. The total was $17 and some change. I thought this was high, and was informed they have a $2 delivery charge.

When the food arrived, I was excited for some delicious Chinese food. It wasn't delicious whatsoever. As a matter of fact, it wasn't even good. I am VERY disappointed in this. It feels like a waste of money, and I am sitting here on a Saturday night hungry. I won't be ordering from New North China again. I would recommend you look elsewhere.
