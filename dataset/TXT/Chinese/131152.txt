phTLTkqSvylLkmz5wAwhTw As a brand new vegetarian, I was so skeptical but I have been OBSESSED with the eggplant tofu for MONTHS. It is seriously the most delicious vegetarian dish I have had thus far. Its perfectly seasoned, the tofu is perfectly fried, and it just tastes amazing. 

I ordered through yelp with them, about 4 times now and everytime they are so fast and extremely friendly.
