DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg My fiancé and I came here after finding out they had gluten free options on their menu. This was particularly exciting for my fiancé who suffers from celiac's disease. We came in and the place looked pretty cool. The staff seemed friendly and it was a pretty nice environment. I ordered a Teriyaki meal and she ordered the Sweet and Sour chicken from the gluten free menu. We took our food to-go. When we got home (we live less than ten minutes away) we were excited to try it out, but we both ended up disappointed with our meals. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with the meals, they just tasted very bland. I didn't really get a lot of flavor from the chicken or the rice. It kind of tasted like a microwaved teriyaki bowl. My fiancé also said something similar about her dish. For the price, it definitely wasn't worth it in my opinion. Kind of a let down. Overall, awesome joint with nice people. The food, however, is kind of a let down.
