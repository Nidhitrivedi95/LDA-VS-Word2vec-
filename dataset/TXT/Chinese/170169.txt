VVUL1lzBOipXJlOG1wURMg We were in the area and thought we would drop in for a quick meal. Ordered the usual house fried rice and chilli chicken. The food took a bit longer then expected approx 20 mins or so. It did show up hot and ready to eat eventually. My partner said the chicken tasted 'off' so he didn't eat more then one piece and only ate the fried rice. I really enjoyed the sauce so i covered my fried rice with the sauce. It was delicious at the time - but it was a huge mistake. Finished the meal around 7pm. Got home, stomach was rumbling a bit, thought it was just because the fried rice was pretty spicy, but no big deal. At 4:30 AM I woke up feeling nauseous and was throwing until 11:00 AM. At 6:30 AM it came out the OTHER end and that didn't stop until 12:45pm. I felt like I was going to die. It was the worst feeling in the whole world and would not wish this on anyone. My body was cold, sweaty and aching all over. =( 
FOOD POISONING

I use to love this place but since it took me out of commission for an entire day it's been axed off my list.  
I hate leaving a review that says 'don't eat here' but DON'T EAT HERE!
