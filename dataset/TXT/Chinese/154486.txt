tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg Here's the deal - I am reviewing on happy hour only; unfortunately, I've never eaten here another time, my wife just isn't a chinese food fan ever...

But for happy hour, I'm often here just for the happy hour bar menu.  They have a crunchy roll that is the best sushi roll you will ever touch your tongue to.  Pile on some dumplings and edamame, and you have one of the best dinner deals in town.  Anytime I can find somebody to hit Autumn Court between 3-7pm, I'm there.  And I could eat that crunchy roll 7 days a week.
