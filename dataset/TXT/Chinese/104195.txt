Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg Unbelievable! Not in a good way either ! Reached out to P.F. Chang's from my room they took the order and advised I come down in 30 minutes. 

I did just that to find a confused waiter asking if my order is possibly under another name to find out they no longer offer the dish I placed an order for! Why didn't the server taking my order know this? 
 
Why didn't anyone page my room to let me know! So disappointed. The communication needs to be improved among the staff, the hotel and with their customers!
