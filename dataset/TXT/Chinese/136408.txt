qGLEE1yA1bK0YdlGI-S39A The craving of noodle soup fulfilled.

I've been to this restaurant before with my family where we always admire the simplicity of the menu. The main focus of the menu is the noodle soup style. You have a dozen options of how you take your noodle soup. The options include beef brisket, wonton, dumpling, and fish dace. 

I had the break brisket and dumplings. It was quickly served with a soup base that was not too salty. The noodle option I chose was the ho fun. My favourite. The prices are reasonable and worth for the portion size you receive. 

The restaurant was quick full with every table taken. 

The kitchen is open concept where you can see the cooks prepare the food. 

We also had boiled iceberg lettuce with oyster sauce. A dish that can't go wrong. 

Overall, my dining experience was pleasant. No complaints. 

Definitely a place to visit again for a good old craving of noodle soup.
