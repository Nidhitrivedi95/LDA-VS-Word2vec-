Xfod0UWr_9B-TOM6qxVIwQ This place is my go to for sushi delivery. I'm allergic to shrimp and they always give me the shrimp spring roll with my choice of tuna or salmon and don't charge me extra. Very accommodating!! The staff couldn't be friendlier! I love that they gave us a Chinese calendar for the new year. I have never been in the restaurant, but I've been ordering from here for over two years and love it! So cool that they have Hawaiian options as well. It's like three restaurants in one: Chinese, Japanese and Hawaiian. Awesome!!
