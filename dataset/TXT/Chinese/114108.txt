mt5kFJr1rOqIajMguELR9Q I went to the Drake hotel for a poetry slam, as usual.

Then I was like - the weather is so nice and calm and breezy and beautiful, and it is 11 p.m. , what can I eat? 

Oh Saigon Flower? sushi and har gow? GREAT.

Anyways - no. I ordered the har gow, Pho, sushi. Fail on all. I felt like I was eating acid and bleach. I dont know how to explain this. The HarGow did NOT have real shrimp in it.

I would never eat here again. It says open till 330 a.m, which is cool for the late night crowd but ...no.

I wish I went to Subway next door.
