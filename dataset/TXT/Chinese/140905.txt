RAKSBqeNb-p_ZABwAWH_jA I ordered Togo  my first time and I tested and dumped it in the trash! I ordered the same thing I always get from Chinese restaurant but this was made with zero effort. Chicken was not cooked sauce was watered down (looked much like a soup the what I ordered). I was one of the last customer so they might have just put something together to get me out  but no thank you. I will. Or be visiting you ever again!
