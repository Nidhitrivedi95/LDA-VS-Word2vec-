SUktrYdNQD8k2vvkM4OpfA When my brother- and sister-in-law (who is Taiwanese) visited recently, we made the very great decision to let her order for all of us off of the secret menu.  If you visit Peking Garden's website, they call it the "Exotic Menu."  Nothing that I'd gotten off the menu for whitey had been bad, mind you, but the real deal stuff was awesome.  In addition to Sizzling Rice Soup, Deep-Fried Shrimp (whole), and Twice-Cooked Pork, we were treated to Stir-Fried Lamb with Ziran and Bean Leaves in Garlic Sauce.  The Ziran sauce was sweet, maybe reminiscent of cinnamon, and unlike anything I'd tasted in Chinese cuisine before.  The Bean Leaves were vibrantly green, tender--not soggy, and studded with garlic cloves.  AMAZING.

I still have not had their giant alcoholic drinks, but I want to.  I just want to have a cocktail big enough for two people while munching on bean leaves and garlic cloves.  Is that too much to ask?
