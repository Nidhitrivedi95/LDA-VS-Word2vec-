N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ that oxtail with the plantain coconut rice was AMAZING, i was actually a bit sad when i took the last bite. also got the kimchi potstickers, the OG fried cauliflower (sweet and sour cauliflower essentially), and wok fried gailan. tried to order the jamaican patty double down but they sold out of the vegetarian patties...guess we will have to go back another time.
