xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A I've eaten at Lulu's too many times to count.  I always get dragged here by friends and family, against my better judgment.  I have cousins who've worked here, but that doesn't mean I have to like the food.

Now, I don't care if Asian food tastes authentic, but I care if it tastes good.  The only Pittsburgh food that I like less than Lulu's is the blood-pressure-inducing salty dishes at Rose Tea Cafe (go figure, everyone seems to like that place as well).  Go to Bangkok Balcony instead for something nice, or even Orient Express if you're in a hurry.

That said, the restaurant environment is kind of nice, especially considering how inexpensive the place is.  And the service is usually decent.
