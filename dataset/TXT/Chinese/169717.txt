VU5btOpyINHmCfGajZJe0Q I'm not a big fan of black sesame paste but my aunt insisted I try some of hers. Surprisingly I liked it! My aunt said this place is her favourite place to get this. My cousin got the watermelon grassjelly and he seems to really enjoy that too. I will remember this place next time I'm around the area.
