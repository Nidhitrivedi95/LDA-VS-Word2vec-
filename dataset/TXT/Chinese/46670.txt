bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q So much fun! Service was off the charts. Servers were working together to make sure we were well taken care of. At one point, the owner came over, hugged my mom, and wished her a happy Mother's Day. lol Food was very good. Basic American Chinese food, but high quality. Get the orange chicken! We will be back for sure. :-)
