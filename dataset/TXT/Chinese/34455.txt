aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ As always the food was excellent unfortunately our server treated us like an inconvenience for being in his section.  Jeff leaned over the glass wall to take our order and deliver our food. He couldn't even come around to the front of our table.  He was clearing dishes and cutlery as fast as we put down our forks.  He never even asked if we wanted another drink OR dessert just put down the bill. Sadly we will be visiting another location
