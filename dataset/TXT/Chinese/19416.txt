5NzUIglhCrq88ojer2Q2jw great fried rice. good fusion between chinese and indian. go for the dinner specials like masala chicken on fried rice. from other places, I usually buy thai fried rice with chilli chicken for $15 but here I am able to get both a special put together but with a larger quantity for only $10..thats good value..
