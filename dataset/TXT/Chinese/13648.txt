2ZHk1x5ZH687aPVo4ElYAA Consistency is what defines the quality of the drinks here, they are always refreshing when the right flavours are picked. On our last visit here, my girlfriend and I both had Italian sodas, she had the passion fruit soda while I had the strawberry banana. The drinks were on point.

Over the years this chain and particularly this location has had several deals that got customers to revisit but were discontinued unexpectedly. One specific deal was a post secondary student discount of 10-15% that was offered for a while. This discount eventually became a take out discount and then was shortly discontinued. The reason I bring this up is because we had a stamp card in which we had to collect 8 drinks in order to get a free drink. We had filled out the card over the times that we've visited only to find out that they've changed it to take out orders. Suffice to say, this was another promotion we were disappointed in.
