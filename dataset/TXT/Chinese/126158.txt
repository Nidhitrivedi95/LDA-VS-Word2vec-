OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA My family has been coming here for the lunch special whenever we get the chance for years. It has stayed pretty consistent and the price is AMAZING compared to the huge portions, I had enough for dinner as well. I had the Shrimp Chow Mein today with chicken corn soup (amazingly warm and delicious) as was the main dish. Both had just the right amount of everything in my humble opinion. 
The rest of my family ordered Beef with Chili Sauce and Beef Chow Mein and one person ordered the hot and sour soup instead. Everyone loved it but two people did find it lacking in spice and basically finished the entire jar of chili that they usually have on the table with the soy sauce. 
The service was really fast, we were barely half way through the soup when the main dishes arrived. They were warm but not as piping hot as some would've liked (i don't like my food too hot so it wasn't a problem). Atmosphere and location was good, I did find it kind of odd that they had popular English music playing but again, no biggie.
The only con is that after eating, I was parched, no matter how many glasses of water I had. This is something I haven't experienced before but I guess i'm more susceptible to the salt level now that i've started eating healthier...or they've started adding more MSG, i don't know. Hopefully this dry throat will disappear soon. But just a word of warning, be prepared to intake more liquid than normal and don't visit this place more than once a month.
