ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg My husband and I love Vegas. Btw the 2 of us, we've been there 33 times (and we live on the East Coast. =)  When it came time for us to pick a place to have a mini-reception for our friends after we got married, we couldn't think of a more suitable city like Las Vegas.  And nothing says Las Vegas like a buffet! So we searched around and picked the buffet with the best view.  Little did we know that we came for the view but got the best buffet on the Strip - the Jasmine brunch buffet! 

All the awesome things:
1) I called a few months before arriving and told the hostess that we were celebrating our nuptials with a few friends and to see if we could get a table by the window.  While they couldn't guarantee this, I showed up that day with the perfect table with a perfect fountain view, right next to the window.
2) The food at the buffet was spectacular.  Even my super-picky friend couldn't stop raving about the bbq beef short ribs, which were soooo tender and tasty.  Then there was the Peking duck, carved table-side.  Talk about wow factor for your guests! 
3) I have the biggest sweet tooth out there and the dessert ROOM at the buffet was alone worth the price tag. 
4) B/c it was a celebration, my friends brought a bottle of champagne, which the waiter promptly served.  He even gave me a chilled bottle of the same thing, since mine was brand new/room temperature.  How thoughtful! 

Overall, my husband and I had a very memorable meal there - food was super tasty, atmosphere was absolutely lovely, service was fantastic.  We are planning on celebrating our 2 year anniversary at Las Vegas again this summer.  Can't wait to hit up Jasmine Brunch buffet again!
