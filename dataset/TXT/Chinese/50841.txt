Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA Go to their happy hour!!!  3-6 daily!  Everything on the menu is tasty.  The drink specials are really good too.  We've gone to the Planet Hollywood and the Flamingo/Paradise location for the happy hour.  Love it both times!  

If you like spicy...you have to try the Red Dragon Dumplings.  And lettuce chicken wraps are always a must!

Without a doubt, I'll be back!
