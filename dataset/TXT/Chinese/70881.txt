FanQrSh9QTDytonKHt9C6Q I had been looking forward to a meal at Yuan for a while... However, with many good options on St Denis, I may not return. 

While the concept of vegetarian bento boxes is interesting, the dishes were poorly executed. The 'brownie' was a slice of Betty Crocker cake from a box and the decor borrowed from an Italian restaurant... I'm confused - what is this place? Japanese? Mediterranean? 

The only thing that had any taste was the General Tso 'beef which was quite good. Everything else was bland, cold and disappointing.
