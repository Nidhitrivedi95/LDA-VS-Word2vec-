1MrJJ9tyNyfFrxaNZ67xFg This is a Vietnamese owned, Chinese and Japanese restaurant. All I can say is, "wow". Usually, the restaurants that serve different types of Asian food aren't very good, but Silk Road is on point. If you are looking for authentic Chinese and Japanese food, this place is not for you. If you are looking for Americanized Chinese and Japanese food, this place is for you. Everything is cooked very well and tastes delicious. My boyfriend and I frequent here for Chinese food. 

The service is also very good. It was madness on New Year's Eve. We placed a very large order for sushi and Chinese food. We were surprised when they said only 45 minutes. We came and picked up, it was a full house and a ton of takeout orders, but everything was done quickly and correctly. The employees, despite being under a tremendous amount of pressure, were courteous and efficient. 

I definitely recommend this place!
