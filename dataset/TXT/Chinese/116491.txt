N97-DBkCFBy69maCMkUG1A I just went here for lunch with 9 other coworker, and I have to say, most of the food we try was a little bit too salty. The lamb skew was the best food, while the other food such as the fried rice, the egg plant with pork, and the soup were all "meh". Also the famous $5 was just as advertise, we got a few pitchers and they tasted alright .
