O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw This is my go to dim sum joint. A few must try's if you're ordering of the dim sum menu:
Hargow
Sui Mai
Steamed BBQ pork buns (!!!)
Fried bean curd with shrimp paste
Beef short ribs
Tripe
Eggplant with shrimp paste 
Fried squid tentacle
Black sesame paste ball for dessert 

They get really busy around dinner time but they are really good about managing the volume. I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 20 mins for a table.
