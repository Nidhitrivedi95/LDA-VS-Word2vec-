Z0JT0Ras-kMvJLMdn9iJQQ Decided to try this place yesterday on a whim (I was craving good Chinese food and wanted to try a new place). It's really tucked away so it's hard to spot from the street. 

The decor when you walk in is beautiful. The seats almost feel like you're sitting outside in a private patio setting. It took a minute to be seated but later on I found out why: The place was ran by one man. The same man that seated me also took my order, cooked my meal and was my cashier. I don't know if this is how they normally operate, but it's too minimal for a business. He had really broken English as well, which makes it incredibly hard to communicate when ordering or asking for something you need. 

The food itself was good. The eggplant was very tasty and the noodles were just okay. I'd probably never order the noodles again, but they have a LOT of options. The food also seems authentic too. 

I would come back, but I'd be inclined to bring somebody that speaks Chinese the next time around to translate and to make suggestions.
