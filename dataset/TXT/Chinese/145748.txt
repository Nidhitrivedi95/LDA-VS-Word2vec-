S2_YSVQlTxu0ABRDEsze7g To be honest, paying 30+ dollars for a hot pot like this was definitely a WASTE. We got there at around 10 PM, the receptionist was good, gave us a sit, and everything was good on that point. But, to order the base of the soup and the food, we use 20 mins to catch the attention of the waiter. The service since than was TERRIBLE, no one was walking around to ask if needed anything when the table was empty, because customers need to order from the server and not an order shit. Even more terrible, servers ask the tables for any request that were near around us, except us who were sitting at the middle of the restaurant. By paying this price for a meal, this restaurant will lose a customer and I believe more coming.
