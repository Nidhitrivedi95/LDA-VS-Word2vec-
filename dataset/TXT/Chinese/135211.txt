qaJ-HewyVAQCQ8C_KveZ4g We ordered delivery from this place last night and were very pleased. The General Tso's is delicious and perfectly spicy. The Sweet and Sour Chicken was ok. Ordering in the Yelp app made the experience much better - no language barrier over the phone and it ensured the order would not be messed up. Prompt delivery. I would recommend this place for delivery.
