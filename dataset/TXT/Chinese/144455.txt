RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ One of my favorite places to get bubble tea in Pittsburgh.  The food is good too.  Today I tried and enjoyed the marinated pork special.  But what really sticks out to me about Rose Tea Cafe is the service.  It has always been fast, friendly, and very accommodating.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for bubble tea, a meal, or both in the Squirrel Hill area.
