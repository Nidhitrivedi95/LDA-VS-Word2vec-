tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg So so so horrible I will tell you why. I play at the casino all the time and get food comps. So I receive 150 dollars I food comp. I had to order my food at the bar. The young blonde hair lady with the glasses was horrible. First she ignored me and serving her host there was like 4 people at the bar ordering drinks. She didn't even come up and say I'll be with you just a moment, but in stead rolled her eyes at me. Waited 30 mins to finally get to order food. So I place a huge order. Came back serval time to see if my food was ready and she was like the cooks are mad at me and it'll come out. I kept seeing people go by and and getting there food first. Thought that she forgot to put in my order. I went back again to see if it's ready it's been 3hrs. I'm not kidding by the way. They are about to close. I asked for the manager, and waited again. So I played bj and see how it goes. Took the manager 40 mins to see me to resolve issue. So they came up with a plan for the next time I come I have two entree, appetizer, and free dessert on them. I felt that the waitress/ bartender was discriminating and rude. Wow such horrible service. Never been treated like that. So if you see her don't take any orders from her. The food was overall pretty ok.
