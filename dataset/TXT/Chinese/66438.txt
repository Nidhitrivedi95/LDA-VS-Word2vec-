EhGPj8iJDIdaHnWg9d5BgA I took a day off from work to visit this restaurant with my in-laws.  Wife made a reservation at 11.  Surprised by a rude greeting at the front, claiming our name is not on the reservation list.  End up it's a confusion between first name and last name, but the whole conversation is not polite at all.

Food (dim sum) is fair, definitely have better choices for similar price.  The lake view is excellent, no doubt on this.

The worst part of service came at the end, we were asked not in a polite manner if we are going to order more food.  It was close to noon, not even an hour since we have a seat.  Then the bill passed to us without our request.  Terrible service in my opinion.
