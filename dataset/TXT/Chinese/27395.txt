8B4tanBgBpccBUWSEH4yLA If you're looking for "real" Chinese food, best go elsewhere.  That aside, this is one of my favorite joints for good "American" Chinese.

The place isn't large, more or less a hole in the wall.  The staff is pretty friendly and is quick to get your food ready when it's not busy.  However, they do struggle to keep up with a number of customers when it's busier. Be prepared to wait a while (never more than 30 min).  Decor is complete with the manager's daughter and her TV. Fun!  Don't expect to bring larger groups here, as the place seats 20 at the most, and even then, it's a squeeze.

The food is pretty good and is consistently so.  Have been there 10+ times and never disappointed.  You can expect plenty of sauce on your giant amount of chicken/beef/whatever with a solid side of rice (white or fried, your choice).  

Lunch specials are hard to pass up at a whopping $5.01 for a drink and a hefty helping of whatever you ordered.  Don't see what you want on the lunch menu?  No problem - just ask them for it, they've been happy to comply.

We've also done dinner for a group before and the amount of food we got was massive.  The bag alone weighed close to 15 lbs.  

Worth a try!
