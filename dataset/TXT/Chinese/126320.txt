oZfNL6ZFdITqfwJzcE-LyA I love getting take-out and delivery from this foodery. They have awesome combo plates, and their egg rolls are really unique. The cream cheese puffs could be bigger, I'd rather have fewer big ones than several tiny ones. But that's just my opinion. My top three favorite dishes, orange chicken, chicken chow mein, and beef fried rice.
