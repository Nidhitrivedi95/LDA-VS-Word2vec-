44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw Had a fairly decent meal on 5/14/16.  Portions were large and tasted okay.  We were finished with our meal and chatting with our friends when asked to leave. We were told that the table was needed.  There were a few people waiting who could have been seated at other available tables at this   early evening.  They were rude, inconsiderate, and just really used poor business sense!  We will think long and hard before we return there and we will make sure to tell our friends and acquaintances. Oh,yes they were certainly not apologetic!
