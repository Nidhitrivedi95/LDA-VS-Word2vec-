a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg The food is certainly not authentic Chinese but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. This was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had. The service was spot on. The server visually checked on us every five minutes or so and offered complimentary dessert at the end. Everything was perfectly cooked. All of the vegetables had the perfect amount of crunch to them and the meat was soft and tender. 

Try the Double Dragon. It was perfectly cooked -- and just melted in my mouth.
