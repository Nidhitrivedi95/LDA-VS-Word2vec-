BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg A couple friends and I got together last night for a girls night and decided to order from How Lee.  I'm always a little worried when ordering delivery for a big group that something goes wrong or is forgotten but I was pleasantly surprised when How Lee got it all right! We ordered a 1 tofu, 2 veggie, and 3 chicken dishes plus egg rolls and everyone raved over how delicious it all was! I ordered the white meat sesame chicken and it was cooked perfectly. The egg roll was really tasty as well. The portions are about what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant, and I brought enough home for another meal. 

2 small gripes. It took a while for delivery and there were no fortune cookies! Wah! I love the crunchy sweetness of a fortune cookie after eating a big meal like that! Oh well, everything else was great and if I were in the area again I would definitely check out How Lee again!
