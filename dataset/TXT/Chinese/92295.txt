IPyrraIafBs8afeVMGmfCQ As a native Chinese I am pretty particular when it comes to fried rice. Growing up my grandparents taught me that an easy way to spot a real Chinese chef from a fake one is by tasting his or her fried rice dish with the most simple and basic cooking. Angel's Fried Rice is certainly a real surprise on the strip of Las Vegas. The rice they use is real basmati rice from the hills of the Himalayas. And when served hot with curry chicken, teriyaki chicken, ham & egg, and curry shrimp, curry beef meatball vas even honey walnut shrimp you can do no wrong by adding some egg rolls and hot & sour soup for a dollar. With merely seven or eight dollars you get everything you expect and more. It's no surprise to me this restaurant is owned and operated by veteran restaurant business owner Bob Tang who has successfully ran a series of restaurants in San Francisco, Beijing and now Las Vegas.
