vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q I like this place because you get to eat the moment you sit down. The ladies with cart come right to you and sell you everything in their carts. The dim sum are pretty authentic and tasty. They have pretty much all the regular dim sum you can get from other dim sum places. This restaurant is okay clean and bright inside (with natural light). Prices are reasonable and there is no wait if you get there by noon on a Sunday.
