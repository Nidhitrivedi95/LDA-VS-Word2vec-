UED302E-B2OyVr0mssARnA I like another reviewer....Chinese-ish...lol! Well I'd have to agree on that one!  Best items here I think are: walnut shrimp ($1 more), string bean chicken and eggplant. I always opt for noodles because their rice is so dry...but even the noodles are not the greatest...but again it's fast and decent.  I like that they have the peach diet green tea....kids meal is not worth it, might as well get a 1 item combo for just a little more. No prize or dessert....don't bother. I don't recommend drive thru either they skimp in servings. All in all it's OK....at least no msg.
