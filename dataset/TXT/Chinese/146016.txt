S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A Super authentic Chinese noodles. I've spent a lot of time in China and had many bowls of <U+62C9><U+9762> which roughly translates to Ramen, and this is the best I've had in Phoenix. it's also the only place I know of to get <U+5200><U+524A><U+9762> or shaved noodles. A must eat!

The atmosphere is what I would call classic Chinese restaurant, something very similar to what you would see in China. Nothing fancy, but certainly adequate. Service is also great. Don't miss out on the Boba drinks.
