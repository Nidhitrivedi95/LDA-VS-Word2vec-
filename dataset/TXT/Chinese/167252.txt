VGKq16vCdPPHMoryy6XTHg The food here borders on gross and is not that cheap if viewed in light of how crappy it is.

We started with the catfish egg rolls, which tasted like someone dropped a fish stick in Tabasco, put it in a wrapper and fried it. The three cup tofu is apparently their most popular dish. It looked beautiful and tasted completely uninspired. Tofu drowning in heavy, corporate "Asian" sauce with over-marinated cucumbers on the side. My limp pizza was the worst attempt at thin-crust I have encountered in Madison.

I guess this place is "cool" because the lighting is red and the waitresses wear stripes and polka dots at the same time. I've been here at night for drinks as well and found it very awkward. The music is loud, so there's no way to talk, but also no expectation of dancing. 

The positives: They have a nice selection of beers on draft and the waitresses were polite.
