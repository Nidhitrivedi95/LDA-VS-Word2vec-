HGuHk935tyokX6kveEviJw Mekong is always pretty busy around lunch time on the weekends so I try to get there earlier, around 10:30 or 11. The food is great, consistent, and inexpensive. Where else would you be able to feed 5 people a large, non-fast-food lunch for around $50? There is less variety in the dishes than you would get at a similar place on either coast, but it is still my go-to dim sum place in the Phoenix area.
