All the times I've gone it's been clean, the waitress and bartender are both friendly and I have a great time! 
The only thing that I'm a little confused about is the hours. It says on yelp that they're 24/7 but last time I went on Thursday, around 1am they turned off half of the lights, looked like they were completing closing procedures and I kept noticing the waitress and bartender looking at my group so I took that as a cue to leave. When we were checking out, they didn't say anything so I don't really know lol
But overall, a great place to hang out with friends. I'll definitely be back soon!
