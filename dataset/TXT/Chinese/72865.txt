fh-hCT2esNJEocdBdggWoQ Went there for lunch. At first my families were really impressed with their sweet & sour pork. Unfortunately, we have to  wait for one whole hour for the Peking Duck and the duck is room temperature and I am basically biting on a piece of cold duck fat. So disappointed with this place, will not recommended to anyone.
