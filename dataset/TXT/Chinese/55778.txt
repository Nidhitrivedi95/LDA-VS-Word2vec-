cxq_iu2Zl5jm6qLGfff5eA I base my review on the few items I ordered from this place on a weekly basis: chicken curry, roast pork lo mein, Singapore rice noodles, shrimp fried rice. 
I lived a mile away, and was always given a good estimate for delivery time before completing the order on the phone (20 min to an hour at times) and the food was delivered hot.  I tipped the drivers pretty well, since it was always like -5 all winter.  The few times I strayed on the menu, the dishes were hit or miss but my main choices were always amazingly consistent. Not the cheapest cheap Chinese food around, but delicious for what it is and good value for the price.
