AUFFJBCh6spwBFJI6SnITg This place has great fresh affordable food! The one item bowl is LOADED with food! And for only $4 it can't be beat! I've had the Orange Chicken and Mushroom Chicken. Both were great dishes. I loved the lo mein. My favorite are the crab puffs! They are extremely hot. So allow some time to cool. I love this place and will be back ASAP.
