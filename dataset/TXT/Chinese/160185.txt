U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q When my family and I were on vacation in Vegas, we decided to go here for dinner before a show. The wait was 30 minutes, which was fine, but when we got to our table, there were barely people in there. That made me question why we had to wait so long. Perhaps they had too few servers that day, but even that is questionable.

Our family ordered the duck and bbq pork egg noodle soups. I know we didn't order a variation, so it's difficult for me to review the restaurant as a whole. However, these soups were decent, but nothing spectacular. Pretty plain with just noodles, the meat, and a few stalks of Chinese broccoli. The portions were quite large but for the quality, it's not worth the price we paid. Everything in Vegas is expensive, so it's unavoidable, even for a bowl of noodles.

Our server was very friendly and prompt. The atmosphere is really bright and modern, with walls consisting of overlaying curliques. I was a bit annoyed with the kitchen staff constantly dropping plates, which was really obvious in the otherwise quiet restaurant.

Would only go back if I was craving Chinese food but it's not an amazing experience.
