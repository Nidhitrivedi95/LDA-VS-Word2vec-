Rh2smrKvcamnP8VBUgMI0Q One of the better dim joints in Chinatown. It's located on the third floor of the building. Pretty large place that accommodates quite a lot of tables so there's not a huge wait time. Pretty much got seated after a 15 minute wait for a table of 7 on a Sunday.

It's also fairly clean though I'd still wipe my plating and utensils before eating. Service is ok - what you usually get at these Chinese places lol.

Onto the food, pretty decent for the price you're paying! I mean for me, it's a much better option for my wallet than going to Rol San. No food that really stocks out as amazing though. It's also your traditional method of wheeling carts around for your food and compared to other places that still do this, these dim sum ladies actually come around quite often! So not to worry if you miss a cart, she'll come back in 10 mins again. 

So if you're looking for some traditional dim sum in the heart of Chinatown, this would be one of your better options!
