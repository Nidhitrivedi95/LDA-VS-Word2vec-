Ly48L1qSRdLpCSWcs_DWIw Food is reasonable quality, though not necessarily better than many other HK style cafes in Markham. The price is also a bit steeper than most others. However, the decor is a little more put together than the others which are usually more hole in the wall kind of places.

Basically if you're looking for cheap authentic HK style cafe food there are better places. But if you're looking to bring people who might want a nicer atmosphere or who need English on the menu this is a solid choice if you don't mind paying a little bit more (e.g. $9-12 or so for a dish).
