iH-BDuPiIV1Eag82oqXmAQ A little hole in the wall restaurant with OK food. They do have a few tables but the inside of this place feels hot, oppressive and sticky, so I would definitely get take out. Large menu and fast, friendly service. The food is so-so, not awesome but OK, kind of like what'd you get at a mall food court but without the heavy greasiness.
