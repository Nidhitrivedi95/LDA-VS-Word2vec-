5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Fantastic dinner experience.  Our waitress was great and helped us pick some new items on the menu.   The green bean tempura appetizer was a hit. The veggie fried rice was plenty for 3 and very filling and went well with the chicken I ordered.  I wanted to try something new so the waitress suggested a pork dish and then switching the meat to chicken and it came out great.
