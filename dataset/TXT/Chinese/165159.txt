UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw We tried this Thursday.  We chose to sit outside and enjoy the evening.  It was quieter than I thought, given the location.  We opted for a table near the fire and it was very comfortable.  The service was great--Kenley did a wonderful job taking care of us.  For appetizers we had lettuce wraps and coconut shrimp.  My husband, who doesn't like coconut shrimp loved the way they prepared them.  The lettuce wraps were ok. My husband had the steak flambe and it was terrific.  I had the apricot glazed pork chops and couldn't eat them. They were dry dry dry.  We finished our meal with chocolate cake that was pretty good.  Portion sizes are generous (including the wine).  It is also across the parking lot from the PGA store so be sure we will go back next time we are at the PGA store.
