I don't really have a problem with the food or restaurant itself, just the staff. Mainly the young guys that work there. Call me crazy but when someone is working in a public restaurant setting and they are wearing a hat that says "F U C K" on it, that doesn't exactly say class or professionalism. It says this employee should be fired. Seriously have some shred of decency and present yourself like an adult. Wearing shirts and hats that say F.U.C.K. and other choice words is for punks with no sense, it's pathetic okay. I won't be back because frankly that low quality of character is not worth supporting.
