rIeXMt92PLNjZbemWKRXcA Just walked out of this place. My husband and I walked in at 1:30om no one greeted us we stood there for about 7mins there was two people standing by the register a larger built lady playing in her phone watching some sort of videos. We continued to look around every single table was dirty. There was not one cleaned table in here. It also smelled like sewer so my husband and I looked at each other and said Let's get outta here! If they can't even bus tables how would I trust what's going on in that kitchen?! We are on our way to Noodle Man!
