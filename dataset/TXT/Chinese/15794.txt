Not sure, if they all just meet there every night or what... I liked the duck they had. It had a good flavor and was good priced. The Lo Mein was extremely disappointing. The chicken and the beef was terrible. Maybe it was from a rubber chicken/cow. I would not recommend this place, except for the duck.
