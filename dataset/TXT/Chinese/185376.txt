XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA Always a lineup for their noodles as the place is pretty small. Not mad that the menu is also small because everything on it is amazing. They only have two types of noodle dishes- the dry one and the soup one, but you can choose the noodle thickness. My favourite are the flat noodles as I find them to have the perfect noodle texture. The noodle broth is amazing, but I always ask for less chili oil because regular spicy is too spicy for me. Also try the jellyfish in sesame oil side dish, I get it everytime!
