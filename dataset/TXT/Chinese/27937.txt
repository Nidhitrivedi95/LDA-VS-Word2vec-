8FUzCm4Q13MJMX7N6ftmQw The food is so good. It was here in under twenty minutes, the crab raging were to die for, and it's so worth the price. The wonton soup was the worst part but it was still good, it just didn't have enough non-liquid things in it. Like the Flickr was okay but it had like three wontons and the smallest amount of chives. Like I said though still pretty good. The wontons I will dream about tonight! Not too oily and just crunch enough. Yum. I got the orange chicken and fried rice which posted wonderfully. I was too full after a couple bites but it could feed me for days! It  was so much for the price and so tasty. I also ordered a two liter Diet Coke and it came all frosty and delicious. 10/10 would order again!
