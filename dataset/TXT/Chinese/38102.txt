aTbz9GdpAf2M5MeAHVNhWw This place has really authentic asian cuisine now.  It used to be a yunan restaurant which I disliked.   The place also used to have a funky smell, it's still kind of there but the great food makes up for it.  I only tried the sechuan beef noodles today, but i'll be back to try some of the dinner cuisines.  It's spicy and the flavor is great.

I read some reviews on dirtyness and stuff like that.  I don't know, didn't experience that yet, honest it doesn't look like the cleanest of all joints, but theres a running asian joke.  That's part of the authenticity!    The dirtier it is the tastier food.  No, seriously.  =)
