It's okay.  It's your typical Americanized Chinese fare, with some good dishes and some not so good. The lo mein noodles are fairly standard and tasted decent enough.  The happy family combination was also cooked well.  On the other hand, the orange chicken was overbreaded and the pieces of chicken were way too large, so it did not soak in the orange flavor properly.  The egg rolls were supposed to have pork and shrimp in them but there was so little meat that they tasted like vegetarian egg rolls.

So yes, sort of hit and miss, but I don't expect much from Americanized Chinese food, so I'll probably order from here again.  As long as they don't shoo me away again.
