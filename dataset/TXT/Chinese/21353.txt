68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw I was in Toronto recently and my bro-in-law decides to take me out for a bite to eat.  We decided to go to Asian Legend.  Rumor has it that this place was as close to Ding Tai Fung as you can get in Toronto (especially for their xiao long bao). 

We had some spicy chilli oil cold cuts ( typical beef stomach, five spice roast beef, and tendon).  This was delicious!  Some of the tendon tasted a little salty but honestly with a cold beer and the amazing chili oil it was a great mix. 

The Shiu Mai and the Xiao Long Bao were great.  Let's face it - it is not Ding Tai Fung but the broth was clear and flavorful and the pork was juicy and had rich taste.  You know when you have bad soup dumplings - it's like a one-way trip to vomitville!  

The other dishes were just as flavorful.  I enjoyed the Noodles as well as the scallion pancake but I could honestly have skipped that to be honest...

Service was good and food was tasty.  I would definitely recommend to anyone traveling Toronto's Chinatown.
