qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA I hadn't been here in such a long time. The last time I was at a PF Changs was in Honolulu. They have really good happy hour. In Hawaii my favorite drink here is the Aloha Kiss but they didn't have it at this location so I tried the Asian pear mojito. Very refreshing...I like mojitos and I like Asian pears so it's the perfect combo. I tried many different appetizers but my favorite are the fried green beans and fire dumplings.
