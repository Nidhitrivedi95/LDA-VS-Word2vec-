QOmojzu24dTI2coPjOtu2Q Unfortunately there is only two good things I can say about this place. Great crab puffs, and an expanded delivery area.  I ordered mongolian beef, which was pretty much like shoe leather. Thin, tough, and no flavor. More onions than beef. I also ordered shrimp lo mein. Noodles were mushy, shrimp not stirred fried. More like precooked shrimp, thawed and added after the fact. Also, a little pricey considering quality. This is my first and last time ordering from this place.
