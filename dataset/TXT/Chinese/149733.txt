The portions are very large for one person but some items are complete with starch, protein and vegetables. Entrees included Thai and Japanese types in addition to American-Chinese  and Korean dishes.

I had the chicken with veggies with chow mein; the rest of the group also ordered individually, not knowing that the items should be shared. So some food had to be taken home.  My food was not drenched in the usual oyster or other American-Chinese popular sauces but tasted, maybe a bit too much, of the cooking oil it was sautéd in.
