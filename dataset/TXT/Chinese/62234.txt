DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA AWFUL, HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING....... just a few adjectives to describe this train wreck of a restaurant. Quite possibly the WORST service ever experienced. If I could give this place 0 stars I would gladly do so. Sam woo used to be good, but their pathetic excuse for service has carried over and left a bad taste in my mouth. Way overpriced, will NEVER return, you couldn't pay me to!
