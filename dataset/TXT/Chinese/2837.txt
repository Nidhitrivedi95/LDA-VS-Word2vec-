_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA This is hands down the best meal we had on the Strip. We ordered Egg Flower soup which was great! The coconut juice was a whole coconut with a spoon to scrape off the cream inside; it was delicious! Ordered the Ta Lu Noodle soup and it was a huge bowl of awesome tasting food. But the best part of the whole experience was that the waiter was extremely knowledgeable and knew what to suggest. He helped my friends choose vegetarian dishes and they loved the food too.

Given that its inside Venetian, the food was very reasonably priced. The final check came down to 75 bucks including tip for 3 people. Loved every part of it.
