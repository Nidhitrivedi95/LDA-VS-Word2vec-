hMgIF04rrJ7oB1lGIpFt5w Not the best Chinese food in the area (golden harbor) but not the worst. The main problem I had was that most dishes were overly greasy, especially the shrimp and noodles. Noodles had a slightly offputting taste, like reused oil or lard. The eggplant with garlic sauce was delicious but not spicy like the menu said. The best thing we had was definitely the Szechuan fish and tofu. The tofu was so fresh and the fish was perfectly cooked. The sauce had that nice slow burn you get from a good Szechuan dish. I would maybe stick to the Szechuan as this place is supposedly known for spicy food. Not opposed to coming back but I would ask to watch the grease and highly recommend the Szechuan fish.
