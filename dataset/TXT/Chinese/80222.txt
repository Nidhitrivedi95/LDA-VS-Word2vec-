gopA-Q9KWwC8BLIRDhusgg I just have to clear a few things up about this restaurant. I do have to vouch for them a bit because I worked there for some time many many years ago.

The food is, like most places, Westernized Chinese/Indian food. It's hard to find a place that serves super traditional Chinese food at all these days. Hakka is a Chinese-Indian style of cooking. The owners ARE Chinese and do speak Chinese but they were born in Calcutta, therefore they speak Urdu, Hindi, Mandarin and Hakka to say the least. 

Their menu is very diverse with a generous selection of veggie dishes as well to suit their clientele. Most of their customers I find do hear about this place through word of mouth. 

Their service may not be top notch and from time to time the wait gets a bit lengthy but I don't hear as many complaints about the food quality than the wait for the food. I've always found that their portions are generous, prices are reasonable.  

But I will have to say this: I still crave their chili chicken and Manchurian soup!
