jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw Came here for dim sum with some friends. Located in china town, you would expect some very authentic dish. Overall, the dim sum was a average. We had the Chinese broccoli which was like any other place. The chicken feet was a little bit in the bland side. We got some stir fried noodle which tasted like the noodles you would find at a buffet. I'm not going to go into the other dishes I got since there's not too much to really say about those... They were pretty much average.
