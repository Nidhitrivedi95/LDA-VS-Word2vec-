PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Was looking for dim sum and found this new restaurant on Yelp. It's across from the International Marketplace. The food was fresh and at a great price. Before 2 pm, they have the traditional carts going around, and they have a food bar so you can order additional items. The owner greeted us and was very attentive to ensuring that we enjoyed our meal. Overall, it was an enjoyable lunch and I'll probably come back again next time I'm craving dim sum.
