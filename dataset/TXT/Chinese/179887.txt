X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg This place reminds me a lot of marquee because of the stairs. Our group didn't have trouble getting in because we had presale tickets, but the line at the door was pretty long, and I heard they were charged $200 for guys o_O

Upon getting in, they have stone walls/stairs kind of like a castle dungeon...

The first floor (Or i guess the second) is hip pop. I didn't go in, so I can't say much about it.

The next floor is the main stage and dance floor where the big name DJ's play. The dance floor definitely looks a lot bigger than at Marquee, but it's just as crowded. You're literally shoulder to shoulder (or less) and pushing your way through the walk ways, the dance floors, everything. The only up side is that they have decent AC, so I wasn't super sweaty the whole time. Oh, I also didn't bother wearing heels. I know, blasphemy!

The top floor is all tables. Don't bother coming up here unless you have a table. There is no space for you to really look down on the dance floor unless you're at a table. You can only look from afar. Might as well do that from downstairs.

Overall, I enjoyed my time here (I didn't even have any drinks! which I heard were $20 a pop...) mainly because Calvin Harris put on a good show. I'd come back again for the DJ's, not really because of the venue, which is not bad, but nothing innovative or special.
