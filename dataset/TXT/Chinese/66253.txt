eh9e2wfsXNRa4BgVSXUu7g Hai Tang Cafe is by far one of my favourite HK style cafes in the Markham area, the food is great and the price is cheap so you cant ask for much more. I have been going here for almost 10 years and after you go there you will see why. It is a small cafe that serves food (for takeout and eat-in) and the usual Chinese baked goods.

Food - 4/5: the Singapore Rice Noodle and Curry Chicken Rice are my favourites there. I would even say that they make the best Singapore Rice Noodle dish in town and the GTA. What I like about Hai Tang Cafe's food is you get what you order, no bullshit. All other cafes and restaurants like putting in a bunch of onions, peppers, and random crap into their dishes that really takes away from its true flavour, but Hai Tang doesnt do this. Their Singapore Rice Noodle is simply vermicelli, curry flavouring, bean sprouts, BBQ pork and shrimp, and its delicious. Also, their lemon iced tea and iced coffee are amazing!

Price - 4.5/5: whether you eat in or take out there is no tip, which is a huge plus. A dish + a cold drink is about $7 total which is a really good price if you're looking for a cheap, tasty and filling lunch. 

Service - 3.5: its a Chinese cafe that is focused on getting customers in and out as quick as possible, as there are often lineups to get a seat during the weekends and other popular hours. Of course they could be better, but I don't blame them and this is what you would get in any other HK cafe. 

Overall definitely worth paying a visit if you're a fan of authentic HK style Chinese food and/or on a budget.
