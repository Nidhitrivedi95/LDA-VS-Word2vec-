a5--WEPUdH7smreNuqj4aQ We have gone to Hunan VIII for a while now on the regular (every Wednesday), so we decided one week to try the place across the street. I wish I could get that meal back. It was too packed, too dirty, and too greasy. There was food all over the ground. We even had to wipe down the seats, table, and high chair. The tables were too mashed up close to each other, that it even felt like a clown car. 

Besides all of the ridiculousness mentioned above, as we walked in and out we were annoyed by a couple guys selling rosaries and candles outside of the restaurant.
