Km0sT7E_dc2U1BkyRoy1xA This was horrible.  They advertised they had white tuna. I inquired about this as an avid fisherman and asked if this was albacore. They said not it was red big eye tuna. I asked them to check with the sushi chef which said this was escolar white tuna.  Lies !!!   Escolar is a misnomer for snake mackerel which can make you extremely sick.  I will never be back here.  I brought up my concerns to the waitress/bartender.  Horrible place.  Don't go
