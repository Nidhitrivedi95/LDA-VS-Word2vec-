XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA Went here reluctantly because my mom likes this place. I'm always wary of hunters because the volume of food reduces my appetite. There is a good variety of seafood, meats, carbs, vegetables, and dessert. Edible, but not great quality. 

3 stars because it's expected of a buffet and because the green tea ice cream and egg tarts are good.
