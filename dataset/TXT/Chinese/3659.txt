Staying at the Palazzo, this place was our best bet. Being with my cousins whom are all Chinese, we know what's realllllll Asian food. This place is really good! Authentic food, Cantonese speaking waitress, and tacky Asian decorations.

I would give it 5 stars but the prices were a little high for the food we were getting. Initially we were craving pho but my Asian side just wasn't willing to drop $18 bucks for a bowl of pho when I could be getting it for less than half the price at home.

All in all, I would come to this place again, noodles after a good night ftw.
