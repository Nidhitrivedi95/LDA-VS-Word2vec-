W8xPHUqL088jdcmNZyH-eA I really had my hopes up about this place. I saw the pictures on Yelp and they looked so good! The potstickers were decent but it's pretty hard to mess up pot stickers. We tried the beef soup and it had a strange after taste and beef had no flavor. I struggled to eat more than 4 bites, it wasn't pleasant. I won't be revisiting this place. thoroughly disappointing.
