vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA What a meal! Absolutely fantastic Chinese food. Might as well be kicking back in Beijing. The place is generally full of Chinese folks, which is a good sign. Our hostess actually didn't even speak English. The food is top priority here. I went pretty simple, with Hot and Sour Soup and Mongolian Beef. All of it was perfection. 

I can't wait to come back and try other dishes.
