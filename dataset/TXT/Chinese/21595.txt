6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q I agree with the other reviews that Red 8 is very expensive for what it is.  I'm picky when it comes to Chinese food, and Red 8 does not cut it.  I've been there twice.  The first time I had a very bland braised beef noodle soup.  The second time I tried the lunch special for $18.88 (so azn).  The special came with kung pao chicken, a potsticker, and a spring roll.  The kung pao chicken tasted like lean cuisine-- painfully bland.  The spring roll looked like something I might throw in the microwave at home.  Finally, the potsticker was good-- but my meal only came with one, so big whoop.  I've also sampled the dim sum, which is good, but pricey as hell-- even for Vegas.  I think we've learned our lesson and won't be back.
