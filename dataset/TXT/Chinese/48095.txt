c3jw3I5uL4ewjxkTx4YOcg Dim Sum Dishes really nailed the Asian tapas concept. It is very tasty and all food is of outstanding quality, as is the wine, and the service.

As vegans, we didn't know what to expect when we arrived there, knowing that their website lists vegetarian dishes. Some of them were identified as vegan by us. We mentioned that we're vegans when we entered the restaurant, and they even have a special menu where everything was described in detail. Perfect.

We ordered six different dishes, which was enough for two people. The pricing isn't cheap, but inexpensive for such a fine-dining experience. The siblings who run the restaurant were very kind and had time for a chat (as we were the last guests of that evening). I can only recommend this restaurant.
