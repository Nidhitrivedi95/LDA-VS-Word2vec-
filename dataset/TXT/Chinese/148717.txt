SlQNMsVEOSxN-ciIn93LOw Ok you cant go wrong with house of leng guys, from Crispy scallion chicken to tofu in garlic sauce this place is the most consistent i have ever seen a restaurant be. I have been coming here for years lunch/dinner and they are clean, quick and great food. They have two locations they are both great!
