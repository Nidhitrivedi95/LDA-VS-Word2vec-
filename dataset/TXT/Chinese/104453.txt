KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ After getting booted out of our reservations from Diego, we went to Pearl for cuisine with an essence of the Canton and Shanghai provinces.

It was a bit more formal than I thought but we were dressed for it.

We ordered two different tasting menus and sake. Everyone got to try everything and some left drunk ( i went for the red wine b/c i dont love unfiltered sake or any sake without the bomb!) The food was great and everyone left full and satisfied.

They even brought out a tiny desert with a candle for Mister's birthday!
