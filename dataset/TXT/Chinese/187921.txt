This time we thought to bring our friend who has never been here before and who'd just arrived from Hawaii. Once we received our food our friend went to the bathroom, a server came to us letting us know our friend had fallen. So we got up to check on him, while our friend was walking back to the table he collapsed into my husbands arms. I went to pay the bill and the cashier, told me "oh I thought he was high" with a smile on his face. And I asked him "why do you say that for?" And he giggled "oh cause I thought he was high." Mind you my husband was right in back of me and I didn't want him to hear because I know he get really upset. But to late cus he heard and so my husband asked the boy "why would you say that for?" The boy replied " oh I just thought he was drunk " and which went on for a couple more times. I was so upset because that is not what happened and for the boy to judge my friend because he has dread locks?!? That's wrong in so many ways. Little did you know he was dehydrated.! Never coming here again, and to that boy. Grow up.
