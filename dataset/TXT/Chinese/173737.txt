However, if you like late night, wonderfully terrible Chinese food this is your place! I loved the food! I like all kinds of Chinese food and mean no disrespect to this establishment at all. The customer service was fantastic! I called in to order and only waited a few minutes once I arrived to pick it up. I had the pot stickers, pan fried, the orange chicken, and BBQ pork lo mien. Everything was very good, fresh and flavorful. You could see, what looked to be a family in the back cooking the food. The place was clean and a single tv on the wall playing college football. The portions were great. I'm having leftovers this morning as Chinese is my favorite breakfast! Pay no attention to the other reviews about portion or greasy food, as I found neither to be true.
