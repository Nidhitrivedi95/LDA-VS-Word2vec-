aAiDjaeWjiD8XxRBGMLKyw Good food, terrible terrible customer service on the phone. You basically have to do their job for them. The delivery person delivered the food to the wrong hotel because they failed to ask which one. There was no thank you or goodbye when hanging up, and the lady needs a little training on phone etiquette.  Again, food is good for what it is but the service makes it a bad experience, at least for delivery.
