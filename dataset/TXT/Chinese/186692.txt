yBxzqKXHhvNVaFnEOd4f7Q I've been here a few times because it's close to my job.  The lady that works in the front is really nice but the food is just alright.  I've never had a major complaint but today my food was not good.  I ordered shrimp fried rice for lunch and it's different, maybe a new cook or they change the oil.  It smells really good but has no taste whatsover.  Even after adding soy sauce and pepper it's unedible.  I'm so surprised because I love fried rice and who can mess that up.  Now I have to find something else to eat for lunch.
