s5fGo1Nieiy6M-fhk_Ywnw Yummy! The new owners have made the food here scrumptious. We tried the soup (plain- to begin with), mix plate (with garlic chicken- had to try) and orange chicken, and a mini BBQ ribs. All were very good. Tasted fresh. We will definitely be going back. Grub Hub delivers from here if you need delivery for now. I'll take pics next time. Oops. Lol
