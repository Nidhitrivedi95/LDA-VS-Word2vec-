Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg My boyfriend and I just don't get why people love this place so much for dinner.  BBQ pork and duck are excellent, but the rest of everything are basically average.  Congee Queen can be great for lunches, because it is a congee-and-stir-fried-noodle restaurant.  However, its dinner menu is limited.  It has no fish dish for dinner at all, not even vegetable stir fried with fish filet.  

Seating is good, and service is efficient.
Food is okay but not that different from another restaurant.  I won't recommend waiting for half an hour to get a dinner table here.
