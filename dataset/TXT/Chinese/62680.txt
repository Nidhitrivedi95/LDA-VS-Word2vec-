YES! My family is from Yunnan, and while I would say this is not necessarily authentic Yunnan cuisine (I would say that it's difficult to find authentic Yunnan food in China aside from the actual province itself), it is the best spicy food restaurant in Las Vegas (and most likely in the state of Nevada). If you're in Las Vegas and are looking for some authentic Chinese cuisine, definitely come here! 

The reason why I do not give it a full 5 stars is because of the service. Just remember that while it might seem like the servers are rude, they aren't. It's just the way it is. This restaurant gets crowded really easily so you should try to avoid the popular hours of lunch and dinner. Either arrive a little earlier or a lot later. They have a new system in place where you grab a number and wait outside.

To the left of the entrance is a bar with some cold dishes. Definitely grab some for the table to snack on while you wait for your order to be taken and for the food to come out. All the dishes were flavorful (though some were a bit oily... so if you're watching your grease intake, be wary :P) - 

-Definitely try Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup (guo qiao mi xian) - a well known Yunnan dish (the dish here is lacking in the soup, but there aren't many places in the US that get this dish right) 
-Some other great dishes to try out - Boiled Fish with Sichuan Special Sauce; Szechuan style spicy lamb chop; Pork with chinese celery and green pepper; Stir-fried pork intestines with pickled pepper; Lamb with cumin
