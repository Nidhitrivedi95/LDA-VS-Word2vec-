rROHsa0BQsKjxNnfYjBF9g I've never actually eaten AT Canton Chilli. But I have had their food delivered many times; they're CHEAP, and deliver as late as 4AM (!!) to the University of Toronto. Usually, my classmates and I end up ordering Canton Chilli when pulling very late nights (which is rather often, much to my chagrin).

I am sensitive to MSG, and Canton Chilli uses it like crazy (which makes the food delicious, but gives me the world's worst headache). As a result, my standby is the chicken congee. It's not as salty as the typical Canton Chilli dish; instead, the congee is nicely gingery, comes with large pieces of tender chicken thigh meat, and is served in a HUGE portion -- enough for two meals, and it's only $3.50! Scooore. 

Service ain't the best and delivery isn't the fastest, but where else can you get food delivered at 3am? Sure beats eating out of the vending machine at school.
