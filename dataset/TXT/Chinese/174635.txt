WF0I9AwErfaqkPPXM98ywQ Been going to the bayview and hwy 7 location for years. A local favourite of mine for their milk tea and steam rice specials! 

A new favourite of mine are their croissants!! They are worth it and a buttery goodness!!

This location also is very modern, gorgeous and a lot closer to my place!!!
