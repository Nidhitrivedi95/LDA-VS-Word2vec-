ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ Dragon Legend is definitely the best AYCE restaurant I've been to. I usually go to sushi buffets, so this was a nice fusion of different Asian foods. 

We had a party of 10, and they sat us at a huge oval table with two lazy susans, which I think was a bit unnecessary. However, service was great throughout the night. I was thrilled to find fresh salmon sashimi and peking duck, two of my favourite foods. I would also recommend their torched rolls and crab legs. The cappuccino ice cream was also fantastic.

The décor (both inside and out) of this place is impressive. There are many grandiose elements that really elevate the environment. Though pricier than other AYCE meals, I definitely think a visit here is worthwhile.
