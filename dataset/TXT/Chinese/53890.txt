cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Horrible experience! My mom and I were eating sushi here, she felt really sick at the resturant and now as i am typing this we are at north york general hospital! The doctor said this is becase of the toxin that is made in these fishes if it is not safely prepared!! I am planning to report these guys to health official!
