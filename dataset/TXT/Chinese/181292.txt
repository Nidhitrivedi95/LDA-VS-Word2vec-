xdfGzrJ1mx3mBx6m14Ebhw Goldstone has been a personal favourite of mine for 10 years since I moved to Toronto. This is standard Cantonese done with authenticity, while being well-priced. Their BBQ duck and pork are great, as are their beef rice noodles, and congee, and won-ton soup noodles. Don't expect to be treated like a king, but do expect no-nonsense service, which is fine by me.

People who rave about King Noodle really don't know what they are talking about - this is the real deal! As with most restaurants in China town - I wish they'd make their facilities cleaner, but if you've been to Hong Kong, this really is a piece of the Orient in down-town Toronto. I will inevitably return!
