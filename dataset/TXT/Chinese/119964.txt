nztjmkY4LZp18kviHIO7ow The food actually quite nice. But the service was not really nice. It was the first time for me in there and once I took the second plate, they took my glass (they though I am finish) and forgot to put it back. When I asked, "excuse me, where is my glass?" The waiter said, "Oh, I will get a new one!" without say sorry. It was a small problem, but quite unconfortable for me to go back there.
