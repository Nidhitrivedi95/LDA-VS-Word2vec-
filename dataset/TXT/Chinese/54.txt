--SrzpvFLwP_YFwB_Cetow Out of all the Keung Kee locations, my family prefers the one in Midland...and for good reason. We were pleasantly surprised yesterday at this restaurant since it has undergone a renovations, which means it is roomier, spacious, and chairs that are comfortable to sit in. We were a gang of 9 and we ordered quite a lot of dishes, and it all came out to $100 or so, so this place is definitely worth the money.

Food. Typical Chinese (although I am not sure what region...sorry!) but very delicious, perfect if you are really hungry. Some of the tastier dishes are the Fried Egg with Bitter Melon, Clams in Curry Sauce, Fresh Fish (to the end of the room there is a fish tank where Nemo could end up on your plate), and Fried Milk (omg). Don't worry - the menu's come with the signature pictures with English captions...and the pictures highlighted are often the most popular dishes so rest assured, you could just point to all the pictures on the menu and you will have a ball.

Ambiance. Clean. Efficient. Can be busy at times.

FYI. Great for large groups as it is relatively inexpensive for the quantity of dishes you can order, and it's all sooo good!
