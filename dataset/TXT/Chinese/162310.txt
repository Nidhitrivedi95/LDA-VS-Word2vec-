uLzgiSqVg5Pr93VVXSdOlg Expectations? Fresh, quick and tasty. Non-expectations? Variety, room to stretch, exchanging patter with the staff. Oh, and at a very very reasonable price.  This Chinese beef noodle shop is everything one can reasonably want. The noodles are stretched and slapped and twirled and twisted in the front window. Based on the orders, the noodle-maker prepares different sizes, plops a portion into a vat of boiling water. A few minutes later, another person scoops up the noodles, drains them and puts them in a bowl, to which a ladle or two of simmering  clear beed broth is added. At the next station is the daikon, cilantro, chili oil (if so requested), beef slices, tea egg (if requested). There are three sizes and the medium is enough for a football player. There are a few other items like spicy cucumber and edamame. We had two small beef noodle soups, with moxi and Jo Yen style noodles. There are few seats, maybe ten tables and another ten at the counters, so we had to wait ten minutes for a table. Service was fast, price was great! If you are looking for cantonese or Szechuan or Thai or a Chinese banquet, there are a dozen other places within blocks. This place is for beef noodles.
