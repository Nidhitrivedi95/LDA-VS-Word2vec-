QnD4hpjwW8QySEh2R_UHpQ I was home sick from work in the middle of the week and had no inclination to turn the ingredients in my refrigerator into a meal and no desire to interact with people or fight through the lunch rush. Thankfully I recalled somewhere in my fuzzy brain a previous order from Royal Panda and went straight to the Google. Royal Panda has teamed up with Beyond Menu so I was able to make my selections and submit payment without even talking to anyone. 

I was surprised to find chicken noodle soup on the menu - score! I also ordered the Szechuan Chicken lunch special. One of the great things about Royal Panda is the ability to have 3 crab rangoons with your combo instead of the standard egg roll. Also the lunch combo and dinner combo are the same price which I remembered as being a benefit last time I ordered.

The food arrived in about 20 minutes which was one of the quickest delivery times I have ever experienced! The chicken soup was interesting, like a soupy lo mien instead of the traditional American chicken soup, but I was a fan. The lunch combo was more than enough food and had plenty of spice to help clear my head. 

The food was pretty standard but the option for crab rangoons and more importantly the speedy delivery time bump this location up to my new go to Chinese delivery.
