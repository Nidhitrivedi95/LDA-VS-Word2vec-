kKCJvvktaKxZ5iFKv3lxuA Pei Wei is slipping a little in my opinion. I used to love this place when they first opened (7 or 8 years ago) and I'd go all the time. However, I feel like the food hasn't been as good the last few years. At least, the chicken lo mien isn't very good. It's borderline flavorless. Every time I order it I end up regretting it. I wish they'd revamp this dish. Flavor please! 

However, the chicken lettuce wraps are still good. 

They're still popular and super busy during peek times. So call in and pick up.
