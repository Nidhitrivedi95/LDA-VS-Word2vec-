QWYKZ9mp9ggGQqGEw0LLqA Lots of hype coming into this place as serving legit Hainan chicken rice but sadly it was just okay in my books. I definitely had better. These days I expect the chicken to be deboned and expect a strong chicken flavor and I got neither of those eating here. The rice though I'll give them credit was pretty good and well flavored. I looked at the portion for a personal Hainan chicken rice and it was too small so I opted to order half a chicken instead. Honestly there wasn't that much meat and lots of bones. I'm very selective with my Hainan chicken rice and this definitely doesn't go down as a place I would eat for it. I've eaten so many Hainan chicken rice that this place doesn't go in my book of places I would recommend to eat Hainan chicken rice. Maybe their other dishes are better but I wouldn't come here for their Hainan chicken rice.
