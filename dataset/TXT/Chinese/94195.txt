JCmyrBoNl2qfZ-f8I5RA3A Pros:
The food tasted very good. (Bibim bap & duk buki) 
The atmosphere was nice. Had private tables and nice decorations. A unique date idea if you are hungry up until 2am

Cons:
Slow service
Never refilled side dishes or water. Waved for attentions. 
Not the friendliest servers 
Only came up to us 3 times: give us menus,  give us water/take order,  give us food and check. 
Walk passed us but didn't come to us when cup was empty and at end of the table
