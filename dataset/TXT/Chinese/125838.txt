OYfXGMEwcMKj_gty5e_Udg Ordered double chickens in black pepper sauce and chicken in cream and tomatoe sauce. Both are good and reasonable price. However, the chicken in mixed sauce is tends to be bigger portion and slightly cheaper, lol. But I guess if you want different sauce then you just need to pay 74 cents more! ;)
