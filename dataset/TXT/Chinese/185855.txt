y3A7FES84gb85UxTTTQ_Xw Their fried dumpling on quite a bit more on the greasier side, and all their dumplings has a slight but noticeable chemical flavoring taste to it to the point is they are slightly bitter (pork with coriander, pork with cabbage, spinach and chicken). They also don't taste very fresh. 

However their spinach dumpling looks very pretty, the service is decent.
