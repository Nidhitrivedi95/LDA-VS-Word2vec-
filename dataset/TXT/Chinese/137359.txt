qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA Wow, HEART SUSHI is the best sushi place I've eaten in a long time.  The food  was fabulous, service fantastic & fast,  all the staff very friendly and helpful.  The whole iPad menu ordering such an innovative concept and $15 for all you can eat lunch, you just can't go wrong.  If you like sushi, this place is a must try.
