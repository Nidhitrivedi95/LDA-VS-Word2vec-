6OhahrmtLGmkUdPfaMck0A For the price they are charging, the dim sum here is a rip off. Only thing good from here is the Xiu Long Bao. But portion is still so small. I come here time to time because is close to my home. But for every visit the portion of meat shrinks. Especially the different types of Baos. All I can tasted is the dough, no juice from the meat or meat at all. I don't see a bright future for this restaurant. Hopefully the owner read this and change their way of operating a business.
