K4-J1A_ZIzG2yNkee0KOaA Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch for 9 people. Got a table fairly quickly. They have a lazy susan in the middle which makes it super convenient. The food here was mediocre, nothing too special. Service was not very good, took a while to get any service (like tea refills, cold water). The servers that we got only spoke Mandarin so it was very hard for us to place our order, but we did manage. 
This time we tried some eel fried rice which was new to me.
