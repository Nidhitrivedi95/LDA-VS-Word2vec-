355zerURpj4IMs2no238_A We've been coming here often and get bad service every time. I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, until my kids made unsolicited comment that  staff here don't like their job. 

They have Polynesian bowl on the menu, which is supposed to have guacamole. Our order didn't come with guacamole. When we brought it to their attention, we were given 2 different responses- the Poke bowl don't come with guacamole, and they ran out of guacamole. No apologies or anything, cashier was even arrogant. 

They didn't even make the effort to buy avocado from local store? One-fourth of their menu have avocado? What about the avocado salad?
