BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA Four of us recently went to this restaurant for lunch. It was incredibly busy which I thought was a good sign....We waited quite a while just to get the menus and waited even longer before our lunch arrived. I found the prices to be incredibly overpriced without the food to back up. I think charging $8.99 for a box Choi dish with garlic is incredibly overpriced. I also found the dumplings ranging between nine and $10 for dumplings way too expensive. There are so many other good restaurants in the area to choose from, I would never return to this one again. When the soup arrived at was only lukewarm and not particularly tasty. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is too busy, too overpriced and the food is mediocre.
