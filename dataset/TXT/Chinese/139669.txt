QxnwaNgY6_e88SBfmT6k1w I ordered the chicken fried rice and the general tao chicken, the waitress didn't speak english, they didn't accept visa or debit card. They brought me cold green tea while I waited for the food. The chicken fried rice was ok at best, and they give you alot for $6.50, but I've had much better. The general tao was nothing more than boneless chicken wings, I brought it home, I couldn't eat it, it was absolutely disgusting. When the waitress brought over the bill, it was $17.52, they look at they money like hawks, like they're suspicious of you, unbelievable. I used to come here all the time 15 years ago, now, it feels like your entering foreign territory and they don't want to have anything to do with you.
