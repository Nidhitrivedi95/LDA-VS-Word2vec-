bLh4ysq5RsbzCNSjqHhwyw I have been here a few times now, and it's been pretty good!

We always order the appetizer platter - shrimp toast is to die for according to my sister! I also ordered the hot and sour soup tonight, which was delicious! The bits of tofu and bamboo shoots are my favorite. 

I wasn't overly hungry this visit and more so just tagged along for company. I did pick off others plates however :), and the sesame chicken is tasty. It was ordered hot on the spice level, and hot it was! Everything was nice and fresh, and portions are filling with a little left over to take home. 

The service is always beyond exceptional! Staff is super friendly, funny, and accommodating. Our waitress tonight was super cute and funny. It took a little bit to get water and soda refills, but since the food was so good we weren't too concerned. 

Will keep returning :) sweet staff and  delicious food!
