v-supbjeNBKNwomn3sLc8g Tldr: good quality dim sum at competitive prices, service is ok, would recommend 

Come here often with my family for the weekly Saturday dim sum adventures. This place is great for quality dim sum at a decent price. I love how this place let's you mark what you want on a menu sheet, so you don't have to wait 10 years for your favorite dim sum dish to roll by in a cart. They have all the dim sum staples, and while it doesn't seem like they have one dish in particular that's better than other places, each dish is quite tasty and delicious. 

Service is alright, and this place gets real busy so come earlier in the day if you don't want to wait that long. Their dim sum hours are 8:30am - 4pm. After 4, they serve restaurant quality Chinese food. Haven't eaten here for dinner as I've only came here for the dim sum. 

The prices for dim sum are pretty good. Each dish is divided into "sizes". Prices are as followed: Mon-Fri: $2.38 (S, M, L). $2.68 (special dim sum dishes). $2.98 (XXL). For weekends and holidays, it's +20cents (for S/M/L/special) and +30 cents (for XXL) on top of the mon-fri price for each dish. 

Overall, it's a solid place for that dim sum fix. My family keeps coming back for good reason. Would definitely recommend!
