2KOXNZVoxpcwen_JmIQdfA decided to stop by when i was done for work this week - 5 star ratings across the board.....hmmm....had to check that out.

well, service was quick, and our food arrived very quick - we ordered pad thai, and a yellow curry chicken....meh - it was ok but not as favorful as i would have liked.

a typically big box mall style restaurant.
