VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q I came here for dinner after hearing so much about this place. It's the only time I've ever been to Times Square in Richmond Hill. The noodle soups were tasty and inexpensive, so I will likely be back!

I ordered the malay laksa soup base with thick rice noodles, fish balls, and seasoned pork mushroom balls. Yum! I love spicy laksa and it goes really well with the rice noodles. Both the fish balls and the pork mushroom balls were delightful. You're given a small glass of tea upon seating, but you can order an included drink with your noodle soup. I decided to get a hot milk tea. Boy was it bitter! I added 2 sugars to it and it was still too bitter.

I'm looking forward to coming back to try some of the other noodle soup combinations.
