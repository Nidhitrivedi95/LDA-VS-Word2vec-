cGQKUOAZm_VHcQOJWbatog We were seated promptly at 11 AM on a Sunday for lunch. I give my appetizer of crab wontons 3 stars, my husband's appetizer of Ahi Tartare with Avocado 4 stars, my entree of Mongolian beef 4 stars, and my husband's entree of Lobster Rice 1.5 stars (way too salty! should have sent it back to the kitchen! hardly ate it!). The manager came over to greet us. The waitress was nice and gave us drink refills.
