tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg After eating for the first time at din tai fung in Los Angeles last week, I was pleasantly surprised that the xiao long bao was better here. The service was friendly and attentive. It's worth noting that our server said there is a new chef coming to improve the menu in a month or so. I will definitely be back soon. 

I had the Chong Qing spicy beef noodle soup and 2 orders of the xiao long bao (steamed dumplings on menu). My mom is visiting and had the pan fried flat flat noodles which was good too, but she loved the dumplings. She can't eat spicy food and was satisfied with her dish.

Relatively cheap prices too!
