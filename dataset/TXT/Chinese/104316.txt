Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg This time of year it's pretty crazy and everyone is running around like crazy.  We sat and ordered some lettuce wraps and salty calamari and then got our name called to go eat upstairs.  The lettuce wraps were very tasty as usual, but the calamari was a bit chewy and tough.  We ordered three dinner entrees which included the pad Thai chicken, honey walnut shrimp with melon balls and the Chilean sea bass with mushrooms and veggies.  The Chilean sea bass was amazing, as was the walnut shrimp.  The pad Thai noodles were tasty, but the chicken was a bit tough and chewy.  

This location is always super busy but we had a great waiter, Ricky, and he took excellent care of us.  The service was great, the food was pretty tasty.  It's always crazy on the strip, but if you want PF Chang's, then this will have to do.
