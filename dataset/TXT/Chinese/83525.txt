hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA took my parents to eat here cus my dad loves this place. the soy marinated fish was great today. the dude that usually serves us is always on top of it. 

they claim they dont use MSG. its written on their business card. 

i had two regular bowls of wonton soup. the first was so savory. i didnt think anything of it. the 2nd was so savory i kept wanting more. uh oh... sure enough an hour or so later i was getting super sleepy and started to get a bad headache. two typical symptoms of ingesting too much MSG. right now i have a very annoying headache thats at the back of my head.

most places that serve wonton soup is going to have a ton of msg in it. i used to eat this broth the street vendors in korea would sell. they would boil the fish cakes in the broth. i asked the lady what made it so savory. she said MSG. the wonton tastes the same. 

i cant help but bitch about false advertising. a lot of people dont realize how many products use MSG. soy sauce, sausages, ranch dressing, etc... 

i still like this place cus their sauteed spinach and baked fish in soy sauce is so good. wait, is that the MSG talking?
