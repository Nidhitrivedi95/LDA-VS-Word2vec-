mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w Dim sum at a great location!  I like their a la carte menu too.  I've tried other dim sum places, and I think this is the best one in the valley.  They have a great variety.  I like their chinese broccoli, shrimp and pork dumplings, and noodle in soup with dumplings. 

 It's hard to find an authentic chinese restaurant that offers good simple noodle soup (with egg noodles), but this place has it.  I'm a fan of their wonton noodle soup.  Their wontons are like Sui Kai, which has shrimp and ground pork inside.


Their hong kong crispy chow mein is reasonably portioned (probably good for 3-4 people) are a reasonable price.  The quality and portions of their food are good.

Their duck is crisp and not fatty!  Roast duck at other chinese restaurants are often soggy and very fatty, but the skin of the duck at East Ocean is light and crisp.  Also, the meat is very tender.  

They offer ginger scallion crab as well.  I like the flavor, but it was difficult to eat.

Also what's new at this place is hot pot.  We got the seafood hot pot, and it is plenty for 3 people.
