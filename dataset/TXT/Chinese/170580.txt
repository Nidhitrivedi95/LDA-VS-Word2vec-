vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA Service is terrible. Food was good. Came here at the old location in the casino before and enjoyed it. Tried it today but the service was very poor. First, at the hostess desk, no one even looked up for about 45 seconds then just pointed and said wait. About 2 minutes later someone comes around the corner and says something like " let go" so I followed. She took me to a table. No menu. I waited for over 5 minutes before I even saw an attendant. She brought a menu and asked for my drink order. Didn't come back for more than 10 minutes and only wanted to deliver my water. I told her I was ready to order. She seemed annoyed but took my order. Kung Pao chicken and Night Fried Rice. A few minutes later another woman came to deliver good, that i did not order. I dont know if she didnt speak english, but, i told her no. Not mine. She said yes, yes and stared at me. Finally when i handed it back to her she got the idea. It was for tbe ladt next to me. Very unfriendly and almost rude staff. Food came quickly and it was hot and fresh. Never saw the waitress again. I was finally refilled on my water by a manager of some sort who was very nice. She brought my water back and I waited probably 10 more minutes before someone came back to get my credit card. They were busy but not full and really no excuse for service level.
