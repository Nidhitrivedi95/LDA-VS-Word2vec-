tnvZOd2vNCLPQS1KEZxqog Wow ... I don't know how this place got anything over a 1 Star review.

Maybe the 5 stars were for the Manager/Owner.  She seemed nice.  The other waitress seemed nice enough but she mostly looked confused.  She ran around a lot and yet, somehow, the service was very very slow.

I should have left when I ordered some Hot Tea.  Like many Chinese restaurants, they bring some small tea cups and and a little metal kettle with piping Hot Tea.  The tea water was cold.

It took a while but eventually got the owners attention.  She apologized, took the kettle and came back.  This time it was sorta hot.  Later on, when I asked for a refill of the kettle ... the water was cold again.  Didn't bother bringing it up again.

Front of the house needs a lot of work.  In my hour or so there, 4 different tables walked out.  Tired or waiting to be recognized.  Tired of waiting to order.  I should have followed them out.

Although tempted to leave as well, I waited patiently and was finally able to order.

The food eventually tickled in over the span of an hour.  One dish would come.  5 to 10 minutes later ... another dish would arrive and so forth.

To be fair, I'm pretty sure I've eaten worse.  This restaurant did not have the worst food.  I could review the individual dishes but this review is long enough.

Looking around the dining room, I could see many of the tables were also first timers.  Maybe all of them.  Maybe, like me, they were fooled by the 5 star reviews on Yelp.

I was just happy to be finally leaving.
