vbVJzKDhHlhMnKRpES5QzQ If you love spicy food, this is a must try! I came here with my cousins and a friend. Luckily we had a short wait, because by the time we left there was a long waitlist. But anyway, everything we ordered was on point! We ordered the Chengdu fried rice, fried green beans, boiled fish with green pepper, pig intestine & beef tripe in spicy soup. The portions are decent shareable sizes so we decided to order a variety things and share it. I will definitely be back especially to try the fried pig intestine, I've heard it is insanely delicious!
