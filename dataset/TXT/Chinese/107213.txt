I walked in and was greeted immediately. A quick look over the selections and I decided to get a two entree plate with string bean chicken and mushroom chicken and fried rice. 

I had to wait a few extra minutes because they didn't have any string bean chicken ready. So they offered to cook some up fresh for me and wait to fix my plate so the food would be nice and hot. Now, that's great customer service! The food was good, not great. But I like that it was hot and seasoned well. I was also very impressed with the portion size for the price. 

I'll be back!
