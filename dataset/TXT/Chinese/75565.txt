fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA My favorite restaurant in the GTA, used to be, at least. I haven't been there since December 2005, so this is based on memory rather than current facts. 

It's very well-lit, very busy, and it's sometimes dangerous to walk from one end to the other given its crowdedness. There was never a time we did not have to wait in line, even on Christmas day!

I loved their Chinese dumplings. I loved their Shanghai-style nian gao, and their osmanthus flavored mini dumplings sweet soup (although that isn't really Shanghainese...?)

This place has nothing to do with the international Ding Tai Fung Inc. that's based in Taiwan. My friends went to the DTF in Arcadia and thought it's delicious. They need to come to this one in Markham that is Shanghainese, technically, to experience what the real thing.
