f9ERQpAPOAMv5Ay0kyD3Yw Was there last night - Yuchi!  I don't know what happened to this place since it used to be good about a year ago. Service was horrible and the food had no flavor.  We ordered ginger sauce on tilapia and the tilapia was overcooked and dry.  We ordered it spicy yet no spice.  Had happy family and also asked for it to be medium spicy - no spice. We ordered the sun devil chicken which was better than the others but not great.  Waiter was inattentive.  Asked for water three times and still never brought to all three of us.  He didn't seem to care that two of the three items were not prepared properly.   We ordered three meals with the combo which included soup, egg roll, and crab puff.  Hot and sour soup was ok - a little too sweet and not very spicy.  The waiter brought 2 of the three platters and it took another 8 minutes for him to bring the other dish.  He could have brought the additional crab puff and egg roll separate so that the third person could begin eating.  We told the woman at the register about the problem but it still wasn't resolved.   There are too many good restauants in town - don't waste a meal here.
