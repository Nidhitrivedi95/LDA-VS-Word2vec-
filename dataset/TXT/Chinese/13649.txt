2ZHk1x5ZH687aPVo4ElYAA Sorry I really don't want to bad mouth any restaurants and its usually compliments that I give but this time, I gotta say the food in this place taste like crap. I ordered fried chicken with rice (seems like a simple entree eh) but half of the fried chicken is flour powder and they use the cheapest rice that has the ugliest texture. It does not taste like normal steamed rice at all (I know this cause I eat rice everyday) and the rice is cold... Alright I'll say some good stuff, the drinks are alright but a lot sweetener in it. So if ir coming in just to chill and get a drink or desert, great! But dinner or lunch, I suggest not.
