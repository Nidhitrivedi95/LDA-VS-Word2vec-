6WDDksGLLehfQDIvQXzR5w Came here with my boyfriend and his Chinese friend - mainly because his friend was feeling homesick, so we decided to treat him out and took him to a Chinese restaurant (a place that he can feel like home.) 

The service was good. The waitress was very helpful and patient with us.. since it was our first time there. My boyfriend and I don't usually eat Chinese food much, so we didn't know what to get. Overall, the food were great and surprisingly cheap imo. 

Definitely coming back! :)
