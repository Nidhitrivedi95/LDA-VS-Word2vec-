QiZCMGZEwVtg1ybOKybLhQ I'm from Philadelphia where there is a much larger Asian population than there is in Pittsburgh. I was excited to find a place that served Vietnamese food but was extremely disappointed with the quality of food and service of this restaurant. The broth for pho does not taste like traditional broth; it tastes like it was made using artificial flavoring rather than from roasted spices/bone/onion/ginger. The noodles are thick unlike noodles typically used in pho. Overall the quality of the food was terrible, and expensive. I can get a large bowl of pho that tastes considerably better for $6-7. Drinks were extremely expensive? $5 for thai iced tea? Bye.

If you're looking for better Vietnamese cuisine in Pittsburgh, try the Strip District. Don't give this place a shot, or you'll regret it.
