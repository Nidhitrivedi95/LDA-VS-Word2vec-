XGc_QdKg9oP8bZ3VM1e5IA I love this place, I've been ordering from these guys for over 10 years, they are the only Chinese place i will order from. The folks at Good View are very consistent, they serve fresh and very tasty Chinese food, and like most places they have their stronger and weaker dishes, but overall they have very good Chinese fare. 

Unlike many Chinese places, they don't allow you to customize dishes, change the noodles, heat level, etc. etc., well Good View does, they are extremely accommodating and often suggest choices on how to have certain dishes. Everyone loves options right! :) 

The other plus is the very friendly owners, and their nice clean restaurant. This place is definitely a hidden gem and very worthy of my business.
