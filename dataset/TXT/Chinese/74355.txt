 Found our new take-out place!!  

We ordered three different things and they were all delicious.  Tangerine beef is sweet and  mildly spicy, but they will up the heat if you ask.  The house sauce on the Happy family is delicious with the right amount of seasonings.  Plenty of the different meats in the happy family.  Sesame chicken and the tangerine beef were both deep fried, and even with the sauces still had a nice crispy coating to them.  Their fried rice is very simple, no overpowering spices that clash with your meal.  

The food was carefully packed, and still really hot when I got it home.  

We ordered dinner, but they also have lunch specials for under $6 that come with fried rice, soup, entree and soda.
