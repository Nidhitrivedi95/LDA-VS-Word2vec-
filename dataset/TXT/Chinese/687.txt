-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw If you live in North York or frequently visit this area then its safe to assume that you are familiar with the infamous chatime lineup. Today I decided to try it out and see what the fuss is all about.

It was cold so I ordered hot tea and milk. It was warm and fresh. Service was quick and friendly. Prices are reasonable but keep in mind this is K-town and you can easily get bubble tea for $3.99 anywhere else.

Decor is brought to you by IKEA. If you look up you will see wooden rectangles hanging from the ceiling (I thought that was fascinating). Washroom door blends in nicely with the wall. Free WiFi. K-pop was playing in the background.

A OK overall. I still fail to see why the lineup and what the fuss is all about.
