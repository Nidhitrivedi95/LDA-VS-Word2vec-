-rx-9Ra2OHfmD1yaUS-CMg Been wanting to try out this place for a long time and finally did this past weekend. The space inside belies it's quiet exterior and the restaurant was packed. Thankfully we had reserved our table in advance. It had a good staff to customer ratio and so service was good. The variety on the menu makes it difficult to choose. Food portions enormous. So, unless you have an elephantine appetite, think twice before ordering appetizers before the entrees. But they let you take a doggie bag home so nothing is lost. Our server was attentive and pleasing in her demeanour. Overall experience was very good making a return visit to this place a worthwhile one.
