Kn57RIWAdnVfJHI1loLXOQ This place is the best embodiment of the fusion culture it represents and services the needs of this South Asian clientele perfectly. 

The dishes could easily be on the menu anywhere in Pakistan and India. And are prepared with that community in mind. With  Manchurian on sizzler and Bombay chicken with fried rice, this place has all the Hakka essentials.

There are booths for privacy and the decor is 'understated family restaurant'.

The price are extremely affordable as you would expect with a family restaurant in Scarborough. 

This place is great value, it serves it's purpose well and is worth the drive. A near perfect restaurant.
