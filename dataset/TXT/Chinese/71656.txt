fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A Before heading off our separate ways home, my friends and I decided to have some breakfast. After eating at too many buffets over the weekend, we went with a controlled portion breakfast.

My friend suggested that we eat at his favorite dim sum spot. Apparently, when we got here, he wasn't the only one who thought  this was his favorite dim sum spot in Vegas. Our party consisted of 11 (10 adults and 1 toddler). We were early enough to get seated right away. This place reminded of some dim sum spots back in the Bay Area, but on a smaller scale. Waiters still pushed carts from table to table up selling items we wanted or to pass up. Our table came to order the following dishes:

- Pork siu mai 
- Calamari
- Chinese broccoli
- Pan fried noodles with chicken
- BBQ pork bun
- Rice noodle wrapped with beef
- Roast duck 

All these items were very tasty. The rice noodle wrapped with beef, calamari, and the pan fried noodles with chicken were my personal favorites. The rice noodle dish was something new to me, but reminded me of my love for beef chow fun. The pan fried noodles were semi-crispy but soft and paired well with the tender chicken.

Service was not the greatest. It gets busy to a point where your table maybe forgotten. One of the waitresses spilled water on my friend and apologized. 

Overall experience: 3.5 stars
