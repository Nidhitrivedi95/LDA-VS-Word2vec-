a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg I love me some diners food and since it was on the afternoon of our return home and we where basically broke, the prices lured us in. 

I have to admit it wasn't the nicest of joints I've eaten in but the service makes up for it along with the prices. 

My boyfriend and my friend both ordered the Club Sandwiches while I was trying to nurse an upset stomach with some french onion soup.  The sandwiches looked delicious and actually was such a large portion they had to ask for too go boxes, I on the other hand basically just had the broth and crackers since it was not the french onion soup I expected, there was at least a whole onion sliced up in my bowl ( sorta looked like worms) but the broth was good. 

The breakfast special sound very appealing so maybe when I'm back in December this will be our breakfast spot on Fremont Street.
