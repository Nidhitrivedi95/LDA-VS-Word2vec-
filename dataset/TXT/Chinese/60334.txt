DM8j5g9k28vEOTM0kz4KVA We've tried so many Chinese restaurants and this is hands down one of the best!  The way these dishes are prepared feel light and not so heavy with grease like so many locations.  The pot stickers are a favorite of ours because they are wrapped in a thicker more delicious dough with an amazing filling.  There are so many healthy choice meals with tofu and sea food and vegetarian options for those eating healthy but still wanting an amazing meal.  We have 4 kids and it is so rare that we find a restaurant we all love--and THIS is one of them.  They are a touch expensive so we dont go very often but it is totally worth the splurge.  My middle daughter regularly requests this restaurant for her birthday and special occasions.  The staff is courteous and very attentive, which isnt easy when 4 kids are dining at the table and they seem to need something every few minutes.
