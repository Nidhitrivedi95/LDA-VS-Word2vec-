xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw I came into the restaurant two days ago, a Friday night. The line was long so we thought we would get an appetizer. The waitress said the potstickers we were looking at were amazing.
We ordered the potstickers and they looked nothing like the menu! They came out white, they looked boiled and not fried at all. It was disappointing to come back to the table to 5 potstickers that were horrible looking and cost $7!
At least my noodle bowl came out good. 
I suggest passing on the appetizers and people just ordering the noodle bowls
