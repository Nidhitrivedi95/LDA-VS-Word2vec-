ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ We were here to celebrate a birthday with family (6 adults, 3 kids) on a Saturday for 5:30 p.m. seating and it was crazy busy.  They insist on 2 hour time limit for each seating and that was fine by us as the vast dining room was already jam packed with people walking to and from the buffet.  

The noodle bot was out of order when we were there which was a disappointment for the kids.  The spicy beef noodle soup I sampled was just ho hum for both broth and noodles.  The line ups at most popular stations like sushi & peking duck were plain silly so I opted out of the peking duck and just did sushi.  Selection is limited for both sushi and sashimi but it was pleasant to see Hamachi sashimi on the menu.  Sushies are on the small side.  

They had more non-traditional buffet menus like braised pork hocks and oxtail stew...etc but I never got a chance to sample these as it was just too hard to get to the food with constant push and pull of other diners each battling for their share of food.  

In all honesty, their food was no better than any other buffets I've been to but I have to say, the congestion and traffic at the buffet line at Dragon Legend was really something else.  I can't say I'd return to this place in a hurry.  

Oh, they advertise "Birthday person eats free with 4 paying adults" on their website but they didn't honor that promotion saying it's not valid for a weekend dinner which is not listed anywhere on their website.  Cheap.
