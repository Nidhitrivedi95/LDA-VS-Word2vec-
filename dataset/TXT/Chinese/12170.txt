2Oz0VGwBgo3Dp5Az5WUoww We no longer go to the Sampan. We had guests for dinner and ordered take out from the Sampan. The lady that took the order said NO MSG in their food. When we arrived to pick up the take out order the cashier told us that MSG was in three of the dishes we had ordered.
It may have been understandable, but she was not polite about it either. She says "NO MSG FOR YOU, HA" - I said we prefer no MSG in our food. We decided, they had given us bad information then the young cashier was somewhat smart mouth about it.  Who needs bad information and  poor customer service, we decided no more.
