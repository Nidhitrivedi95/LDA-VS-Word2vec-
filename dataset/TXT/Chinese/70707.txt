F9h98ZFHLCHG7SdVbXMz0g Kwan proved to us after our first visit, that 1) They are all about Quality and Freshness with reasonable pricing and 2) That Dim Sum can be done right without coming short in service,

After searching endlessly for a damn good Dim Sum restaurant on Yelp, We found Kwan on Yelp we were NOT let down. We got there around 11:30 am, and you can tell the service is great because the server (owner?) Steve seated us and got us started with the Jasmine Tea without delay, and had a nice conversation with him through-out our visit. The food is prepared pretty fast considering everything is made fresh and you can tell by how amazing everything tastes, even the mustard sauce on the table is made in house and I mention that because I personally love it. You don't notice the wait thought as you sip on the authentic smooth Jasmine Tea (yes, real jasmine flowers in the tea) admiring the subtle decor and enjoying the cozy ambience. 

The Breakdown:

-Shrimp Dumpling (Har Gow)
-Scallop w/ Mushroom Dumplings
-Seafood Snow Pea Sprout Dumplings
-Vegetarian Dumplings

These Dumplings were the best we've ever had, I was starting to get sick and tired of the generic bland tasting dumplings we've had everywhere else but these were something else; big, FRESH, and stuffed with ingredients.

-Jumbo Shrimp Wrapped w/ Steam Rice Flour Noodle
This is a star dish, other places have outsourced dough for the noodle, and make it too thick and blob-like but the noodle here is made from scratch in house and the difference is huge, nice, thin and fresh, one of our favourites.

-Cuttlefish w/ Curry Sauce
tender pieces of delicious cuttlefish in a flavourful sauce, what more can I say?

-Deep Fried Squid Tentacles w/ Seasoned Salt
this was some good squid, cooked just right with the seasoning just right and when you dip it into the Worcestershire sauce, everything is ...just right.

-Crispy Shrimp Roll w/ Mango
I HAVE TO WRITE THIS IN CAPITALS BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST MIND-BLOWING DISH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'LL BE BORING, BUT WHEN YOU BITE INTO IT, IT'S THIS BLAST OF GOOEY GOODNESS I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN, JUST GET IT...JUST GET IT.

-Pan Fried Fish Cake
a nice appetizer dish, light but firm, and goes well with the sweet chili Thai sauce that comes with it.

-Clam w/ Chives Crepe
Unlike other restaurants, Kwan makes this dish properly, it's usually made thick and soggy, but here it's thin and crispy as it should be.

-Golden Lava Bun (fried)
Sweet and crispy, gets better the more you bite into it.

Dessert:
-Mango Pudding w/ Condensed Milk
They don't skimp on quality at Kwan, that's evident with the rest of the menu, and even with dessert, this dessert is made with REAL MANGO, not pulp from a can, not food coloured jello. It swims in a light bed of milk and ends the meal off just perfectly.

Kwan will be our regular Dim Sum place, Steve is a great guy and very helpful, the food is above average, the prices can't be beat for quality and service. Already craving more, cant wait to try the rest of the menu, definitely coming back soon!
