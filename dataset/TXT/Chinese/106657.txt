l_pR3x7v2mvE3luVdmGuoQ The restaurant definitely isn't super classy... the chairs were ripped and I could even see the foam! The service was okay-the waiter/waitress didn't come to us immediately and the food wasn't served as quickly as past Chinese restaurants I've been to. Although the waiter who took our order was pretty impressive since he didn't write down our order and still remembered the 6 dishes we ordered. The food was overall pretty good. I ate chicken fried rice- in my opinion it was not flavored quite enough and there weren't many other ingredients (like vegetables). 

I might go back, but I'd definitely only order take out.
