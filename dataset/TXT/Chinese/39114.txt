AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw HK Style Cafe with all the basic classics you would expect. 

I went with a larger group of 6 and they were very accommodating for our larger group. We thought we had 5 people and squished in a booth (4 in the booth + 1 on the side) but had another friend join unexpectedly and the staff quickly helped us get setup at a larger table despite the large crowd. 

I ordered one of their all-day breakfast combos which took a bit longer to serve (everyone was waiting for me even though some of them also ordered something similar). Overall, the food was good (the warm bread with butter was great) and we didn't feel rushed, which some HK cafes can make you feel, and we had a good overall experience.
