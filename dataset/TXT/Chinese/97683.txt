jPxlzLWHc7mkvhw3YUXuZg Ordered their lunch/daily specials:

Pork fried rice;
Gen. Tao chicken;
Sweet-sour pork;
Fried chicken wing (10 pcs).
Their spring roll sucks!

Taste-wise, they were ok.
Price-wise, very expensive for its quality and quantity.

Not worth it unless you like eating expensive, low-quality food.
