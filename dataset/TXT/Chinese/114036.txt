MSYpFcm5FAkQYLcY6tkOgw I thought I would give this place a try since it is close to my new job. First when I walked in to pick up my order the lady was rude and didn't wear a smile. The first thing I ordered was the cashew chicken. I didn't like it, veggies were soggy and the chicken texture was strange and tasted stale. My absolute favorite place is China One on Trop/eastern, so I thought well maybe I am just comparing it to them. So I gave it another try. Second time around I ordered Teriyaki chicken, simple I thought. The chicken was even worse this time! Tasted like over baked shredded chicken leg meat! I specifically asked for my veggies to be lightly sautéed. Still soggy! The rice and noodle are edible/ok. I won't be returning just not worth the money or frustration.
