oWM1ZEsqgJYMgvLbWUwuaw I went to the spa expecting a great massage with a name like spa massage for you however the owner, who checked me in, did not even know what forms I should fill out. Then the massage therapist's pressure was too hard.  I had to keep reminding her the whole hour to lighten up. The facial bed was atrocious. it was like a giant clam that would close up.  I had to lay still. The place did not seem that clean. Nor was it a relaxing atmosphere.
