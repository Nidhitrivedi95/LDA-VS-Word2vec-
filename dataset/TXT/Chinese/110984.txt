A friend had recommended me to try, so I gave it a go for lunch. The plaza is pretty packed was still able to find a parking spot after couple minutes. The restaurant was not too packed and we were able to get a booth seat. The service was surprisingly good for Chinese restaurant, the servers in general were pretty polite. 

As for the food, there weren't a lot of daily special items to choose from and you can't sub for vermicelli or other items unless it states otherwise. Prices range from $6.99 to $8.99 which is definitely a steal and comes with a soup and tea/ coffee. I order the corn cream pork minced on rice (~$6.99) and the corn cream on the dish was a bit too thick for my liking and it was definitely lacking in flavour which was a bit of a disappointment. The chinese house soup was great however, and so was the milk tea.
