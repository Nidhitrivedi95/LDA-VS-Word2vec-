We tried the ramen (it comes with a side of tempura veggies & shrimp), thai spring rolls, roasted cauliflower, street corn, oysters, chicken kara age, and chicken wings. We were too full this time, but I can't wait to go back and try the crab fried rice.

While the ramen did not stand out (it was for the kids, though, and they liked it), everything else was very very good. Actually, my favorites were the street corn and the cauliflower. Simple yet unique preparation and delicious flavors. I could have probably eaten 3 dishes of those alone. Bonus that they were on the happy hour menu (3-6 every day, I think) and priced at ~$2 each. While I am not usually a big time fried chicken fan, the wings and kara age both also distinguished themselves with great flavors and crispy skin. The oysters were good and I appreciated the 3 sauces (thai salsa, asian cocktail sauce, and spicy ponzu) they were served with - again, just a little touch to set Inyo apart.

What made this a great outing for us was definitely the service. The manager (owner?) remembered me from a Yelp tip I left months ago about not having lunch service! Amazing! (BTW, they have lunch now) He was on the spot all evening with recommendations, orders, refills, etc. We love eating out with our kids, but they can sometimes be messy/accidentally knock over drinks/eat with their hands/etc. I felt like Inyo might be a little 'fancy' for them, but the manager was super friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome.

On top of all the food, we had a really good sake sampler and a happy hour beer...total before tip ~$75. Considering this was the equal of lots of places I've been on the Strip, I thought the price was very reasonable, and it was much easier to get in and out.

The only knock I have for Inyo is that it's too far from my house!
