The space itself is very clean, bright, soft and feels good to be in. Nice pure smell in the air with great colors on the walls and plants! 

Service was A+. Staff was very Personable, patient, informational and truly cared about my experience. The server even tossed my bowl for me! :) He was incredibly sweet and caring!

Food arrived quickly, very very fresh! Fresh ingredients and delicious! I got a bowl with noodles and veggies, nothing fancy but sooooo yummy. 

I highly recommend!
