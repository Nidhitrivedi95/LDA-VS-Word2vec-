zPcF4fI18gSp42G17oHmmg Always looking for new buffet adventures and this one was rather excellent.   Sushi at a buffer is a plus and it was really good and a large selection.  They had quite a good variety and good quality overall.  With every place like this, there's always specialties and other dishes aren't as good.  Plus, everyone has their own personal taste, so I'll say this, fried rice was a little salty and duck was tasty.  I'd check it out again.
