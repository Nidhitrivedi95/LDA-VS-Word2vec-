2m4092MsMzEHkuxodaj6-g Service was pretty good here and the Chinese food is the best I have had in Vegas so far, living here for about three years. We've been looking for a favorite Chinese restaurant and I think we found it. We ordered the kung pao and Mongolian beef and both were excellent. We had the lunch special which also included soup, which was average. The meat on both dishes was extremely well seasoned and the sauce made with the Kung pao was to die for.
