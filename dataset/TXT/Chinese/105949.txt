ky5L-EfUwU9chSPcIeXM5w This was our go to place for Chinese for quite awhile, we used to have them deliver our food, but have discovered that it came to us either spilled in the bag or cold. 

We have since decided we would order it and pick it up. They don't take long to make and it is always good and hot when we get it home. The staff is wonderful and we will continue to go. 

The reason they received 4 stars instead of 5 is just for the convenience of going to get the order.
