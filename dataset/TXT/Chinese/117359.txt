NdqDt4c2ZWpGTUWvcDDKkw It's a neighborhood restaurant and family-run.  The kids wait and do deliveries.

You will not mistake it for 'Plum' located a long block physical by distance and half a universe gastronomically.  But it is low priced and filling.

Is it fake?  I don't think so, but like many other Chinese restaurants across the country they order their menus from a central supplier probably in New York or California and pictures of food from that supplier/wholesaler as well.  So the menu doesn't have any mystery or excitement.

Since it's across the street from Target, this will give you an alternative to that snack bar or a place to fill up before you go to Kelly's.
