aY-lZvoTHAFl9k6dcfcAxQ So recently moved to gilbert and every place we have gone to has been amazing. So we opted for Chinese, spoiled by amazing service this place was the exact opposite. 
1. I am not sure if the husband and wife are the owners. But they feel like it's okay to yell at each other in Chinese loud back and forth while people were eating and on the phone. 
2. The lady was in such hurry to get our food that she did not allow me to ask questions about the menu. And with drinks before we finished ordering she left.
3.A family was there that had their CC declined and the lady was so loud about it that everyone else was hearing what was going on.
4. We ordered appetizers, chicken skewers and egg rolls. Both were horrible. Skewers tasted like rubber. And supper salty. Egg roll soggy!
5. Meal I got Kung Pao wife got tofu. So salty we did not eat it. 
6. Went to the restroom and there was a person before us that had thrown up all over the place. I let the lady know and we bounced. All together really bad food and experience. Will not be going back! I have no idea why this place has a 4 star review we made sure to look at it before going in.
