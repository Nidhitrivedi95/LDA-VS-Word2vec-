T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ Went there for lunch today, had high expectation since we tried the same buffet in SD that has really good food & fancy decor. This is a major disappointment! First we were shocked by the high price: price of lunch is equal to dinner! Except for sweet & sour chicken & apple pie, everything is at best luke warm! Most of the desserts are not fresh, chocolate cakes are really dry! Compare to the other Chinese buffets here in town like Jumbo Buffet, China Star, & Buffet Asia, this has fewer selection & worse service!
