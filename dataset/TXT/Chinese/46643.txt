BwbPzuEuIN_oFmNRJIgHlg I'm a tourist to Toronto, but if I lived here, I would be a regular at the Flaming Bull. It was a pure delight. 

We ordered three appetizers - the mango salad, the Taste of Life pork shoulder, and the bean paste pancakes - and the pork over noodles, plus the mango ricotta for dessert. Everything was divine. 

My particular favorites were the bean paste pancakes (served piping hot in a crispy yet flaky fried dough), but I also have a weakness for bean paste. The noodles were also excellent: thick udon with minced pork pieces and crispy rice noodles and carrots and delicious sauce.
