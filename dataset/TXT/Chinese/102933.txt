Kig-T7wfebjGIpgSKcdlKA This use to be my favourite Pho place, I've been going here for over 10 years unfortunately the quality of the food and service is now unacceptable.
The portion size is now a quarter of any other pho and the broth isn't as good, it's sour. The staff are friendly however I've been turned down multiple times because they were closing early.  

This upsets me as big bowl is a 2 min drive from my house and now I find myself driving 20-30 for a good bowl of pho.
