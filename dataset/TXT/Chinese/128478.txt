PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ I need to start this review by saying how impressed I was with the entire staff.  The service we received was EXCELLENT!!!  I have never had such excellent service in a Chinese restaurant in my life!!!  The staff was very helpful with our orders, patient, and attentive to our needs.  

Dim sum for 2.  Got shumai, 2 kinds of chive dumplings, har gow x2, fishcake stuffed tofu x2, crab claws, and sesame bun.  I would say the food here is good.  Not great, not bad, but definitely good.  Would I come here again?  Yes I would.  Would I recommend this place?  Yes I would.  The reviews I read lead me to believe that there were tons of items up front in the display.  I was a little let down that they didn't have all the items I was hoping for.  The carts that come around are pretty standard for any dim sum restaurant in town.  The shumai were  good, they were my favorite item.  I judge every dim sum place by their shumai and I was not disappointed.  I'd like to go back with more people so I can try more items.
