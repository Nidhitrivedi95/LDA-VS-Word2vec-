cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw YAY!  I've found it!  OK, No. It's not authentic Chinese food, but it is authentic American Chinese food.  To be even MORE specific, New York Style Chinese food. I grew up on the east coast and this is what Chinese food is like.  Now onto the business at hand, I'm Chinese and I have to say this place is SOLID...aka...DEEEELISH!  The 2 dishes I always test with are the hot and sour soup and Chicken with Garlic Sauce.  These 2 shows alot of how the chef was trained and can pretty much tell you how the rest of the dishes will be.  And both were mouth watering!  The dinner portion is ginormous, both hubby and I could barely finish 1 dish.  I'm sure lunch portion would be the same, enough to take back to your desk and munch on to survive the rest of the work day cravings.  I totally agree with reviewer #1 for the need to support local business owners. Skip PeiWei and resist the temptation to dine at "trendy" Chinese eateries.  EARTH TO ALL: CHINESE FOOD IS NOT TRENDY.  It was never intended to be either.  The fancier the decor, the higher score on the cool-factor, the worse the food is.  I've searched and searched for a hole in the wall serving Chinese food...and I've found it.  This is one is a winner.
