Typically speaking, Chinese Food and Fresh, Light, and Delicious don't all go together, but at Fin, we indulged in plenty of food, and left feeling full but not stuffed, and like what we ate was fresh.

I know fresh can be hard to understand, but what I mean by that was all of the ingredients were the finest possible, and you could tell they were all top notch. Nothing was greasy or heavy or weighed down - it was all cooked the way I could only hope to eat Chinese food but rarely happens: Guilt Free. 

While it is a bit pricey, you get what you pay for in service and quality, and to be honest, it wasn't unreasonably priced. 

If you have a group - reserve one of the private party rooms - super chic and awesome looking for a special event.
