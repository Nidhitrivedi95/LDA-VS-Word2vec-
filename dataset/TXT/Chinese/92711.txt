IS_IWMsFRJii__17LsP1Og I'm in Vegas and wanted to go to the Thai place that Anthony Bourdain reviewed on No Reservations. While preparing to go there reading the Yelp reviews, I found this place Highly rated and recommended in the reviews, it was only 6 minutes from my sisters house so I decided to come here instead.

We arrived at 11 am and was 2nd to be seated. The place was nice and 70 degrees well decorated and new and clean feeling.

I don't eat Thai food so I went off the reviews to choose, I chose Drunken Noodles  Pad Kee Mao with pork and level 7 spice.

I loved it! Tasted and looked like what I would expect if and when I travel to Thailand.

I checked in and received a free Thai Tea and paid cash received a 10% discount and left 20%.
