csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA I gave this restaurant 2 stars due to service and food taste, but first:

1. This restaurant is not small kid friendly. Didn't take anything away from them but beware parents of small children. I'd go with bigger kids or with the spouse

2. The portions are generous...with no kids menu I ordered noodles for the kids which was quite enough for us all. Ended up canceling the 2nd order because of it.

3. Food was bleh. We got the chicken lo mein and it was not flavorful and half the noodles were cold while I other half was hot.

4. Service. Lowest part of score was service. I purposely told the waiter it was out first time there,hoping she'd tell me about the menu, popular dishes, sushi etc. she just shrugged and said "ok, ill comeback".it took awhile for her to return, when she did I had to ask for a sushi menu after realizing I didn't get one...another wait. After she brought my order...never saw her again. Had to ask another waitress if she could get my waitress to bring the check,she let her coworker bring it! 

As I write this, I regret leaving her a 25%tip and only did it because I had small rambunctious kids in a non kid friendly restaurant although we were not there long and left and ate somewhere else!
