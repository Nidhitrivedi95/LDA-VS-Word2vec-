YpnvKqeVD7dqZ9Mr0SGw6A I really love asian food. I mean all asian food, from hole in the wall places to chains like this. This location has treated me well and the food is always great. It is super close to my new office, and on the day of my interview I actually dined there in an off hour and it was very nice. From my experience, the cashiers are exceptionally thorough, the one who calls pot stickers "POPstickers" makes me giggle every time, and they know how to move some bodies. I've had the honey chicken with both white and brown rice, as well as the POPstickers- all delish
