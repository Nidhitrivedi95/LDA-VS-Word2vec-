X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg It's actually not a bad venue but the hype is half-true in my opinion. Here are the pros and cons (that are probably similar to what other yelpers have posted here):

Pros
- Awesome DJ lineup if you're really into the EDM crowd
- Expect celebrities walking in and out of this crowd because it's the new hot spot to be at in Vegas
- Security is strict, but fair. We didn't have a table but the security didn't really mind that there was an empty table that we sat at and they gave up opportunities to stand by the balcony even though we weren't supposed to be there. Much appreciated!
- Bathrooms are huge and clean
- Multiple floors of different genres - I enjoyed the main stage and the hip hop room. Apparently there is a pavilion that I didn't even find out about

Cons
- Stairs so it isn't friendly for those who were wearing heels, however, there is an elevator but it is usually pretty packed
- Expect are really large entry fee if you didn't buy pre-sale tickets and GL is pretty long
- Drinks are expensive but that is expected of Vegas clubs
