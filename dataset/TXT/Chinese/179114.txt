X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I never do review, but I had to do this time. 
It was one of the worst nights in Vegas.
All staff is extremely impolite and you cannot stand anywhere. 

The security staff is really rude! They are always treating people badly and pushing them. 

By the time the place gets more crowded, they even reduce the space you are allowed to stay and it starts a get worse. 

I didn't know I shouldn't touch the elevator button, when I tried to reach it so, the guy hit my hand aggressively and yelled at me. 

I strongly don't recommend this place!
