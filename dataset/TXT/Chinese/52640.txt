Here are some signs that you've walked into a LEGIT pick up Chinese food:
1) 80 year old Grandma is working the front, and confidently speaks zero English.  Check.
2) Refrigerator is stocked with 1.5L soda bottles.  Check.
3) Cleaning supplies and stacks of to-go containers. Check.
4) Manually hand written receipts. Check.
5) Restaurant seats 3 people.  Check.
6) SUPER FAST, well portioned CHEAP Chinese food!! CHECK.

We even ate here the night after my wedding a few months ago.  I served this to my own relatives.  That's some major vetting right there.
