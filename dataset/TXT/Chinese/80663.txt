GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g Wonderful service and delicious Chinese food!  Loved the hot towels they brought you between courses.  The portions were large enough that our table of 7 all shared.  To end the meal you are given a fortune cookie and a bailey's & milk shooter-yum! I'd definitely recommend it!
