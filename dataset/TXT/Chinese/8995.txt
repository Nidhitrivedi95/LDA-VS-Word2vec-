1NZNZHnGE4-FLZmU6xp3oQ It's the most stereotypical map food you can get.  You are rushed along like an assembly line worker.  I come here all the time because I work in the mall and there's only 4 choices but this place is one of the worst.  And lately is gotten even worse with the portion sizes.  They used to at least pile it on.  Now they do one small scoop of each item and rush you along to the end.  The one star is because I haven't gotten sick from this place....yet.
