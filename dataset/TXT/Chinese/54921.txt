CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw I came to this place with no expectations.. I left with one of the greatest dining  experiences I've ever had. I know what you're thinking it's just noodles. I was wrong and it's so much more than that. I had so many things that we're good...I don't even remember which one was better to tell you about it. Maybe to much sake. The service was impeccable, so happy and nice. Seems like whoever is running the show over here has it together and knows what they are doing. To top it off at the end, we had  some sort of chipped or shaved ice cream that I honestly would eat for all three meals a day. Everyday. It was even better cold later after the club! I know they say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but the flavors have stuck with me even when I left and got back home.
