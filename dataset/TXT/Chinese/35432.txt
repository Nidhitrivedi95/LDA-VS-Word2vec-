We came here with friends from England and this is not a big thing there so they wanted to try. 
The thing that sets it apart from all the other Asian buffets, I feel would be the hand cut noodles. Dough is sliced thinly directly into the broth and cooked. 
They offered beef flavoured, spinach and plain. The beef I guess wasn't really beef tasting cause my daughter asked to take it all out and leave the plain. 
My nieces had the beef and spinach and said about the same. It's more for watching I guess than actual good flavour and taste. I was told the broth was nice. 
I had mainly wings both deep fried and pan fried. Those were good. Not dry. 
For dessert the really good one item (the star) was the ginger milk custard. It was set, but not over cooked. Amazing. If I were to go back it would be solely for that.
