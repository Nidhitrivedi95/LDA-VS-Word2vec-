beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Last night a group of friends and I came here for the first time. The food was good, we were all impressed with the setup of the conveyer belt, and I was excited to recommend this restaurant to my family who I thought would enjoy it. I really wish I got the name of our waitress because what she did completely turned me off from ever wanting to step foot in there again. We were thanking our waitress as we were walking out and I did not think much of it that she did not really acknowledge us. But she kept trying to look past me over towards our table and I had a feeling she was looking for tip money, which was placed under the receipt. My group of friends were saying our goodbyes outside when our waitress comes out and what she does just BLOWS. MY. MIND. She starts demanding more money because she is not satisfied with her tip. She just stood there holding up the receipts and did not want to leave until she revived more money. All of us were completely shocked that she had the nerve to chase us down and harass us about a tip. Tip is not mandatory, so where does one get the nerve to be that unappreciative and ask for more? And why would anyone even think they deserved or would get more after acting that way?! The tip amount was good and fair for the service provided. Our group was not skimping out on the money. Even if we left nothing it would not be okay for her to do that. Our group should have talked to a manager but we all just wanted to leave. This was not acceptable behavior and I hope this is not the standard for how their staff treats customers.

I really created this yelp account just to share this bad experience. That's how much it bugged me.
