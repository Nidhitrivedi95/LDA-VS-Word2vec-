W8xPHUqL088jdcmNZyH-eA Chinese people eat here! Weeks of seeing Instagram posts of noodle places in different states left me with a deep craving for noodles.
I have found the Noodle spot of my dreams!!
The nice lady who served us was very sweet and pleasant. The decor is very Chinatown and out of place in Henderson but I'm sure happy they're so close. Prices are  extremely reasonable. I believe they are under new management which explains the Grand Opening sign.

We started with the scallion pancakes and ended up with a 2nd order. They are warm, soft & chewy with a mild onion flavor...sort of like a Chinese onion flour tortilla.

Wonton Noodle Soup. Light broth with generous amount of deliciously delicate wontons that melt in your mouth. Also generous amount of noodles & bok choy. Perfect anytime but especially good for when you're under the weather.

#16 House Special Spicy Noodles - I cannot express how much I love this dish. It's also known as Cha Chiang Mein.
I've tried this dish at other places and either been mildly amused or disappointed. Noodle Pot is what I've always imagined how this dish should be. Let's just start with the sauce...it's a Chinese version of spaghetti with meat sauce but BETTER! The sauce is not overly done and has the right amount of spice mixed into the perfect ratio of ground pork and mapo-style tofu. Dip the scallion pancake into the sauce :) 
I knew it was going to be good the moment I dug my chopsticks into the bowl and pulled out strands of chewy and clearly fresh made noodles...the best I've ever had.

This is my new obsession. My family will eventually tire and roll their eyes at me when I drag them here every week and then I'll have to resort to sneaking it in without them. Let's keep this wonderful establishment in business for years to come. Go get yourself the best noodles in town and bring a friend but pay no attention to the girl slurping down her noodles in the corner...that will just be little ole me :)
