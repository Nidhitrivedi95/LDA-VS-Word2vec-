KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ been fan since 1999..  food is always great! and staff is always friendly.. except for this older lady.. she has her moments where she will be yelling at someone in the kitchen.. lol!  same staff since i have known the place.. 

it might not be the fancy or most attractive looking Chinese restaurant, but you will get plenty of quality food that will satisfy your hunger..       

try sesame chicken..  or honey glazed walnut shrimp..  mmm good!
