1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA I think if you come here under the assumption that this will be your familiar, Americanized fare of sweet and sour pork, shrimp fried rice, Kung pow;), and potstickers...you will be disappointed...go back to the strip!  On the other hand, if you come with an open mind (and maybe an empty tummy) you'll leave satisfied. 
At Big Wong (gotta love the name)I felt far removed from Vegas and more like I was in SF (this place was reminiscent of my old hood). I was pleased with our choices the salt and pepper shrimp (I ate the heads, tails and all the sliced chilies too) and the shrimp soup with wontons. This little place, be it simple, was alright in my book. I would definitely go back and with my kids next time to share the "experience."
