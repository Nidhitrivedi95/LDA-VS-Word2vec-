X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ This is my second visit here to Island Malaysian Cuisine on Spring Mountain near Decatur.  We parked in the back and entered from the rear...very convenient, but interesting.

They brought us three different menus, one with the names and brief description (most useful for those familiar with the food already), one with pictures, names and numbers coordinating to regular menu (so you have a better idea of the items, and a third one with the chef's specials.   

We ordered:
#1 Roti Canai, came with a small bowl of chicken curry soup to dip your fresh made, and well rolled Roti in...a piece of potato and small piece of chicken on the bone...this was our favorite.

Chef's special Seafood Hotpot...I would call it more "vegetable soup with some seafood"...lots of imitation crab but not enough real seafood. Probably wouldn't order this again, but we did enjoy the presentation of the flame and hotpot.

#118 Kang Kung Belacan...stir fried Kang Kung with shrimp paste...it was tasty.

Service was very pleasant and attentive. I would love to come back and certainly will to try some different items....
