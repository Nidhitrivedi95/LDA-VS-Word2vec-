The first time I had went here with a friend, it was very awkward. Beyond awkward. We stood at the "Please Wait to Be Seated" sign for about two minutes before one of the workers decided to acknowledge us and seat us. Our food was delicious! I always get the pad see ew at everywhere thai joint I go to and this place definitely did not disappoint. My friend got the pad thai with the level 6 spice and she was chugging on her water the whole time. Haha. The service was pretty decent the whole time and it was an OK experience. Nothing memorable except being awkwardly stared at by already seated patrons. 

The second time I went was less awkward, but it just told me that this place and me being physically there was not meant to be.

That is why I stick to ordering ONLINE and having them deliver :) that way I did not really have to deal with anyone. Their online ordering is so simply and they have a mobile site for your iPhone as well! I have only had one issue with ordering online and that was when an hour and a half passed with no food so I called to see what the hold up was. The woman who answered did not speak English so I gave up, haha. Luckily my food came about 15 minutes later but that is still a really long wait. Just remember that if you order online that it is a $20 minimum. The driver's tip is not included so tip accordingly! I will just keep ordering online and get some bomb pad see ew that way.
