RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw Used to go to Congee Wong from way back while attending Seneca College near by.  I brought my then bf there once at time, apparently he liked it so  much that he got hooked. Also so on his sister was introduced to it. Apparently its her fav restaurant. So from this trend, we can see some good words about this restaurant has spread out. Congee Wong is on Finch n Don Mills. Considering where I am downtown core, I never had the urge to go such distance to eat Chinese food since I dont drive. But recently there two family dinners I had attended brought me back to this place after all. 

The place had never been renovated EVER! But the interior somehow was maintained nicely. it can fool you mistakenly thinking its a new restaurant . Everything looked clean fresh and organized. It does give you a bright welcoming feeling as you walk inside. I like when you walk in, you feel "Chinese"! A lot of Asian places try too hard to be contemporary lately and lose their own original flavor of whom they present at first place.  The restaurant was busy even at 4:30pm on Sunday.  if you want to get seats for dinner, better go before 6pm. Or you might have to wait at door for seating. 

We had pork congee, sweet n sour pork, satay chicken chaomian, sizzling beef with onion and mushroom, pork chops, chicken fried rice... very typical stuff what white people will order when they go to Asian place. All the dishes lived up to the expectations, they were very satisfying. Surprisingly the pork chops were amazing, they were lightly breaded and seasoned perfectly, thoroughly cooked and yet tender. 

We gave them huge tips, and I think I am hooked on pork chops now. I am probably going to go back there for some porc =D
