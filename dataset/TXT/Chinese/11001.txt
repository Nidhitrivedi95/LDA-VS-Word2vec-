2cetuQgbP1Bnzm-uMRlocQ Came here for lunch and had their pho.  It was OK... the broth was really salty and tasted like a lot of MSG.  I didn't think it was anything special.  We were the only ones there other than one other group at about 11:30am on a weekday.  It was packed by the time we left around 12:30.  I've heard their karaoke is pretty good, will probably be back to try that out, but probably not for their pho.
