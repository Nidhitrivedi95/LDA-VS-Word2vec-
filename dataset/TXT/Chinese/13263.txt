2UdoeXzcFg87O1VMCc3WGQ Went there for Saturday dinner, I thought the word of "all you can eat buffet" is to see the foods laid out in long table like Mandarin restaurant. Was I wrong. It's laid out in IPAD, browse the menu and order thru ipad. New way for us. 
The foods are good, loves the sushi. The price, a little bit expensive.
We ordered fried rice and some dishes to eat with it but rice arrived first then a few minutes later came the dishes one by one. They should serve it at the same time.
The staffs are helpful and friendly though.
