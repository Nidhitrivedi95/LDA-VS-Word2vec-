Wqa1JjkSuviehZ7OedhPeA Not as bad as I thought.  Based on previous review I thought service would be terrible.  Could be better though.

We had the Peking duck, the signature pears and some other dishes. 

Cons:
No credit cards.  Cash and debit only.

No wet wipes or hot towels with Peking duck.  Had to go to washrooms to wash up.

Kind of pricey.  Come on!  They charge you for the sauce?  That's like McD charging you for ketchup with your fries.  
Not enough pancake with your Peking duck.  Only 10 pieces so if you have a bigger group, you are going to have to order more at cost.

Notes:
Service wasn't that bad that we would pay no tips.  Nobody gave us a refill on our tea but they did have someone pack our leftovers to take out.  Lots of places leave you to do it.

Serving us dessert so early.  Normally I don't care but I was told by my dinner companion that when the golden pear gets cold, it's not so good to eat.  Would be nice if they served it near the end.  


Pros:
Decor is nice.  Waiters are uniformed but the manager/owners were totally casual in T-shirts and jeans.  Saw them working the front desk coming in and going out.  They did bid us good night and didn't ignore us.
Food came pretty fast.  Not the greatest duck but there was plenty of meat with the duck.  My companion said that it was half a duck.

Lining up wasn't bad.  We went on a Sunday night around 6:30 and only waited 15-20 minutes?  Wasn't really keeping track but it wasn't like lines out the door.  Although all the tables were full.

In conclusion, it's not as bad as I thought but a bit pricey.  Good thing one of us had a VIP card to give us 10% discount.  It's nice to try but not some place I would regularly want to go to.  I wasn't wowed by it.

There's underground parking in case you didn't know.

Thank you
