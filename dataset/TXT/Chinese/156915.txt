trsKoo2b9-nMcXCKn8dlfQ All the 5 star reviews are very odd to me. 
Stopped in for lunch and got a lunch special.  Service was fast but poor.  Guy didn't even look at me when he took my order or put my drink down.  
More importantly, the food sucked. If this is "the best Chinese on the West Side" I am glad I live in Gilbert. The fried rice was terrible. Not really fried rice, just seasoned rice.  I got like a pound and it had about three bites of egg.  The egg roll was over sized, mealy and mostly cabbage.  I ordered the green onion beef and got the broccoli beef.  The beef was overcooked and chewy.  It came out fast so I bet it's on a warming table in back and seemed like it may have been there too long.  
They get 2 stars for the huge portions.  So if you are really hungry and have lost your sense of taste in an industrial accident try it out.
