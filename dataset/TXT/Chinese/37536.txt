aPBTwoHvuVKHP2zkiKvwQQ We tried this restaurant for the first time Friday evening. We were greeted and seated right away.  I asked about the nightly special and was shown a card with the specials they have all the time. My husband and I both ordered one of the specials. It started with an ok egg roll and a crab angel that tasted like just cream cheese inside a fried wonton. No crab could be tasted. Our entrees arrived piping hot and very presentable. Unfortunately the food was not good. The orange chicken I had was tough and so salty I could not eat it. The fried rice was good.  Next time we want Chinese food we will try somewhere else.
