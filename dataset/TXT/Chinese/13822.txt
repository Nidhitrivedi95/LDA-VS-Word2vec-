3-HFGxmbzSax-NySJ_LzDg When your girlfriend comments that the piece of candy that came with the bill was the best part of the meal, you know it was bad.
After reading all the great reviews, we came with high hopes and left extremely disappointed.  I started getting nervous when I saw the library of menus dropped off at our table.  I'm not a math major but I know that too many menu options = mediocre food.  This was definitely the case with our dinner.

We shared:
Pork Dumplings with chili oil-Dumplings were literally submerged in the oil and quickly fell apart when picked up
Spicy Tuna and a Yellowtail roll-Both rolls suffered from overcooked and mushy rice
Duck with handpulled noodles-Noodles were solid but the broth was severely under seasoned and lacked any flavor. Most of the duck had gristle.

I will continue to watch for other reviews and may give it a second chance but at this point, VIP is DOA to me.
