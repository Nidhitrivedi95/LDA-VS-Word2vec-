bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg I recommend this as priority! What an experience! Staff is great, ambiance is great, and the food.... From the dim sum to dessert, everything was excellent! The menu is designed to order share-able plates, which is wonderful so you can try many things. My boyfriend and I ordered Pork belly bites and corned beef tongue from dim sum, then the braised goat, hanger steak noodles and short ribs on a biscuit and for dessert, their take on "DIRT", the boyfriend doesn't typically like dessert or sweets but he helped me clean that dish!!! With every bite we lite up! My boyfriend keeps repeating "I love that dinner" " That dinner was great" "That was such a great time"!! As a chef, I love going out to all these great restaurants in Pittsburgh and appreciating their charm, and this is one of the best.
