rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg YUCK! ick! ewwwww! would be how I'd describe my lunch at Sun Asian Kitchen. Whatever was served was albeit presentable but in terms of taste not good at all. I ordered the wonton soup and the Honey Chicken combo (comes with a chicken eggroll, and choice of fried rice, steamed rice or lo mein, brown rice is extra). The wonton soup had a weird taste to it, the broth was alright and the vegetables included in the soup canned. The Honey Chicken combo arrived shortly after, and it looked promising. And what goodness it seemed to offer ended after the first bite. I know how to cook fried rice, and yes, fried rice is made with day old rice but what I had was the rice at the bottom of the pan, there were hard bits to it that would stick to my teeth and there was no flavor to it, as for flavor, the honey chicken had nothing close to it being honey chicken, and the dish tasted off. It was a mess. I was hoping to at least enjoy the chicken minus the lackluster fried rice but the fried pieces of chicken was mostly batter and less chicken. And the sauce was just too sweet and thick that I really didn't know what I was eating hence I just stopped eating and considered my lunch a loss. =( I agree with a yelper that sun asian kitchen is a step above fast food but if I were to compare this tragedy with Panda Express, I'd take Panda over this hot mess. Overall my experience at Sun Asian Kitchen was bad sauce, and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone at all. I'm sorry Sun Asian Kitchen, you're a bad news bear. =(
