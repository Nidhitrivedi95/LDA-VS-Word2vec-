XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw Why 3 stars?

I was hoping for really good dumpling here since it's called dumpling king but the XLB has a weird sour taste to it... Maybe that's the style? But didn't enjoy it and I've tried a lot of XLB elsewhere.

Beef noodle soup - nothing specially, edible, meh.

Cumin lamb - this was really good! Without this dish maybe I would've given it a 2 star.

We had left over for the first 2 dishes and it wasn't really worth bringing home.
