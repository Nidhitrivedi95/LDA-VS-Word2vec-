For Americanized Chinese fast food, the bear has nothing on China One.(At least at this location, anyway) everything is made to order, hot off the wok, and the service is very quick, efficient, and they always check up on you if you needed a thousand more grains of rice, to make sure your meal is what you expected, or even refill your drink for you.

Dining in, they give you bigger portions, and they gave us egg drop soup, spring rolls, and wonton chips for the long wait. We shared the Beef Chow Fun and The Garlic Chicken. Looking for a quick hot meal that's filling? This is not a bad choice at all....ALOHA!!!
