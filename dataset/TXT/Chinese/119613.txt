Nvd7jbpKcFhpFlWOivEH6A Ordered general Tsao's chicken and wonton soup to go. I'm from New Hampshire so Chinese food is different but this is the best general tsao's chicken I've ever had.  Real chicken perfectly cooked and excellent fried rice.  However, the wonton soup was terrible.  The noodles were too thin and over cooked. Overall very good food, excellent service. I would definitely go back and would recommend to others
