r-4QibHfGYJFzbFUtoCMNw I just realized I hadn't updated this review. We've since been to Chez Ping at least another 3 times (again, because my in-law's like it and it's just conveniently located for them :)) and I truly believe they improved in the past year we lived in Montreal.  The steamed fish definitely improved. We even had our baby's 1-month celebration here and the service and food was great!

Perhaps management does read these reviews and work on making changes (at least I'd like to think so).
