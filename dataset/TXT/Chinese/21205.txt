Let's start with the amazing team. Jenny will remember your name and your preferences, take care of your order, and have a great conversation when she isn't busy with other guests. The kitchen team is hard working and the wait is never long. 

The chicken rice is the best I've had outside of Asia. Period. If you miss this food from the other side of the pacific, Vegas has it. I've also had their unique specials, like the chicken katsu sandwich which is superb! 

I will keep coming back. Support local. Support delicious. Thank you Flock and Fowl for setting a new standard in town!
