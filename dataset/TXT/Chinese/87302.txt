HTAAMVDZ4P0VX5F9euJBoA If you're a chilehead like me, then you MUST try this place. These people do spicy food RIGHT! I just got lunch and dinner here, and the Triple Delight I had for lunch ROCKED!  Beef, shrimp, and fish for $6.95  with rice, and soup. 

I had heard good things about this place for a while, and now I am kicking myself for not going sooner. This place is my goto Asian food place now. Try them out you'll not be disappointed.
