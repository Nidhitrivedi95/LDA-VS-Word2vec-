OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA Definitely lives up to their name of King noodle. I've ordered the roast duck noodle and it was very delicious. The duck and soup was really flavorful. The noodles weren't soggy or too hard. I also tried the beef tendon noodles and the tendons were very soft and flavorful. You also can't go wrong with the prices!  I would definitely come back!
