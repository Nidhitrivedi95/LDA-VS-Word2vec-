6sATfFam9_q9uod0I2aCsg I went there initially with a Groupon and I've gone back.   The food is great - at first you think you might not like anything, but then everything is subtly great.   The won-ton with sweet and sour sauce is simple but just great -- a really great homemade sauce.  The e-fu noodles are simple but great.  The soups (pumpkin/hot sour) are perfect...especially the hot and sour. Try some different things, its just creative food done well but with big portions - you get what you pay for.  Note: we went for dinner not dimsum, though would love to try the dim sum.

But what really is positive to me about the restaurant is the service.  They are really nice. Lisa, the manager, really tried to go out of her way to interact with our 3yr old.  They are kid friendly.  Overall I get this very mellow Buddhist vibe, and the patrons seem very much the same, the conversations are not loud or overly gregarious.

The interior is upscale with nice touches (huge chandelier) but still comfortable and spacious too.    It's a place you can go for a special occasion, with large group tables.
