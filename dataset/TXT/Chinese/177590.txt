wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA This is our new favorite restaurant! The food is amazing and inventive, the staff friendly, and the prices very reasonable. The chef changes the menu often which makes it even more appealing as the menu this month has some new offerings to it. If you like wings this is your go to restaurant. Twice fried, extra crispy, Japanese, Korean, and Thai influenced flavors with mild to medium intensity. The Octopus Escargot is amazing and the chef's asian influenced adaptation of a French classic. Brussel sprouts rounded out our meal and were sweet and crispy. They also have Japanese craft beers, a wide selection of sake, and a peach jelly sake which my wife loves. If you haven't tried this place, you are missing one of the local gems our city has! We can't wait to go back in the spring and see what new dishes the chef has created.
