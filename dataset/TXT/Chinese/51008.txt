chBeDQdaZgrb8iOzqgeCDA Awesome!!! My roommate and I got an orange chicken and a sesame chicken to split because we were afraid of the orange chicken being too spicy, but both were great! They also give you a TON of food. Its more like two servings, so this will be my lunch tomorrow too! We ordered delivery and our apartment has a kinda weird address so I gave them additional instructions and they delivered the food right to our door! It also didn't take the full 45 minutes like they said. It took more like 30, if that! Highly recommend and will order again soon or visit!
