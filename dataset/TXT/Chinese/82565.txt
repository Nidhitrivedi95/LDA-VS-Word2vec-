haeyExjSiJNENQKTxTmiPQ Amazing Chili Chicken on steam rice combo. My favourite!  You can order dry or with gravy.  You can even order with gravy with no hot peppers (for those that can't handle the hot 'n spicy!)  They give large portions and charge reasonably.  About $8.50 per combo meal.  Great place!
