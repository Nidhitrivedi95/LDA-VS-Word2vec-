CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Can I just start with the fact that I first got in line on Christmas Eve and didn't actually get to sit down till Christmas Day...

Craving food so late at night/early in the morning, I passed by Noodles and seeing that the line was so short, decided to wait it out.  Let me just say that the length of the line is deceiving.  Even though there was only 3 parties in front of me, I was in line for almost two hours...

I ordered the beef noodle soup and shui mai, and my friend ordered the BBQ pork rice. Because of the high prices I was expecting my food to be beautiful , but was not impressed with the plating at all.

The part that sucks the most is that the food was just mediocre.  It tasted just like any beef noodle soup I could get for 5 bucks in chinatown.  It's actually pretty likely that it was below mediocre, because food tastes better when I'm hungry and having skipped lunch and dinner I was starving.  The beef was so tough, perhaps they should of provided me a hammer along with my chopsticks to help me break down the meat.   

Another thing I'm going to add is that the water tasted so bad, it seems ridiculous that I'm complaining about the taste of water but my friend agreed that it left a strange unsettling aftertaste.   I was actually kinda pissed off because after looking at my glass I found that it was dirty.

The only good thing is that service is good, I definitely won't be coming again though.
