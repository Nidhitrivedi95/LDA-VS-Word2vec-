a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg Last night my hamburger was NOT good and that potato salad was just plain nasty AND my beer was NOT cold! I could have put that 20 bucks in a slot machine. I wanted bbq ribs but was told they didn't have any but as I was paying my check there were three orders under the heat lap for somebody's order. To sum it all up, l do not plan to return!
