Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Stopped in for sushi while we were in the Luxor.  Overall I'd say it was a very nice restaurant.  The decor and lighting were perfect, and it just seemed inviting.

I started off with a pot of green tea and some of the beef potstickers.  The postickers were delicious!  Next up was some sushi.  I ordered the tuna rolls as well as the "Wicked" rolls, which was like a spicy tuna roll with some other fish on top (I forget what it was).  The plain tuna rolls were kind of lame, I found the roll to be kind of rubbery.  It wasn't bad, just not that great.  The wicked rolls, on the other hand, were delicious.  Absolutely perfect.  I also had a bowl of the egg drop soup, which was excellent.

The waitress was very pleasant and the service was great.  Price wasn't too high considering it was Vegas.  I think tip included I paid something like $65.  If I was in the mood for sushi on that side of the strip, I'd definitely stop back in.
