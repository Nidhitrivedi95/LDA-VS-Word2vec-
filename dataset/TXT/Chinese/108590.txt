LjCrhp_Rys2bCIJHz5EGBA It's one of the cheapest all you can eat Chinese buffets in Phoenix and that is reflected in the food. I went here 3-4 times before I realized I'd rather pay a little more and get better quality. Anyone remember David Kwan's on Dunlap ? That was my favorite no thrills mom and pop Chinese buffet. 

Now the fried chicken at Golden Coin is legitimately good ! So good it saved them from a 0 star rating. It's the best item on the buffet. If you have to eat here, you could make a meal of that chicken with some rice and veggies.

But the fried rice is unremarkable. The low mein noodle have an off flavor, and too salty, it might be MSG, I don't know. One time, the noodles were really undercooked. The sweet and sour pork has a good sauce - thin not thick. But the pork they use is tough and low quality. You need to chew it for a long time. When the steamed vegetables are fresh, they're not bad. Hard to mess that up. 

When going for a cheap Chinese buffet meal, I'd rather spend an extra dollar or two. It goes a long way. Golden Nugget on 51st Ave/Indian School or May Garden on 59th are both so much better than Golden Coin. The extra $2 they charge buys a 200% increase in quality.
