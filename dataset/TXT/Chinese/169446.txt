vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q I've had dim sum in Hong Kong, so I know what dim sum should taste like. Cathay House is close, but no cigar. Their dim sum is just too greasy for my taste. I went there during lunch time and there were a lot of people there so I figured this place must be pretty good. I mean the food is not terrible. It just they are too greasy. Egg rolls I picked up from the cart (You can pick whatever you'd like off of the carts) were too greasy that I let them sit for about 5 minutes and what do you know, a lake of orangeish grease was formed in the bowl. Another thing I didn't like about this place is the service. Except for one lady who was extremely happy that I spoke a little mandarin (thank you) and was willing to help me, all the other staff either was rude or seemed very unhappy. I work at a restaurant so I know even if you are having the worst day of your life, you have to put on a smile when you are around customers. But anyways, overall this place was mediocre at best. Probably won't go back.
