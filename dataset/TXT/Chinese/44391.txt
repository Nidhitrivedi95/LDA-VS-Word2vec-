BJ9GwNMo8vIgSuKc6B_mOw meh, just another chinese restaurant. this one comes with an expensive price tag.

the venue is nice, great location (yorkville) and the service is good. but the food is pretty typical, nothing special. 

there are much better places in Richmond Hill, Chinatown and on Baldwin Street.
