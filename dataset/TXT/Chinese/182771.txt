XjmHPe0H91BlJ3gwJb7OiA I would have given it 3 stars since its truly nothing special but the decent/fair prices makes it slightly better minus the service here. 

My parents heard this place was decent. Either from friends, newspaper or ad on tv. The prices were decent as we ordered a 4 course meal with lobster for $58 ish dollars. We end up adding another dish. When we walked in I believe it was in the middle of "HK afternoon tea" so it didn't look very dinner like. The tea was in plastic cups versus the ceramic ones I'm used to. We were given the afternoon tea menu and my parents asked for the dinner menu. Yes we were eating dinner around 4:30pm as we all had an early day and exhausted. We decided on the ginger and onion lobster course dinner. It was decent. Came with sweet and sour pork chops, Bak Choy with garlic, and chicken. The standard is fried, but if you add $3 you can get the steamed chicken. The dishes were decently sized and good value. 

Service was mediocre. Typical Chinese restaurant service. However, during dinner the server was trying to swap our plates. She somehow knocks my dads tea all over his lap. Poor dad lol. She was sorry but no manager came by to apologize, no offer to take any discount off (again, typical Chinese restaurant). My dad was pretty upset and luckily we were almost done so we left abruptly. 

Will I be back? Probably not. 

Ps. I also didn't like that the bill says we must tip minimum 10%. Annoying!
