I was really hoping that I was going to love this place because it's very clean, the owners/servers are very nice, and the overall feel of the place is better than many of the other Chinese restaurants in the area.  But I found the broccoli chicken and Mongolian beef to be very bland; the flavors only slightly perked up the next day when I ate the leftovers.
