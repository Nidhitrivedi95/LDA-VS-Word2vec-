R7-3MCD6_RL_VxN65yCh2Q By far the absolute worst Chinese food my wife and I have ever eaten. Actually we could not eat it because of the rawness of the meat. Lemon Chicken was raw and the Teriyaki chicken wasn't even chicken. Both dishes smelled bad as well. We maybe had a half a bite of each dish and told them we couldn't eat it. Still charged us for the meals. We'll never go to this place again. GROSS!
