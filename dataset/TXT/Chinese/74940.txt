fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg We got there at 9:10 on a Saturday and they close at 10. They made sure to lock the doors by 9:15 so no one else could enter through the front.

The food was mediocre. I had a spicy noodle soup.

When we asked "how the Dim Sum service worked," our waiter replied "oh that stops at 9 but I guess I could go get the dim sum menu for you." (We decided not to get dim sum since this guy made us feel bad for even asking about it "so close" to closing time).

This might be weird, but personally I find that making your guests feel guilty about being there is not a GREAT service-tactic. 

I should've trusted the 3-star average rating they had before I got there.

Giving two stars is generous and it's only because 1 of the 3 people we interacted with was very nice while we were there.
