8ci0d-HKFK8MgHrf8kPF8g I have been a repeat customer for a few years now after a friend recommended. Absolutely love this place. The chicken lo mein is yummy, and their delivery is quick and the food arrives hot. Also, the prices are amazing for the large amount of food they give you. Never had any issue with the employees. A definite favorite of mine.
