nTc-Qj_-ABZrpM9YSpJ6jA Technically located inside an Asian market (but with their own store front--similar to Subways inside Wal-marts) this place serves up decent, Filipino munchies.

FILIPINO MUNCHIES
Although it doesn't taste like you've slipped into a Filipino family's kitchen and dined in secret on their creations, our desserts were still satisfying especially with the hot sun melting us outside. There was a slight chemical aftertaste in our selections--a small reminder this restaurant was in the business of making mass-produced, similar goodies in other locations. My Taho and our hot items didn't look very appealing in its disposable container--it looked like a rushed job of grabbing to-go containers from a birthday party.

GLANCING AROUND
Our cashier was very friendly, but with so many bodies dancing behind the counter, it was no surprise to witness some confusion in the interactions between the employees and the customers before and after my order. The dining area is very simple and plain--reminiscent of the old, old fast food places before they decided to upgrade.

I believe this place will stay busy from the mere belief most of its patrons are visiting Filipinos who want something somewhat reminiscent of home.
