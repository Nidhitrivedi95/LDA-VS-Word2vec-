TtaXPsMrTGyPsAlO5LFQ6w We are fans of this little local place - but we are not fans of buffets (just our own personal preference). 

We order off the menu and usually take it to go and we have never been disappointed.  I get the Buddhist Delight vegetables that comes with rice, their pork fried rice (which has always been very good) and a large wonton soup.  The food is so hot that even when we get it home we still have to let it sit for a few minutes!  I love that.

NIce lady that takes our order and keeps things running. We eat here whenever we are back in Mesa.
