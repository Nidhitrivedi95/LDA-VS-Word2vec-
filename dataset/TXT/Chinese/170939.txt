vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I was craving dim sum and it did seem like this was the highest rated place to go in Las Vegas. Unfortunately it was quite disappointing.

If you know of any better places for dim sum, please message me.

We arrived around 12pm and there was a bit of a long line.
Luckily, it is a longer wait for smaller tables. We had a large group, so we were taken in immediately. Since they had more larger tables that were open.

There are two separate rooms on each side of the front counter.

There were plenty of carts going around, and service was good.

Although it was annoying that the cart ladies kept stopping only on one side of the table, alienating everyone else.

But they did have a lot of options to choose from, and had all our favorite dishes.
But also unfortunately all the dishes that we assumed would be hard to mess up, were not great at all. Below standards for our taste. Probably a fast food dim sum place would taste better than what they were serving.

Quality was not amazing. Very mediocre.
