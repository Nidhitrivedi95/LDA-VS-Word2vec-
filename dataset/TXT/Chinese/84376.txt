The high roller ramen was delicious, garlicy, crunchy and flavourful from the Chinese sausage (lap cheung) but the management was super strict about the timeframe to serve the dish. Kinda snobby about it but whatever..

We also ordered:
Thai Apple Salad: 4/5 -second best dish after the ramen
Potstickers: 3/5 
Jackpot Chicken: 3/5 
Shrimp Laksa Toast: 2.5/5 - I usually enjoy laksa but this version didn't have a strong enough taste to my liking.
Killa Prawns: 3/5 
Schmaltzy rice: 3.5/5

It was kind of pricy for what it is, and some dishes are just 'okay'.
