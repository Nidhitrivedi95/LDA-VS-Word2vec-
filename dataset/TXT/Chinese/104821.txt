KqC7y46lAjWAksfKsWStWw We ordered General Tao, some veggies and rice using the Just Eat delivery service. Worst idea ever. It took over an hour and a half to get here, and the General Tao was soggy and flavourless upon arrival. The veggies were also pretty lacklustre. It's a shame because I've eaten there before and their lamb hot pot is actually really good. I wouldn't recommend taking out from this restaurant.
