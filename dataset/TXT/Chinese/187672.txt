yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Pho Kim Long deserves a four star rating!!!  It really hits the spot and never fails to fill your cravings because it's open 24hrs.  The convenience and price of the food is truly what makes up for my rating!!  I'd give it a 5, only sometimes the food isn't always consistent and service is just alright (although I don't expect much from a place with such inexpensive food).  

Anyway, the food I usually eat is pho tai with the steak on the side.  Squeeze in some lime and you're good to go.  I also really like the stir fried beef cubes with seasoned rice.  That dish is always on point.  The grilled pork chops is something I used to always get, but i've noticed that this dish is sometimes poorly prepared (undercooked) so i rarely ever get this anymore.  Spring rolls you can't really go wrong with and the egg rolls are pretty yum too.  That is the extent of my menu knowledge, but i have also tried the  mongolian beef, walnut prawns and some of their vermicelli dishes through my friends.  

One thing I always get here is the pineapple shake!! YUM!  I've tried their other shakes and noticed them to be a tad bit powdery or artificial tasting.  The pineapple and avocado shakes are the only ones made with milk and fresh fruit, i think, and that's how i like it!!! I'd def recommend you try it.
