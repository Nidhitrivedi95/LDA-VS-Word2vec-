4KHo1LnkM69RtWTDBdG16g Great late night food and dessert place. They provide wifi but its not that good. They serve herbal water so its not that its dirty.  They have hot and cold desserts, steamed rice, hot stone pot rice, hot pot rice, herbal stop, ramen, herbal tea, bubble tea, slushies, fried things etc. They have magazines readily available for both genders interest.  The bathrooma are only one stall though. If what you see on the menu iant exactly what you want you can ask them to add or subtract certain thinga. For what it is ita on a bit pricier side but they put the effort into prepping which you wont at home. Great place to sit snd chill long, they wont kick you out. Certain seats have oulets too for chargers or laptops.
