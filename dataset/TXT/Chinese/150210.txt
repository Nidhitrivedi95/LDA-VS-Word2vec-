The crawfish with cucumber(?) was what we got- can't remember the actual name but we easily had over a pound of crawfish. They're not in season so they were small and not the freshest, but the dish itself was a good combination of chilis, seafood, and veggies- the sauce was addictively spicy and delicious.

Would go back for one of their popular lamb dishes, but would choose to dine in. Though they can do takeout, it's not the best way to experience the cuisine. But hey, if you're in a crunch...
