cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw Noodle and Rice is an undiscovered gem.  We have an office nearby and have lunch here about twice a week.  We also have a son who lives in Tempe who loves red curry.  We entice him to visit  us on a weekly basis because he now will no longer order red curry anywhere else!  This is the real deal.  They use coconut milk, not watered down so it has the right consistency and he orders it Thai hot WITH Thai chilis.  He's a burn it to the ground guy and says he's never had it as hot anywhere else in town.  My husband is a fan of the bamee noodles (add beef, double shrimp) with a side of the best chow mein you've ever had to tone down the Thai hot way he orders it.   My standby is the Garlic Noodles, add shrimp and a little extra hot for an extra 2 bucks.  It makes 2 meals for me.  We always start with a chicken egg roll for a buck.  Best in town....they add a little hint of cinnamon that just sets it off.  I've also had the General Tao chicken and it is the best I've ever had.  Fresh and tender with light sauce.  Everything is cooked to order and FRESH FRESH FRESH!  I can't wait until the weather cools off because I have my eye on some of the soup bowl meals.
