ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw Cleary I am stuffed and can't get enough. Portion control is not easy for me here because the food is so good. I could honestly eat here every day. My neighborhood Pei Wei is a regular dining spot of mine. 

The setup for this location is different then other location because this is Pei Wei Asian Market. They have a concept similar to a to go Asian restaurant however it is the same great Pei Wei entree's and taste. My favorite is the Dan Dan Noodle Bowl or making my entrees into salads to substitute for rice. Got a gluten allergy no problem they have a gluten free menu. Kid friendly menu offered. 

Everyone at this location is super friendly. You can tell they enjoy their jobs and the atmosphere. This location is always clean I have never seen a dirty table nor have I ever had to wait for one. The only suggestion I have for this location is for to go. Every time i order a to go it is like they wait for me to get there to cook my order instead of having it ready by the promise time. Other then that every is perfect.
