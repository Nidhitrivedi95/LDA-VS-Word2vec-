eZQbDYQTZk0_cBroVxnPWg My absolute favorite Chinese food restaurant in Phoenix. I tend to stick with the Mongolian beef and crab rangoon, both of which are phenomenal. I have had other dishes here and have yet to not enjoy it. They are super convenient and are super punctual with their deliveries. A must try if you enjoy Chinese food.
