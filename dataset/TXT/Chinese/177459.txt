wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA So good!! We loved this place.  Please try it.  Staff was friendly also.  We tried several meats on a stick grilled, salt and pepper shrimp, crab fried rice ( our favorite), and bone marrow ( second favorite), and Thai wings.  Along w Brussels sprouts.  
We were glad to be able to try Japanese wagyu steak.  It's a pricier specialty meat.  It's $15 dollars for 1 ounce.  We realized it was too fatty for our taste but glad to pay a lesser amount for a sample of it!! We have seen this steak for $150.00 elsewhere and we're very curious to try it.
