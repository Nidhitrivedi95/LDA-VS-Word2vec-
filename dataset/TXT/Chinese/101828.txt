KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA I am so glad that I found this restaurant/bar. It is an excellent combination of East meets West. I was craving some good Indian food but also wanted to have a nice cocktail and that's not something g you can find at most Indian restaurants, but here they have a lot of selection and the drinks were really well made. The food was amazing and left me wanting more. I swear I'd try everything if I could. Also the service was great and our server made us feel welcome and relaxed  I'm excited to return and maybe even check out one of the dj or live music events.
