7U73RqIg6JA0WThxWUV3uA This Chinese restaurant is in a different league than most Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh and venture to say in the US.  Nice atmosphere, clean, ambiance but most importantly excellent food especially if you like regional Chinese spicy cuisines.  Try the Sichuan wonton, masterpiece, or the handmade dumplings from appetizers.  The ChongQuing spicy chicken is fried with red hot peppers, not dry, juicy and tasty.  My favorite chicken dish is the country style (Hunan)?with jalapeños, celery if  you like spicy.
Overall, excellent Chinese either authentic or Chinese American.
