UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ If you're lookin for a place that's smells like smoke and grease mixed together, than this is your mecca. I can't totally bash it here, the food is edible, but that's about where it stops. 
**On the upside**
I'm usually unimpressed by the person at the front who either has facial paralysis and therefor can't smile (in which case, please forgive me), or just really doesn't seem to give a crap about well, anything, but yesterday I went in to grab some food for my boss (who is always complaining it's too salty but still chows down on their grub regularly) and the guy behind the counter was really friendly.  He asked me if I wanted water while I waited (+ numero uno) and then gave me regular updates on the food (+ number dos). He was the saving grace of this restaurant. 

Now if they could just jazz up their drunken noodle we'd be in business.
