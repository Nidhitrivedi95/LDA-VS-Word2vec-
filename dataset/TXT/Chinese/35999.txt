ajkx7NWnjraj_uz20mdbhQ I only went to eat there because it was open after 10pm. Asked the waiter what soup was popular and he suggested the monk fish soup. (Didn't realize it was a whopping $16 as it was one of the most expensive soup on the menu,but that's my fault for not checking) However, the soup did not match up to the price. It had just a few measly pieces of fish and the consistency was overpowered by corn starch. The service was terrible and the server that cashed me out was super rude. I tipped 18% on the bill which also included my takeout. For a second, I thought I had done something wrong because he looked away and just rudely mumbled "OK" and threw the receipt at me and walked away. Nope, it was just him and his pompous attitude.
