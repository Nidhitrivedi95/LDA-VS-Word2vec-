NYMUlUYYEb3H0nKsauj-yw I only really tried this place because oishi bento was closed after a fire a few weeks back. This place was pretty disappointing. The rolls were flavorless. . . I couldn't even taste the rice, just the freezing cold cucumbers that they cram in everything. Even less delicious than the rolls was the sesame cold noodle appetizer which involved tough noodles with a few strands of shaved carrot and cucumber, some sesame seeds and a little solo cup of peanut butter. Not very good and even more hungry than I was when I got there :(
