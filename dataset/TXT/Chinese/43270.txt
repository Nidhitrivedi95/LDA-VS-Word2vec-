BevY0RqrIxHOgfd8l_UWSQ OMG is an upscale HK restaurant with plenty of western dish choices.  The quality of food is good, each dish was well made and presented well. I got the curry shrimp which was appropriately spicy with a good kick and crisp jumbo shrimps. It was delicious without being too overpowering. 

My group loved their individual dishes. The salted pork foot was a delightful surprise, the whole table enjoyed the crispy skin and the tender meat. The meat was a little too salty for my taste but the whole dish got licked clean so I assume it was good. For those who don't like such strong flavors, the smoked salmon pasta seemed like a good choice.
