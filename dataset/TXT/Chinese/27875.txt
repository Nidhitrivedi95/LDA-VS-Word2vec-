8FUzCm4Q13MJMX7N6ftmQw I've only been in Vegas for about 6 months and I have been struggling to find a good Chinese food place. I found this place from a mailer I received and I definitely think I have found my place!

I have been here several times and a big deal for me when it comes to Chinese food is consistency and this place rocks!  Their individual dinner is an awesome deal as it comes with an entree, rice or noddles, an a soup choice!  I almost always get their pot stickers and they are killer!  

Portion sizes are good and the girls that run the front counter are always real nice. 

I would definitely recommend!
