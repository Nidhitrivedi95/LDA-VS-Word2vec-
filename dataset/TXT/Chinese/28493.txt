8MXjK1lhVRhU3yGCUv9qsA Taiwanese snack.  Tried pork mean Bao, the pork is tender and soft, but flavour is light and not as flavour as what I normally had in Taiwan.  It'd better if they add more groundnuts, and average spicy is not hot at all.  Bao texture is also not quite right, it's alright but not as great as I thought.  It's fast food joint so they take and prepare the order quick.  As for the price, it's really not cheap considering how small each bao is, one probably gets better, cheaper options for snack meals in bakery stores Chinatown.  Haven't had chance to try their dim sum, maybe in the future when opportunity arises I'd give it a try.
