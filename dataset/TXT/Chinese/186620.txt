YBIhTjmEH3IEZW4Dr5ReRA This is our 3rd visit since we found this hidden gem recently, thanks to YELP reviewers!! Tonight, 3 of us shared crab puff appetizer, Orange Chicken & Happy Family entrees. The crab puffs are generously filled and are so flavorful! The entree portions are large and also very flavorful.  The Orange Chicken has a lil kick and the chicken was tender.  Happy family was a favorite too...The veggies weren't overcooked, nice!! The portions were large enough that we left full AND had left-overs!! The staff is always very welcoming, friendly and attentive.
