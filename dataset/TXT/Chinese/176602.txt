Wqa1JjkSuviehZ7OedhPeA My family and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time. 

We finally checked this place out and are quite disappointed. Although authentic, the flour wrap was quite thick compared to numerous other places we've tried. The duck wasn't very greasy, but they also didn't slice very much Peking duck, which was surprising for us. I'd say its about 2/3 of what you'd expect from most Chinese restaurants. We had the remaining of the duck put into a soup, which was a lightly flavoured, but not spectacular.

The eggplant dish was pretty tasty, but a bit on the oily side. Nothing has beaten the ones I've had in China.

The Walnut chicken is tasty, but again, a bit on the oil side and had few walnuts in it. Has some minor spiciness, but probably my favourite of all the dishes I had.

The service was good and attentive. If you call to make a reservation, you might not get seats on the same day, so it's better to show up.
We had the egg dipped sweet potato fries too. A bit sweet for me, but good if you like sweet  deep fried things.

Overall, I wouldn't come back for Peking duck but the service was decent and broth was OK.

I won't be returning here.
