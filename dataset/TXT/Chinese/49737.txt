CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Saltiest (and most expensive) noodles ever!

For a whopping $13, I got the equivalent of a bowl of noodles that would've cost $4 at a normal noodle shop.  I asked for udon noodles with my Cantonese Dumpling noodles.  Instead, I got egg noodles.  Which was fine, since egg noodles were probably the better choice for a noodle soup with dumplings.  However, I must've downed a whole pitcher of water by the time I was through with the noodles. 

So, one star for the price, messing up my order, and the saltiness that was pervasive in all of their noodle soups.
