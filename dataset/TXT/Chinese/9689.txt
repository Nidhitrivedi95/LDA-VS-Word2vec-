1uPQTz5XZSWr0ti7kUpaDw Excellent dumplings!  Stumbled across this place in the China Town district of Montreal.  Highly recommend if you are looking for outstanding dumplings.  Nothing else to this place...no ambience, no alcohol, no other food worth tasting....but wow, their dumplings (of all kinds) were spectacular.  

Service was very good.  

Best were the shrimp, egg and leek steamed dumplings...but also strongly suggest the lamb and the beef.  Outstanding!
