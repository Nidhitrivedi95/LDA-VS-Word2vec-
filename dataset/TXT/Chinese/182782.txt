XjmHPe0H91BlJ3gwJb7OiA I have been back to Ocean Seafood Restaurant a few more times since my last review..

lunch, afternoon tea and dinner

Though the price here is cheap, the quality matches that too.

My last dinner experience was just horrible. Both the dishes were beyond bad! The fish fillet has this thick soggy batter and the snow pea shoots was old and rough.

Meh... not going to be back for awhile.....
