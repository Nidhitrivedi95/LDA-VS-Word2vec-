pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA This place is SOOO good!!!
When we first walked in, the decor is super pretty. Place looks really trendy and it was packed on a Wednesday night. Ambience is very hip and is perfect for a date night or girls night out.

DRINKS
NINA FRESA - our server recommended this drink and its super yummy! its a vodka cocktail drink with strawberries and guava.

FOOD
SALMON SEVICHE - excellent seviche... the sauce has a tangy pineapple taste mixed with a little bit of spice because of the jalapenos. really good appetizer.

BERKSHIRE PORK BELLY ROBATA - i think this is the best out of everything that we ordered. the pork belly is super fatty on the outside (but in a good way) and just melts in your mouth. it has a sweet/salty glaze on top of the meat. this dish is just amazing. i highly recommend this dish.

LAMB CHOP ROBATA - good dish but since they served it with the pork belly, this dish was overshadowed.

BOBO BRAZIL - not your typical sushi roll because they put seared beef on top! this roll is super good though!!! i really recommend this one too.

SAMBA STRIP ROLL - out of all the dishes that we had, i was least impressed with this roll. i ordered it because of the maine lobster but the portion is super small and the taste is bland compared to the price ($19.00). if you really wanna try this dish, i suggest you skip the sauce because it overpowers the maine lobster.

Service is okay and I notice the waitress did not course our meals... Refill on drinks is also a bit slow.
However, I would definitely go back to this place if ever I'm back in Las Vegas. :)
