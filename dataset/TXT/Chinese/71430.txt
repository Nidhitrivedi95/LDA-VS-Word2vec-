fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A I'll update my review tomorrow when I actually eat here, but for anyone wanting dim sum, don't bother coming after 3p (at least in a weekday) because they don't serve it then. Why have dim sum in the name of the restaurant if it's only served limited hours? And only lunch, at that.
