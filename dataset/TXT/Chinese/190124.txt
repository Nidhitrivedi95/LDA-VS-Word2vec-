Comments
- this place was empty on a Sunday morning at prime dim sum time (10am).  That speaks alot for a restaurant that is in prime location.
- food was mediocre 
     - Chiu Chow Dumplings had a really thick dumpling wrapper
     - Beef tendon came out just warm, wasn't braised long enough so it was still kind of hard. 
- they need to stop duck-taping the carpet to the floor, because it looks disgusting with dirty stuck to the peeling edges of the tape. 

if i remember correctly, prices as follows for dim sum

S - $2.7
M - $3.7
L  - $4.7
XL - $x (can't recall this one)
