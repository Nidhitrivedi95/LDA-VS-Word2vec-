NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ Service was unattentive. It took forever to get someone's attention but they are respectful and courteous when taking down orders at the very least!

Oolong tea is my go-to! I ordered the 913 Ginseng Milk Tea (Hot) to change it up, and I didn't taste any strong ginseng flavour but it still tasted relatively smooth, but not creamy

Pork floss on toast - extremely dry and toast wasn't toasted

Taiwanese fried pork - delish!

Mango shaved ice - flavour is spot on if you don't mind frozen mango chunks! It's alright even though the ice isn't shaved as fine as some other places

Fried popcorn chicken = comes with a delicious mayo. I like the pork better though!

There's a large variety of options to choose from, though I'd stick with the fried food and milky drinks
