2nQ2_o5pPUMByU86bDjOeg By far the worst Thai food I have ever eaten. I'm not entirely sure why a Chinese takeaway would try to do Thai as the food is vastly different, so my fault for ordering it I guess. 
 I can't even begin to tell you how horrific the food was. I knew I might be in trouble the moment I opened the container of King Prawn Tom Yom soup. It was an alarming shade of orange and had a layer of oil floating on top. I can only describe it as a bowl of oil with roughly 3 prawns and half a bottle of fish sauce thrown in, (and possibly some red/orange food colouring). It was so salty I could only take a few spoonsful then go drink a pint of water.
The Thai Veg Green Curry was equally disappointing. Not necessarily as disgusting as the soup, but it lacked any kind of sauce and consisited mainly of green peppers. Now, I'm no world traveller, but I do have a Thai friend who owns her own shop so I'm pretty sure that Thailand has more vegetables to offer than green peppers. Plus, what little sauce there was tasted mainly of a can of coconut milk. None of the wonderful balance of flavours Thai food is known for.
Next. Fish Cakes. Again, the alarming orange/red colour blinded me when I opened the container. They were wierd little hockey pucks that tasted like something that was scraped off the floor of a fishmongers and had the consistancy of rubber.
Last: The Chili Dipping Sauce was a tub of vinegar with a few green chili slices thrown in for effect.
I've never written a review of a restaurant before, so forgive me for going on about this, but seriously, this place is really really awful.
Lesson learned. If you want Thai food, go to a proper Thai restaurant.
