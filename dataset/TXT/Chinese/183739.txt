I've been here twice and the entrees have been good. I have no complaints about service; the last time I went a mistake on our bill was quickly fixed with a smile by the server who made the error.  Although this isn't the first spot that will come to mind if I want to take friends out for Chinese food, it's someplace I would return to for my lunch break if I have a few extra dollars.
