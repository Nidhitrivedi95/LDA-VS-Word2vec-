kLiMrnkcV_dfVpejfRlhSg Reading below's review i thought WOW did i write that! 

Ended up here twice this week after a late night out the first was a friends idea the second was last night after Maro club and was my idea.

WHY would i go here again - well the food taste pretty good when its 3am and the portions are generous for a great price.

I have had a chicken curry and a beef and giner both on rice and they were both $5.50 on the menu! 

The service is quick, the food comes out very quick also and although it may not be the best food in the world for a place which is open so late and for good value then I would give it 3 stars.

I mean its either this or street meat right since fish and chips does not exist anywhere or decent kebab.
