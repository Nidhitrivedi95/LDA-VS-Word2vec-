hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Oh man, I ask myself "is this queasy feeling in my stomach going to last all night?" Terrible idea to come here, I should have waited the three minutes for a table at Ramen Bar. I walk in to Everyday Noodles and first my nose is telling me it wants me to turn back out the door. I know your nose is supposed to adjust to smells pretty fast so I decided to push past the signal my nostrils were sending to my brain. I settled on sesame noodles with chicken, my boyfriend was extremely daring and tried the braised beef noodle soup. There were many times we shared a romantic moment staring into each others' eyes, trying not to regurgitate the food back into our bowls, all while enjoying the rhythmic sounds of noodles being banged against the steel countertops.
