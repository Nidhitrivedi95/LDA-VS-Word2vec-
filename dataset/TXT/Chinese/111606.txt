M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g I cam for lunch to search for good char siu BBQ pork.  I had the lunch platter which came with a choice of 2 (BBQ pork, roast pork, roast duck), a few big clumps of bok choy, and some rice.  This came to about $10.  The portion size was actually pretty solid with about 8 pieces of each meat.  The duck was very well cooked and flavored.  The char siu was a little sweeter than I was hoping but still good.  Overall, a nice lunch spot at a good price.  The restaurant looks like it's catering to a more upscale environment but the prices are lower than you'd expect from the interior.  Hopefully people can find Taste in the area that is already heavy on good Asian food, more leaning towards the Japanese and Korean variety.  But in all a tasty and affordable lunch if you're in the area and want to change it up a bit from the typical salad and sandwiches.
