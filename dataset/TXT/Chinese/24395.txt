6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag By Vegas standards, China Mama is pretty decent because Shanghainese and Taiwanese options are limited here, but if comparing to LA, this food is pretty substandard and shitty. Since I last visited, China Mama received a nice interior renovation. There's now an open view of the kitchen behind a glass pane and the walls were given a fresh coat of paint. 

However, the food has stayed, more or less, the same and the service was poor as one might expect. On this visit, the xiao long baos were completely overcooked with a dry, exterior skin and devoid of any soup within. In fact, the pan fried pork buns were much juicier by comparison. I did remember the last time that I came here, the mama's special pan combo and beef rolls were worth splitting if you had a larger group to share with. The food is overpriced for what you get, but until Mama Lu's Dumpling House opens a Las Vegas franchise, you're kind of stuck with the China Mama's brand of lackluster food, service, and prices that leaves much to be desired.
