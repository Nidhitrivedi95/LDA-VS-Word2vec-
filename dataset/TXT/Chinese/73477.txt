fjE-jiwnTQysz-rLl6YMQg One of the few places I miss in Pittsburgh ! The portions are generous, the prices are right, and the service is outstanding ! My favorites were the General Tso's, the Amazing chicken and the orange chicken !  All are spicy, but not over the top, heat for heat's sake, but a flavorful heat ! Totally worth the trip to Dormont
