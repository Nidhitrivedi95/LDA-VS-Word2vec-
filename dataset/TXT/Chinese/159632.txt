U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ We have frequented Pho Chandler since it opened. I love the bun thit nuonh cha gio. They put a large serving of vegetables. This is my go to spot for "bun" with less noodles and more veggies. Their green beans are very tasty. Their combination rice plate is delicious. Their pho is okay.
