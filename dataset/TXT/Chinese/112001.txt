MDeqp3L79cq3h11_nW5umw this is my favorite T&T! Even more so than the flagship store in Markham. I love the adorable Russian man at the deli counter and I like that the deli counter has a great selection and it almost feels like a European deli store. 

I adore the prepared foods section for its fried shrimp and fried smelt. I also enjoy (very much) the deals at the end of the day (buy 3 get 1 free).

They have decent store sushi if you need a quick fix, nothing fancy but always fresh and curbs the craving. 

At the end of the day they put all the prepared foods into containers and sell them at a cheaper price, and the meat too!! Pork, marinated and soft and delicious, along with rice, noodles, seafood with veggies, fried rice with shrimp and cheese (!!!).

Unlike the Markham store, they have cold food (marinated pig ears, seaweed salad, beef tripe with chilies) at a self serve table so you don't have to bother the nice lady to pack you a container. 

Veggies are fresh, there are sales all the time, fish is on sale every week - grab a flier and head to this heavenly piece of Asia in Richmond Hill. You will NOT be disappoined. There are huge lines on weekends though - fair warning.
