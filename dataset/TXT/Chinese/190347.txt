YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g My fiancé and I went to Luckee today and I can't say I loved it. The reason for my visit was the article on BlogTO advising that the restaurant had excellent options for people on gluten free diet. I got very excited and decided to go there. I checked the menu and looked like that they have some nice dim sum options. I called Luckee to confirm that they carry gluten free dim sum. The lady on the phone told me that they indeed have gluten free options and a server will explain their gluten free items. 

I went there and there were literally two gluten free dishes they could make for me. The menu also looked very different from the menu on their website. It was much smaller. My fiancé ordered regular dim sum and an entree. The portions were so tiny, but he seemed to like the food. My dim sum took a while and I thought oh wow they must be making the gluten free flour/dim sum from scratch. 

When my food came I saw shrimp and chicken in cabbage leaves. They tasted okayish but I was pretty disappointed, especially given that I got 6 small cabbage leaves for $20. I was really expecting some nice dim sum and nice gluten free dough.

The place is very pretty but the portion sizes are quite small. I didn't eat non gluten dishes so it's hard for me to comment on all food in the restaurant. My bill was very expensive too. We were not full at all and went elsewhere for more food.
