zkU-WMio8g6dpRJ2Y2xqvQ One of my favourite dim sum joints! Quality of food is always top notch and food comes out fairly quick. Recommended dishes: siu mai, beef rice roll and baked BBQ bun (sweets section-pineapple baked with BBQ inside). This joint is a bit on the pricey side for dim sum but worth it! There is limited parking however there is an underground parking lot.
