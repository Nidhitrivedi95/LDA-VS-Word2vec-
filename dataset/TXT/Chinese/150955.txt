SxjNgkzAlUG-wt2rSbc2HQ Ordered food 1 hour 45 minutes ago and it is still not here ... I could have driven to the grocery store, bought ingredients and started a Chinese restaurant in my kitchen and been eating some chicken balls by now ... did I mention I live 1.4 kilometres from this establishment lol called them three times and every time it was ten more minutes but we need to pay full price  food is good but not good enough for a 1 hour 44 minute wait
