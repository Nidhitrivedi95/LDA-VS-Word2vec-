S9CrHJJnns3cqdGca7mQWQ Found this place and been coming since they opened. Good food nice people. You get a lot of food for the price. They stuff the containers full. I even have enough for lunch the next day.
I recommend Chopstix for replacement of fast food. It's the same price and much tastier in my opinion.
