_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Finally had a chance to try this restaurant after my family and friends rant and rave about how amazing it was. I had huge expectations of this place! Got there and it was packed! You have to make reservations a week in advance.  Decor was your typical Chinese restaurant. Nothing special. I did noticed all the tables ordered very similar things. I went with my 2 aunts and my grandparents, so 5 of us. We ordered the dinner for 4. It was a lot of food. The dinner for four I say can feed 7-8 people. We have 4 boxes to take home after.  The dinner for four came with the black herbal chicken soup of the day( which is supposed to be good for you) or corn soup.  Also came with 6 lbs lobster Hong Kong style lightly batter and friend with friend onions on the side. Also came with king crab served 3 ways - crab legs fried with garlic Hong Kong style, then steamed crab legs with salty eggs and crab meat friend rice with the crab shell. Also a side order of snow peas tips in goju berry stir fried.  For dessert there was black sesame pudding. All in all the service was ok like your typical Chinese restaurant. Cash or debit only.  No credit cards.  There's a 10% service charge automatically tacked onto the bill.  Food after awhile tasted salty. I noticed the lobster due to the large size tasty rubbery and chewy.  I'm not sure I can eat this meal all the time but I'm glad I tried it to get it out of my system. I thought for the amount of seafood you get the price was reasonable.  I've had better seafood elsewhere.
