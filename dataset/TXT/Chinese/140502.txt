R7-3MCD6_RL_VxN65yCh2Q One of my most favorite spots.  Love this place and their lunch specials cannot be beat. They have the best sizzling rice soup in AZ.  I am from Cali and this is the only place that does it well so far in Az. The sesame chicken and shrimp chow mein are family favorites. They are our go to Chinese place.  If you are looking for ambiance though not really so much. But the food makes up for it a hundred fold. Now I want it for dinner. Plus the servers and staff are sooooo nice!!!!!
