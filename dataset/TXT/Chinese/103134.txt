KK7H1bVOMAJnDqMhBv2zpA I give 10/10 

We have been their loyal customers for more than 14 years. It cost us about 90 km back and forth trip, but it all worth it. Their main highlights are Dry Chilli Chiken, Chilli Fish, Hot and Sour Soup, Vegetable Chow Mein, Schezuwan Fried Rice, Vegetable Fried Rice, Shrimp Pakora   and the list goes on and on. I can't complain about anything. The food is just soooooooooooo yummy. You actually get confused what to order and what not. The owner husband and wife both are very humble .  word of caution: Ask for low sodium/ be like I want less salt  in everything.   I have been their customer for 14 years and I am telling you this for a reason.  Good luck you would not regret going there and spending your buck.
