zXR-C_clfbCksI0cIDrl4g You can't go wrong with this place if you're looking for super fast, mid-quality Chinese food. I come here around once a week and it's always on point. They never mess up an order, it's always made fresh, and always made fast!! My favorite items as of late are the lettuce wrap appetizer (no mushroom or onion), the bbq pork appetizer, and Kung pao chicken!!  Yum!!
