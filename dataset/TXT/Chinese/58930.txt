dHJ4PT5C9mr6QPs4o_DaSA The food at Golden Dragon is awfully good. The prices are even better.  They serve both Chinese and Japanese cuisine in two separate and distinct menus.  The options for food are mind boggling at times.  There is a sushi chef at the bar from open until close who knows how to serve up some pretty respectable fish.  
What makes Golden really stand out is the wait staff.  The cooks, servers, and management (which tend to double up on jobs) are very friendly and engage you in conversation, which I found gave the restaurant a "homey" feel.  The dining area is very large and nicely decorated, with flowing fountains and a very nice koi pond.  What is surprises me the most is how empty the place seems to be at any hour.  I never have to wait for a table, and even with four or five other parties, the place feels large and can fit many more.
I will continue to eat at Golden Dragon, though they may not be the best out there, you certainly can feel and taste they try their hardest to be.
