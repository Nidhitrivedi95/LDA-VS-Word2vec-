uU8up3hGwW9qnzQD1HZsMQ Really bad Chinese food. First off, the guy answering the phone could barely understand me so I had to repeat my order and my address many times. I almost gave up and hung up the phone. 

Secondly, the food took close to an hour to arrive. When it did, it looked poorly cooked and non-appetizing. The general taos chicken was bathing in bright red sauce that looked and tasted like syrup watered down with red food coloring. Never again!
