RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ It's a shame that a neighborhood with so many restaurants is held hostage to this restaurant group.  Rose Tea Cafe in itself provides, poor, rushed service, rude management, and the food has consistently gone down hill.  The same problem is evident in their sister restaurants, Sun Penang and Ramen Bar.  Perhaps they should consider focusing on doing one restaurant well, instead of three poorly. Squirrel Hill deserves better!
