a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg This is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley because I will travel from Prescott for their delicious food. I'm NEVER disappointed, because they are consistent. I have probably had everything on the menu since I've been going for the last 4 years. If you want REAL authentic Chinese food. This is your place!
