lmfyEVKm3CDGWg18LeRhgA Yikes!  This place was not what I expected after reviewing the previous Yelps.  My mom and I went there for the lunch buffet for $9.99.  Perhaps that was the mistake?  The buffet runs until 2:00 and we arrived around 1:00.  We should have turned around and left immediately when we noted only four people in the entire restaurant.  The food on the line was obviously the same stuff they put out at 11am.  The pad thai was forgettable which is what I had my mouth set on and the chicken panang had no chicken that I could find.  The wonton salad was good except for the limp, soggy, saturated wonton strips....so- I guess just the salad was good.  The chicken wings were great except there were only a couple of lonely wings to sample and they were not refilled even when a few new brave people straggled in.  

The service was near non-existant.  It was their lunch time too, I guess because they were all sitting in a booth off to the side eating.  We received our drinks when we were seated, and after that only once more when we asked when they finally provided the bill.  We used another non-bussed table to put our used dishes on after realizing that they were more than happy to let the dirty dishes sit on our table during our meal.  

I don't know, maybe it's worth going there for dinner?  I won't be finding out.
