ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg Nested in a little shopping mall of sorts, I was pleasantly surprised that this dim sum place was open so late (we arrived close to midnight on the way back from Cedar Point). Ordered a couple dim sum dishes since the carts obviously were not out and about this late at night and as such, there was no one in the restaurant other than us. Surprised how quickly the order came as most dim sum places I've been to before tend to struggle with made-to-order outside of dim sum cart hours. I will say that the dim sum here is pretty good, not the best I've had, but definitely good enough to be considered relatively authentic. Dumplings, eggplant, shu mai, you name it, there's a decent list of dim sum options, at least from what I can remember when taking a cursory look at the menu. Would definitely come here the next time I'm in the area, although I certainly would be open to trying some of the others that local folk have said are good, too. As it's in a small shopping area, parking tends to be limited so do keep that in mind when coming during weekends, when it tends to be more busy.
