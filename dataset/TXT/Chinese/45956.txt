BsyNabKZJOVIHWmwUghreg Next time I'm in Toronto, I will definitely come here!

So, I'm visiting and my friend who's hosting me suggested we get Thai. I didn't realize just how awesome it was going to be. We went for a mid afternoon lunch on a Friday and there was a good crowd but still plenty of seating. The food was quite nomtastic and I was pleased to take home the rest of my huge portion to eat later (and yes, it reheats well!). I had one of the specials which was quite a deal given the awesome amount of awesome food you got!
