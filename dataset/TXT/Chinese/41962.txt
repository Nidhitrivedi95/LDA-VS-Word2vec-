BaEwrpEQyWDOOuAzu0q6Zw Sushi on the buffet looked like it was left out for hours. No signs to tell you which sushi roll was what and nobody around to ask questions to. Most of the chicken didn't have good flavor and it was overall just a complete disappointment. They did have a large variety of food options available though. Will not be going back.
