WfgupKdYx1h0mKBmOmNQ3g I ordered Terryaki chicken and Chinese vegetables. My food was delivered fairly quickly via Grubhub, but the food is a complete disappointment.  My supposed Terryaki chicken, which is supposed to be grilled, is bland and 100% not grilled. The meat looks and tastes like it was boiled on water with zero seasoning. The Chinese vegetables were only just a tiny bit tastier than the chicken disaster, and the fried rice tasted like scrambled eggs with a touch of salt - I don't even know HOW they managed to do that! I'm super upset, and I feel like I wasted my money. This food is horrible, and clearly they'll never get another dime from me!
