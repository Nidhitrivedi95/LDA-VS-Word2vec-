aHVhlCvmlNnnPf-LgclNNA As Sal G. said, finding the Sesame Inn is a little tricky inside the glorified  mall that is Station Square. Hint: It's up on the seldom-traveled 2nd floor, so climb the steps and keep walking along the balcony until you see it.  Or...just ask somebody who works there...like we did. 

I rather liked this stately, serene Chinese restaurant that Kay and I came to for a pre-concert dinner (Dream Theater and Trivium at the Trib Total Media Amphitheatre. Other metallions obviously had the same idea.).

I really was at a loss as to what to order, so I went with Lamb Hunan; a mildly spicy yet sweet dish loaded with a hodgepodge of fresh vegetables and protein. The lamb was just a wee bit gummy, but other than that I did enjoy the generous helping and the fluffy white rice that came with it. 


Kay has a knack for ordering things I almost ordered and making me envious over it. 

Honey Moon Duck: What I almost ordered. 

See my review for Root 174. Look it up. I'll wait.

Yeah, Kay scooped me yet again. Not only was this a similar scenario, but the boneless duck had the same crispy, moist, fall-to-pieces quality that Root 174's pork-fat-cooked-pork shank had and was so artistically plated, Kay was tempted to put the root-vegetable "flower" garnish in her hair for the brisk, magnetic, prog-metal evening.

Our appetizer consisted of an exceptionally gratifying sextet of boiled pork dumplings. Served with a refreshingly tart soy ginger dipping sauce, each potsticker was a supple, richly meaty joy in both wrapper and filling. Voluminous, velutinous, victorious. 

Sesame Inn has a very limited dessert menu, but due to the large portions, we were too full to partake. Give Sesame Inn a whirl for they are a reasonable, tony dining option if you find yourself in or around Station Square for whatever reason.
