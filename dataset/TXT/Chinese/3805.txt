_mkObKf2FTg4pRcCFZBf4w As all Yelpers mentioned, it used to be 'Panda Buffet', not like it was any better. Both these buffets are not as expensive as most buffets, but also their selection is limited and very rarely refills. We went on a Sunday, as we came in around 8pm, its maybe one quarter filled restaurant.

We had 5 ppl, so business was picking up a bit, but the food on most station seems low in quantity unless we asked for it to be refilled. Interesting note on their door as you are coming in, stating on Saturday, they have 'Lobster, Crab Legs, and Oysters'...Sounds nice too, but maybe limited supply per person.

Lucky for us, there was crab legs, but limited again. They have fried shrimp, fried calamari, barbecue pork, some veggie, two soups, noodles, and a bit of sushi (don't eat it), chicken wings, simple veggie fried rice. 

Funny thing is I'd ask for the refill on crab legs, and this lady in the back would put a new batch, but its limited, really only enough to fill one plate full if you just ate that alone... My friend asked for water, and the server brought us the bill (one bill with service charge of 10%). I thought usually it only applies to 6 or more ppl, but its not that significant, so its fine... Server being not busy, but not really proactive in clearing plates from tables...

This is a place to definitely avoid, unless you're okay with spending under $17 pp and having limited quantity amount to fill yourself up on.
