FEWTPBUv-QiugBe-2uXD4A Good food, nice and hot wonton soup for a cold night. Orange chicken for me, sesame chicken for him, specials w/spring rolls, and lots of rice too much for me. Just right amnt of spice in orange chicken. Most of the business was take out, we stayed, clean dining area, tv with silly game show. Only problem was when the door opened and the cold came in. Staff stopped by the table to make sure all was good.
I would return when in the mood for asian cuisine, and in the neighborhood.
