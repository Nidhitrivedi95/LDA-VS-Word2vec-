15RvAvPxUBl3HmnGMJdtTQ Stopped in for lunch with a work colleague as this was close to his office. We split a yellow tail-jalapeno appetizer which for $10 came with only six pieces. It was nice that the jalapenos were spicy for once but it was a rather small appetizer compared to what I have had before.

I also had a miso soup, which was a bit on the sweet side, and a seaweed salad which was larger than normal.

I also had a yellow tail/scallion roll and a Inferno roll. Both had a bit too much rice but were fresh. The Inferno roll was quite good since it was also spicy.

Service was a bit spotty since our waitress did not speak very good English and brought out items at different times then we requested.
