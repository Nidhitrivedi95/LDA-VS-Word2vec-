J7rkQISD48jXgdM6UxNAbw Been going here for about 18 years. I always get the all white meat chicken teriyaki. There isn't another place like it around. Their sauce is perfect. Great lunch spot. Family owned and very friendly. They love to get to know you and make you feel like family. I've brought many coworkers here and they all love it.
