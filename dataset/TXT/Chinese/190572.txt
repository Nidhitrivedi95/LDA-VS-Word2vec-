yKuAM6kL5sSKtfoe9a3GpQ The $5.99 daily lunch specials, including soda (no refills!) are incredibly cheap and they don't cut back on portions, either.  I've only eaten lunch here, but the General Tso's chicken was great.  My friend had the Thai green curry beef with rice, and I had a little of that, and it was great, too.  Odd to see the flag of the PRC & a big picture of Mao staring down at you in front, and at first it looked like a "let's-create-a-Chinesey-looking-place-for-non-Asians," but most of the customers inside were Asian (look, I'm white myself, but if I see a Chinese restaurant with mostly white people, I'll stay away...)  The staff are very young, friendly, and enthusiastic & also work at the Korean restaurant attached (which shares the same kitchen.)  Would absolutely go there again next time I'm in Toronto.

(The Yelp map also looks a little off...it's in between Dundas & College on Yonge, not north of Bloor...)
