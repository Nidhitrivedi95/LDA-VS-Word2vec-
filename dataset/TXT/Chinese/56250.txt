CZK8pOfcrG7QhhZTfeis8g Don't be fooled by the fancy décor of the place and the live seafood at the front of the restaurant.  This restaurant may look appear to be a high class establishment, but their service and attitude are worse than any fast food place I have been to.  We were a party of 8 people on a Sunday night.  We placed our order at 6:50 pm.  After half an hour we asked three different servers to check on our order. We had to ask three different people because the first two did not come back to us with an answer.  The manager explained that our order had not reached the chef yet as there were several larger tables that ordered the set menu (more expensive) ahead of us.  

We asked to have the rice served immediately as there were hungry children at the table that needed to eat.  Well that didn't happen either, and the first dish came out at 7:50 pm exactly ONE HOUR LATER. In summary, a flimsy excuse and no action taken.

Given that this was a service issue, our tip reflected this.  Our waiter had the nerve to tell us that the tip was not sufficient.  REALLY???? Apparently the concept of tipping based on service has eluded this place and clearly, this guy knows no shame.

There are so many good Chinese restaurants out there, the food here was average.  Bypass this place and spend your money elsewhere.
