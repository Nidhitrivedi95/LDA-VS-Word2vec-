yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I'm leaning more towards a 3-Star rating, but the pho itself is so good that it deserves an extra star. I've been eating here for years, and there has been a steady decline in customer service. We hadn't visited for several months because the restaurant had become so popular that wait times were too long. Last night (Friday) at 7 pm, more than half of the tables were available. Yet, our server kept rushing to and from our table without so much as eye contact. And I noticed all of the other servers treating the other patrons the same way.

We ordered our favorite app, calamari. It was so over-breaded it was almost comical. A lot of the bites I took didn't even have squid in it.

But onto the main event. The pho is still the best in town. The flavors in the broth are deep and intense. The noodles are comforting. The rare steak and brisket are tender. It's enough to keep me coming back even though the service is not great.
