We had the teriyaki chicken fried rice for $8.35 plus an extra &1.00 for the fried rice. It had a bunch of veggie, chicken and plenty of teriyaki sauce. The portion size is pretty solid and can be shared by two people if you aren't too hungry. The price isn't really that expensive compared to a $4 Greek yogurt or other extremely overpriced options.  The service seemed nice and it will take about ten minutes to order because it is made fresh so FYI if you are in a huge rush for your plane. They are open late until 11.
