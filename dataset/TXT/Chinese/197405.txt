We arrived as a group of 11 (and we had made reservations ahead of time), but turns out they don't have that many large tables so we had to be seated at two separate tables.   This was kind of a bummer, since part of the enjoyment of hot pot is the communal aspect of eating and being able to chat with your friends - while everyone fights for the last fish ball.  The service was good, they were quick and attentive through out the evening; coming round to top off the pots and also our glasses with water.  The good part about this place is that they have a tray of condiments ready at your table (with a pretty good selection as well, including raw eggs), so you can start concocting your sauce immediately.

My table tried the following soup bases: preserved egg and cilantro/satay and preserved egg and cilantro/corn and pork bone.  The soups were very standard, if not a little bland.  The selection of foods was pretty average, they had all the standard items although were missing some staples like enoki mushrooms.  The quality of the food was hit and miss.  Their veggies were fresh, dumplings were average and their lamb was decent.  However, their beef (after the first plate) was noticeably freezer burned.  Finally, the only drink you get here is water.  We asked if they provided the plum juice or anything else with the meal, and the answer was no.

Overall, I would go to other places like Hi Pot that have a better selection of foods and at least offers one drink with your meal.
