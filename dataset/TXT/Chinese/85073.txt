HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw Asian Cafe Express is a tucked away gem in Mesa. It's quality food every time. We usually get take out and it's always got a good crowd (which is a good thing).  Service is excellent and the staff are always polite and friendly. 

I tried the red bean tea for the first time today. It was excellent. Perfect summer drink. I'll get it again. Also my go to is the twice cooked pork. It's excellent. I usually get it extra spicy took. 

I've tried numerous dishes and they're all excellent (the only one that i didn't dig really was xo sauce tofu). 

Love Asian cafe express it's my take out Chinese food go-to.
