KqC7y46lAjWAksfKsWStWw This place is absolutely delicious. Delicious delicious. 

We had the black pepper beef and an eggplant dish (stewed in lots of oil, sweet yet spicy). Both were incredibly flavourful. Hot & sour soup was one of the best we've had, and we tend to try it at all szechuan places we visit. This place was clearly a step above any other. Great quality, would love to go back and try many more dishes!!

We were glad to see that the patrons were very mixed, with at least half the restaurant being chinese. i think that's a good sign!
