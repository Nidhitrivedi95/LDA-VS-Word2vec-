BJ9GwNMo8vIgSuKc6B_mOw I really thought this place would be as good as most of the reviews say. I was sadly disappointed. I went there last night, at 9, for them to immediately tell me "you must order quick," and "okay you order quick" after saying "yes I understand" three times, they reluctantly led me to a table. When I sat, they threw menus in the middle of the table and walked/jogged away...

When we decided what to order (in less than 5 minutes, I might add) they seemed impatient while rushing us in speaking our order. The food came quite quick and was very authentic, unlike any other Chinese delivery or take out you can easily get for a quarter of the price (which is why it earned another star). The other star would most definitely be credited towards the ambience, as it's probably the most beautiful Chinese restaurant I've been to.

Missing stars because of rude service (they literally told us to hurry up while eating), forgetting our order, and being unbelievably expensive in the end. I wouldn't suggest this place at all, but hopefully I went on a bad day.
