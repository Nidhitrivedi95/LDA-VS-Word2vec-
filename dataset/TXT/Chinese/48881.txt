CanfdSFEs_o_h9SBvxyXlg BOTTOM LINE: Some of the better BBQ meats are no longer in China Town!

You would never expect to find this gem in, of all places, the College Park food court. It's been around for about a year or two, and simply put, the BBQ meats are surprisingly good, the service is lightning fast and the prices are rock bottom ($6 for a rice box, tax included!).

The business model is simple: offer quality BBQ'ed duck and pork, then throw it on rice and fresh bok choy. Their meats are tender, flavourful and not overly fatty or burnt. I'm surprised to say that I think they beat out most of the places I've tried in China Town - both in quality and price! Folks, this place ain't reinventing the wheel, but damn, you owe it yourself to stop by if you're ever in the 'hood and have some BBQ meat cravings.
