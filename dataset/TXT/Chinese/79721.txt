GkY6UWWn0Fz2ehcuBp66pg When I stopped eating meat, giving up giant dim sum brunches with my family was the hardest thing.  This place was my only consolation!  Even my father, who seems to have an innate distrust of mock-meats, was willing to eat here, and with good reason--the food here is really good.  Really really good.  

I've since started eating meat, but I'll still make the trip to Pacific Mall whenever someone suggests we go here.  Try the turnip cakes--they're so good.
