W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g I've never had wonton soup with noodles before.  The wontons and broth was good though.  The kung pau 2 was ok. It's not as good as the Kung pau at panda express. The iced tea was not good at all.  In general I would prefer to give this 3.5 stars but that is not possible.  I feel a little mislead by the 4.5 stars. I will probably come back to try the pho because it is hard to find in this area.
