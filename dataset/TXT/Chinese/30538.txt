My main problem was that the food was waaaaay too salty, so much so that after dining there Mother Day, my feet and hands were still quite swollen two days later, and I drank tons of water to clear all that MSG from my body.  So while the food was okay, the sushi not bad and the fruit bar quite nice, I can't weather all that sodium which disappoints since it's in my Steele Creek neighborhood.  Other folks might enjoy it, especially families.
