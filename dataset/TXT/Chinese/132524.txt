pofDmHoIsdvPcSKzb2iMag I come to Sky Dragon frequently for dim sum.  Servers push their cart around the room to serve food.  The benefit of this is that you can physically see the food they offer, especially if you're not familiar with dim sum.  You can also order from the waitress any item that you do not see in the cart or if you're just impatient waiting for food.  I've tried almost every item on their dim sum cart.  The food is hit or miss - food can be hot and fresh or not warm at all.  I find that when there are a lot of people dining in, the food tend to be more fresh.
