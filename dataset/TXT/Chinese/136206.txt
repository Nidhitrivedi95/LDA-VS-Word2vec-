Qe8vFq-3HMld-ymBQLDnpg Life has a few moments when you lose all faith and admiration in other human beings, my latest experience at Cynthia's is a prime example of one of those moments. 

We ordered the crispy Ok chicken for pickup and expected that Cynthia's would be able to meet the standard of adequate dining that we expect. We were appalled when we received Ok beef several of us do not eat beef so we called Cynthia's in hopes of getting the acceptable meal we payed for.

At this point we were already aware that our meal would be sub par on several different levels. After working through the poor communication skills of the woman on the phone they agreed to give us our well deserved chicken, they then had the audacity to demand the beef back, in trade for the chicken. 

The delivery man stomped away with the beef which began to beg the question, was another customer going to be victimized and receive a beef order with around 30 percent missing, let alone the limitless amount of possible germs they were being exposed to? 

We had hoped that the utter disappointment was over, our hopes were not remotely met as we moved on to the noodles, we had ordered the crispy chicken noodles which makes it complety unacceptable when the noodles were soft, soggy and the distinct opposite of crispy. If the texture was the only flaw perhaps we cod have forgiven for the noodles, unfortunately that was simply not the case. We had only received around 2-3 small pieces of chicken In the entire dish,  we took the deficiency of chicken as a cheap display by Cynthia's. The noodles were also severely lacking in Flavour, they were borderline tasteless and brought a disappointing ending to a terrible meal. 

I had to write this review so that I can share my woes with anyone that will listen. This is a unacceptable display of customer dissatisfaction and I shall not stand for it.
