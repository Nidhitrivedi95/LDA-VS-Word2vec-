Better than good, however short of excellent. Dinner prices run high for the venue which makes it a better bet for lunch, particularly on weekends. 

The decor is kitschy Chinese -reminded me of movies from the 40's- the menu is extremely long, but there's nothing exotic or unusual about the choices. 

-Hot and Sour Seafood soup. ($3.50) Mildly spicy, it looked and tasted unlike the typical hot and sour offerings and we enjoyed the taste, particularly the enoki 'shrooms. The bowl was small but priced accordingly and enough for starters.
4 stars

- Cold Sesame Noodles w/ Peanut Sauce ($6) a serving of stale pasta noodles with a dollop of commercially made sauce on top. Not fit for consumption.

- Spring rolls, one meat one vegetarian Greasy, tasteless and pretty awful albeit when dipped the sauce made it passable.. barely. Personally I didn't feel cheated,  I'm no great fan of spring rolls, Since they're complimentary :

- Bang Bang Shrimp was the favorite. (lunch $8.50, dinner $14.50) I found the flavor mildly spicy, complex and rich. The dish was described as a curry on a bed of angel hair pasta, not what I think of as curry and honestly there was barely any pasta at all however the shrimp was both abundant and excellent, I'd definitely order it again -for lunch.
4 stars

- Scallops in Garlic sauce w/mushrooms, peppers etc (same $8.50/$14.50) also mildly spicy and tasty but with less bite and too sweet for my taste. Lots and lots of large scallops, I'm giving it an extra 1/2 star for that reason only.
3 1/2 stars

The service was trying hard but was clumsy to the point of rudeness, maybe just a cultural thing. We found it amusing and I'm not deducting any points for it - however under the wrong circumstances I could see customers going postal.

Short of hiding an Opium den upstairs I don't see how this restaurant could be mistaken for any 5 star establishment. However those with no expectations other than a good Chinese meal will likely be satisfied.
