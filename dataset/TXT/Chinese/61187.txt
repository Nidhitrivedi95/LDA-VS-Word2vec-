dqeUvrlMxTAk0VL2n1ukaw Love their food here. The staff there is  also very kind and polite when taking your order. My delivery orders arrive on time and my food is still nice and hot. Great choices to try are their egg drop soup, sweet and sour pork, sizzling rice soup, and house lo mein! They also give you option of leaving out the onions on the entrees of your choice, which I am very appreciative of.
