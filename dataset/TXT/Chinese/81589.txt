H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag The lady here is AMAZING!! I came here once about a year ago and the fact that she remembered me is phenomenal. Not only is the customer service amazing, food is BOMB!!! I got the orange chicken combination plate with an egg roll, cream cheese wonton, fried shrimp for $7 and a side of potstickers for $5. Everything was so good! My favorite chinese place from now on
