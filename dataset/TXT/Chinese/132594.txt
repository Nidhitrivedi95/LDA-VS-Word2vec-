POiWEckMIOqX7TgBxXgCzw Have been wanting to try this new place since I saw it a few months ago. Placed order to go that they said would be ready in only 5 minutes. Wow! Fast. I ordered Mongolian beef and veggie chow mein. Yum, it was delicious. The mogolian been was really spicy but great flavor. It went well with the veggie chow mein, as the chow mein was a little sweet and had broccoli and mushrooms.
Can't wait to try their lunch specials. So much to choose from on their menu. So happy I've found a new Chinese restaurant in NLV. Will definitely be back again and again!
