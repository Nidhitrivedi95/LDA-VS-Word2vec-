2m4092MsMzEHkuxodaj6-g Excellent food. Service was quick and portions are huge. It was packed so they took down our number and called about 20 minutes later. We ordered the Yang Chow fried rice, enough for three. We also ordered the fried squid with salt and pepper, also enough for three, slightly spicy and the Kung Pao chicken, a little too many peanuts but overall everything was good
