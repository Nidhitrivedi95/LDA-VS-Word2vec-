g1UVmCOhQDY7TGSZ2rRT_w Great place for lunch. The service is pretty good and they serve the food pretty quickly. I usually get the pork and egg congee with radish cake and deep fried donuts and that's enough for serve 2 people. Prices are pretty reasonable and the food is hot, fresh and delicious! 

They do have "high tea" specials and brunch specials which they give diners a special menu with cheaper than regular menu prices. Just come around 3pm for high tea and before 10 for brunch.
