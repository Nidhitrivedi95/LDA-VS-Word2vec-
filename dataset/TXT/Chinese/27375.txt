I just got home from Chinese new year's eve dinner. I never really liked this place because they always had bad service, so when I found out that this was under new management I was hoping it would be good. And tonight definitely met my expectations. 

We were seated quickly, and because it's cny we ordered from their cny set menu. The food came out quickly, I saw the staff working quite efficiently and even saw the owner's young son helping out. Poor boy, saw him getting confused a few times. The food was good except one dish was quite salty I don't know what it was called. All our dishes came on time, none missing unlike the year before. 

The servers and hostess were also nice and friendly (what a surprise).  And there's a huge mirror by the washroom! Lol good for checking yourself before you go back to your table :p.
Anyway, I haven't been here for dim sum since  new management took over so I'd come back to check it out!
