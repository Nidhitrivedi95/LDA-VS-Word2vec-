Weekday dimsum is priced at $2.50 for S, M, L from opening til 11:00am. Tea is $0.80 per person. While prices are  competitive, the choices are a bit limited as some dishes like congee or rice noodle rolls are classified as XL.  Food comes out steaming hot, a good sign. Taste is ok, as is portion size. I just wish the menu would have more items in the S, M, L range.
