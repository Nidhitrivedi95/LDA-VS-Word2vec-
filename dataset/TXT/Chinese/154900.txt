tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw Desert Jade has been my favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix for decades. I can always expect, and experience, a great meal here. My only complaint is the lack of change. I'm vegan, and I've been able to sort out how to order my favorite items with my favorite server to make sure they have no animal products in them. Spicy bean curd with water, not broth. It's to the point where I don't have to order - it's just "the usual." That's wonderful, but it won't help any other vegans feel comfortable ordering. It would be great if they updated the menu to indicate what is, or could be made, vegan.  For instance, I know the bean curd soup can also be ordered with water instead of broth. It wouldn't change the great food they already serve, but it would open it up to new customers.
