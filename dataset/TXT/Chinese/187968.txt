One waitress was nice enough while serving us and I decided to order along with my boyfriend. He got the combo and I got the raw steak small noodle soup. I should have noticed the red flag when my food came out a mere 2 minutes after ordering but I just ate as normal. It wasn't until after I had eaten that I noticed half of a straw wrapper in my soup. It wasn't mine as I thought at first. When the mgmt was notified they told me it was my own until I showed my wrapper was in one piece unlike the half of one in the soup. The manager was told and he did nothing about it and hurriedly gave us our check. Shan't be coming here again.
