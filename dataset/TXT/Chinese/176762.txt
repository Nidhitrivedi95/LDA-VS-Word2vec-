wrRxFrnUucvR4dlG6Q9fKA I have very little faith in chain restaurants.

Panda Express lunch was really bad.
Noodles - overcooked, choppy, wasted, flavorless.

I chose a "Grilled Chicken" which was 70% chicken fat bits with a few pieces of some kind of breast or muscle like tissue.  

Grilled steak something with some vegetable was leather.

Its just not good.
Fact is there ain't nothing good to eat in 85027 unfortunately.
