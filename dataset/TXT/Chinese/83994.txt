hEUAUdG4fBdYWvPeEASnng I really wanted to like this place. Numerous spelling errors in the menu, prices changed immediately upon opening, noted in the menu with pen & stickers.
Prices are too high for the quality of food.
Ordered the Pho- certainly not as good as many other restaurants in town that serve pho.
I won't return.
Also service at lunch time was terrible, cannot come here for a normal lunch service if you need to be in & out.
