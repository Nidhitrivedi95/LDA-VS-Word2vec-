a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg I am gluten intolerant, so I have only tried 1 thing on the menu... Which is AMAZING, so it's fine by me! 
I always have the chicken lettuce wraps... Sounds boring, right? Nope! Delicious! And very filling.  (The sauce they offer is not gluten free and they do not have GF soy sauce, so bring your own)
He has the lettuce wraps and sometimes the Pepper Steak which he says is absolutely fantastic!
He also had the green beans and I tried 1... Wow! Delish!
Nice restaurant for families or date night with great food!
