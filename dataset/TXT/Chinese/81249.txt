GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg As a first time customer, they made a bad first impression. An hour 30 minutes for my meal to get delivered. With simple instructions; address, name of apartment, where we were waiting. And the food I think was the worst part. I usually never write a bad review but this was a bad first experience.
