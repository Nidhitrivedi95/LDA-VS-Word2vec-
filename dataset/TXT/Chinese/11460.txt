2GtIC6u4hVneccWfTlOxHQ I wasn't going to this buffet expecting to have my socks knocked off, and even with that in mind I still left feeling totally disappointed.

All of the food fell flat in one way or another: hot foods were warm, cold foods were tepid, spicy foods one notch above bland, sushi slightly fishy. I felt like my taste buds had a cold. 

I TRIED to find at least one item that I could use as a means to get full, but in the end, nothing was good enough to have that much of. I ended up going home and making a bag of popcorn...
