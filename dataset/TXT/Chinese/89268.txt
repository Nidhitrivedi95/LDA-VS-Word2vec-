I6oxEn1HT41S2GPrDKPPvA Decent experience! Visiting from Los Angeles and the food is authentic here but some of the items are lackluster. Great customer service and little wait time on a Wednesday evening. 

Really liked the sweet and sour pork, their soup, roast duck, and the veggies were fine. 

Some of the plates were dirty, and the lobster was bland.
