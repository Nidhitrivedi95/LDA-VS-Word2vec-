wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA Inyo has a very unique menu. Asian fusion describes it well. No sushi on the menu but dishes and flavors reminiscent of China, Japan, Korea, and Thailand. 

We went with the chicken wings, sashimi, street corn, and Brussels sprouts. I would say all of the dishes were good but none stood out as a Vegas must-try.  We went during happy hour (9 pm) so most of these dishes were discounted as well. 

Weirdest thing about the meal was that they had no cold house saki - only hot. You would think they could just chill the saki before serving, but whatever. Overall a good meal. The restaurant seemed a bit quiet on a Saturday night but hopefully Inyo is around for a while and I'll stop in again.
