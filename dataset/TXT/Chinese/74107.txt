FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ I was pleasantly surprised by this new restaurant in Mississauga China Town. All the other restaurants that used to occupy this corner space has been lack luster and hit and misses for stomach aches. 

I went with my mom and sister in law for dim sum after trying their bbq pork take out the night before. 

The dimsum had flair... most dishes on the menu was standard but with added zest. For example the siu mai (pork meatballs) had dried tako (japanese squid) on top and it was doing the little flakey dance. The shrimp rice noodle roll had some herbs rolled into it and the porridge ($5.50 a bowl) had fish maw... YUM

Also get the fried squid tentacles... yummy and they put it in a fried noodle bowl! Cool

So it's not the best tasting for everything but I appreciate the extra creativeness in the standard fare found in most chinese dim sum restaurants. I can't wait to go back and try out their dinner menu.

Service was hot and cold depending on who you were talking to :)
