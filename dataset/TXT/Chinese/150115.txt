SRYM6FaIF6LuXldcC1PY8w Best dining experience in years! The food was very good. If I was to rate just the food, I'd give this location 4 stars. However, the exceptional service gets 5 stars out of me. We had a party of 6 that was filled with special requests, food allergies, etc. Our server Tyler was the most attentive, generous, and quick moving server I've ever had wait on me. He took care of all our needs and more. It's hard to please everyone in our group, but tyler left all of us incredibly happy with our dining experience. We will definitely be back.
