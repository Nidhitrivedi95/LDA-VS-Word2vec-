pqOn3CAS8IfeBa-ZfuH7Sg I love this! I like how they grill everything in front of the customer (made to order) what I asked for was not in the menu ( all chicken) since they have it with other meats/shrimp. Anyways I ordered teriyaki chicken with brown rice and noodles. It was good loved how they put lots of veggies in your plate. Here's a picture of what I'm taking about!
