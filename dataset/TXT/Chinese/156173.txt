tQ9BtMUHFr8rdpmjmayUcA Looking for a noodle soup place in Markham where you can make it your own way with your own choice of noodles and toppings? This is definitely a good go to! Went here for the first time with a friend and I was surprised! Sometimes I crave for noodle soup but not exactly the pho style and this place is perfect for that!

Menu is small but still has interesting variety and options. But never look for quantity over quality! Pricing is fair and food tasted pretty good. Service was fair as well but it was somewhat quiet although it was during the "dinner time". There were maybe a few other tables with us?

Overall I would definitely return to this place given the quality and also because you can put together your own unique noodle soup! Kind of a nice twist instead of being given the standard noodle soup options :)
