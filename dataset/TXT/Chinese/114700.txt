mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w Came across this place bc its in my area & I was craving for some dim sum. I've been here once before & was just recently here (08/01/17). 

Let's start off with the customer service. All the employees were really friendly and nice. Always came to the table to make sure everything was ok & always offered to refill our drinks, etc... and that our food was on its way.

The food was average. I got the soy sauce chow mein (chef special) which was $9.25 it was ok. Nothing special but I was really craving for noodles so that satisfied my craving. I also got orange chicken something on their regular menu. It was fresh & yummy!! I really enjoyed it I give it a 8/10. From the dim sum menu I got sui mai, baked pork buns & shrimp and chive dumplings. These were all made to order so they were hot and fresh!! Taste wise would be 7/10. Tasted like average dim sum. 
Their dim sum menu is very limited. They didn't have much but they had the popular items I would say. 

Pricing - the dim sum was pricer than other dim sum places I've tried (for example orchid garden). The dim sum items were $3.50 each.... 

I spent a total of $40 on my whole bill. I would only recommend this place if you want dim sum around this area. I may or may not be coming back... but other than the limited dim sum menu & pricing, I would came back for the regular Chinese food because it was delicious!!!
