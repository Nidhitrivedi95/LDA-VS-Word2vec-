I echo the sentiments of many other yelpers about this place. Personally, there are far too many reasons to not go that outweigh reasons to go.

I went to Hakkasan on a Saturday night to go see Tiesto. Luckily, I purchased the tickets on Hakkasan's website so my guest and I did have to wait in the enormous line that had formed outside. We were in within 10mins. Online, men pay $30 and women pay $20. That was probably the only positive of the night.

Once inside it didn't take long to realize how poor the layout is. There is a dance floor on the first and second level that are both very small and lead to a "sardine in a can" feeling if you dare to venture into that hot mess. My guest and I ended up dancing off to the side because it was literally impossible to force our way in and have a iota of space. 
Even off to the side it was pretty busy. Simply put, they let in way too many people. This may have been due to the fact the this was during NBA summer league and UFC 200 just let out and some of the pro athletes were in there, which may have led to a bigger draw.

Overall, it was not a good experience. Look into other venues before going here.
