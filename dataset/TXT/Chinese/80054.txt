gnqHyA6gY2-m9S-FKt6Xqw Cheap Asian food (though on the oily side). Cravings definitely gets busy during the lunch hours though. The owner is a cool guy, he knows a ton of Asian languages and dialects.

Oh yeah, don't eat in the restaurant unless you want to go back to class/lab smelling like Chinese food.
