r2qLNZaYTZKjvVXfXB1BLQ Newly open noodle joint. Spacious with modern look and a fair amount of seating. Serves Presotea along side with noodles of course. Once seated the waitress drops down an tablet to order food with. She then starts showing us how to order with the tablet in Mandarin. I don't speak a word of Mandarin so we just nod and let her finish. I tablet was easy to follow for ordering. I really don't see the point of using a tablet unless it was used to avoid communicating with customers in English or Cantonese which I think is the majority language in Markham. I believe all staff there are Mandarin speaking but they do understand English so it was no big deal. 

On the menu they advertise the noodle as ramen but its actually hand pulled noodles. Ordered the beef rib with noodles at $7.25 + $1 for big bowl. The noodles were fresh hand pulled noodles. I thought the noodles were a bit overcooked so they had a slight soggy texture to them. The beef ribs were very flavourful even though they were in the soup itself. The portion of beef ribs was pretty decent. Some pieces had too much fat on it.

Also tried the Intestine noodle at $7.25 - good amount of meat and the noodles were the same as mentioned above.

Also got a passion fruit lime basil seed drink from Presotea at $3.99 - a bit sour and a bit sweet. Tasted okay but next time I think I will stick with my iced milk tea.

Overall, a decent hand pull noodle joint.
