I thought that the food tasted like any other dim sum restaurants. I do like their pumpkin congee over some of the cheaper restaurants I go to. Also, some of the design they put into the dishes was very cute! The mango pudding was a shape of a fish and the ham sui gok looked exactly like a pear.

The service was a bit lacking because we couldn't find a server when we wanted to get our tea refilled. They do clear off our table quite quickly which was very necessary because we ordered a lot of food for four people.

I can't say I'll come back here because it is on the more expensive side and there weren't any outstanding dishes.
