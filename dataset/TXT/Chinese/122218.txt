OfqTPtPSQfCVxaSlY4qAxg We always wanted to go this place due to the fact that many other Hong Kong Chinese restaurants are really good and it seem like it was like a great authentic Chinese food place to go to.  This is by far the worst place i have ever been. 
 I ordered the egg fu yung, it came with 3 patties, just green onions on top and gravy. no other vegetables or other condiments like I have at other places and worst of all it was burnt.
 We ordered Peking Pork Chops and it tasted like orange chicken, try figure. 
And last we ordered Seafood Chow fun, it was slimy and seafood was chewy, uncooked and no flavor what so ever.  
The top it all off, we were not offered any other drinks, server just gave us water that tasted so bad due to the fact probably because the glass cups were not washed well as you could see other lip stains. We all felt grossed out and sick after and my 3 year old daughter was nauseated  all the way home.  Me and my wife had a headache as well. Probably because, i presumed of the MSG and uncooked seafood and the overcooked egg fu yung.  
Last, it was 105 degrees outside and I was sweating like a pig inside with there ceiling fans off and the A/C prob seem like it was set at 90 degrees.
First and last time at this place.
