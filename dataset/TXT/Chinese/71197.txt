fBmyj1okdO1p-GUzfQQohg Ok, so, I found this place after craving sweet and sour chicken last night.  It was late, and I wanted to carry out.  This place is located within a shopping strip that has quite a few asian quisine's to choose from.  The reason I chose here was because it was exclusively a carry out joint.  I just wanted to grab a bite, take it home, and eat.

So, I enter the place, and its kind of drab, and not really appealing to the eye.  It appears to be a delievery/carry out joint, with NO seating.  So, I review the menu, and place my order for sweet and sour chicken.  The girl behind the counter was warm and friendly, and answered the few questions that I had.

I was kind of iffy about this place. It's not in horrible shape, but it really needs a good cleaning and some updating.  I felt it was kinda dumpy looking.  But, it was late, I was hungry, and I didn't want to be to pessimistic.

Well, I got the food home, and ate it.  It was fine.  But, I ended up getting sick later on that night.  I don't know if its because of the food, or the fact that I am having an ulcer flare up or what.  So, i have to give this place 3 stars, but with hesitation.  I want to say, I am not one who normally has a week stomach.  I don't know if I threw up because of my ulcer, or because of the food, but please eat here with caution.
