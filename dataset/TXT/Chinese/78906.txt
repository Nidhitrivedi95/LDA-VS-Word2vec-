GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Lousy food at a high price. Portions are tiny!!! $14 for a cup of what is supposed to be a cerviche  is a bowl of salsa with some shrimp.  It came with "3" chips. When we asked for more chips, servicer said it's be extra charge.  Spring rolls were just deep fried wonton skin. where is the vegetable????  Food was salty, and poorly executed.  What would expect from a place that features both Mexican and Chinese food?  Only thing good about this place is the service.
