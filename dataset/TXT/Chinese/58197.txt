dazGlP4Rk4nxlyMtlvkpvA Admittedly, I have never tried Dragon I's food.  This is a review for those of you hipsters out there who can't get enough irony....and kind of like to sing.

I was looking to try something new for my birthday bash last weekend.  What I stumbled upon was a private karaoke lounge, tucked away in the upper lair of what I had previously assumed to be exclusively a bubble tea restaurant.  Or an exclusive bubble tea restaurant, however you want to look at it.  Recognizing that this was a chance to broaden my horizons as I entered into another year, I immediately walked in to put my name down for a room, which was then written on a scrap of paper smaller than a post-it note. Needless to say, I had my reservations about my reservation, but I also knew I was on to something great.

The song selection keyboard was in another language; the songs available were from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s, which means essentially anything post-Backstreet Boys was non-existent.  The music videos to accompany these throwbacks were of bears climbing up majestic mountains or wolves howling at a full moon.  The only downside was that the drinks were a little weak, but that didn't stop my friends and I from having a fantastic time.   

Overall, belting out karaoke classics at the top of my lungs in a private room made for an awesome birthday celebration.  I consider this birthday party at the Dragon I karaoke lounge to be the most entertaining, and therefore, my favorite to date.
