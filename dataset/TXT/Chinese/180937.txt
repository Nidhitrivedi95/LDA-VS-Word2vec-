X9ftU-exKhTMOjtr3B52rw Extremely fast service - great if you're in a hurry with colleagues.

As other posters have noted - amazing shrimp wontons, homemade hot sauce, etc.

One thing I was surprised with was the fish balls.  I tried half of one that my friend shared, and I liked it.  And I usually despise fish balls, beef balls, and anything like that.

Also, we didn't notice this right away, but there is a tea station so you can quickly grab your own tea.  Given the prices / speed it seems like a very practical arrangement.

Prices = excellent
Food = great
Service = lightning quick, very friendly and kind staff, and the right level of service for the type of food (people who want a quick bowl of soup)

The food and prices earned the 4 star, the service got my 5th star.  Well done.
Bought some of the hot sauce on the way out, seemed to have a great flavor at the restaurant.
