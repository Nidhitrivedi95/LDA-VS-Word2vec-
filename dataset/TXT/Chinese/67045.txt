ElCX49QVRf-IJlvKLOZSlA I should have checked the Yelp before I walked into this terrible restaurant.  I was just walking back from Arthur's seat hike and was hungry.  Saw this one walking by so decided to try.  Well, big mistake.  Although it was run by Chinese, food was not even mediocre quality and their service was terrible.  Didn't even give me a napkin until I asked for it.  To top it off all, when I gave them a visa card to pay, they said they have to charge additional 3.5% fee.  What?!??  I've been here 4days now, none of the restaurants I ate had same issue; big or small.  Stay away from this awful restaurant!!!  Should be ZERO star!!
