kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A Decided to give this place a try for lunch due to the good reviews on yelp.
Reviewers weren't wrong. Pretty good Asian noodle restaurant. Ordered the hot and spicy beef noodle. It looks like "Fire" soup but it wasn't as spicy as I thought. Has a "kick" to it but not enough to not enjoy the flavor. But next time I do order this soup would be when the weather gets cold or if I have a cold. It will clear the sinuses. Next time I'll order the B1 the regular beef noodle soup. But the best part of the lunch would be the Mongolian beef pancake. All the reviewers were right( good reviews and bad) . This appetizer is a must get dish. Even though it arrived after my noodle soup was at my table the pancake was worth the wait. My next visit will be the Mongolian beef pancake and whatever I decide to get at that time.
