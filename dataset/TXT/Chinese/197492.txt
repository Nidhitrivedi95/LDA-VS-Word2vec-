zs710LuQ8y10YsQHIjxjyw Only a day before I was at Dumpling House Restaurant on Spadina, where I was blown away.  Once I have something I really like, I tend to fixate and have the same thing over and over until I get the obsession out of my system--a rebalancing of sorts.  When I noticed the Chinese Dumpling House in Richmond Hill, I thought it was an offshoot of the same treasure on Spadina. The name is fairly similar.

I walked into the small restaurant and noticed they too had a glass booth where ladies where making fresh dumplings.  This looked right so far!  Then I noticed the menu was distinctly different than Spadina, but still, a dozen dumplings for $7 is a win.  This time I added my favourite Green Beans with Minced Pork, to make sure I had a big enough meal.

This is not the same as Spadina, but still very good.  The dumplings were fresh, hot and delicious.  The bean dish was also right up there.  Now I had to figure how I would compare the two dumpling restaurants on my decision tree.  The bottom line is that if I am not willing to make the drive into the big city, this will be  my frequent go-to.  I expect to be here often, and will hit Spadina whenever I am in the core.
