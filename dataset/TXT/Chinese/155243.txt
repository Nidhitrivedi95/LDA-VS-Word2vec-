tiw8uPbxSMqx1Ox3JXGsEQ Decided to bring my family to this "establishment" ..they travelled all the way from NY for a family reunion, as this place came highly recommended. We were a large group of 16 and decided to call ahead to ensure they could accommodate our number.  They said "sure come on in!"From the moment we got there, we were met with a waitress who was not only cold as ice,  but had zero customer service skills! The food which included 2 appetizers were served over the course of 40 minutes, with most of our table watching the others eat and finish their meals while the food was continuously being brought out as slow as humanly possible! Two of our guests never received their meals and when the sever was approached she stated that they were busy and that their order machine was broken..at no time was an apology given!!! When asked to speak with the manager we were told he was busy! To make matters worse the waitress had SO much attitude ...I started to feel bad that I had interrupted her from doing her job and for the owner deciding to only put TWO servers to work the long weekend! To add fuel to the fire the bill came with additional items that were never ordered. Can't knock the food...but the service was a great disappointment!
