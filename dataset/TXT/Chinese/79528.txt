GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog I am a bit mystified why the ratings are so low overall. Maybe it's because Andres caters to real foodies, and some diners may not understand some of the unique dishes. We loved the lotus chips, 20-vegetable fried rice, shrimp and pork shumai, and a fun tamale. I would definitely go back again....and really want to try glass noodles (Chinese) and Chile En Nogada (Mexican).
