Ef9crW61OYp2UJ0ysi3nEw Heyyyy everyone. Im gonna try to start up on these again! So im new around this side of town and thought i'd try the Chinese restaurant around the corner. I call in and order small general tso's with white rice . The menu i see online tells me 7.54 she says on the phone that its 8.25(assuming thats the tax) or something like that Then tells me it will take 10mins i get there in 6 mins and its already done . So i know its not fresh. Then i go to pay and she says 9.58. Which is annoying. But after that long rant the food wasnt on the fresher side, it looked very dry, BUT it was has a really good flavor! it isnt spicy at all if thats what youre looking for and idk if they dont do sizes  but if this is a small good Lord idk what the large would look like. Im adding pics. Flash no flash and UPDATED menu.
