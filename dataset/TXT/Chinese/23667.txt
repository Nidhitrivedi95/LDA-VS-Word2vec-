6W20fKnjqPTSU2irnSVmSQ The ambiance of this restaurant is relaxing and comfortable. We had the lettuce wraps and then shared salmon and a beef entree, which both were fantastic. We would eat here every night if our diets allowed us! Our server was nice and the food came promptly. I recommend eating here if you like Chinese.
