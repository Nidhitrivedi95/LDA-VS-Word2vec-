lkM72Y21bjBqUGaW7iL7tQ Needless to say the place was very fair (haha). Actually it was great, I was here for a banquet and the 12 course meal was impeccable as you'll see in the photos: roasted pig, fish, chicken, lobster, shark fin, abalone, and rice dishes were done well. Great service staff. Of course, my meal here wasn't the normal meal you would get, as it was a banquet, but if you're looking for a great Chinese restaurant to host your next gathering, these guys do it quite well and classy!
