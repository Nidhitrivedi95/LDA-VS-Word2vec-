pSTQPnaee7euEULfDgIDdg Got my order delivered and it came super hot granted they are about 3kms away but I'm never disappointed with the service and delivery time. 

-Chicken wings were on point and has that Chinese restaurant flavour. 
- Pineapple fried rice which could have used more flavour and more pineapple. 
-Beef chow mein crispy 2 thumbs up. 
-General Tao chicken  was great. 
-spring rolls were good and that sauce is delicious.
-Great portions! 

Sorry no pics this time as the food was crushed haha
