FI9xm1sFvrE6vJgF28-1dg My favourite sushi restaurant in Edinburgh. I would never have come here without a recommendation from a friend, so thought I'd best pass the message along.

Situated just along from Haymarket, the restaurant is small and a bit of an ugly duckling. I wouldn't have been tempted inside by the decor... But if you look past the aesthetics and get inside I'm sure you will be converted too.

The staff are really friendly and the sushi is YUM! Plus you don't have to pay the exorbitant rates of some of the trendier sushi places in town.

I would highly recommend the Dragon Roll and Softshell Crab Roll which is amazing!

They also do cooked Chinese and Japanese meals - so if you have a friend who is not a sushi fan there's something for them. Plus they do takeaway.

Really can't recommend it highly enough. Go and find out for yourself!
