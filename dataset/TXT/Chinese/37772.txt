AR1w3ragHgRvnU71A7aaZA Shabu takes it to the next level by serving up its many Chinese, Japanese and Korean delicacies in a rustic and authentic, East meets West spacious interior, - where the food is the main attraction. The servers were cheery and prompt as they helped us navigate the expansive menu and choose the right dinner items. The food came within a very short time and was beautifully presented, fresh and spicy, and absolutely filling.
