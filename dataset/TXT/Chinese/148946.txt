SNkkuchbVtUzCwyENcai_g The lunch specials are amazing! $8 for bibimbap? Count me in. The bibimbap was pretty good too and they put in a decent amount of beef especially for the price. I also got 3 side dishes to start. The bean sprouts didn't seem fresh, the sweet potatoes were extremely sweet and the kimchi was very salty but hey you get what you pay for. The point is the $8 bibimbap was very good so terrible side dishes aside, I'd recommend this place for a cheap lunch spot. The waitress was confused and disorganized but it seemed like she was doing everything on the front end of the restaurant.
