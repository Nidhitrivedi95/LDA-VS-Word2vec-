aY-lZvoTHAFl9k6dcfcAxQ I really liked the simple menu.  I didn't feel overwhelmed with choices.

When I first arrived, it was packed.  They asked if we would be ok sharing a large table with another family.  Our daughter is very friendly and I didn't want to disturb the other family so we declined.

Eventually we got a table and at first everything was fine.  Slowly the service declined.  The food wasn't great, just ok.  On a bright note, they serve large portions so there was plenty left over.  Food is a good value.

Lastly, I thought it was odd that they had a vacant baby carrier taking up a whole booth yet they had customers waiting to be seated.
