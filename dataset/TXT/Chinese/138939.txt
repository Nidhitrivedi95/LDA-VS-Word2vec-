By no means is this authentic Chinese food, but I think the New York is a reference to the type of joints we were used to on the East Coast which used to be lacking a while back in town. 

The hot and sour soup is pretty darned tasty; spicy tofu with brown rice is my choice and folks like won ton or egg drop mixed soup, house fried rice, Orange Beef and Kung Pao Shrimp. Another option they enjoy when they have guests is the Family Dinner A or B which has about 10 main dish selections and comes with apps, soup, fried rice and egg rolls: lots of food for under $25.  The occasional appetizer sampler is ordered including mainly meats, which I don't eat. They love the spare ribs, too. 

Lunch specials are reasonable as are dinner prices and service is friendly. Hey, it makes the folks happy? I'm in!
