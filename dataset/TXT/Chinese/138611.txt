QpOAv584eb-ecG4TLEm95g I haven't been to any of the China a Go Go locations in a couple years, but we decided to go here last week for dinner. We ordered Family Dinner A - $25.95 which came with 2 Egg Rolls and 2 Crab Rangoons, soup (Egg Flower), rice (BBQ pork fried rice), and two entrees (Orange Chicken & Beef Broccoli). It was more than enough for two people. In fact, it was enough for our dinner that night AND lunch the next day. The food pretty much tasted like most of the other Chinese fast food joints. My favorites were probably the BBQ Pork fried rice and Egg Flower soup; both very satisfying. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. We dined in, so they kept refilling our glasses and making sure we were doing alright. This location definitely has much better service than a couple other China a Go Go locations I've been to.
