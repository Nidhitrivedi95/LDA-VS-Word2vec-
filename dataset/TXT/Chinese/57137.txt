D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw I found this place by accident once when I was horrendously hung over and starving, and didn't have it in me to either of the other two Thai places I love in LV.  Searched Yelp, and found this place.  It is now one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  

The food is always fresh, the staff is very friendly, and the food comes out pretty quickly even when the place is standing room only.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the atmosphere is casual.  Hint:  bumped up my normal level 7 order to number 8, and there was a noticeable difference.  Will have to try it once more before kicking it up to 9...
