wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw Since moving here, we wondered where the local Asians in the community ate. Now we know! I was so elated to see uncles and aunties there for a mid-Sunday brunch. The venue is cozy and pleasant. Once inside, I was taken back by the friendly and prompt service. It was almost difficult to order from the menu with pictures of the entrees bordering the room. 
We ordered a couple quasi dim sum dishes--turnip cake and rice cake with chinese donut. The turnip cake was a hit, and the rice cake with chinese donut was too oily. Probably better to order it with shrimp or beef next time. For entree, we had the egg noodle with wonton and bbq pork. It's served piping hot and very fresh. The wonton isn't mom's caliber, but it will do for Cleveland. 
Good to know-- Prices are very reasonable. Portions hefty. Super clean restroom. Closed Tuesdays. Closes like at Midnight when it is open. No duck or pork hanging behind glass, so you can bring timid eaters in.
