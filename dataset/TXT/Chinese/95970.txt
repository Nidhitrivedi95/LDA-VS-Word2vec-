jKJr7aPdTZ5kiQw0g40yJQ I was very pleased with the food here this time. I tried before when I think was under different management and this is a great improvement. The boneless spare rib is great, sweet and sour chicken great, General Tso is decent, fried rice good and the egg roles are decent. I will come again and hope the quality stays as good as this time. I am trying to avoid the Mandarin restaurant down the street which used to be my favorite but went down hill year after year until I just had to stop going.
