It's not just the fact they have strong flavors and amazing vegetarian options -- they're AMAZING delivery. There have been times I ordered and literally had them knock on my door within 10 minutes. Sure, I live a block away but still..dang fast! They're easy to deal with and the food is great -- no complaints! Heck-Sounds good for lunch.
