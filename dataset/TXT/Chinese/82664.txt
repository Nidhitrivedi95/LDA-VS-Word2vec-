HbLNib13kdNkvq_A9O_waw Rating the service as it is below sub-par and unfortunately has been for sooo many years. I wish there was something closer in South Phoenix to rival them, surely they would appreciate my business. The ALWAYS forget something out of your order.... Like 100% of the time. It could be something like a whole burger order or an extra ranch that you PAY for. They tie up the bags so tight that its almost impossible to check your order before you leave. I called today after they forgot something I PAID FOR out of my order. The "manager" Maribel sounded clueless and admitted they forgot it, as it was still sitting on the counter. I asked her why this happens all the time "its cuz were busy"... no customer service skills. I asked her managers name, she said she could not give it. I don't want his home address, just his first name. I can't tell you his name she says.... Marcia's has been in SO Phoenix for close to or over 20 years and their customer service is to assume that people who are patrons to their business deserve sub-par service. Tell everyone you know.... I will!
