UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w Came here for breakfast. 8.99 I believe with a memeber card. The time when I want varieties, i go to a buffet. 

Food was mediocre. Typical breakfast items. Powder eggs. Sausage, hash, bacon. French toast pancakes. French toast was rock hard! Fresh fruits. They had a omelet station so that was a plus. The orange juice gave me a stomach ache. 

Service was good and friendly though.

I came here expecting mediocre food since price was cheap. Overall well worth the cheap price. 

Cheap okay food for 8.99. Can't beat that anywhere in vegas! Just go with low expectation so that way you can enjoy the food.
