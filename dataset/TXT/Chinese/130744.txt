pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Had the most delicious meal at Sushi Samba this weekend! The waitress suggested we do the sampler / tasting option. We set a price point and told her our likes and dislikes...and from then on it was nonstop deliciousness! We truly liked everything that was brought out. For 4 girls, we set a price point of $50 per person and were beyond full by the end of the meal. Next time I would probably do less sushi rolls and more of the other goodies on the menu. Will definitely be back!
