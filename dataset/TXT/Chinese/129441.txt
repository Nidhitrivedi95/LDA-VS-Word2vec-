pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I've been dying to try this in Manhattan, but my first experience was in Vegas. Expensive, but great. We got the miso soup, amazing cocktails, and a couple rolls. The asevichado roll was $25, their innovation on a rainbow roll, and the best roll I ever had. The edamame was simple, but generous with right amount of sea salt.  I can't wait to try more back in NYC.
