PhNdyQTtZjOQ1bqoT4S3oA Only one visit so far, but I was very impressed.  
I have been on the search for a quality General Tso's chicken for some time now.  Most places like this that are "casual" Chinese food (the type where when you walk in, you see pictures of the dishes above the counter) are similar in nature - low prices, good portions, but quality is all over the place, especially when it comes to chicken dishes.  This place was on point when it came to flavor of the General Tso's sauce and quality of the chicken.  I did not feel like because of the price ($9.50 for the large order which can easily be split) that the chicken used was of a lesser quality.  In fact, this was one of the few places where they used uniform sized cuts vs some big, some small.  While that might not seem all that important, whenever a restaurant uses larger cuts, I've noticed they usually are using lesser quality in order to do so.  I am definitely going back for more & will post again.
