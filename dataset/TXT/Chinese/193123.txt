ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Great food, reasonable prices and nice ambience. We sat at the bar and watched the cooks prepare our food, which I always enjoy. The cook struck up some nice conversation with us and was very friendly. The menu was just the right size - not too daunting with good variety. For appetizers we got the calamari fries and the brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts themselves are enough to go back. So good!!! For entree, we ordered the wood fire grill plate with flank steak. It was healthy and tasty and fresh - perfect if that is your mood. We also ordered the pork belly and the duck confit steamed buns. The pork belly was my favorite of the two. I look forward to going back and trying the mongolian beef bowl, the spicy seafood hotpot, and the bananas foster fritters. They looked so yummy!!!
