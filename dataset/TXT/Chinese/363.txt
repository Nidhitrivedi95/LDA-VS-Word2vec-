-092wE7j5HZOogMLAh40zA I love this place. The people that work there are so polite and totally cool at the same time. Dont be fooled by the deserted feeling when you forst walk in, the food is amaizing. I literally come here insted of the Chinese restaurant by my house because their crab puffs are out of this world! Not to mention I usually order Singapore rice noodles and this place is on point. All hail Wong Jr!
