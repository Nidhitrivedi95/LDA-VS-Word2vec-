My friend asked our Uber driver to drop us off at the address we listed, he guessed it was Pho Kim Long because that's where everyone goes after a night of clubbing. We were there at 3am with a group of six and it took us a while to get seated. The broth is A-Okay, noodles and meat were standard. I feel like the pho here is just average, but it's the perfect way to end a long night of clubbing on the strip.
