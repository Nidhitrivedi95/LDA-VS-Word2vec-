fGrE4Om-cTh_JgQC42qx9A We came to this panda express as our last stop before heading out of Phoenix Arizona. We were craving some Chinese and knew this would satisfy our needs. We always choose the noodles and the rice option with a stack of orange chicken!  Be sure to get a couple of egg rolls on the side.

Unfortunately we did not receive any fortune cookies. Maybe you need to ask for them? We were sad about that and didn't have time before our flight to go back and request :(

 Tips and tricks--ask for a free sample. They will give you a yummy treat on the toothpick while you are deciding what's  your favorite. Walnut shrimp is a great choice. 
Usually the weather is nice in Phoenix, grab a seat outdoor and enjoy the scenery!
If you're not too hungry, order the kids meal. That is the perfect snack size.
