Don't be afraid to ask the server for the disposable wooden chopsticks, as the big plastic ones set on the table can be cumbersome to maneuver. Aside from the menu you could also ask for a portion of choy sum - sautéed chinese cabbage-to add some fiber to the dumplings and such. My personal favorite is the taro puff balls while the recently discovered deep fried shrimp dumplings are also worth a try.
