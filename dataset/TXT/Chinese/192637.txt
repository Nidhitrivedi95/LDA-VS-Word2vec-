z8Cw9KBnDj3X40H9fXElYw Last night we came here for the second time. We ordered take out and I'd like to say the people working there are beyond friendly. They always say hello and the regulars always get greeting that makes it completely obvious that they are recognized. I love that. We ordered three large size entrees and an egg roll and were out of there for only 27.00. So of course for that price it must be horrible, right? No it's flavorful, tender and cooked wonderfully. We're a fan of the pork lo mein, the sauce is amazing and the pork is tender. We also LOVE their garlic sauce, it is out of this world. Everything is hot and cooked really well. I can't wait to eat my leftovers! 

Just because it's in a strip mall, and looks kinda dark on the inside, give this place a chance! You will not be disappointed!
