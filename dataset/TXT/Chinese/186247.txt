If I had had, I would have ordered from it, and this would be a 4 or 5-star rating based on value.  Since my item costed $6.50 (still a fair price), it is now a 3.5 star rating.  The pickled pork belly on rice tasted quite good.  Many popular meat on rice and noodle choices on menu, though none unique.  Competent fast food booth for lunch.
