I arrived there in about 20 minutes to which I was told it would be ready in couple minutes. 10 minutes later I ask about how long and am told a couple more minutes. 20 minutes later the same thing. Finally 10 minutes after that I said I wanted a refund if it wasn't finished. Our food comes out at that point. We leave and get home to find half of our food is missing. What we did have was completely cold. When my fiancé and I called them to express my displeasure the woman on the phone said its not her problem and hung up on me. When I called back and demanded a manager we were hung up on again. Will be filing dispute with bank tomorrow.
