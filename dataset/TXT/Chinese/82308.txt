H94fBucKEuNKsjbSy7WODg I love the fact that the woman that served us, is so friendly.  I would guess she is the owner, with the care and attention she has shown us the three times we've been here.  
     The food is the most important thing to me, and it's ok.  I really would like business to thrive here, so it's really hard to say the food is "ok". (Blame it on the fact that I've gotten pickier over the years.)  I had a combo of mu-shu pork, egg roll, rice, cream cheese puff and chow mein.  The crepe for the mu-shu was too thin to pick it up (they were pre-rolled for the combo) without it falling apart. But I enjoyed it with the hoisin sauce.  The combo also came with soup.  I got the Hot and Sour Soup and enjoyed it with the fried chips.  
     I love love love supporting local small businesses.  The but, to that, is that small businesses don't always have the funds to redecorate and have everything look fresh and tip-top.  The outside is poorly designed and the inside looks like it needs a make-over.... but really!  What's important to me is the people and the food.  So, stop in and give it a try!
