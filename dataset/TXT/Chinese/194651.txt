ZGpT6rcgSsJ4GxwTHbvvJw I was looking for Chinese food and I was not familiar with the area.  As usual I went to Yelp for assistance.  I was very disappointed with my choice.  The restaurant did get excellent reviews for the walnut shrimp.  The shrimp was okay, it had a good sauce which helped.  I made a mistake and ordered the fish in black bean sauce.  The fish tasted old and dried up.  It was so bad I could not eat it.  I don't think I will be going back.
