cdLBNUBgPurw3PyLXvbiGA Top notch for service and food! Well-mannered and courteous staff. The menu is very similar to most HK style cafe and I was surprised to see breakfast items being served at 12:30pm still. We ordered the breakfast with 3 kinds of meats and the baked chicken ala Portuguese style on rice. Both came with drinks and the baked rice had the extra soup & garlic toast - very nice touch!
The food was plentiful and it's refreshing to see fruit served with the breakfast, very western style. The price was $8.99 and I thought it was really decent since a drink is included. 
I would definitely come here again!
