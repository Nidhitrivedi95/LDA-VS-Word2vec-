LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA I have been to this Flos 5 times and this was my worst experience here.  The food is still not here and we have been here for 30 minutes.  They said they were so busy that all of their 12-15 tea pots were being used by customers, but I looked around and saw only one table with a teapot.  Then, we waited 10 minutes for a tea refill.  The waitress must have realized we were becoming impatient because she excused the slowness and apologized.  However, the other Flos is always more busy but also more prompt.  So I know they have an example to live up to.  Really disappointed.  Won't be back. Won't recommend.
