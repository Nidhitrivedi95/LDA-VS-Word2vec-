oacm52KPpEpOBf_M2sARLA This last weekend we stayed at a hotel 2 miles away from here, and were recommended this place by the concierge. Big mistake! We ordered the family dinner special and an order of crab puffs at 7:13pm. Our order wasn't delivered until 9:15, and was missing the included fried rice and side of Crab Puffs we ordered, so we called to have them deliver those. 

After hearing nothing for an hour, we called again at 10:30 and were told that the delivery driver had just left 10 minutes prior. Finally, after calling it quits and going to bed, the driver finally arrived at 11:30 with our fried rice. We never got our Crab Puffs.

I highly discourage anyone from ordering delivery from this place.
