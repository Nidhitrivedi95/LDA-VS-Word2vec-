XEKx5litKe1KkfJpqtmJUw In terms of food, I rated it 5.  In terms of service, I gave it 1 or 0 if I could!!  So, on average, I gave it 3 stars to let you to decide to go or not.

The eel hot pot rice is very good and also the signature dish.  Crowded of people and the waiters didn't care your business at all.  They thought even you left, many people waiting outside.
