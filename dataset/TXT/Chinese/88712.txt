I_vzg2V92U7wdD61tvGtpg I have tried the chicken lo-mein, it ok.  the ginger chicken (I get it extra spicy) is super yummie!!!! the general tso's is a hit or miss.  the hot and sour soup is ok.  the Mongolian beef is super yummy!!!! the fried rice is ok. the veggie egg rolls I don't like. will add more as my family and I try new dishes.
