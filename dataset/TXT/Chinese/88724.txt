I_WWH2vYccjz-QxW3u1zJA Okay it's a buffet so i am rating this against other buffet's but it doesn't really matter because it gets one star either way.

Variety is bad here, (one the layout is crappy and could have been better used to maximize space and provide more table space for different options) . The food i couldn't find one thing i like, not even vegetables. Oh wait i lied, the fried sweet donut was good and the hibachi grill was decent for a buffet one.  Bad part about the hibachi grill...i was waiting there for 5 minutes before the chef even came out of the backroom to start cooking my food. Also i got a glimpse of the backroom when he opened the door, i wish i didn't GROSS!!!

Also they had some workers cleaning snow peas on a table where people eat....i decided to avoid snowpeas for my trip after seeing that. Not a food surface and not okay.

Plus side, this place is really clean for a buffet. Lots of places to sit so you can bring a group. The price is very reasonable...but than again you pay for what you get...cheap price cheap/crap food.

Wait i'm not done...thats right i am not done. The wait staff was horrible, All the other 4 that were on duty were too busy talking to each other, braiding each others hair and gossiping about customers while one guy was busy busting his butt off trying to wait on a dozen or more tables all over the restaurant. Not only was it one guy doing it all, but this guy barely spoke any english (i am not hating on him for not speaking english), He REALLY REALLY could have used some help from the chatty kathy's in the back. Hopefully they wont have to split tips, because none of the other workers deserved it.
