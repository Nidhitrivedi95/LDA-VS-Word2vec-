csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA I am a regular at Noodletasia. I ordered from takeout with this trip. Didn't know they had a separate section of their restaurant for takeout, but that was greatly appreciated and convenient. I always order the chicken lettuce wraps which are delicious. I also get fried rice, spring rolls, and sushi. They're all great! The staff members are very polite and helpful too.
