c-Ur4wPDNjt-e2N5MkRRaQ Excellent Dim Sum all around!  One specialty that is my favorite here is the Spicy Tofu. The chicken feet are also excellent. Every item is flavorful, hot, and high quality. The decor is dark which is one of my only complaints. If you are looking for good dim sum downtown Toronto, I highly recommend checking it out.
