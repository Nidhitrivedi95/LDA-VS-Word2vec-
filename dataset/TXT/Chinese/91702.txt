ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w This may be my new favourite dim sum / Chinese restaurant in the city. 

I am a big fan of Lee Wei Heen and Kwan managed to poach the chef from there. 

This place uses less sugar and salt than any Chinese restaurant I have tried and clearly used better quality ingredients.

The shrimp and bamboo har gow and siu mai were both very tasty. The crispy spring rolls wrapped in rice noodles were particularly good and the egg tarts may be the best I have had.

The seem to be short staffed with people rushing around, but the food certainly made up for it. 

I will definitely be going back.
