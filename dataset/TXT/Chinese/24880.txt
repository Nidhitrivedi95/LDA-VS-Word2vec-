7-Wlpm30PGCBIZtH2rOlew Went here for lunch with a friend. I read in other reviews that the pho is subpar so I went instead with the chicken vermicilli bowl. It was pretty tasty, though nothing extra-ordinary. My friend ordered chicken coconut curry and was happy with her meal. Again, nothing special but if you're hungry it more than does the trick.

The waitress was polite and efficient, and didn't offer the check until we asked for it which was oddly refreshing. All in all, a decent lunch place. Can't speak for the pho but the noodle bowls are solid.
