This is exactly the kind of take out Chinese food that I want for exactly the price I want to pay for it. Is it the best in the city? Absolutely not. Is it the greasy, tasty numbered-menu Asian fare you're expecting from a place with generic food pictures on the wall? Bingo.  I can only speak for what I've had so far: General Tso, Pork Egg Rolls and Wonton Soup. I think I spent $10 and I had three full meals worth of food. All were spot-on. It's exactly what you expect it to be. 

Cleanliness is a bit on the iffy side but honestly, I'm fine with it. I've worked in enough restaurants to know what it's really like and what most places get away with. The food was great and it didn't make me sick. Cool.
