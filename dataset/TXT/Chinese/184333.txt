xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A Lulu's has great american-asian food.  It bring lots of great dishes from many cultures.  The plates are large, but still priced for single persons.  So you don't have to share a dish ever.  The Dr. Foo's Special is a really awesome popular dish, I get it about every time I go.  You have to mix in the Dr. Foo's Special sauce.  The Pad Thai and the Spicy Sechewan are good dishes too.  Their appetizers are good and cheap too. 
 I would recommend going here over Oriental Express every day unless you are in a hurry.  Lulu's service can be horrible sometimes.  Once the waitress didn't realize she was our waitress and left us sitting there for 15 minutes.
 Lulu's does have the best bubble tea in Pittsburgh though.  I like Classic the most.  But I figured out the smoothies are the best bang for your buck because they aren't 50% ice like the bubble teas sometimes are.
  I usually spend $12 on meal, bubble tea, tip and tax.
