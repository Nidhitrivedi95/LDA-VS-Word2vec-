ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ This is the location where it all started. They got me addicted to cha time!!! I never knew you could customised your order until I came here. I often hate that bbt taste way too sweet. I am so happy I found this place!! You can zero to 30% sugar - and they also have the grass jelly instead of the tapioca. Heaven!!!

They also opened up a lot more locations  up in the Richmond hill and Markham area. But I have to say, this is by far the beat location. They make it just perfect!
