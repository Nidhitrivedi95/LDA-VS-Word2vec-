fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A This is a brand new restaurant open in Rio, very spacious and nice decoration.
I came for lunch on a wednesday, the wait wasnt too bad only 10 mins, kinda confusing though coz u dont know whether u are supposed to stay in line or get a number from the host. 
Talking about the foods, we only had dimsum. There were like 5 carts, not enough for the size of the restaurant in my opinion. Their routes wasn't well distributed. Some carts have never gotten to us, and we had some passing by for at least 10 times. The foods wasnt hot and  I like my food hot. The flavor is alright. The skin of har gow and sui mai was too thick and powdery. 
The price was 1.99 for a small, 2.99 for a medium, 3.99 for a large and 6.99 for special item. 
Their pastry was so yummy, so delicious. Try the egg custards, durian balls and salted egg buns. The salted egg buns was my favorite, so tasty. 
The service was alright. They are newly opened so its understandable. I hope it will get better.
