z_zyOfFO-OIYgCR5hstyTw It was a good experience overall.
We went on a Friday evening.....and were very surprised to learn that we were the only guests there.  Beautiful Friday evening, attached to a mall and movie theater..... I was expecting some waiting.  Oh well. Eventually one more group came in.
Needless to say that service was quick and friendly. Server was good, and honest (not the salesman type who would push specials or say everything is good).
They have lots of vegetarian options- and almost everything can be made veg. They also have a vegan and gluten free menu for those who want it.
We ordered one app and one entree to split. The veg spring rolls were yummy. Presentation was inviting as well. The size was quite larger than the typical spring rolls.
The entree was also delicious. We had the Seoul style curry with fried rice. It was well seasoned and plentiful.  Only complaint about that is that they added kimchi to our dish even though we specifically asked not to.  But I was able to take it off without effecting my dish.
Prices are reasonable as well.
I will go again.
