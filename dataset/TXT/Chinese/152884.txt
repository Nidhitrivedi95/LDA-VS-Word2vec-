t5vvlSgoeHF9uY6VkokmSg This place is horrible to deal with. These people are fucking idiots and the manager Mary as well. First they get my order wrong. Granted they corrected one part of my order. They can't make something as simple as extra well done crispy sesame beef. When we got it. It was saugy. We had to return and there only solution what to put the sauce on the side. At the other location on Centennial they know how to make it perfect extra well done crispy and guess what they have it delivered to us and it still crispy. This store where we live close by and we picked it up, they can't even do it. They said that with the sauce on top it makes it saugy by the time you get it but the manager wouldn't and listen to what I was saying. How can they make it perfect at the Centennial location they make it extra crispy with the sauce on top and have it delivered and it still crispy. Yeah they're different locations and all named China one but they're owned by the same person they should all be taught how to make it all the same. Especially if you're paying for what you want when you tell them what you want they should be able to make it for you I don't understand why the other place can do it but they can't. And the manager just kept explaining how they make it and how they make it at all the places but she wouldn't listen when I'm telling her they don't make it that way at that place. She said the put the sauce on top it will taste the same. Hell no!!! It was not even close. Its so tangy and nasty. Unlike the one at Centennial it was darker crisper like beef jerky but you didnt lose the flavor and taste crispy but soft inside. DON'T RECOMMEND THIS CHINA ONE LOCATION TO ANYONE!!! The one on CENTENNIAL IS WAY BETTER AND THEY DO IT THE WAY U WANT IT. HELL IF NOT JACKY CHAN IS BETTER AND CHEAPER AND GIVE U WAY MORE FOOD THAT IS SOOOOO GOOD AND THEY GIVE U FREE FOOD TOOO!!! AND WHEN THE MAKE A MISTAKE THEY MAKE IT THE WAY YOU WANT IT AND FOR THE INCONVENIENCE THEY GIVE YOU FREE FOOD LIKE EGG ROLLS, WONTONS, ETC. Also there's no point in complaining to the manager because she ain't going to do anything for you! She will defend her staff even though it's not what you ordered instead of making it the way you WANT( I MEAN SINCE YOUR PAYING FOR IT ) AND had ordered it. The funny thing too is that it says it on there menu it's crispy right under sesame beef. The QUALITY OF THE FOOD SHOULD BE ALL THE SAME IN ALL THERE LOCATION. BUT I WILL NEVER ORDER HERE IF ANYTHING IF I CRAVE THIS AGAIN I WILL DRIVE MY FUCKING ASS TO CENTENNIAL. IT JUST SUCKS U KNOW WHEN U CRAVE FOR SOMETHING AND THEY CAN'T EVEN MAKE IT THE SAME WAY AS THE THERE OTHER LOCATION..I WOULD UNDERSTAND IF IT WAS A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT BUT IT'S NOT!!!
