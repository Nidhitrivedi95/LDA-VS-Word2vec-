dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw Bad bad....they "auto" to charge your tip on your bill which they never told you before(it's illegal). If you wanna charge my tips you should let me know before. After that I paid tips again cause I didn't know they already charge my tips. and the service was bad like shiiiit and they always keep that shit face with you.
