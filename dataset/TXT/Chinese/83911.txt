He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw Walked out without ordering anything 

Tried to seat us in the middle of a group then when I said no they sat us next to other folk on a small table .... the place wasn't busy at all plenty of booths available and then the next people that came in were seated at a booth..... we heard them and they hadn't booked this table specially

It annoys me when they try give poor seating so ..... they ain't getting my money.
