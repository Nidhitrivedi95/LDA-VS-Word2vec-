In Vegas for a week staying w some friends.  We've been there a few times, love it.  

I think the "its bland with not much taste" comments from others mean they didn't mess around with the sauces as much as possible.  To me, that's just kinda a sign that they're not adding a ton of crap on the food, so its a good thing IMO, but yeah I may wrong on that one :p
