beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Great spot! They had  variety of veggies and meats and pricing is awesome. Must try the entry level spice broth . For a person that don't eat spicy foods, it had me wanting more. Gillbert was my waiter and he was very informative and always made sure we had everything we needed.
