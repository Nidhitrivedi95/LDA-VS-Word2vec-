cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Brought my guy here for his birthday and I must say that the decor of this place is pretty interesting.  With giant wooden chairs, petrified wood, and even a boat, it makes for some nice eye candy.  The food itself was pretty good with a nice sushi/sashimi selection, dim sum, peking duck, etc.  Since it was the weekend we all got half a steamed lobster.  We sampled the giant dragon pearl and watched them make one giant continuous noodle strand. Being a seafood lover I was happy to see the salad section had large sized peeled shrimp for me to enjoy endlessly.  One nice touch was the small hand-wash station near the buffet to quickly wash your hands without having to got all the way to the bathroom.  I would come back here again and try to con a few non-seafood loving friends to come along, just to take advantage of their one per person lobster ticket.  (Yeah I know I am a seafood addict and must be stopped)
