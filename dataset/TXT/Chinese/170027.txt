VvSmE1NnTjnaTPHT0WrCaQ This was my first time at a vegetarian restaurant.  The decor is simplistic and clean. The menu is quite varied with all sorts of "weird" dishes.  

I ordered the mango sushi rolls.  They were alright, but missing something. Maybe I am too much of a meatatarian to truly enjoy it, but our vegetarian friend thinks this place is great.

3 stars because I think the menu is a little too expensive. 8.99 for a mango roll with no meat :(.. I can get the same elsewhere for 4.99 at other restaurants. 

Nevertheless, if you are looking for a clean and vegetarian place in Kensington market, you should check it out.
