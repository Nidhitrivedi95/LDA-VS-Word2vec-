LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA Flo's has a very modern ambiance so I was excited to come and try their authentic Oriental food. I was a little disappointed for a few reasons:

- They don't allow fried rice as a side dish during the lunch special (no subs)
- The appetizers tasted like they were frozen and fried up instead of made from scratch
- Kung Pao Chicken tasted very much like star anise (licorice basically) which is not how it's advertised

A plus- they give you an assortment of different sauces with all of the food brought out, which is awesome because I like to dip my food.

Probably won't go back, but a good place to go if you want a quick and cheap lunch with a big group.
