AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I'm so glad this place exists. As we were driving into Vegas, my boyfriend and I (both Los Angeles natives) made a last minute decision to stop by here for some food before checking into our hotel. We've come to an agreement that we will visit this restaurant every time we make a trip to Vegas as long as we are together. We shared the walnut shrimp and the crispy beef. Both were amazing! Three weeks later and he won't stop talking about the walnut shrimp.
