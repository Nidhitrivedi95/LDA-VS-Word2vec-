dWB0HT1nXQ2N8n3bvPKJuQ Without a doubt the best Chinese food I have had in Pittsburgh.  Great service, great flavor and a really nice place.  They have an outdoor deck that is great for people that like that sort of thing.  It's a little bit of a challenge to find, but if you know where the Living Room was located, then this is the place!  The restaurant is actually in Bethel Park but the signage is not real great due to the municipa restrictions.  John took the time to stop and chat for a few minutes. Great place, Great food and we will go there again.  It's our new favorite Oriental restaurant in the burgh.
