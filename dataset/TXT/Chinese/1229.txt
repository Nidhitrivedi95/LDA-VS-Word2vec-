-juOL0eJC6kvf5RLEjoPvA I have been going to this restaurant for the last 4 years. It is the best in Montreal for authentic dimsum served every lunch time. Cantonese style chinese and their main course dishes are excellent too. The restaurant is also very clean and well maintained compared to most other chinese restos in Montreal.

Only negative is the service is generally slow and waiters can come across as a little rude but that is common in all chinese restaurants.

Favourite dishes:  all steamed dumplings, general tao tofu, vegi chow mein, ho fun noodles with black bean sauce..oh and parking is free and easy.

Tip: on weekends the line up for dimsum can be up to 1hr. Get there by 11am and it is generally 10mins.
