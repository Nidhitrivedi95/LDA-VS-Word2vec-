dF-_fcrNyk4iZ5Pc1mr-wA The Jade Tree is one of our favorites both for dinning in and taking food home to enjoy. We really love the Walnut Chicken among the sweet offerings and General Tao's for a great spicy choice. My personal favorite is the lo mein, in pork, although it is also good in shrimp and veggie versions.
Service is warm and friendly always.
Although Jade Tree does not have a bar, Chinese beers and plum wine are available.

We have never been let down by Jade Tree!
