I left Chen today almost in tears, and it wasn't from the hot mustard. Today was the quintessential "one of those days", and I stopped here to pick up dinner for my family on the way home from work. I arrived 5 minutes after the lunch special cutoff, was a total scatter brain, unable to count the correct cash and then leaving my credit card behind, forgetting to order crab puffs and and just generally having trouble articulating what I wanted to accomplish. 

The woman serving me still let me get my takeout from the lunch specials, and had such a genuinely sweet spirit. I forgot to order a drink, and she gave me my soda on the house. She just ...got it. I don't know if it's women's intuition or what but I needed that little bit of goodwill today. Sometimes a free drink and a little compassion goes a long way. I'll be back. 

Also, 
Good food. Like, really good.
