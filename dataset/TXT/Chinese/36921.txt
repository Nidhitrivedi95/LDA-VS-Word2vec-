AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw I ordered delivery from Chop & Wok a couple weeks ago and I've got to say, I'm so glad I did! I've been searching for a good Chinese food joint and I'll be looking no further. The food was fantastic and arrived piping hot (I actually had to let it cool a bit before eating) which is rare for anything delivery. The gentleman who took my order was very kind and the delivery driver was very friendly. The food tasted fantastic as well! We had the orange chicken, honey shrimp, Hawaiian fried rice and crab puffs...all of it was delicious and the portions were large enough to leave a bit for lunch the next day. My experience from start to finish was a total win! I can't wait to order again!
