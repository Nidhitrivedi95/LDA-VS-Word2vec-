JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys thick chewy knife shaven noodles! It's pretty tough to find a noodle shop that makes good shaven noodles so I'm glad I was able to find this little gem. Inside is really cozy and clean- came to dine around 3:30pm on a Saturday and there are still quite a few parties eating there. 

- Spicy wonton: not very good. It's like little Shanghai wonton where it's not big and not much stuffing. There's no flavor and not spicy at all. Highly NOT recommended. 
- Shang beef noodle soup: really really realllllly good! We got it with shaven noodle. Broth is perfect- very flavorful and not overly salty. The noodle was beyond amazing. Thick and chewy!
-beef pancake: this was okay. The pan cakes by themselves are a little plain but the dipping sauce that they give you makes up for it. Possibly worth trying at least once!

There was only 1 waiter working when we were there so the service was a little slow and it was hard to get his attention. But all and all, very good noodle and that's all that matters! Will be back for sure!
