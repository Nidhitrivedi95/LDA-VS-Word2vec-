GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg Awesome sushi-go-round!!! Plates are decently priced and service is great. Ambience is good. You can find all the usual sushi suspects here! I'm A Las Vegas roll type of guy, and they have a few rolls completely tempura fried. Absolutely delicious! Mochi ice cream is pretty good dessert to finish. Sushi tastes fresh too! Only reason why I didn't give 5 stars, could have just a bit more variety in rolls. Saw the same 8 - 10 rolls and hoped when one was finished, they'd replace it with a different roll; but, the DJ kept spinning the same sushi record. Will be back for more!
