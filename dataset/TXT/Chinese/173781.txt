Wa2X66syShuMSVUYAj1C-Q I kind of believed the other reviews so I decided to try it.  The food was very bland and seemed like everything was low in salt.  Quantity was good.  We had Kung Pao chicken which was probably the best out of the three.  We also had Shrimp chow mein and sweet and sour chicken.  All very bland.  I don't need it to be crazy spicy or anything but just some flavor.  Save your money and just go to Panda Express.  And no I don't work for Panda.  We won't be going back.  Just my 2 cents!
