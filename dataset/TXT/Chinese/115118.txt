N_ML37GOTOLtGKWqRnbJRA This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Their lunch menu of specials is huge. Each lunch selection includes a soup, egg roll and white or fried rice. Lunch at $5.95 a plate is a ton of food! The ambience is nice and quiet and the dining room very clean with an open floor plan. Service can be slow so if your looking to hurry on a Friday lunch hour this might not be your place.
