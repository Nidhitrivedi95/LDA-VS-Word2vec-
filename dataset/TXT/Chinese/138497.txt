QOmojzu24dTI2coPjOtu2Q I placed my order via phone at 6:50PM. They said 30 minutes to pick it up. I showed up at 7:30PM. The delivery driver/kitchen assistant came out and asked me how I was doing. I said great and asked how he was. He told me he felt really sick. I should have left right then and there. I let him know I placed an order by phone. A woman let me know it wasn't ready yet because they couldn't tell from what they had written down what I had ordered. I clarified the order indicating no MSG and they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. As the minutes ticked by I was trying to see inside to see what the hold up was. All I was able to notice was the sick feeling delivery driver prepping containers for food. At 8:15PM, or 45 minutes later I was tired of waiting and asked for a refund. They did not know how to issue a credit on their credit card machine and did not have enough cash in the cash register to provide a complete cash refund. How do you not have enough cash in your cash register to even make change when a customer pays in cash? All they had was two twenty dollar bills. What a fiasco. I am completely disappointed with this place. I will not return and encourage others to eat elsewhere.
