gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw I've only ordered take out, which has been amazing every time! You know how when you take home sushi it sometimes doesn't taste the same? Not with Iron Chef, the quality is great and the rolls stay tightly wound :-) Not a bad experience yet and the staff is always friendly when you arrive, sometimes you get a free sushi roll or beverage!
