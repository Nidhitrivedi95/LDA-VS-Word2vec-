AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Having just moved to Vegas from California, I was looking for a good Vegan Asian restaurant. The restaurant is very clean, the staff is friendly and and the service is great. The food is also excellent, it's on par with all the great Vegan places I've been to in California, and the price is great as well.
