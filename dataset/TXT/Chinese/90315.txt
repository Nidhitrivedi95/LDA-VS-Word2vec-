IFXL6wMLBgBSGSiLBjtViA Came here as a group of 14-16 or something for a TLC dinner meet up. Reserved at 6:30 p.m. and me and my friend were the first ones to arrive. Surprisngly it was extremely empty with maybe only 2 other tables with people eating on the main floor. However we didn't start eating until about an hour at most later waiting for the rest of the people attending. 

The staff was extremely nice to us and didn't push us to rush at all and you can redeem your check in offer when you pay at the end :)

I got the free soup bases which was the vegetable and beef, nothing great, just basic vegetable broth with vegetables in it and the other was probably beef bone broth with also vegetables in it but it also had 3 tiny pieces of tofu in it.

The friend sitting next to me ordered the spicy broth and it had lots of dried red peppers in it. I didn't get to try it but from his reaction he seemed to like it. 

The beef slices we recieved had quite alot of fat on them (about 50-60% of the slice was fat) and according to the other table of friends they just got mostly fat (80-90% fat). The lamb slices were nice, I didn't try the pork but no one complained about it. 

What made me really confused was that I ordered 2 watercress for the first round, and it was pretty small so I ordered 3 in the second round and it was the same size/amount I recieved the first time LOL. 

Also, when we ordered beers, the first corona my friend had, had a lime in it. But the second beer he ordered there wasn't?!? LMAO idk just thought it was funny.

Overall they have a really large selection for animal parts such as beef tongue, beef tripe, and chicken feet. The pork blood was disappointing because it had no taste (tasted like pork-blood-textured water.

At the end of your meal you get 1 free icecream scoop and damn do they have a nice selection of icecream, I think they had about 8 different kinds !?!?! Amazing.
