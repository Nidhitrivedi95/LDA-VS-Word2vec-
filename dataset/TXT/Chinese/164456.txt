UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ Very standard Phoenix Chinese.  Pot stickers were warm and not very hot.  Also the bottoms were crispy.  We shared beef fried rice and orange chicken.  The orange chicken was too sweet and the rice was somewhat mushy.  Ambiance is nice and service was decent, not exceptional but not bad either.  Would I go back probably, but I wouldn't say oh hey let's go to that mediocre average chinese place.
