q4QuS-MaVSXbIFkUZlxZ9g This is a restaurant literally down the street from my house, so the convenience factor is definitely a plus. The food is decent, but not usually my first choice to come here. 

Best deal is the lunch menu. Unfortunately it's written in Chinese only (at the top right hand corner of the menus), so you'd need a Chinese reader with you. Lunch menu usually includes Curry Chicken with Rice, Hainanese Chicken Rice, and Fish Ball Noodle Soup. Each one of these three are decent, ranging between $5.99-7.99. Nothing jumps out as amazing, but a nice inexpensive lunch that comes with a beverage. 

Service is hit and miss depending on the time you go. Not the nicest servers, but they do get the job done. Unfortunately, today we sat in the corner of the restaurant, and were basically ignored (as the servers never looked our way). I essentially had to yell in the restaurant just to get a server's attention to come our way. However, if you sit almost anywhere else in the restaurant, you will easily be noticed.

Overall an average place that is relatively quick, with decent food. Not the best place, but it is one of the alternatives in this area.
