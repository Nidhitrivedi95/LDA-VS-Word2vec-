JQrh2cmndqRKwTpVveHPDg Had dinner here today with family after a 1 hour wait. They didn't take reservations for tonight, so it was 1st come 1st serve. My family comes from northern China, so a lot of the menu options felt pretty nostalgic... until the actual food came. Typical Chinese restaurant food, i.e. very greasy, cornstarch-y, and salt-loaded. We asked for no MSG, but certain dishes like cold noodles must come with MSG due to the pre-packaged sauce. The food definitely felt more authentic than Chinatown options, but I was disappointed by the lack of truly vegetarian options (watch out for meat slices in their veggie stir fries) and the copious amount of oil.

Overall-

Food 3/5 - Taste was a times bland (i.e. the okra dish) or overcompensated by the taste of salt or spice. Unhealthy for sure. Decent portion sizes for the mains, but small serving sizes for desserts. Nothing special - I thought my family's home cooking could probably beat many of their dishes. Their Peking duck is supposed to be very famous, but we didn't order it tonight. 
Value 4/5 - Not bad, e.g. $8.99 for many dishes. Family-style, would recommend ordering many dishes and sharing. Unsure if this is true for everybody, but we had to order rice/carbs separately as rice didn't come with the vegetarian dishes. 
Service 4/5 - Friendly servers, but they're really busy, so infrequent service. Food takes 5-15 mins to arrive.
Venue 5/5 - Large (but not large enough since HUGE long line clogging the entrance at all times) and clean. Classy looking chandliers. Clean and modern washrooms. Really loud and chaotic since many large groups and families come here.
