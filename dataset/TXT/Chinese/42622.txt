BCga5CbMqcZLCpxAuln57w If I am craving Chinese I will no doubt head to Panda Wok. I recommend eating in the restaurant if you have not experienced it yet. It is probably the cleanest Chinese restaurant I have been too and its obvious how fresh the food is when you dine in. My General Tso's chicken was nice and crispy and had a great flavor.

Downside, if there is any, there is no alcohol. But then again, you can always do take out. Pro tip: I come from a family of heavy eaters, but this meal is always at least two meals (it usually lasts me three!) So not only is the food good, but it is 100% worth the price
