RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg I wouldn't particularly come back by choice. Sat at the sushi bar and ordered maybe 8 rolls or so to try with my date, and all of them were bland and had no flavor of fish just of the rice. Even got some sushi that wasn't made right according to the description when we asked the chef about it he responded that's how we make it now. Wish I would have known that, I could have ordered something else. The sign outside said 50% of sushi which should have been my first indication that it wouldn't be good. When we got the bill there was no discounted sushi. Oh well. I won't be back!
