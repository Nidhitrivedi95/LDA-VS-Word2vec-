D9bf5U0y_0MnL9wMFc4bKQ OK, super cute ambiance but the food left more to be desired.

We ate:
- Duck course (2/5): While the rice were awesome, the actual duck and lettuce wraps were mediocre.
- Potato Latka (2/5): No texture, no memories
- General tao tofu (3/5): Not bad
- Sashimi salad (5/5): The only thing I would go back for

Probably will not be back :(
