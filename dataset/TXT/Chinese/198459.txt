ZYyi0opV_ivODZ8bU--7Xg This is the best chinese restaurant in Montreal. If you're a local, you know this. I usually go after the clubs close. It's famous for that. So tbh I don't really remember much about the food but I know it was good and it's crowed at 3am. So go.


Update: 
On a recent couple (and more sober) of visits I had the lobster special (2 lobsters for $32) made with ginger and chili. It's so delicious!!! You gotta have that!
