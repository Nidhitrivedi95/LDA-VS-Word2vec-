dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ Please PLEASE do NOT eat here...

A friend and I went here saturday night and had the all you can eat sushi
The sushi looks good on the plate and in pictures but once you put it in your mouth it is mussy and WARM!

We did the all you can eat sushi

The lettuce wraps are lacking flavor and greasy.
The crap wonton are hard and taste stale.
The calamari is OK. Still not very good and was not hot.
The miso soup taste like a can make it from a powder packet from the store.
We had 1 rainbow roll ( mussy and warm )
1 salmon and avocado ( Mussy and warm I also spit out a seed of some kind while eating a piece of this one )
And 1 crunch roll which was just disgusting and I only ate 1 piece .

This is an honest review and I really dont understand why they were so busy when we were there. 

Their sushi and apps that we had were horrible and made us feel very sick after we were done. Very much NOT worth the 60$$ we spent

We will never go back and will stick to our normal sushi place ( Sushi Go Round )
Where the prices are cheap and the sushi is GOOD AND COLD.

Thank you.
