CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw Decent food, ok taste, but quantity is not the best. I believe they could have given more food on my plate. A little pricey for the amount. Of food received. I am satisfied because I purchased a groupon for $12 for $20 worth. They were out of a lot of foods as well, which are the most popular foods at 3pm on a Saturday. Staff was very nice and it was very clean. Ok for a lunch spot.
