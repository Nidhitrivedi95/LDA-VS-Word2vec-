Great sweet and sour pork. Not to doughy or sweet, best I've had in a while. Nothing is really oily, everything was well seasoned and not too salty. Tastes like home cooking. Need to order ahead of time for certain dishes like lobster. 
Great place for down to earth Chinese food without any frills. Like none at all.
