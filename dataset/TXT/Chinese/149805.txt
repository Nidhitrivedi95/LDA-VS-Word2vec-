sQFpfRs1Flcw3evCdI2wpA Came back again last night to grab a quick dinner and was again very satisfied with the food (quality, portion size, and presentation), but the service was kind of spotty. The restaurant was pretty much at max capacity around 7:30PM, so it was understandable that the wait was longer and the waitresses were more testy. We waited to be seated for about 5 minutes, which isn't bad at all considering we didn't have a reservation. But it was kind of annoying that there was no one at the door (no host/ess) to take care of seating, so we had to track down a busy server. Food came fairly fast, but they brought out my main before the appetizer. No big deal overall.

I was really happy with my shrimp mango salad - the presentation was so pretty and it was quite filling thanks to the huge quantity. The Thai tom yum soup (With shrimp) was so-so; better than other versions I've had recently at Suhko Thai and Spring Rolls on Dundas. The soup to content ratio was ok, about 60:40) - I wish there had been more content as no way I would have been full with just a full sized soup. Also noticed that the food options (appetizers and mains) from the $19.99 dinner combo are a bit smaller and less impressively presented. My partner ordered veggie spring rolls and a tofu yellow curry - both looked really basic and smaller than similar dishes on the tables beside us. His mango ice cream was basically a scoop (decent size) in a water cup lol. Our neighbor had some kind of ice cream too, but it was so much bigger and prettier - came in a bowl with fresh fruit garnish on top. My theory is that when you order off the regular menu the food comes out bigger and better looking.
