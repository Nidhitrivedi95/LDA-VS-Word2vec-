AktuBx1W7c3ZdzwuaOp8xg Wow been going to this place for years and tonight just blew me away. Called in for a pick up order some guy answered first time. Gave order ask if I could pay with CC over the phone not able to because had to be present with my card when picking up. Told him my wife was picking it up to just put the order in and she will pay for it. Dude tells me stop yelling which I wasn't I was just telling him to put it in and she will pay. He hung up. Called back and asked if he hung up on me and said yea and he will hang up again...he did.. What an asshole wanted to drive down and handle it in person but not worth my time.

The owners who has always been great to us may want to review their staff. With this type of shit ass attitude business will decline if it has not done so. 

If you don't mind a drive go to New York chinese or better yet if you want really great chinese food go to Wo Fat look them up. I will never purchase from little dumplings and I will let a lot of people know the new staff sucks ass!!!
