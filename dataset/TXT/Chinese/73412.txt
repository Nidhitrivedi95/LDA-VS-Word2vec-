fJCsDc353UC6eUn-kCBrGw Okay, I'm from the Philippines, so basically our foods there are mainly Chinese inspired..we have stir fried noodles (pansit), egg rolls (lumpia) and some other dishes that are just yummy! 
Well I love to cook! It's my passion <U+200D>
For the many 'Chinese kind of' restaurants I've tried, I love them, well you cannot really compare them to the authentic Asian dishes, but at least they try. And of course, they have to have the western taste mix..
As far as the  taste, food presentation, cleanliness and good service. This place is pretty good! I love it here! 
We normally come here with my inlaws or friends during weekends. I always order same thing -wanton soup, grilled salmon and lettuce wrap. A soup and a rice should always be there to complete my meal! lolHubby always tease me, because Filipinos cannot live without rice and 'sabaw' (soup) which I admit! Haha 
I love the ambiance of this place, it's peaceful..I mean I don't like to eat in a noisy restaurant. The place is well kept. And the food service is great! 
keep it up guys!
