n9WOZlk5k868HXRVhKp5IQ I haven't been to this restaurant in a very long time and all I can say is I've been missing out. We went on Christmas Eve since it was one of the only places in town open it was packed we got seated and given our menus but it was at least 10 minutes till we got to order our drinks. Again it was very busy over all the service was really slow and the waitress seemed very stressed not that I blame her. I ordered wonton soup and chicken Lo Mein. Everyone at the table gets to snack on their in house made fried noodles and duck sauce and they are yummy, my Wonton Soup came out hot and very good. And then the Lo Mein came it looked so good everyone at the table was in awe over my plate and looks did not lie it was delicious! Chicken, bean sprouts, green onion, and snow peas. My dad got Cashew Chicken he said was very good  as well and my mom ordered from the Japanese Grill menu Teriyaki chicken with mixed vegetables it was pretty good but not as good as the other things we tried. They have a pretty good looking lunch specials menu as well we will definitely be back!
