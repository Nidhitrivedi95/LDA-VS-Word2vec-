He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw Our party of three came here for lunch today. Fortunately, we got a good parking spot in the busy plaza parking lot. 

We ordered the salmon teppan, eel omurice, and pork cutlet omurice.

- The salmon teppan was delicious! It arrived on a sizzling plate which cooked the salmon to perfection. 
- The eel omurice was, what I would describe as, heaven on a plate. The eel tasted similar to that you would find on eel sushi. The rice-filled omelet was fragrant and made my eyes rolled up. It had bits of mushroom as well, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
- The pork cutlet omurice was just okay. The curry was on the thicker side, contrary to the watery consistency that other Yelpers had reviewed here in the past. Perhaps this restaurant caught wind and made their sauce thicker... than any curry I've ever had! 

The pork cutlet omurice is part of their lunch special, which is the same as regular price but comes with a choice of hot beverage (hot black milk tea and something else like honey tea)

By the end, we were too stuffed to try their desserts but we'll definitely be back to tackle their toast tower. 

Their decor is pretty modern and attractive. Their eating utensils are a mini shovel and mini pitchfork, and were very effective in shoveling food into my face like a barbarian.

If you haven't been, I'd recommend it. Try to come during off-peak hours to avoid parking hassles.
