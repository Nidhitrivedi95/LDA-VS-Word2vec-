gvur69cXFtawJnJbNzFuZQ I frequent this shopping plaza and have always had my eye on Pearl of the Orient - After a trip to several stores I decided to dine alone and try it...

When I entered the establishment I took a seat at the bar, it was moderately busy with a interesting barrage of patrons. There was an old western movie playing on the flat screen behind the bar - interesting choice... The bar had four people, two couples...all of which knew the bartender by name, Scott. He was very attentive to all of us and kind - but he never introduced himself to me, which I thought was odd as everyone was calling him by name. I first asked if I could order something from the lunch menu (and would pay a difference in price) And was told no - Bummer. So I ordered spicy tuna, pretty typical and one of my faves. I ate one; it was messy and tasted old. I pushed my plate away and when he asked if he could box it up for me I said "No, it wasn't very good." He then removed it and carried on... No further questions, no recommendations, no asking if he could get me a fresh order, nothing - Oh, and it still showed up on my bill. The remainder of my food options were a mute point - They didn't knock my socks off (I had the ginger-dressing salad and lettuce wraps.)



The best part about this experience was people watching. I may give this place another shot - but I think there are MUCH better Asian Restaurants
