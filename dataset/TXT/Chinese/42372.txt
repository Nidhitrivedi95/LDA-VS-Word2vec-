bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg Not for the picky eater. Stopped in for a drink before heading elsewhere for dinner. The drink was a very heavy pour(always appreciated) but couldn't decide on on an appetizer because of the choices. I was not the picky eater in this group but just a fair warning to those who plan on dining at this place. Decent place but doubt I'll venture back.
