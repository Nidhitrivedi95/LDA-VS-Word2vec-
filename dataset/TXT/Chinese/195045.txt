zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ First of all, this restaurant is one of the coolest I have seen. It's a 3-story venue made of glass with a beautiful bronze sculpture snaking up the front, and a giant whimsical front door. I came here on a weeknight and it wasn't very busy. Service was prompt and the atmosphere was calm and classy. Sit at the bar if you can--it's pretty cool to watch the chefs make ramen and garnish all the dishes carefully. But beware the bar stools because they are heavy and will bruise you if you're not cautious. 

All of the food I had was delicious. I've never had real (not instant) ramen before, but have seen Chef Chang on Mind of a Chef and trust that, in terms of ramen, it's good. His knowledge of the subject is verrry expansive:

+ Brisket Buns: The best steamed buns I have had. Sweet, savory, umami, complex flavors and nice textures. Add sriracha for some heat.

+ Momofuku Ramen: Of course I had to get the "signature" noodles. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, the egg added creaminess to cut through the savory broth, the nori brought some unexpected flavors and was my favorite part of the dish. I really enjoyed how the composition of the dish allowed me to create each bite differently, so the whole meal was interesting. 

I can't wait to go back! Wish there was one in Wisconsin...
