1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w We eat here often and last night we had a great experience. Normally we sit at the bar but last night we chose to sit at a table in the dining room instead. Brandon was our server-he was meticulous and very knowledgable of the menu. Next time we will ask for his section-you should too!
