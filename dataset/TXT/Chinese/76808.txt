gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw This place is inconsistent. It's usually not good. My cucumber salad was over soaked in dressing and it was mushy like they had prepared it yesterday. It's always hit and miss... I don't plan to come back. There's also one waitress who always looks like she doesn't like anyone! I don' recommend it.
