Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g Without a doubt, one of the best Chinese meals I have ever eaten in Las Vegas! 

Just back from Shanghai, the name of the restaurant jumped out us. We've driven past several times, but tonight we decided to give it a try, and, wow, what a treat! The service was extremely friendly and attentive and the suggestions turned out to be exquisite. Each dish was better than the last. 

If you want authentic Shanghai style food, get over to Bund Shanghai. I just loved it. Clean, friendly, well-priced, and absolutely delicious food. I can't wait to go back.
