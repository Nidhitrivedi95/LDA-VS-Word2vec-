LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA We ordered take out pad thai.  We got back to the condo and realized that there were literally very little to no spices in it that would make us think it's pad thai.  Also, it seems that they use egg noodles versus the classic thin rice noodle.  So, overall, we were very disappointed and would not return.  If you're looking for some meat and noodles in some kind of bland sauce, then try it.  We sat at the bar while we waited for our food  The drinks were ok, just like any other place, however the difference is that they have asian wines here instead of a classic cab or Reisling.  Just disappointing over all.  The egg rolls were "spring rolls" and again not very tasty and kind of bland.
