7P0po-W1w7lKqJGG8UfPgg We wanted to eat at another restaurant but there were so many people waiting in line because of Mother's day dinner so we decided to try this place instead. When we walked in, we saw all the tables have this big clay pot of fish soup, it looked so spicy!!! I don't think we can handle it so we ordered other things. Sweet corn soup with crab meat - it was a very clear soup but you can really taste the corn and crab meat, not out of a can. Shanghai fried noodle, BBQ chicken knees, dumplings, beef patty ...

The best of all that I ate tonight was the fried pumpkin with salted egg yolk <U+91D1><U+6C99><U+5357><U+74DC>. It was the first and most delicious dessert I have tried at the moment. I felt in love with it. Crispy on the outside with soft pumpkin meat inside. Toss with salted egg yolk and sugar on top. I couldn't stop eating it. I know it is unhealthy with the egg yolk but it was too good especially when it was still hot! I must come back again for it in the future.
