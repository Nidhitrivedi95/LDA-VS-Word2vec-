zswdqM8Av3KxVv9o7_6ORA What a pleasant surprise in Urbana Champaign! My fiance and I were visiting his dad who lives in Urbana Champaign and we came to Rainbow Garden to eat dinner. I didn't have much of an appetite when we came into the restaurant but that quickly changed once the food came out. 

I ordered the jajang myun, which is the black bean noodles. It came with a loads of seafood, beef, and vegetables. We also got the sweet fried beef, which was also very tasty. I was very pleased with those dishes, especially my black bean noodles. 

The portions are generous and the food is tasty. Next time we're in Urbana Champaign, I definitely will be back for the black bean noodles or maybe change things up and try something new!
