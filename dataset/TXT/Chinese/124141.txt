opwxvFwYTppE0JgfM4FBlw Been here a few times. Excellent location since it's minutes away from my house. First trip I ordered the beef broccoli lunch special. Great value but the fried rice was a bit bland. Second time I was sick a friend of mines got me the won ton soup. I like the broth but the wonton wrapper was not cooked all the way through and the texture was very doughy. Third trip I ordered the Kung pao chicken lunch special and again speedy service and great value. I will definitely come back for the lunch specials only.
