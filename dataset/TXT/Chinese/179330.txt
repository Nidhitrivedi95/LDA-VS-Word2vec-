X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg This place didn't cost $100 mil for nothing, it is out of this world. Some of the best talent in the world and beat staff in the world. For sure is the best nightclub in Vegas (with Light, XS, and Marquee being very close). The VIP Hosts are amazing and VERRY attentive. The bottle service girls are top of the line, never really had an empty drink. The lighting system is out of this world and state of the art. You just feel like a million bucks right when you walk in this place. A must if you're in Vegas
