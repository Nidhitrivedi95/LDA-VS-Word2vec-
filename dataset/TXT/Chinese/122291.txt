OfqTPtPSQfCVxaSlY4qAxg After a "comedy of errors" last night for dinner, my wife and I arrived at this restaurant.  We started the evening wanting Middle Eastern food, but apparently after 8:00 PM on a Friday night good luck finding one that is open.  Virtually all we went to were closed.  Strange as Friday is supposedly a "party night".  We ended up going to total of 5 Middle Eastern restaurants finding all of them closed.  

Acknowledging this fact, we decided to go for Korean, but in the parking lot, we saw the Best Hong Kong Dining was open and changed our mind for Chinese.  Now, we knew about this place.  We had driven by it many times as the Korean restaurant and market share the same plaza as this Chinese restaurant.  

We went for dinner at Best Hong Kong Dining when we found that to our delight they are still open at 8:30 PM!  

I ordered a seafood and bbq hot pot.  My wife ordered a seafood chow fun.  I kind of knew what chow fun was, having eaten Chinese food often enough while an undergrad in the early 1990s.  

As far as the hot pot, I ordered it expecting something more like a "lau" or soup.  What I received was more of a "stew" cooked in a clay pot.  It was surprising, but it was tasty.  

My wife enjoyed her chow fun.  When I tasted some, I found it to be tasty.  I remember eating chow fun back in the early 1990s and it tasting so bland!!!

Anyway, we both were content with what we ordered.  We plan to stop by again for lunch or dinner soon.  We wish the restaurant well.  We want to see more business though.  It was still a bit quiet when we were there.
