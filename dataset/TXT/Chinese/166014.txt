vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw My girlfriends favorite Chinese place. I'm not sure what the crunchy noodle dish is, but it's crunchy, flavorful, and delicious.
 The shrimp are fresh, and they cook everything when you order, as opposed to flash frying to heat it up.
I am NOT a fan of fish tanks that are dirty, with miserable fish swimming and nothing else in them, no decorations or anything, which is one star off. The food, almost all of it, has the exact same texture, the exception being the aforementioned crunchy noodle dish, which is the other star I knocked off.
 I believe the delivery times are limited, and I'm more comfortable ordering person due to a slight language barrier. It's so close to home it's a quick drive.
 They are next to Subway, and parking right in front is limited, walking a short distance opens up the entire swap meet parking lot there, and it's not far at all.
