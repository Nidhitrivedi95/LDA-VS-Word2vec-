Ly48L1qSRdLpCSWcs_DWIw Staff didnt check on us, food was So-so. 

Squid/Fish Balls were a tasty appetizer. 

We weren't given the option for dessert. Server walked up, told us register was closing so they were billing us now. (This was as we were finishing our dinner, and wasn't 10PM yet) They did this to everyone there at the time, but it would've been nice to have at least been asked if we wanted anything else. We had hot tea and hot food in a warm restaurant, and would've gladly sprung for something cold.

I had the Malaysian Ox-Tongue Curry, my wife had the Malaysian Chicken Curry. Both were decent.
