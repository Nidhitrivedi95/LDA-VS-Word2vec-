"Congee Queen, 5308 Hwy. 7 E., Markham, was charged Nov. 29 with using a basin other than for hand washing of employees.

Charges do not necessarily result in failure of the health inspection; they simply highlight problems for which the establishments were penalized. The establishments are given a chance to get back into compliance and pass their health inspections."
