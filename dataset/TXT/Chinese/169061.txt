Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Order anything above spice level 5 and they stand by your table with an extinguisher. J/K if you love spice order the red curry tofu level 8. It's to die for. 2nd best way to heat things up.
The staff was super attentive and our drinks were never half empty. I was warned up front of the spice level so there were no surprises except that they actually made it spicy, just the way I like it.
