iRFaq249LVEFGeXLzPULnQ Okay this Chinese dining establishment appears sketchy at first glance but don't let appearances fool you! My co-workers and I hit this place up for lunch and are so glad we did. When you walk in the atmosphere is really clean and well kept. They have great lunch specials ranging from $5.50-7.00 and the food is great! Asian fare that's authentic and really good. We had the shrimp and lobster sauce dish and beef curry. Can't beat the price and food quality. Give it a try and you shall see.
