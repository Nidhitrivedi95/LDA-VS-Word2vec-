CSe9FpalbwGzQcp_h5BVxg So disappointed.  Ordered over the phone specified three times what I was getting to ensure the order was correct. Went to pick it up in a rush and it was $40 for one thing of chicken rice and one egg roll. I felt that was extremely expensive and had asked if it was normal for it to be that expensive for what I ordered and she said yes, got in the car and checked the ticket- they had given me 5 fried rices.  Went back in and they weren't happy that I had come back to let them know I only needed 1 fried rice to go with my 1 chicken and 1 egg roll. They refund the $25 of fried rice and I get home to open everything and have the order incorrect.  I won't be back.
