cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw BEWARE THE ONLINE ORDERING SYSTEM!!

Previous to tonight, I would have given them 3 stars. The food has been good on all three visits (we got takeout). Not amazing, but good. Would love to see more veggies in the Panang Curry, but it's still yummy.

Tonight, I placed an order using their online ordering system. BIG MISTAKE. The timeframe for ASAP is advertised to be 20 minutes. Our order wasn't ready for an additional 15 minutes! When I complained, she said that they don't receive the online orders right away. It gets faxed to them sometime after your place your order. She also claimed to have tried to call me to let me know the order would be ready later than the time provided on the receipt, which is an out and out LIE. I had my phone with me the whole time, and never received a call.

I'm on the fence about returning to Noodle and Rice, but my DH shredded out takeout menu after last night's issues. Clearly, they've been kicked off the list as far as he's concerned.
