8keN8Z2sylAEXgMCJMQpDg Best Chinese restaurant in chandler in the 23 years I've lived here. I used to live in the Bay Area (San Francisco) and was spoiled by all the great Asian food. Until now, all we've had is generic Chinese food, nothing outstanding. The owner (Allen) cares, everything is fresh, and the prices are reasonable. Real crab rangoons, excellent Mongolian beef, all rices good. You won't be disappointed.
