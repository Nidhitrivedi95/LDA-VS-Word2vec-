XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA We were at Eaton's and searching for a quick dinner place. Pretty glad we found this restaurant as it was fast and delicious.  

Came here around 6pm on a Tuesday, and were seated within 5 minutes. Keep in mind that the place is pretty small, so it's probably best for parties of 4 or less. I was surprised by the lack of items on the menu, but it actually made it simpler to order.You choose the noodle type, thickness, toppings, and spice level. I'm glad I went with the broth version, but I'm sure the dish would taste great without soup as well. Gobbled up my noodles promptly, and it ended up being around $25 for the both of us.
