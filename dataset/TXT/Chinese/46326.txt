BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I've heard a lot about how Mother's Dumplings is THE best place to grab dumplings in China Town. Were they good? Sure. Were they the best? Probably not. The service was quick, and the selection was quite large. Would definitely go again to grab a quick bite, but definitely not the best dumpling place I've been to. Nothing over-the-top amazing.
