yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Came here for the 1st time a few weeks ago and have been back many times since then. The orange chicken, spring rolls, crab wontons, and Mongolian beef are some of my favorite dishes. Food comes out hot, fresh and quick. The fact that it's open 24/7 is amazing and convient. I always order my food to go so I have not had the chance to review the dining service. Food is A+, as a local that works at a casino I would 100 % suggest this place to my guests.
