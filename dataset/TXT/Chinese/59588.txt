dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw Bao down to great food!

I have been eyeing this fab joint from Clint's and others' reviews, and when in the area today, I stopped by for bao!

Greeted warmly by Chef Sheridan and Jenny - she immediately answered my questions with what to order: the special with chicken, beef and duck.  I told her the tofu sounded great, so that will be next time!  I got the mango passionfruit tea too (yummy!)

While I waited, we chatted about their business and other general stuff, and I learned that bao is from Taiwan.  I got to sample the seasonal butternut squash soup (it is almost like dessert!) and learned that their chicken rice bowl is a twist on Hainanese Chicken Rice.  Chef Sheridan told me to try the sesame noodles too.

I was served each bao one at a time (I sat at the counter in front of the register and saw the cooking and prep in action) - first duck, with its crispy skin and chives, then the juicy chicken with cilantro, and lastly, the beef which had a nice brisket texture.

Overall, I loved all THREE!  I need to get back for the tofu bao, the sesame noodles, the chicken rice, the smoothies....mm!  I hope I can get over here to make this a regular spot!
