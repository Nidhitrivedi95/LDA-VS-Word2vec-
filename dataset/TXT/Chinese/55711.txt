cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ Atmosphere- Standard Chinese restaurant decor. 

Service- A. The waitress was really patience with us and explained what ingredients we're in what dishes. 

Food- We got the eggplant green pepper mixed, Hang zho fried rice, spicy chicken, and a side of bao skewers. Everything tasted good so I recommend what we ordered. The only thing that was strange was the bao on skewers. It had the lamb spice dusted over the bao and kind of crunchy.
