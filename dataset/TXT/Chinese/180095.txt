X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I didn't come here for a while because I thought it was just a re-branded Studio 54 and that place was hot garbage. In town for a birthday party, I got guilted into going and had an F-in ball! this place is awesome, my favorite nightclub in Las Vegas right now. Music is great on both floors a little something for everyone. It was stupid expensive, like $10 for a beer and $70 for 4 shots of Fireball, but that's expected at any Vegas nightclub. It loses a star for set-up. The top floor is used for the headliner (usually Tiesto/Calvin Harris) and every space is good. Its WAAAAY crowded, but the folks in here didnt seem to care they were in a trance like Jesus was speaking. the 2nd floor was hip hop and the set up was wack. If you don't have a table, you are, in effect, left on the outside of the party looking in. Still, great music, everyone i ran into was friendly and not on the usual instagram model BS. Word of advice, pay the money and get a table it will improve your experience 10 fold. 
PS. i heard they were charging $75 a head (crazy) that night and being stingy letting people in on supposed guest lists.
