My food was ready when I walked in, and my order was correctly filled (something that people who eat Chinese food enough would appreciate).

As for the food itself...I've had better.  The crab rangoon has a plastic taste/texture, and my General Tso's was over-breaded and terribly soggy...and I know it's not the best for take-out, but it wouldn't have been that tasty even when fresh.

The egg roll was okay, and the hot & sour soup was pretty good.

This is a bit of drive, and I'm not sure it will be worth a return visit.
