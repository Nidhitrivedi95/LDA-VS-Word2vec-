Tz5a_AzxWx0gtIAlinr1Ww My wife and I started off our vacation week by going to Fortune Star because we worked at home all day and were very hungry.  We never go to Chinese buffets or any buffets but we actually had a gift card from our wedding (4 years ago) from here that we had never used so we needed to use it.  I'm glad we finally did.  

     I think it's a decent buffet.  If you're looking for great food don't go to a buffet.  This place is good if your hungry and want to eat a lot but not spend a lot but still have a good time.  It's good for kids too which is nice.

     We walked in and this place is huge.  I believe this used to be a Damon's so I can see how the space was utilized.  They sat us down in a booth.  The table and buffet wasn't sparkling clean but it was clean enough for me to eat at and on.

     We walked around to see what they had to offer and they have a ton of food.  I'm not going to name everything but they had almost everything.  I really had my doubts that this food would be any good with the amount of food they had but it was good.  

     Was it 5 star gourmet food no but was it freezer burned food like a review earlier not at all.  It was decent Chinese food.  I liked the coconut shrimp and honey chicken the most.  My wife showed me their sushi which I was hesitant to eat but she liked it and I did try some tuna and salmon and it was good.  They have a hibachi grill in the back and that's what you need to do.  You can get fresh ingredients and have the chef grill some shrimp, chicken and beef.  The beef didn't look good to me so I got chicken and Carrie got shrimp.  It was nice.  Not expensive and we left very full.  What more can you ask for?  Next time we come here we won't eat as much though!  We rolled home....
