zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ First and last pho experience. Very unprofessional, we asked many questions about menu items not ever having pho before I wasn't impressed to be told by our server after our food arrived and we were not pleased that she "prefers ramen bar" and gave us the location. We might have had a better experience of the food didn't have a ton of grease and tasted like old meat. Not looking to try pho again after that experience.
