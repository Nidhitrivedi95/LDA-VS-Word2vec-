9qGnuoT91dg8WtVGVMbWAQ My wife and I had the family dinner. The sizzling rice soup alone was worth the trip. The PooPoo platter was just OK--nothing spectacular, but by the time our entrees arrived we were pretty full. We had Moo Goo Gai Pan and Orange Beef with Pork fried rice. All were superlative. We got a total of 5 meals out of it. Highly recommended, bring lots of hungry people and don't over-order. We will be back to explore the. menu. Really more like 4-1/2 stars.
