S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ This place looks like a cafeteria, but the food is good and the menu is very varied.  Speaking of which, the menu takes a bit of work to get through, but there's definitely something for everyone...including vegetarians.  (see the Gardein selections)

The sandwiches are very inexpensive and pretty filling.  So watch out, if you intend to try a few things.  Save the sandwiches for last (unless you have some restraint...which I do not).
