Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA What can you say?  It's a chain, it all tastes the same and this place is always good!

We had two couples in the group and each split a Changs for two deal.  Comes with your choice of soup (2), an appetizer, two entrees with sides of rice, and a dessert to share.  IT IS A LOT OF FOOD, but it is SO GOOD!  Neither of us finished it all.

Try to eat on the patio if the weather permits or along the windows facing the strip.  It offers a really nice view at night when everything is lit up.  The overall feel of the restaurant is like any other PF Changs, intimate, loungy, and sleek.  This one in particular was more brightly lit on the inside compared to some I've been to in the past.

The server we had was AWESOME, his name was Melique and I hope I spelled his name correctly.  He deserves an award.  He was knowledgeable, personable, quick, and overall a lot of help.

The only thing I will dock this location for is for leaving an entire round table right next to us dirty for our entire meal, about 1 hour.  The table was covered with food, spilled drinks, crayons, napkins and worst of all right by the front door and next to two occupied tables.  I cannot believe nobody came over to clean it!

Overall a great experience and will for sure be back.  Oh and will definitely be eating those leftovers in the fridge!
