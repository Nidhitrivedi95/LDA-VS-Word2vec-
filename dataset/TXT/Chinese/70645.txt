f9ERQpAPOAMv5Ay0kyD3Yw Loved Shanghai Grill! We picked up a takeout order here last night. The food is so good! We had egg rolls and crab puffs as well as house lo mein and kung pao beef. Everything was delicious and ready 15 minutes after I placed the order. This will be our new take out Chinese pick!
