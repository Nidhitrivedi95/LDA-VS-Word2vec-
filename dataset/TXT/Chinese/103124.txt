kjx0Zq21nF9aAK9wpGkmng It's astonishing this tiny establishment can manage to stay open. 

Think of yourself in a 'restaurant' but serviced as if you're in a cheap Asian food court. We had to seat ourselves, and the sparse menu is plastered on the wall for all to see, with various spelling mistakes. The pictures of the dumplings are all the same, but with different labels (ie. pork, beef). 

With one server running in and out of the back kitchen, I was correct to expect a long wait time for my dumplings. 

The dumplings came out overcooked and I do not believe that they are "made-to-order". There was no flavor in the minced meat, which was wrapped with soggy dumpling skin. 

You're better off buying a pack of frozen dumplings and cook them yourself at home - save yourself the disappointment.
