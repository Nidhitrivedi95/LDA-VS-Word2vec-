The 'managerial' staff are good and definitely provides high quality service. However, some of the other staff will take the 'blind/look through approach' and no matter how hard you try, you wouldn't be able to get their attention. 

Dim sum is good and the quality of the food is good. I like the fact that they often make little changes to their menu so I wouldn't feel bored with their food. 

I love the durian pastry!!! The stir fry vermicelli is also very delicious and I definitely recommend.
