pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Wow! The best sushi in LV-hands down!! I've been here many times. The Yellowtail tartare tacos and El Topo roll are fantastic! Lima and Neo Tokyo roll and yellowtail pradita sashimi my choice picks. Service above and beyond-Vanessa is awesome! and patient with my recent visit which had some in our party who are novice sushi goers.
