4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA I told my husband every couple needs a Chinese restaurant they always go to. 

One day, he said we should try this place because they had lots of great Google reviews. Lo and behold! This place is FANTASTIC!!

Our favorite is their General Tso's chicken. 

I love that they bring out little wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce for dipping. 

Service is friendly, in fact, go there twice and they'll treat you like you are a regular! I love that! 

Their meals are cheap and large. What not to love??!!
