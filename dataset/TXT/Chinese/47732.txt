C04pA51n5jPS6KJJHWyuYA Typical Hakka cuisine. It's not bad but the quality of ingredients isn't the greatest. The chicken tends to be a little fatty, and all the dishes are slightly oily, which kind of makes you feel like you've eaten a cannonball. That being said, the food sure tastes good and there's quite a bit to choose from. The lunch specials are a pretty good deal, but mostly rice. Not a bad place to get some Hakka food if you don't feel like venturing out of the neighborhood.
