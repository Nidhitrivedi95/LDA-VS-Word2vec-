aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ I love this restaurant and the food. BUT...this location was my worst experience. 

So I visited this location while walking around Eaton Center in the downtown area. It was lunch time and we wanted to go to one of our favorite restaurants. We ended up at this location and sat down to order our meals. The waiter came to our table to take our orders. My husband made his order while he pointed out the order on the menu and the waiter agreed and left. When the food came out, my dish was in order but my husbands dish was completely wrong. We called the waiter back and spoke with him telling him that he made a mistake. Now, get this, the waiter...wait for it...started arguing with us blaming my husband that he ordered that dish that was on the table. My husband politely kept refusing saying that he ordered another dish and pointed at the dish he wanted on the menu. The waiter kept getting ruder and argued back with a harsh tone blaming my husband that he ordered the dish on the table. Frustrated and surprised, I asked the waiter to take the dish back and call the manager. When the manager came, to our surprise, he didn't even show any sort of care or professionalism to work this mess out. Even more frustrated now, we asked them to charge us for the drinks we ordered and let us pay and leave. Get this...they agreed and made us pay for the drinks. This restaurant and manager did not care to rectify the issue or work at fixing it. He didn't even seem interested in making the customers happy. It was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant. By far, the worst manager and worst location for this chain. Sad!
