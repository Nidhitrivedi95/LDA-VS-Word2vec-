wFTUOOJ_0quggjgXOpP7DA The food is good but i hate the fact we had stale chicken on top twice now. Every Friday we order food. Usually 2 safire chowmein and 2 safire fried rice and it was quite tasty but the chicken on top was dry and hard. I can tell it was chicken from the day before cause usually when there is left overs at home the chicken get that way. I give it a 2 star rating cause if it wasn't for the stale chicken they give you it would have been 4 stars for me.
