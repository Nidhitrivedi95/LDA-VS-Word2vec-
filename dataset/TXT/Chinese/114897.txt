myw0csRck6XG4w5Z-EFyqg Had a coupon for 15% off so we thought we'd try it. BBQ pork slices had, um, BBQ sauce on it. I mean like Kraft brand. Needless to say, didn't like that. The Dragon Bowl spicy chicken was not too bad. Mostly onions though. Other half had the orange chicken. Orange chicken was okay. Once had it where they added orange marmalade as a sauce. This was sweet but not as sweet as that one was. Not spicy enough but most orange chicken isn't even if the menus always say it is a spicy dish. Sigh.
