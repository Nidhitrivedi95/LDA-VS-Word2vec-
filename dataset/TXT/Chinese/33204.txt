a5--WEPUdH7smreNuqj4aQ This place needs negative stars! The only good thing I have to say about it is that after argueing with the cashier, we finally got our money back and were able to go somewhere else to eat. Both my husband and I were not happy about the thought of paying $18 to leave still hungry.   I wanted to like New China, but the food was all cold, either tasteless or tasted spoiled, I couldn't find someone to get me water to drink and some things tasted spoiled.  I spit more food into napkins than I ate and finally, after going back to the buffet to try a few different items (all equally disappointing and spit into napkins) I went to the cashier and asked to speak to the manager.  she asked to see my receipt and then proceeded to argue that we'd been there for 20 min. and obviously had eaten something and claimed that in the 13 yrs of their business no one had ever complained! Seriously??? After showing her our plates with rejected food and napkins filled with garbage, reluctantly, she refunded our money.  My advice to diners is to go somewhere else. I should have read these yelp reviews before trying new restaurants.  We had a burger and fries at Five Guys..they never let us down!
