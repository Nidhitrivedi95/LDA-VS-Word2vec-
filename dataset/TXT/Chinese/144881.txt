rwKJHC-DE2aLTZiS_xFy7g Magic Noodle's new expansion to their late night eatery is in my opinion, not so magical. The establishment itself is actually quite modern and the appliances are all new and spiffy, but the food is supposed to be the main star of the show, and unfortunately, it was not. 

I ordered "The Magic," which has a lot of random stuff included. I was excited because the pictures looked very yummy and appetizing, but when the actual food came out, it was uninspiring and quite sad looking. Yes I know it's not supposed to look the same, but the differences are big. It was also an ok taste and size. I was not that hungry when I came, and I was not that full when I left. Magic Noodle is known for their tiny appetizers, but I am pretty sure their prices went up so all the dishes are $4 and up. This makes me not want to order anything because the money issues are real and I can get 2 McDoubles next door instead of a small plate of seaweed salad. The service was inattentive and uncaring.

I give this place 3/5 because while the menu is nicely updated and the decor is modern, the food quality was not amazing and the service is lacking. This place is quite a drive for me and I wouldn't come back again unless I was in the area.
