hQMx2ZbGAa_oxJNpnTZf8Q In the ongoing challenge of trying to find somewhere to eat that isn't a chain we decided to give The Diner a try, it's right down the road from where we live but we never think about it. 
I had the tuna melt which came with fries and I was thrilled, it was a perfect diner tuna melt with nothing fancy in the tuna salad and your choice of cheese (provolone, do the provolone) and it was huge (I ended up taking half home). My boyfriend got the spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs which came with a salad, the sauce had lots of tomato chunks in it which he wasn't thrilled about but the portion was huge and he took about half home. It was about $30 for the food and 2 sodas and for the portions being as big as they were that wasn't too bad. Their menu is very interesting from the traditional diner things to pizza & subs to chinese food. The dessert case looked amazing.
The decor is great, it looks like an old diner which I love. Parking was no problem and the service was great. It's not really big inside so I'm sure you would have issues finding a table during peak times.
