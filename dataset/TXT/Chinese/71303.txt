FcNtrDGaWmkDzlHaq9F1UQ I always love coming to Toronto to visit friends and see the sights. Every time I'm in town, I have to come to this place. The food is always so good. Sometimes the wait staff can be a little chilly as far as reception is concerned, but has always been spectacular. The food came quickly and, as mentioned before, was very good. Definitely, I recommend this place for business lunches. I will be returning here when I return to Toronto.
