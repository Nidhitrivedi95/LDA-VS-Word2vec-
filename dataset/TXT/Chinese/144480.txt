RvwZqjdkZ_pER0moPXLZAQ This is probably the best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh for what it is.  There are others which seem more authentic and popular with people who are Chinese (e.g., Tasty restaurant on S. Highland), and others yet which are super upscale (Richard Chen's in Eastside --also off of S. Highland).   This place has a great chicken with green chili peppers and a number of other dishes.  The bubble teas are also wonderful.   A couple of dishes are kind of goofy, like a chinese version of chicken fried chicken steak.  I am not sure if this is actually a modified authentic recipe or a pander to American palates in the worst possible way.  In any case the chili chicken makes up for most transgressions.
