6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q standard chinese food... nothing spectacular... except for the price, but youre in vegas and youre right next to the wynn casino... so i guess you have to  suck it up...
anyway out of the pan fried seafood noodle, mongolian beef, and garlic bok choi, the noodles were the best, beef next, and then bok choi...
oh yeah... the rice is jasmine rice which i am not a fan of... i like my rice sticky... you can order brown rice as well...
