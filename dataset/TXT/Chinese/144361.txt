rv9T1qGHbh9eXqFpKEPy_A This is really solid Americanized Chinese food. I live just about a mile away, so we get take-out every now and then. I honestly believe the low reviews are because of the fairly high prices. I do wish they would lower their prices--we would get take-out more frequently if they did because their food is good. Our last take-out order, we got the moo-shu pork, shrimp with vegetables, house fried rice, and one egg roll. Our total with tax was $40 (as for the reviewer who ordered for four and their total was $110 - they must have ordered a crazy ton of food. My family doesn't eat like pigs). This fed my family of four for dinner, and I had enough leftover for my lunch the next day (a big lunch too. I was stuffed). 

Quantities are not always very big. I love moo-shu pork, but they give you very little for $10. If you eat it in the restaurant, they roll it into only two pancakes and serve it like that. If you empty those two pancakes, it amounts to very little, but it's still very tasty. I also like to take my daughter here so we can sip tea while we wait for our meal. The ambiance is lovely.

Anyhow, if you need a Chinese fix, this is a good place, but be prepared to spend more than you would at your typical cheap Chinese place. The food is good, though, the decor charming, and the service friendly.
