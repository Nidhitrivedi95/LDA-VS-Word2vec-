D84t4wCarKR7h9lbWZDFmQ Decided to come to Tang Dynasty Best Food to order a Fried spicy pork chop rice box for lunch today. About 5 minutes later, I received my order and started eating. I noticed the pork chop and also the rice was cold. Went up to the counter to tell them the food was cold and they remade it.

The Fried pork was not spicy at all.

Don't think i will be coming back anytime soon
