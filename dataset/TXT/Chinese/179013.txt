x8_vFLAheiN5sfZEE9YPew Maple dragon is a great Chinese take out or eat in restaurant.  My favorite order is the sesame chicken with 'skinny' noodles.  I have never tasted sesame chicken  that taste so fresh before.  They cook your food to order so it is not sitting around and served stale.  

The prices are reasonable and the menu selection is vast.  The sweet front desk clerk is the best.  He always has a smile on his face and he is very personable.  If you are in the area and are craving Chinese food check out maple dragon.  I promise that you won't be disappointed.
