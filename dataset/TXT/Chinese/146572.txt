S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg OK, so I'm biased. Eaten a lot of duck around town but this is my favorite. Best roasted duck won ton noodle soup...ever! Flavorful, crispy skin, perfect noodles...yummy. My other favorite that the rest of the table had was crispy kau chee mein w/cake noodles. Gotta go with the cake noodles. Good ole comfort foods.
