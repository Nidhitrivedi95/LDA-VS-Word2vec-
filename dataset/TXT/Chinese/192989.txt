ZckxLuc9lpz9LDAQlMKWiA Today's experience left a pretty horrible image in my mind. The service was bad, as in the waiters weren't cleaning the tables and when you were done with your meal they didn't bother to come and take the plate away plus the manager or boss whatever had a really bad attitude. For dishes that expensive i wouldn't go back ever again. As harsh as it sounds, going to Mcdonald is better than going there.
