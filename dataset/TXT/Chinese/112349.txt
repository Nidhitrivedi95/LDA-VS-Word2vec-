mGCOI83lIiDfc4cEOtmZlQ My friends and I came here after the day club and were starving. There were many options at the food court but once I had a delicious bite of the orange chicken sample, I knew I definitely wanted to eat here! I got the 2 entrees and 1 side combo with orange chicken, mushroom chicken and half white rice/half chow mein and danggg was I satisfied! I love Panda Express but this place topped Panda Express by twentyfold! The food tasted like authentic Chinese food, something that my grandma would cook for me. Really good food for food being served in a food court. It was also decently priced for the amount of food they gave us (around $8 for the combo) and especially because things in Vegas can be so pricy. A good place to go to satisfy your Chinese food craving :)
