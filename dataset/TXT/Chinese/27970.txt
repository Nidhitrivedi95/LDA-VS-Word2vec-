8gVq0xCXVeAAS3-nsifAgQ Seems to have gone downhill -- I was there in 2010 and had a decent cashew chicken, but this last time was bad. The rice was blander than minute rice I make at home (and I'm very bad at making rice!). Service was rough and slow for the product. The chicken was OK but no better than cafeteria or Asian restaurants that don't claim to be "fresh". Very disappointing, the concept could be an Eastern version of Noodles and Company.
