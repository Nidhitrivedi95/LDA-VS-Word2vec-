sr0rCMn-XtKATvl9adYQxA After my solo visit at Double Ming Chinese Dessert, I have the honour to accompanied a few other yelpers for 2 separate occasions and able to try more of their dessert offerings! And I have to say I am more and more impressed!

Janelle W was almost tricked in thinking hasma is a fungus... when I wiped out my phone and googled that and now at least she knows what she is getting herself in and she could not resist in trying that! 

When you can eat frog genitalia, grounded turtle shell in essence Jelly just like a walk in a park... 

I always trying to explain to my fellow companions the reasons behind why we eating all these Chinese desserts.. how healthy it is.. blah blah blah.. but that always fall into deaf ears, because basically they just ignored me and went "hmmm, ahhh, so delicious!"
