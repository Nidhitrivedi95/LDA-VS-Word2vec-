nMo0ozHO7cqsPaxw_7N6ow I've dined here several times and the dimsum is ok. It's definitely hit or miss here. Sometimes the food is nice and hot and other times the food is ice cold. This place isn't the best dimsum I've had but not the worse I've I've had either. Considering i don't have much dimsum options in CLT this place will have to suffice. I really wish CLT offered better dimsum options like NYC or Boston does.
