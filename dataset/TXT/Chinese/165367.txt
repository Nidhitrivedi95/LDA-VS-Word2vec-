v-E_fwn4CesE_rdmxvwvSQ I know this location just opened so I didn't give them 1 star. They have some things to work out. It took quite a while for them to get fried rice out and they weren't upfront about how long it would take. Also, the person that scooped my entree put it in the container knowing it was going to be a bit until they got the rice out so the entree was out of the heating area for a while.
