A6lKCuTrDSJ_eFKyumZCJQ Love me some WuHu Noodle! Been there twice in one week. It was yummy food sit in and as take out for dinner at home. So far we've tried the duck (delicious!), pork, sticky buns (both kinds), ragoons that have an awesome curry flavor that makes these unlike any others, orange chicken made with real frik'n oranges not some nasty canned business, spring rolls....pretty much half the menu! While at first there was a small wait during lunch rush, I got my take out dinner order and was in and out in 15 minutes. Totally delicious and not at all expensive. Cute little spot for lunch too. I'll easily be a regular. Besides, it's an excuse to play my wonder woman slot machine :)
