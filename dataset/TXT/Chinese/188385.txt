yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA We came here for lunch to give it a try. REGRET!  Absolute TERRIBLE service.  We were greeted by a hasty waiter who gave an angry disposition.  They gave us the menu and came back a minute later to take our orders. It would take me at least 5 to decipher their menu. 

In addition, one of my friends and I ordered similar pho but with slight differences in meat. One was large and the other was small.  After they brought out our food we started eating. 5 minutes later they came back to say that our bowls were mixed up.  For one thing, there is no noticeable differences between a large bowl and a small bowl. Well no use complaining about that anymore.

The pho quality was somewhat substandard, salty, and lacked effort.  I know its Vegas, but there are many pho restaurants in the area and I've tried one a few blocks down Spring Mountain that actually has tasty well made broth.  This place did not give a lot of meat either.  

I can only tell you that I am not coming back here.  It does look clean and all, but you will not be satisfied, just like the many visitors of Vegas who gave this place a try.
