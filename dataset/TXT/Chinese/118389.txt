nlU0Gp7KCN2hjIzcTdWy0w Everything tasted fine, it was just "off".  The sweet and sour pork wasn't like anything I've had - the sauce was similar to orange or sesame sauces at other places.  Also, I'm pretty sure it was chicken, not pork.  The sesame chicken is tangy/sweet but again, not like the standard sesame I've had other places.  The egg rolls had good flavor but VERY greasy.  The crab puffs are good, filled with crab & onion with just a touch of cream cheese; not overpowered like others elsewhere.  The chow mein is good, a bit salty.  Although nothing was gross, we won't likely go again.  It was absolutely fresh, however, cooked to order!
