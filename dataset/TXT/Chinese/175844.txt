WLCdg4ib7-_7b8epoXRjAw I really like this place because it has a more unique and exotic selection than most Chinese restaurants.  I've always been a big fan of sesame chicken and this place really does it right.  I know that doesn't sound very exotic, but it's what I like.  They get your food to you very quickly, which makes it a nice place to come if you're in a rush.  The only real down side is that the dining area is kind of small to actually sit and eat in, but it's perfect for take out.
