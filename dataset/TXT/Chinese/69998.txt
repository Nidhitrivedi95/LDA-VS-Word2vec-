I really do not like it when due to the waiter or waitress not understanding English, they mess up the prder, than blame the customer.  So, very pleased with that.

The food was also excellent.  We both had different variations of the lamb.  Both very good.  Came with fried rice, which had an excellent flavor,  Wanted the Peking Duck, but at $32.00 I was assuming it would be for two poeple, but there was the langiuage barrier again, and the waitress stating, well, something I did not understand.  So, no loss.  

Also, very nicely decorated inside.  Overall, a very good experience.  Will definitely go back for the lunch.  They have a three roll with soup sushi lunch special that is cheap.  I really want to try it.
