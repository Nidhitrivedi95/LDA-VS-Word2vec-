b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag Came here for the breakfast buffet and it was delicious. I have a gluten sensitivity and dairy allergy and the servers and kitchen were incredibly accommodating! I was able to order an omelet and even eat a couple of things off the buffet. Very helpful and friendly staff, great food.
