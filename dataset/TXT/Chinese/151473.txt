szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A I think when you have great company to go along with great food, those calories don't count. Right? Well, that's how I'm looking at things today because Great Wall not only made my tummy very happy, but I'm graciously looking forward to going back again soon to mack on their delish cuisine.

Robert M and I met some of his coworkers there this morning at 10:30 and were treated to some of the best and most affordable dim sum in Phx. Like, San Francisco good and affordable. I won't pretend to know the names of much that we ate but I can tell you everything was mighty fine. And the four of us were stuffed by the time we stopped eating and for $14.07 a person. Somebody hit me!
