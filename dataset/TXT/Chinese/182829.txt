XJo_kPFlbuORqL-mE2Ny6w We went on Saturday night a littler after 9 p.m., unfortunately they weren't expecting the last minute rush and I'm assuming sent some of the workers home before 10:00 so they were a tad bit slow. The food was hot and fresh when it came out which made the wait worth it. The waiters and waitresses were nice and were very apologetic for the wait time and compensated up by not charging us full prices and taking things off our bill due to the extended wait times which is something I greatly appreciated. The raspberry mojito was pretty good and the strawberry lemonade was tasty. The spring rolls and potstickers were cool but nothing to write home about. I LOVED the mango sesame chicken and fried rice!! My boyfriends sweet and spicy chicken was also to die for. Overall I will definitely return since they were friendly and had pretty good food.
