O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw May I say, Rol San's dim sums are as authentic as the ones you can get in Hong Kong (this is a great compliment as I grew up in Hong Kong and was in a dim sum restaurant twice a wk for 20+ years). All types of dim sums are on an order sheet. So, we can choose what we want without dealing with the pressure given the stuff pushing the dim sum carts. Because of the amount of customers, most dim sums are freshly steamed and hot! Temperature is the key to deliciousness. Must tries: Steamed pork dumplings (<U+71D2><U+8CE3>), steamed squid (<U+84B8><U+5C24><U+9B5A>), and sticky rice pastry (<U+54B8><U+6C34><U+89D2>)!!
