5XX1w4WbwSlrACQ5vKuLDw Humble, friendly, fresh-faced Pho on lower St Laurent, totally willing to switch up spicy soup options to make them vegetarian for me, careful to warn me that the broth would still be chicken. The resulting soup was light, spicy, not oily, or too spicy, and amazingly aromatic. For $8!

The decor is simple. The ceiling and the storage area are both a tiny bit unfortunate and on a rainy day so is the basement smell, but the soup! the soup! Curative for sure.
