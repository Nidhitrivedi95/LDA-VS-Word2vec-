vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw During my recent trip to Vegas I figure I'll steer off the usual path and see what the locals truly enjoy here... Looked up online and found Food Express and decided to give it a go...

Despite the fact that I've already had an early dinner, I was craving some salt and pepper pork chops so that was my target all along!  

Well... gotta say that their S&P pork chop was pretty good... but since I'm from LA, I guess I've had similar quality?  But nevertheless it was made pretty tasty.

I wanted to try other dishes so there will most likely be a future review from my next trip...  Thus hopefully increasing the star rating at least one star higher...

If the food is good, you may ask why I gave it a 3 stars?  

To me... if a customer gives you a bill to break for your bill even though it's not much of a change, you should always give back the change and let the customer decide what to do with the rest of the money... well, the guy hands me my food and said thank you....  I was going to give him the tip anyway but I didn't understand why he didn't place it in the tray and let me make that decision.... why does he have to make that decision for me?  Yes... I'm Asian, but I definitely would never do that because the change is still "not my money until given"  So that irked me quite a bit even if it's a little bit of chump change...

Hopefully my next visit all the food will be fanstastic and that they will actually give me my change back.... if not, I'm gonna once again raise hell on yelp about it for sure!

Don't mind my rant.... enjoy your hot and crispy pork chops!
