IDPbmH1OIhEbb9OIQyDJgw I'm not a vegetarian but surprisingly enough, when I ate the food here, I didn't seem to miss the meat at all. It's amazing how they can use tofu and soy to mold it into mock meats that taste and have the same texture as real meat! 
The food portions sizes are also pretty big and they come out fresh and hot. Not to mention the prices are great as well. I ordered a plate of roasted pork, fish maw soup, fried rice, and a taro bird's nest to share among 5 people and the bill came up to around $40! I'll definitely be back as their service is also fast and efficient which is a definite plus!
