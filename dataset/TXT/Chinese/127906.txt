pe20N--YSUZlKYa-WaSfJA Yet another buffet. Yet another mediocre meal. I think I see a recurring theme at buffets. They pour their money into design with things like statues, running water, or other trivial things to set the ambiance. Then, the food. Sure they have a nice variety of food, but what about the quality? I think there's a formula into opening Chinese buffets. You must be wondering, why do you go to these restaurants then? Good question, I think it's so I have a scale of what other restaurants can do. 

This is another one of those Chinese buffets that follow the nice ol' formula that I've seen fail time and time again. Starting off, they do great, but after a while it just starts to be a let down. I had about one plate of food (if you read my reviews you know why) and well it was okay. Nothing special. Very mediocre. 

They have sushi, hibachi grill (which is like Mongolian style, but they just use the hibachi grill... In that you pick what you want, hand it to the cook, they cook it, then you get it back), "Chinese" dishes, desserts, and some other frivolous things, pizza, Mac n cheese, etc. 

Final thoughts: expect grand ambiance and design, and mediocre food. Hey, but for the price... It's a winner compared to other buffets. (12.99 on a Saturday night)
