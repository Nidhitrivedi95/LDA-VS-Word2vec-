1uPQTz5XZSWr0ti7kUpaDw Holy dumplings! I swear I saw the clouds part and a light shine down as I chewed.
I got the beef and coriander pan fried dumplings. Since they're made to order it was understandable why it took a longer than other places. Yet, they came out piping hot and in big portions. I'm not a fan of dumplings or dim sum, but the flavour was phenomenal.
I also ordered the cucumber and jelly fish salad. It was a nice crispy texture of cucumber throughout, but they skimped out on the jelly fish and I found it too salty.
If I ever return to Montreal, I'm coming back here because they're the only place that can satisfy this dumpling craving I have.
