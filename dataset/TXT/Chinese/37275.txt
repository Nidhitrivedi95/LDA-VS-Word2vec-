An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg This location is not as good as the hwy 7 location. The peanut chili soup was not as rich and flavourful as the other location. 

Service here is also spotty (even for Asian standards). We got yelled at for waiting outside instead of inside even though there was no space to stand inside. While I don't expect 3 star service I also don't expect to get yelled at by the restaurant staff either. 

This is a choose your own adventure place where you get to pick soup, toppings and noodles. The hostess asked us to fill the form while waiting. So I asked for a piece of paper and she snapped back and told me to go get it myself. While I'm fine to fill in the form in advance, but if I'm doing this for your revenue maximizing benefit and not for my enjoyment, a little politeness would go a long way. 

The crowd at this location is somewhat grimey too. The patron to the table beside me kept coughing but did not cover his mouth. Felt super sketch throughout my meal. 

Overall, I would not come back to this location.
