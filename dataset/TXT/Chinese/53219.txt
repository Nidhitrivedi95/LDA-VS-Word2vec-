cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw I'm so glad we tried Yaos. We ordered the crab puffs, orange beef, teriyaki chicken and chicken fried rice. Everything was very good other than the teriyaki chicken which was  a bit on the bland side. The food was ready for pick up in 15 min and the staff there was very friendly. Maybe one these days they'll offer delivery but it's still worth the drive.
