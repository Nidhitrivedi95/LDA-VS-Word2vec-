AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA We had a groupon and my husband is a vegetarian so we decided to try it.  My man was in heaven - he couldn't decide what to get.  He settled on the crispy beef and thought it was one of the best dishes he ever ate.  I am a carnivre so I wasn't as thrilled - certainly not their fault.  We started with corn soup - not too exciting.  I had the eggplant and tofu - eggplant and sauce were good - tofu was ok.  

Service was phenomenal.  We couldn't have more attentive wait staff and everything came out quick and hot.  Definitely will be back!
