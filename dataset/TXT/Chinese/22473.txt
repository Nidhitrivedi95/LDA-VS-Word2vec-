6MhY_9EkUkKCvvN8rzXZzg I think I was spoiled growing up. 

I used to live ten minutes away from the best Chinese food restaurant I've ever eaten at. I've traveled far and wide and still nothing matches my home grown favorite. Alas, the ten minute drive would now be a two hour drive. 

Since moving to Phoenix I've been on the lookout for good hot and sour soup. On the advice from Iain B, I decided to give gourmet House of Hong Kong a try. 

I've driven past this restaurant many, many times and never once did I think about stopping. The neighborhood isn't what I'd call inviting and the building itself doesn't exactly say, 'Eat here!' Nevertheless, I had faith in Iain and would see this thing through. 

The menu is huge, like maybe a hundred items deep. Sifting through all of the choices it was nice to see all the usual suspects, but some relatively unique dishes as well. 

Though I came here specifically for hot and sour soup, there were so many enticing options I decided to get a little crazy. 

Takeout Order: 

-Crab Puffs 
-Mixed Veggie and Wonton Soup 
-Curry Beef Stew and Noodle Soup 
-Wunan Beef 
-Sweet and Sour Chicken 

Total: Around 25 bucks! 

Fifteen minutes later I was able to sample the food from the comfort of my home and WOW! This place is legit! For the price I would have been pleased with adequate food, but each item really blew me away. 

The crab puffs were more crab meat than cream cheese, with great flavor. The Curry Beef stew was amazing, with an excellent flavor (they actually put this in two containers, one for the beef and noodles with one for the broth. Nice touch!). The Wunan beef had just the right amount of fire to it, and was just plain delicious. 

I'm already planning my next trip to Gourmet House of Hong Kong. The quality of food is truly amazing for the price. 

Oh, and next time I'll get the hot and sour soup.
