s5fGo1Nieiy6M-fhk_Ywnw We ordered from here on Friday night and it ended up being a very unsatisfying experience for the most part. The sweet and sour chicken is the only thing that tasted good. The General Tso's chicken tasted like they used sweet and sour sauce on it, the egg rolls were mushy and the other 2 entrees we has we're flat out disappointing. We decided to try it because its a little bit closer to us then China One but from now on I will go back to China One. Same price there but far better food.
