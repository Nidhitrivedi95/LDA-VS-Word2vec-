I had the chilequiles and the bean taco. The chilequiles were quite good, but the chips were soggy by the time I got them from all the delicious tomatillo sauce. The bean taco really wasn't impressive. It was covered with raw onions which kind of ruined it for me. The homemade tortilla was definitely the standout (I also sat at the bar and watched them being made... Neat!).  Could have definitely stood to have a wider variety of vegetarian offerings.  If they did I would probably come back.
