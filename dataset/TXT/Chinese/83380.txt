hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA I heard this place was good but was very disappointed.  The food did not seem very fresh, had odd, almost dirty taste to it, the bowls weren't very clean, and there weren't as many choices as I thought.   On the positive side, the soft serve was delish, the sushi was mostly good (although the inari was mostly seaweed), and my picky daughter found a lot to eat.  The won ton soup was the best I have had in an all you can eat chinese buffet.
