rdifwelsxkuUf-tw2O4o1g Came in for dinner last night, Mr Chop Chop is a family run business where the husband wife and even the teenage son's were working. 

You won't get fancy decor, it's away from the strip and in a run down mostly vacant strip center. I was a little reluctant eating here, but seeing this family working reminded me of myself working at my families Chinese restaurant years ago - when I was only 15 years old. 

Mr. Chop Chop is tiny place but their food is tasty, has generous portions and is reasonable. I ordered the fish cake appetizer (awesome dipping sauce), Chili paste delight with catfish and yellow curry chicken. 

Overall I was happy with the quality and taste here and would recommend Mr Chop Chop for lunch or dinner.
