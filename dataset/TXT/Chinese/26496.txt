7T3WU-Up01pgCeygbc_K-A i'm not sure what happened but they changed the consistency of the noodles and some of the broth flavors, the noodles are much softer now. the service is nice but they forget about you if you ask for extra noodles, so we always have to ask twice. They also don't let you substitute any of the side dishes unlike Fudao noodle house. We went a few days after opening and I feel like they wanted to keep a line outside on purpose to generate hype. We stood outside for 40 minutes and there were a lot of empty tables that the servers just left empty for 10 minutes before seating people.

I like the bamboo shoots side dish, but I'm not a big fan of the overall taste or price point. It's not bad but I feel like you can get much better price (less than $10) and better quality at Fudao noodle house which is not too far from here.
