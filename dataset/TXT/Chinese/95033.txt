jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg Came here for a wedding reception. DELICIOUS. Really indulged here. Had all kinds of good food. Peking duck, walnut shrimp, delicious spring rolls, delicious fish. The fish was to die for, you better bet I tore that shit apart.

Too bad I live in San Diego or I would come here more often.
