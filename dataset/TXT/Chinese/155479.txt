TkrydveE1Laf_LHoKFALNw Hi I'm from California and moved Vegas about two years ago. I found this restaurant one of the best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is delicious. Try ginger lamb and tofu soups. The owner Lisa is very friendly, ask for any changes in your order for a different spices.
