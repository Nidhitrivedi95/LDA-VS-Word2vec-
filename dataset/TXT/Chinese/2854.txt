_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Came here when I was in Vegas, was pretty disappointing to be honest. All the reviews said "authentic Chinese food" and "best Chinese food on the strip" and all I remember was how disappointing it was.

First off, the location is near the betting areas so I guess you get to watch some sports while waiting in line. The problem is you'll be waiting in line for a long time, at least for lunch. We waited nearly an hour to get in and then another hour to finally get our food.

I ordered the Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup based on everyone's reviews. They made it seem like it was amazing but it was just... okay. The soup was strong in flavor, but the noodles were ordinary and the meat was tender yet bland.

Overall, it was pretty average. The food was decent, but the wait really ruined it for me.
