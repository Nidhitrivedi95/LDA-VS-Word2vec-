1yAbNyUgJhOjCz9EcOCWdA I am sure that there are better places in Markham and Richmond Hill, but in terms of convenience, you can't really go wrong with Forestview. 

Is it the best dim sum I've ever had?  No, and yeah the portions are a bit small...but!

1. They have carts!  What KILLS me is when dim sum places do not have the carts but resort to the menu.  Yeah I know, Shanghainese vs. Cantonese-style dim sum...but I love my carts. 

2. The prices are reasonable.  Dim sum isn't really meant to be super expensive. 

3. The har gao, shui mai, char siu bao, ham sui gau, cheong fung, lo mai gai, seafood congee and etc were all fresh and tasty. 

4. The service, including the ladies pushing the carts, is very good!  If you need a drink, extra mustard, have a question, or your bill, the staff is very accommodating.


I hope they stop renovating soon and reopen!!
