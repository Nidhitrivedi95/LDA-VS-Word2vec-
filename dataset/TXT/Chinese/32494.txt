9Zhiktm7_LYN_uxaT9XEhg I wish there was a way to give half stars on Yelp so I rounded up to 4 stars.  Don't come here for the ambience (3/5) cause that is not what you'll get.  It is a small strip mall type store so very small and vanilla inside.  The food this go round was decent but some of it was a bit off.  I had the general tso chicken which was very good (5/5) but the fried rice did not taste as fresh as before and could have used more soy sauce to up the saltiness (2/5) and the egg roll was not good (1/5) the cabbage tasted too raw and so it was too cabbage tasting as a result.  Still, we'll come again as it is overall good and the portions are huge.
