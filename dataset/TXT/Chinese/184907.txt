xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw Visited this restaurant a few weekends ago. The server asked if it was our first time, which it was. She was friendly and brought us our beverages quickly. We were confused after we went through the line, added our sauces, and handed our food over to be cooked. We didn't know if were were supposed to wait there or if it would be brought out to us. It was brought out to us as we walked back up unsure. The food was ok, but seemed pricey for how little we got. Also, yes I did pile my bowl high.
