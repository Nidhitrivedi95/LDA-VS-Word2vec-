Wqa1JjkSuviehZ7OedhPeA Came to dayali on a cold rainy weekday for dinner at 7 30pm. Lucky for us that we were seated immediately. Our waitress told us that usual weekday nights for a party our size we would require reservation to skip the wait.

When dayali opened few years back, it was always a special treat for us to come and enjoy Peking duck. (Also because mom had special membership card which had since expired.) But this time that we came, our Peking duck was served almost immediately after we put in the order and was not hot. Everything else we ordered was nothing too special either. My all time favourite Chinese yam with blueberry sauce lost its special touch as well.
