WEw08dCcOiwH3Sw1f_8DKQ Decor, space, and service were all amazing 
BUT the food wasn't (mind you this is dependent if you fancy Mongolian cuisine) 
I surprisingly found the curry fish to taste scrumptious but other items such as friend potato and noodles to be bland and in some cases very oily
I would recommend this for someone craving traditional Chinese cuisine but if you are like me who enjoy Hakka style more I would avoid this place.
