dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw Yelp has come through for us once again. We were looking for a weekday lunch while staying on The Strip. Great Bao sounded different & not too far away... Well, it turned out to be a bit of a trek but more than worth the drive. In a corner of an oddly sprawling beauty salon in a strip mall you will find the two proprietors tucked into their tiny kitchen serving absolutely delicious little open faced sandwiches, a few salads & fresh drinks. While we went the way of the carnivore-duck, pork & chicken- there are vegetarian options as well. Each sandwich came with it's own unique & flavorful garnishes-everything freshly & perfectly prepared while you wait. The prices are very reasonable, the service is friendly & solicitous. The only down side is their tiny, somewhat awkward location but even that became part of the fun. Hope these two go on to open a bigger restaurant soon!
