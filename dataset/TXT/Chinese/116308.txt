n72smZw1iVORdnjGfFT0FQ Richmond court restaurant does it all. A bakery located at the entrance butts up to the barbeque pork, duck and cha siu hanging in the glowing red light of the warmer. Drinks are made behind the counter and live lobster are kept in the aquarium under the television. 

The menu consist of the typical Cantonese style cuisine of a variety of fried rice, noodles and congee. However my favorite of them all are the baked chicken casserole on rice with tomato sauce or a cream sauce. The chicken they use is typically fried to give it a nice and crispy texture so it doesn't become soggy when the sauce is on top. This place has a huge selection of dishes like no other and the service is noticeably volume driven. I give this place a 3.5 star because a jack of all trades is a master of none.
