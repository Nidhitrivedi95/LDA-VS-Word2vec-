a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg Having been a loyal customer for several years I had to write about a particularly terrible experience we had on Christmas day. We contacted the restaurant at 2:30 to place an order for pick-up at 5:30. We were told to call back 45 minutes before we wanted to pick it up. When we tried to call we got a consistent busy signal. Finally we sent my daughter in to order and discovered that they turned off their phones without even giving a message for customers to come in. She paid for the order and was told it would be ready in 1 1/2 hours and we would get a call. The restaurant never called and after 2 hours we went in and were told it would be another 45 minutes. Yes it was Christmas day but this experience was pathetic and judging by the other customers reactions we were not the only ones to have to deal with this. There are other excellent Chinese restaurants and they will now get our business.
