U can't get this quality downtown; nowhere close!  And my goodness... the value...  $4.50 for a bowl of noodles and 4 big wontons.  SO GOOD!!!

I've always known about the HWY 7 location but rarely make it that far north.  When I found out they opened up shop south of Steeles, I knew I had to pass up on Ho Ho BBQ for some shrimpy goodness.  

The service is fast.  I think it took about two and a half minutes from ordering to bringing the food to the table.

My husband and I each ordered a bowl of wonton noodle soup and we shared a plate of greens.  Delicious, simple, no frills.  Plenty of firm shrimp in the wontons.  No fillers. I hate that feeling of biting into mush when you're eating wontons.  The noodles...  I love wonton noodles but these ones are extra thin and have that amazing firmness/bite with each chew.  Even after sitting in the hot broth they don't get overcooked?  A miracle!  The greens were blanched so nothing fancy but you want to feel healthy so eat some greens! 

Just a little tip:  If you like spicy, their hot chili oil is like burn-your-mouth off spicy (and I love spicy!).  Start small and add if needed.  I went big to start and felt the burn BIG TIME.  You can buy mason jars of the hot sauce too for all you mason jar and/or spicy fans!  

Next time I'm in the area, I'm going all out!  Wonton noodles AND BBQ...  Oh yes...
