VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg I came back to Vegas to see family for the weekend and was craving some legit Chinese food and some quality Boba Tea.

Enter Boba Hut. I did a quick yelp for places around the area and settled on this place. This was 3 days ago. I've eaten here 3 days in a row.

I ordered their Beef Chow Fun. It was delicious and authentic; so many places butcher it but this was one of the best ones I've had in a long time. There's so much meat and it's so tender. What was surprising was the affordable price. In Chinatown this dish will sell for $10.00 easy. But it's way cheaper here.

Next day I ordered their Saimin noodle soup and man oh man it was so delicious. A large helping of noodles in a perfectly flavored broth. 

Today I had their drunken noodles. As expected, it was bomb as fuuuuuudge.

Every day I get the typical Boba Milk Tea, I'm a classic dude, but they've got wicked different combinations of different teas and add-ins for some Boba variety.

Their service was genuinely nice and cheerful and very good.

They're a new business and I wish them great success because the food is amazing and so affordable.

AND they close late. (Midnight)
