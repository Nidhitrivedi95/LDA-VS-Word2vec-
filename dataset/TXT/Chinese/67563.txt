eMTE-wqpk_YWaV3mf7Ii3A I used to like Spring Rolls waaaaay back in the day.  They had a lot of good dishes that were Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese for a decent price.  The portions are pretty big as well.

I don't know what has happened, maybe I have experienced much better due to the explosion of really good Asian food in the past 10 years that this place leaves me...meh.  

There are now many locations and I think with this the quality of food has gone down.  Just generic dishes now.   I remember once I went on a Sunday morning as they had dim sum and it was the worst dim sum I have ever had and it was pretty pricey.

I may visit it again if need be, but I certainly won't be on my list of go to places.
