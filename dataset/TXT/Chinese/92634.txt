IS_IWMsFRJii__17LsP1Og WHEN IN VEGAS...

If you...
1) Have drunchies
2) Are off the strip
3) Want food delivered to you PRONTO.

Gata Thai Cuisine gets the job done.

So post-dayclub partying in vegas, I usually have a couple questions, 1) where am I? 2) what day is it? 3) why am I so hungry and most importantly 4) WHAT ARE WE EATING or else I'll devour everything in sight. A crowd of us were extremely partied out and heading back home, and per reviews and comparison to the other delivery options, we chose to order delivery from Gata Thai.

We ordered the following and they were all really good!
--Hot and sour soup
--Pad thai
--Pad See Ew
--Orange Chicken
--Beef and Broccoli

Delivery took 40 minutes and food was hot and fresh. Needless to say, we killed all of it.
