xVHzCbDWCwmyavF5PgJRmg As mentioned in a previous comment, always double check the amount they try to charge you, because it's always off by a few cents. I've ordered deliveries 2 or 3 times and every single time I had to argue with with the lady over the phone because she was rounded up to their advantage. Every time, she would turn cold and rude over the phone, and send the delivery guy with still the incorrect amount.
Needless to say that it kind of discouraged me to try again, because surprisingly, when I order in, I don't expect to argue over the bill forever. Anyway, last week end, I went there as I had a craving for their beef ho fun, which costs $8.50. Once I ordered, the lady typed $8.55 as before tax price. I pointed out that she was not using the correct amount. She then gave me the bad look and started to argue. Seeing that I wouldn't let go, she said "it's for plastic bag". So first, you charge me $0.05 for a plastic bad and second you don't even ask if I want one huh. An Asian woman walked in and started to speak Asian with her, so I no longer existed. I managed to tell her I didn't need a bag so she corrected the price, all while talking to that new customer. She then turned to me as I handed my credit card, and again: $0.25 for credit card. I told her to cancel the order because she was being annoying. She just turned around to the kitchen, yelled "cancelled" and turned to that Asian woman and kept talking.
I don't know if the owner sometimes reads the comments online but no matter where I go, their customer service is tagged as awful. Maybe it's time they do something about it.
I'm not Canadian so I don't know how that works here, but I wish there was a regulatory organism to avoid customers to be scammed by restaurants like that, because between that and those that at the last minute tell you it's cash only, it's really annoying!
