O_Yi95nUeeqSudiMlUfttQ This is not a fast food restaurant, they dont charge like a fast food restaurant but they sure act like it is one.
We went it since we saw it is full, which usually means good food or fresh food (due to the demand). We ordered a soup, appetizers and main courses they ALL came Together!.  The food was ok not amazing, very greasy the only plus was that the portions were not small. At the end you need to go pay at the counter (again not a very restaurant feeling). Not sure if I will come here again.
