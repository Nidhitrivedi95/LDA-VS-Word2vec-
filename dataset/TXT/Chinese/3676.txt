_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA we thought noodles or congee would be a good way to soak up the alcohol after an evening of drinking.  the service here is fast, but the foods is so-so.  i agree w/ bennet a.  overpriced and underflavored.  everything we got was lacking in some flavor, even if the soup looked heavily sauced, there was not much taste.  i got the calamari rice noodle soup, which i thought would come in a clear broth, but it came in a cornstarchy soup w/ egg and green onions.  it was ok but nothing to write home about.
