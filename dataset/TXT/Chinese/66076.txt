EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw I am a dim sum fanatic. Go to dim sum in every city i travel. This is just wonderful dim sum:

Fresh, made to order
Great prices
Great no hassle location and parking
Great personalized service
Nicer decor than usual corny dim sum
Several nice aquariums a nice touch ( no you cant order sea food from these aquariums :)
Pretty large selection, even chicken shu mai (usually just pork)
Serving dim sum late, till 9pm.
