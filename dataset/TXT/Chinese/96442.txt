jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow I love this buffet. It is very clean and there is a great selection. I love this place for a team lunch during work time. It's close to the office, quick, and easy. They are very accommodating for a big group. I have 10 people on my team. They all loved it and had a blast. I think the best part of coming here is that you don't have to wait. You get your food right away and there is more time to socialize. 

I will definitely bring my team here again for lunch.
