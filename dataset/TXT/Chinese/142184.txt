RJKbewB0SzRZpIvQmiF-dQ First Time trying NNC today, they left a flyer and we ordered via delivery.  Food was good, nice flavor, hot and the vegetables were so fresh and crisp.  Order was 100% accurate, and delivery was fast.  I loved it, the kids loved it and we will definitely order again from them.  We will probably not order the BBQ Pork Ribs off the appetizer menu again....but, the General Tso's Chicken, Vegetable Lo Mein, Kung Pao 2 and crab puffs were AWESOME!!!!
