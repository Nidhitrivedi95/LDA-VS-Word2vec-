9ibMbke1qYbmhJ2Qf3tWfA I love that you can order online through Yelp. These guys are quick and their pad thai is remarkably delicious. I had them deliver twice. It takes about an hour for them to send you the food, though. That's fine with me!

I had chicken in mine but realized that I can totally go vegetarian, so I did. The tofu is marinated just right and very tasty. It's not every day that you'd pick out the chicken and toss it to your dog in favor for the tofu bites!
