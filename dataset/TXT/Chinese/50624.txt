CGgUHkAKU0QBsdGvXxfMuw It seems Mister Wong has changed their menu around a bit, and that's a good thing! I called in an order for their Kung Pao Shrimp lunch special and it was actually really good! The portions are big for lunch and it comes with an egg roll and wonton. The woman at the register was very friendly. I'll likely be back!
