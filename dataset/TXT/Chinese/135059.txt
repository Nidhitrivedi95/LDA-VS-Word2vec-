qAbXHsddBhmfQFegGiV7Dg Best take-out Japanese!  Have been dining here for about 18 years, and my husband for over 20!

Consistent, excellent quality and friendly service.  We have been huge fans of the teriyaki chicken all of these years, and are trying to work our way through the menu...but you know how it is when you find a good thing!  Never have found any other teriyaki chicken anywhere as good as this.

The owner definitely provides all of the charm of this little place.  Lately, his place has been so busy, there is no chat time.  If it's a slow day when you go, he has great stories to share, just get him talking!  He's a wonderful person.

Good eggrolls, yakisoba, fried rice.  There are so many other menu items, stop in and give it a try! You won't be sorry.
