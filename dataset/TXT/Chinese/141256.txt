re-KZo5dPJPZdK-Abqoifg I only tried this place out because of Risa D's review and I found a coupon on Groupon so decided "why not?". There weren't many people there on the Thursday night we went but I over heard the waiter tell another couple that the weekends are completely booked for weeks.
My boyfriend tried the General Tao chicken and I took the Spicy Basil stir fry. I'm not a fan of General Tao chicken but this place??? The chicken is the best I have EVER had. It was SUPER crunchy deep fried chicken with a nice glaze on top.. the glaze was not too sweet or spicy. It was perfect! The basil chicken was EXTREMELY garlicky but very tasty. But not as good as the general tao. I would definitely go back. For the price? and BYOB... totally worth it...
