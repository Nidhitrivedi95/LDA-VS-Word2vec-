AyOLu1vg-CZtVVhYRKJYAA I have been coming here since I was very young with my family back when it was good China. Now my boyfriend and I are regulars. The food is always fresh and sooo good. The plates can feed up to 3 people! Prices can't be beat. Recommendations: shrimp fried rice, orange chicken, egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, sugar donuts (usual items that we order)
