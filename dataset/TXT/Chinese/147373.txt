SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ I went to Ling ad Louie's not knowing exactly what to expect.  It was like a version of PF Chang's but maybe a little more casual and with better food.  There was ample room inside and they had a nice outdoor seating area complete with misters.  I was alone so I sat at the bar.  It was Friday at about 6:30pm  but there were a reasonable number of open tables inside and out.  I would say it was about 3/4 full.  I started with the crispy calamari (got for Happy Hour price of $5!).  It was a portion large enough for several individuals.  It had sort of a mayo/ sriracha sauce drizzled on it and it was very good.  I coupled it with a 4 Peaks IPA....mmm
I had the Kung Pow beef for my main course.  I guess I was expecting a low quality beef but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and large chunks (it seemed like filet but the server said it wasn't....maybe sirloin?)  It was super tender and the veggies were done just right too.  Service was excellent and it was a fun, festive atmosphere.  I would definitely go back!
