dYU5hXVyPsm7C-T-13I_YQ Sushi sushi sushi! All you can eat sushi! Which is one of the ways they offer their sushi here, for under $21 dollars, all you can eat sashimi is a few dollars more though! I know what you're thinking, you can go to an Asian buffet and they have the same... not exactly though! Here you'll get your own rolls made of whatever you choose and they'll send it right out to your table, fresh! Not only can you choose from a large variety of sushi rolls but there's an appetizer section, soup, and entrées! Yes. I did say all you can eat sushi but they also allow all you can eat in other categories too, if you choose the all you can eat sushi option! Isn't that awesome!!?? These rolls and entrées aren't dinky either! Only catch is you have to finish most, if not all of your food before they start sending out the rest.. they don't want food wasted obviously, and I don't believe they'll give you a Togo box either, unless it's towards your last one or something. But either way it's a great deal! 

Servers there over the passed few years have gotten better, they're a tad bit more attentive now and less of a language barrier.

Recommendations: Chandler Roll, Scallop dynamite[or seafood dynamite], volcano roll, and their bonzai noodles
