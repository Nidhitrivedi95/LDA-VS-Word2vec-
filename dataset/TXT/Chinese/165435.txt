v_xuLfW7TXBsQctpOuPvQw I was excited to try this place because it's a two minute walk from my girlfriends house. We decided to try it today and they had good staff, cheap prices, but awful soup. It tasted like microwaved noodles with tasteless and badly cooked meat, and cheap bouillon cube broth. If you want good quality noodle soup, just get pho from pho hung on spadina for excellent soup at the exact same price. Not impressed at all
