Xfod0UWr_9B-TOM6qxVIwQ Was not impressed with this place at all!   

From the minute you walk in it's dirty and depressing.    I should have followed my gut and left right then, but I didn't.    I was starving and thought I'd just order.   

The California roll was yucky.    It comes with a chunk of fake crab meat.   Not the shredded up kind.      And a little avocado.     Tasted blah!   

The orange chicken was just gross.   I couldn't even get more than a couple bites down.    Meat was full of gristle.     Yuck!    

I will have to find another place to eat next time I'm in the area.
