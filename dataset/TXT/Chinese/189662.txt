yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Since moving away from SW Vegas, away from my beloved Bamboo Bistro, we decided to make Pho Kim Long our main Vietnamese spot, and it hasn't really disappointed!

All dishes that we have tried are very affordable in price and even more generous in servings. We have enjoyed most of the dishes they have served us. 

The usual night hostess is very sweet and helpful, always taking drink orders and actually paying attention to the patrons. I remember when she went out of her way to bring me my soda when our server forgot about it, very awesome.

Speaking of the service, it's sub-par really. Most of the servers we have received don't check on us often, let the glasses go empty for awhile, or don't seem interested in ensuring great service. Being a manager at a restaurant on the strip I have high standards, however I realize that not every business is like mine, and I can't judge other servers too much.

Food, amazing. Atmosphere, very casual. Hours, amazing, 24 hours. Go. Eat. Now!
