W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g I absolutely love this place. This is my go to place. I've ordered lots of thing off their menu and have never been disappointed. Their Thai basil chicken is to die for. If your a vegetarian then you'll love their sautéed tofu and vegetables. Their pho is among the best I've tried in the valley and the closest thing I've had to food in Asia. If you've never been here , then what are you waiting for?! Double time!!!
