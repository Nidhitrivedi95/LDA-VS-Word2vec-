TtaXPsMrTGyPsAlO5LFQ6w I ordered delivery from Tao Yuan today for the first time and am very impressed! The delivery came in under an hour and everything we ordered was exceptionally good! I've ordered Chinese from a few local restaurants a bunch of times and the flavor of this food surpassed all of them.

We tried:
the orange chicken (amazing)
the beef lo mein (also amazing)
Gai Pang Beef (sooo good)

The quality of the meat and quantity of the food was great and large. 

I would recommend all of those dishes. Check them out! I know I'll be ordering again in the future!
