X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I was very pleased with my visit here at hakkasan. Despite the rude annoying drunk people in the line, I thought the bouncers and promoters were outstanding and respectful. Unlike some of these other clubs on the strip who seem to power trip over there status of holding the clipboard. I appreciate hakkasan for being organized aswell. Nice club though and I enjoyed coming here. I'll be partying here again thanks to the promoters. Kudos!
