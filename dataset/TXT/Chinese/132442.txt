pNYrI9kmAvv1TmAmSoJ23A This place was trash!!!! The sweet and sour pork was awful!! I had to spit it out on a napkin! I thought maybe it was just a bad piece and decided to just try another, same outcome. The house fried rice was just so/so. Service was terrible, the Chinese lady w the short hair runs around like a chicken w their head cut off. They had the audacity to charge me for my sprite and when I asked for my money back for the sweet and sour pork she took the difference out of there. I won't be coming back here at all. I had to get up twice to get something myself instead of waiting. Very dissatisfied. I recommend Panda Express instead at least they're consistent!
