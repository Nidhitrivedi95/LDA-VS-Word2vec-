IS_IWMsFRJii__17LsP1Og I live so close to this place that I had to try it even though I was skeptical that a good thai place would be in my area. I ordered the chicken satay appetizer, yellow curry with chicken, and pad thai with shrimp. Overall, I enjoyed all of it. I love yellow curry and theirs was pretty good. Plenty of veggies and chicken and the number 3 spice had good flavor and not too hot.  I've had better pad thai, but Gata's is definitely passable for those lazy nights when you don't want to cook or drive far.  The satay was good too, especially with the peanut sauce. 

I will come back here again whenever I'm ready for a lazy night in watching movies with my girl.
