VGKq16vCdPPHMoryy6XTHg Natt Spil has a super fun ambiance- dim lights, funky wood benches and decor. 

Tonight we had the brie/apple pizza tonight and the dumplings as a starter. They were both really good. Although, we would have liked the pizza toppings to be a little more spread out towards the crust, the apple and cheese were more concentrated in the middle . 

We went on a Monday where there's a deal of a pizza and a pitcher of beer for $17-- not bad! Also got a birthday shot of their coffee infused vodka- yum!

Our server was very friendly and attentive. We had been there before so had an option or two of what we wanted, but he was able to give some good tips.

Great place to go on a date or out with some friends.
