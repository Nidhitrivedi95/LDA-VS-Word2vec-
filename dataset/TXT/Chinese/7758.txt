0VtWeDkqzj9CE3MF0geWYA I came here for a family dinner.  A whole table of 10 of old, middle and young.  The servers were friendly and nice to tables of families like ours; I supposed we were their bread-and-butter clienteles.  The many food items we ordered were cooked well.  They tasted authentic Cantonese and delicious.  We didn't order any expensive seafood dishes, yet the servers changed our eating plates mid dinner, as if this table were high rollers.  The portion was decent, so was the services.  

Fair food, fair decoration, fair services and fair prices.  A decent and presentable neighbourhood family restaurant.  Solid 3 stars.
