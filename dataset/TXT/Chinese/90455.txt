IFXL6wMLBgBSGSiLBjtViA It was an average day walking up Spadina heading towards our usual dumpling spot when we fancied a shot of tequila to warm our chilled bones then BANG! We stumbled upon this gem of a foodery. Where do I start?? The servers speak great English, and explained how the menu worked, but best part is.... He noticed we were absolute new bags and literally took away the sauces we had proudly made  from the "sauce bar" and brought his own creation. I wanted to dislike it but how disappointed was I? He made our first bites for us and it was freaking AMAZING.
Best all you can eat I've been to in a long time. I can die happy (and 30lbs heavier) now.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Dat (our legendary server) for this fantastic experience. We will be back tomorrow. And the next day. And maybe Saturday.
Xoxo The Tequila couple
