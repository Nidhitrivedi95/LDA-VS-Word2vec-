This was my first time at the neat restaurant. The place is bright and has a lot of character to it. The server was really friendly and would frequently check if we were good. The price was decent considering that we ordered around 4 plates of food ($35 w/o tip). One of the order was on the lunch menu and it comes with a salad and a miso soup (both were satisfying). Overall, miso soup seems like a simple dish- a lot of restaurants tend to make it really salty and it's like drinking a bowl of salt but the miso soup here was decent. My favourite dish is the squid- it was extremely tasty and it wasn't over cooked. The skewers were a little disappointing. They were really small and it was plain.

I would visit again to try the rest of their menu items. They also had a polar beer and it looked interest- its now on the bucket list...

Verdict: TRY
