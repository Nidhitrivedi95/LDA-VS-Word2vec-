9M69HnfjB0d11G9oGLpVgw My mom finally persuaded me to come back here last week after it was placed on my blacklist because I spotted a cockroach on the wall in 2009. (Mom: "Come on. It was a skinny roach, which meant it had nothing to eat. And, that was before they finished the renovations in the adjacent food court, he was just here while displaced from his home.")

The food was ok, and I didn't spot any roaches this time, but I'm not coming back any time soon. We arrived around 11:30am for dim sum, but there wasn't a lot going around. We ended up ordering noodles because we were hungry and the same seven carts were going around. It was only when we left around 1pm that more stuff started coming around. (Dad: "Was the chef/staff stuck in traffic on the way back from Casino Rama?") This was a Tuesday, so maybe weekends are better, but then you'd have to fight with a bigger crowd.
