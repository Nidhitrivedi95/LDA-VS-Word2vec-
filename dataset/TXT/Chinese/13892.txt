3-nPI5TJVKXEBJnFU0L8yw I called this restaurant and asked if they delivered. The response: "No!"  *CLICK*.  They hung up on me. I ordered food from elsewhere.

About a week later, I decided to give them a second chance. It was a disappointment.

The food was mostly just blah -- neither good nor bad. It satisfied our hunger but had little taste.

And while we ate our not-so-pleasant food, we got to listen to: the floor-shaking loud music from the dance school next door, and a discussion about how few soy sauce packets customers could have in their take-out bags.

We will not be returning.
