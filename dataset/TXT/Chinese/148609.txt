SktLID5_ywSlgVE-h3NB3Q I wish they would give us an option for 1/2 stars. I really give this China A GoGo location - 3 1/2 stars. We found this place by accident while helping my brother move from his apartment to his house. We were in charge of picking up food. That was 3 years ago. Since then we've been going to China A GoGo for our chinese-fast food cravings. 

Okay so we don't frequently go out to eat. Only when we don't have anything else to eat at home OR we're sick of eating my cooking. =D

The reason why we keep going to China A GoGo is:
1) Very generous portions, especially when you order combos.
2) Variety of foods. There is plenty to choose from on the menu. They even serve Pad Thai.
3) Food is cooked to order and not placed on a warming dish.
4) Prices are pretty cheap.
5) It's nearby.

We prefer their food to Panda Express and the Grand China which is on the other side of Durango (and Warm Springs). I hear that the Henderson location is a lot better. We may have to take a trip there one day to see if it's true.
