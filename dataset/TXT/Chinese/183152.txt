We ordered several dumplings, steamed and fried. The fillings all seemed to come out as soup dumplings.
Their Korean cold noodle was my fav. It had more flavor than all the dumpling dishes. 

Lamb dumpling tasted very game-y/stinky. Lamb is hard to perfect, granted, but this dish was hard to swallow. 

Service was similar to a typical Asian restaurant, nothing really bad to say if you don't expect much. 

Decor was very flashy, bright red (with prints) chair covers and red paper lanterns covering the ceiling lights.
