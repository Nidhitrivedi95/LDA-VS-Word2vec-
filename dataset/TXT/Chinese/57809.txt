D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA All these one star reviews are right! This shop instantly loses 3 stars for the price. 5 of us ate here, and the total was $86. The first dish we had was too salty so that loses another 1/2 star. The last half star is also due to the price.  The menu says there is a 18% forced gratuity for 6 people, and when we asked why they forced it on us(without telling us beforehand) for 5 people, they said it was due to holiday weekend. Overall not worth it, just go to a buffet or head down to chinatown for equally good food!
