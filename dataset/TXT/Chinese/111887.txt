You want good asian, go to a place frequented by lots of people of european descent.  If you want autenticity go to the place that is packed with asians.  This is a Pitt/CMU tradition, and the heart of "Asian Alley" on Oakland Avenue.

There is no decor, it's packed in, and certinaly could use some renovations.  Save the complaints for a different style.  This is 100% authentic Szechuan chinese, and you should appreciate the complexity and style of the food served here.
