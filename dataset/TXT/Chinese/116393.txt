N7wlv3nrhDPuDDY8yX6QvQ I usually come here with my godmother and parents since they live come by this restaurant.  I particularly love the sweet and sour pork usually, it is always delicious with juicy pineapple and tender deep fried pork soaked into the mouth watering sweet tangy sauce.  Having said that, I was a little disappointed with the service yesterday.  The waitress gave us rice first when the main dishes were not ready and so the rice were left to sit cold.  And we didn't get our soup almost half way into dinner.  

The other servers were a little irratated about this, but I think they should educate her a little bit about the flow of how the food should go out.  Usually, we like to have the soup first, then some dishes and then white rice.  I thought this is common knowledge in a HK style cafe.  I usually am quite please to eat there since the decor is clean and spacious.  The food are always really good, non greasy, and no msg.  

If it was not the yesterday's mishap, I would have given a higher rating.  Hope they improve next time
