jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw Holy grossness...I guess I shouldn't be so harsh about this place but the Vegas Strip is the land of food and I really think the competition is tight. If I had to wear high heels and fake eyelashes. I think this place can step up its game too! This place just doesn't do it for me. 

Pros:
Banh Cuon with Suong
Service

Cons:
Price
Location
Food
