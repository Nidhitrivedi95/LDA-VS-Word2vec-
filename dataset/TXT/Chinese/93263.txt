Izd-To33XTMnjM19XRonhw Oh, man. I tried the salt and pepper pork chops (the lunch version, not the full-on Hot Sale), and it was delicious. Juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. I want more. I would have these every day if having battered fried food all the time didn't kill you. 

We also had mixed veggies and wonton soup, and they were pretty good. Even the hot tea they put out for everyone is quite decent. They pale in comparison to the pork chops, though.

The waiter is very friendly and is always hustling. The food comes out quickly and all at once. A few seats for singles and pairs, and a few tables with lazy Susans for larger groups.

I personally love places that don't really prioritize decoration. Amigo has layers of plastic covers on the tables that they can just dispose of and posters that haven't changed in years. I think it allows me to concentrate on my pork chops. 

I will be back for the Hot Sale very soon.
