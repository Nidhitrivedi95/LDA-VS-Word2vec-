S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A I've always thought this place was extremely mediocre. The people that rave about this place.. I seriously wonder what they've eaten in their lives that they can talk like this is the best place on earth. They told my girlfriend and I today that they don't have #17 any more because nobody ever ordered it and it was gross. Luckily, that was her favorite dish, so I no longer have to go there anymore. 

If you still consider going here, know that the noodles are good but the flavors are bland as hell.
