EjYGxyksao-Jhw86tIAiYQ Aiight..3 stars just for Cheap Eats alone...

So i hit this today for lunch. Read reviews before and its near the J-O, so why not.. $4.50 lunch specials and the portions were BIG.. now i can destroy some food, but when they were bringing me my food, i was like Ohh Yeah, i'm going to sleep as soon as i get back to my desk.. Headphones + ITIS = ZZzzzzz... so i went with the pan fried noodles and chicken... My bad.. the lunch menu has a variety, and i plan to work my way through it..but that dish was just too bland..i mean it definitely wasn't my cup of tea..even with my cup of tea..but i will find something on that menu that will put a smile on my tastebuds.. Even if its just the Combo Rice..cuz really, can you actually mess up combo rice??
