AZKhBlrI5vgTBm3j9WwnbA Delicious hakka food, and the price is very cheap! I decided to dine in with a friend (during the evening) a while back and we were shocked by the enormous serving size - one dish was enough for two people!! What I found the most remarkable was the amount of chicken in our dishes. Moreover, the lady at the cash was soft spoken but very kind.

I don't eat Hakka regularly, but to me, it seemed that there was no compromise on quality, while maintaining a very good price! They do have a very nice variety of dishes but try to catch a special if you can. 

A word of warning, the plaza where Bao Shin is located has limited parking spots, so try to avoid this area during weekend nights.
