aWu1homxB6lciXU6-ZlpSQ Now and then I reminisce about eating stinky tofu at Taipei's night markets.  I apologize for nauseating many people already, but really, it doesn't taste like it smells.  To learn to appreciate food, it goes beyond simply smelling it.  I mean, you wouldn't just sniff a glass of wine without drinking it right?  Well to cure my craving for stinky tofu, I make a visit to Wei's Taiwanese Foods in Scarborough.

Wei's stinky tofu has a trademark appearance- they carve up a hole in the middle of the tofu and pour what resembles a black pepper sauce inside.    One order of Wei's stinky tofu costs $3.99.  It still doesn't compare to what I had in Taiwan in terms of crispiness as the tofu was chewier than I wanted.  But it was flavorful and the black pepper sauce went well with the added hot sauce.  If you know where to find extra crispy stinky tofu, let me know!

I also ordered a Taiwanese style sausage rice () which comes with your choice of soft drink or soup for $5.25.  You can pick three sides so I chose beans, tomato with egg, and cabbage with mushrooms which were all delicious.  The portion was bigger than I could handle alone so it ended up being really filling.  The Taiwanese sausages were very good.  It was a little sweet and had a nice bite.  I didn't find it too oily either and it went well with the rice. They used Japanese rice and mixed within the rice was a little bit of ground meat and pickled veggies.  I felt like I was eating a home meal away from home.  I would definitely order this again.
