NKHvmp19c6wrm0dZXcLtmQ Came here a couple times. I love the variety of food and desserts they have here. I have tried the chocolate ice cream parfait, Strawberry Apple Italian soda, Strawberry lime Italian Soda, the supreme crepe, and the popcorn chicken. Some of the food was amazing. I always get the strawberry Apple Italian soda and popcorn chicken. The parfait and lime soda was not the greatest so you should be careful of what you order. The parfait was okay but I did not like the grass jelly inside the parfait (extremely chewy and classes with the ice cream). The Apple strawberry soda is better than the lime. The service is extremely slow but the overall atmosphere of the place is pretty nice. Very clean, comfy chairs and the mood was nice. Would go again but I will have to be careful ordering.
