kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A On our way out of Vegas and wanted some good noodle soup dish.  My friends has the Hot and Spicy Noodles and I got the Tomato Beef Noodle.  We all shared the Mongolian Beef Pancake and Spicy Wontons.  All the foods were a lot oilyer than we like it but the noodles were good. There were a good amount of meat in my dish.  The server was a older man who seemed really out of it.  He served all the tables who came in AFTER us - - didn't bring bring us water etc.  I asked for a fork and we got dirty ones. 

Drinks-- we got lychee green tea, green tea and black tea. A lady server brought out the wrong ones and when she asked the man serving our table he looked confused.  

The Service wasn't great and the food was ok...Would be back for the tea drinks.
