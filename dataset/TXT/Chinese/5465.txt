0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA If I could give zero stars I would.  Stopped in for lunch. No one in the place (not a single soul), that was probably my first warning. I sat down anyway, on their hard, uncomfortable plastic chairs (seriously, the decor is very cafeteria like), and started to look over the menu. Pho for $10?? It better be some amazingly good pho! So I sat and I sat, waited and waited. The server/owner/manager/whoever that greeted me when I walked in had gone in the back and after waiting 10 minutes I decided to just leave. Give me a break. There is NO ONE in the place. I'm your ONLY customer and you're going to just let me sit there forever? No thanks. Went to my usual go-to for pho at Pho Van and had an awesome lunch.
