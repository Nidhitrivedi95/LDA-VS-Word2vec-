dJnF_GUWdoX3tUucpKbYMg Came here for dinner for my bro's birthday and generally, it was a meh experience. Nothing in particular about this restaurant stood out to me honestly.

To be honest, I thought this place looked quite attractive on the outside. When I went in, it was another story. It's like they are trying to be fancy...but it doesn't necessarily come off that way?!? 

The staff and service was ehhh. One of the ladies working there kept talking to us which personally I find annoying. I felt like she constantly tried to have a conversation with us... like gorl pls stop. I kinda don't want you spitting over our food ... lol. I don't know what happened but somehow a family that came way later than us got their food before we did (they ordered the same thing as us) like ... um ?!? wut!? why!! WHAT DID WE DO?!?

Food wise. Nothing stood out really. Some tasted alright while others were a bit questionable. The only notable thing was the complimentary peanuts they gave out. They're nothing special but I kept scarfing them down. Low key they were the star of the show LOOL YOU GO PEANUTS !! 

**note: they give out complimentary soup and desserts (some kind of papaya, white fungus soup dessert and mango pudding)
