vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw My daughter and I were looking for a good Chinese restaurant on the fly and found this place. This was a spur of the moment decision we will not long forget! 
Their portions are just right and the food is full of flavor. I had the Sizzling Black Pepper Beef. The beef was so tender!
The waiter was very attentive and made sure that our food was served in a timely manner.
This will definitely be our new go-to spot!
