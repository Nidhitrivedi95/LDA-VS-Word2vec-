SZmm3wOx_fcC2rblUVewGA I've passed by this place numerous of times. I keep thinking this place is very sketch because it's located at the basement of the subway on Dundas street so I was a little skeptical when my Co workers wanted to eat here. To my surprised it was actually really good and the this place still rolled the dim sum in carts!!

I haven't seen that in years. It's banned from all resturant uptown.

The food was good and cheap! Oh I will be back here for more!!!
