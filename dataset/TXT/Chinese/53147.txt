cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw I agree with some of the review here, Yao's is a typical Americanized Chinese restaurant that is well priced and good customer service. When me and wife went we were instantly greeted with a friendly and helpful staff.

The food is OK and is priced accordingly, I had the Kung Pao chicken which was a little on the sweet side. I did however love that they have chestnuts in their food!!!

My wife had the Orange Chicken, it was extremely sweet and a little over whelming.  We saved it for leftovers.

Overall: 

You pay for what you get, don't have high expectations, but its worth a try if your in the area.
