NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ During my first trip to Toronto with family in 2012, my cousin brought us to hangout at TenRen's for boba/tapioca tea. I was very excited for boba even though it is everywhere back where I live. I remembered the drinks we had were alright, nothing special since we have TenRen's in Southern California. The big shock that imprinted into my memory was that we could not play card games (Big 2) in the restaurant as we normally would do back in California. We were told that cards weren't allowed at the restaurant and were asked to put the playing cards away. Due to that, I consider my experience at this TenRen's not satisfying hence the single star rating which is the lowest possible.
