beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Finally came by, because of all the good hype! Unfortunately I wasn't able to sit by the conveyer belt of food. We got sat at a high table which was a tad uncomfortable as there wasn't much room for my legs. I HIGHLY suggest requesting to sit by the food conveyer  belt , as you can pick out the food/sides you want in your hotpot. And come on, so intresting!

They have an excellent variety of sides from meat, vegetables, and seafood. There is even a "bar" for sauces and small appetizers made available for you. It is self serve! 
There is also an actual bar inside too.
You get your own mini hotpot to yourself, and can choose from their chicken, oxtail, spicy, or a half spicy and half chicken broth. We did order a veggie combo, and wow. Its literally a basket of veggies! If you order it, its enough for 4+ people.

Service was a little slow, and our hotpot broth  took some time to come out. But they are more than happy to help you once you flag them down. I'll definitely come back again another time!
