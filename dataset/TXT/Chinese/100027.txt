JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA Always a great lunch and plenty of food.  I have always liked playing with my food and experimenting with all their different sauces is cool.  No disaster combinations yet but I am sure I could find one if I tried hard enough... there is tons of variety.  If the dining room was less cafeteria I would go 5 stars, but they do a great job for the niche they are in.  

Service is usually pretty fast, staff is nice, I like watching them grill up my meal, and of course, who can complain about a free ice cream cone on the way back to work?  Two thumbs up from me.
