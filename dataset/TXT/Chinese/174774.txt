wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw So this is what Chinese food is supposed to taste like! Holy crap! So good!

Honestly, I was glad to be in dining with Chinese speaking friends or I may have struggled a bit with ordering.  I had no idea what was good (or what my friend ordered for me!) but when it all arrived at our table the portions were huge and delicious!  My favorites were the black pepper short ribs and the shrimp wonton soup.  We ordered four meals for three people and we had enough leftovers for probably another three people.  The portions are freakishly big!

I'm so glad to have tried this place out.  No fakey MSG-laden flavors here.  Everything is flavorful in an authentic way and I can't wait to go back!  I've been thinking about that sweet and sour sauce all day...
