MVBCWXTDtU8C1Qh5mMNSKA As a Dim Sum connoisseur, and growing up in Vancouver, I've ate lots of Dim Sum. This place is worth the visit as this place is that it is one of the many few restaurants that offer discounted Dim Sum $2.99 each on S/M/L dishes, 7-days a week!

Also, what made this place stood one was the unique dishes that I didn't even see in Vancouver Dim Shop places. They had Ox Tail, Pig Intestine, and fried Sweet Chinese Pancake that hit the spot for dessert. They also have very good Congee and Zongzi (Wrapped Sticky Rice). Go and pick up your chopsticks and start enjoying some unique and well-crafted Dim Sum.

I will definitely revisit. A solid 4 stars!
