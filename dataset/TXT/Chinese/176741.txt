wR71mnXAJMVmgMBrHevndQ Went here for dinner with family friends. This was our 2nd time. We had their special baked chicken, green pepper beef rice noodle, fried Taiwanese vermicelli, snow pea leaves with garlic, egg white with seafood and broccoli and dried scallop fries rice. For dessert we had the tapioca with coconut milk. Everything was delicious and not too greasy! The owner is very friendly and approachable and so are the staff! 

Would go back and definitely recommend others to eat here!
