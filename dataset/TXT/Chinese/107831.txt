ldKrUirpZZ6JDnNwOwLpvw if you go here expecting a full on japanese buffet, you'll be disappointed.  i know i was.  i love japanese food.... but there was very little of it on this buffet.

i got some sushi.  i had some soup.  my husband got the made to order teppanyaki, and it was just so so.  there was not enough sauce, not enough choices for ingredients, and honestly, i felt like the guy making it wanted to be doing anything else.  

the things on the buffet seemed to be refilled frequently, and it all looked fresh.  the sushi did look like it had been sitting awhile, and without any sort of name tags above them, i had to guess what was in each roll.  there never seemed to be anyone working that area of the buffet, so it was not possible to ask either.  

the wait staff were nice.  they were attentive and refilled drinks/cleared the table often.  they smiled at my 3 year old son who was systematically dissecting sushi rolls on his plate.  

the chinese food on the buffet was almost entirely meat dishes.  there was no tofu or anything, which left us disappointed.  the food was really as americanized as it could be.  i felt like i was at panda express, except that it was more reasonably priced, which helped to buffer the disappointment.  

i don't think i'll be back, and for no real reason beside the fact that it was not a japanese buffet.  it's akin to other buffets in town, like chinatown.  if you enjoy chinatown, you'll like ichiban.
