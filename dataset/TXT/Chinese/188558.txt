yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA My family and friends went there on last weekend. Pho has too much MSG, the services were bad and they demanded tips. I don't mind tipping but the service much be good enough to earn the tips.  The food were bad and the services were even worse.  We won't come back here again.
