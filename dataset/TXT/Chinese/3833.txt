_ONkRPvpIYdCuj9u6cIPeA Came here around 1pm on a Monday. Pretty busy but luckily didn't have to wait for a table. It's $2.70 for all dim sum and $0.60 for tea per person. 

They advertised their crab claw dim sum outside their restaurant so we decided to give it a try. Not bad. It's really a big ball of shrimp around a small crab claw. It comes with a small dish of vinegar,which helped to bring it the flavor...I found it kind of bland to eat it on its own. 

Curry octopus was tender but not spicy and didn't have much curry flavour but I find that's how it is usually made at most dim sum places.

My bf ate all the shrimp dumplings and rice noodle with BBQ pork so his verdict on them was "it was alright" lol 

Steamed rice was a little dry and the beef is the same consistency as the beef balls you would typically have at dim sum restaurants. It's almost like a firm beef paste? Doesn't taste much like beef to be honest. 

Deep fried dough in rice noodle was ok. Good that the deep fried dough stick wasn't stale, so the bread was still soft. 

Overall, not bad. Standard dim sum restaurant. Would return if I'm craving dim sum and at market village.
