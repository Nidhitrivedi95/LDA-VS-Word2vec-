x9SL1nCaUYM4JP91UrVkxQ This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. It's been around for many years, but I've only recently been there a few times. 

The reason why I think this is the best is because the food tastes natural; not too overpowering in seasoning/MSG, but that doesn't mean it's bland. I have low tolerance for saltiness and oil, and dislike goopey sauces, so I really think majority of the dishes I've tried here are great. 

- Chicken: so moist and soft, even the white part! The skin is thin and crispy without being oily and having the layer of fat. This is my favorite chicken and my favorite dish here. 

- Green veggies are generally good, such as choi sum and the fermented bean curd lettuce

- Beef or Seafood & Broccoli or Celery in Taro Nest - generally I don't like these nests, but this one is freshly fried made of taro! It is fresh and crispy, and of course I like it because I'm a taro fan!

- Soups - chicken feet; lotus root 

- Steamed fish 

- Glutinous rice stuffed chicken - this needs to be pre-ordered. A huge whole chicken, moist, crisp skin, stuffed with my favorite glutinous rice. IMO the chicken is a bit bland compared to the regular oil fried chicken, but still tasty. 

- Lobster - Few times I ordered the 5 + lbs lobster (total is around $70) So delicious! Lobster needs to be large for optimal taste. Large, meaty, juicy pieces. I've had both the deep fried and garlic steamed. Both are good, the fried one is more flavorful.

- Winter melon soup - needs to be pre-ordered. Very flavorful with lots of ingredients!

Generally can't go wrong with this place! Great food & Great value!
