SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. We ordered the pu pu platter disgusting. The egg rolls were frozen in the middle and tasted weird. The chicken skewers were chewy and like jerky. We also ordered the jalapeño chicken and the chicken was almost inedible. It was also chewy. We each ordered a sushi roll and it was average at best. There are way better places for sushi and Chinese food don't waste your money.
