VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ What is not to LOVE about Flo's.  I haven't eaten here in years and it was just as great as I remembered.   I am from New Orleans and their shrimp rivals the fresh gulf shrimp that I grew up on.  I had the seafood soup and it was delicious and full of shrimp and scallops.   My meal was only $11.00 and I have leftovers for tomorrow night.   The hot and sour soup was also amazing and I hear their beef and noodle soup is delicious.   I am here for a month and will be eating here a lot.   I can't even make dinner at home for less than that.
