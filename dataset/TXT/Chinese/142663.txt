rkVTKhUDO-VtrIu8esB75g It's a food court shop, so don't set your expectations too high. 

I was here with my family during the Christmas holidays and oh man the lines were out the door for this shop. It took about 40 minutes from lining up to getting the food.

The lo mein noodles were just okay. It was $9 for a somewhat small portion that felt like mostly cabbage than noodles. If you want meat, you are charged extra. The noodles were slightly sweet and otherwise okay. I'd eat again but would prefer other options.

The tonkotsu ramen looked promising but it's food court ramen, so it's not gourmet. My sister said the meat was pretty decent.
