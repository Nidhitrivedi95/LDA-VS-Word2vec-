JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw I really, really love this restaurant. The service was amazing, and the space was so cool. I loved being able to watch people twist and turn the noodles.

My friends and I got the Shang Beef Noodle, along with the Spicy Wonton and we LOVED both dishes. 

The Spicy Wontons were a bit oily, but so worth it!! I decided a long time ago that good food over health (which is probably why my doctor always yells at me but oh well). My friend thought that they were a bit too spicy but honestly he thinks that everything is spicy so I wouldn't trust his opinion. They were perfectly delicious, and perfectly spicy. Highly recommend!

The flavors in the soup were delicious - I think something I'm always very concerned about when I get beef broth soups is whether or not the flavors are concentrated enough and if the meat is tender. At this spot, the meat is so soft and tender and the beef broth is just the right flavor. The soup was not too salty and not too bland, and such a delight to drink on a cold winter day.

The noodles were especially wonderful. They were so chewy and light, and they paired perfectly with the light broth. 

All in all, I would whole-heartedly recommend coming to this place and trying it out. The prices are great, the customer service is spectacular, and the food is INCREDIBLE
