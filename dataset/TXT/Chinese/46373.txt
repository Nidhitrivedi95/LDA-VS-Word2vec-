BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA This place is AMAZING!!! The pork and bok choy fried dumplings were divine.... They were so good I went to talk to the manager to tell the chef how much I enjoyed them. They tasted freshly made and we're fried well. The smashed cucumber salad was also ridiculously delicious. This place is lightyears ahead of the Dumpling House also on Spadina. 

The restaurant was clean and staff were efficient and really nice. 

Damn Mother's Dumplings! I was seriously in heaven when eating there today. I'm craving more dumplings already. Will be back ASAP, you made me so happy with your delicious dumplings!
