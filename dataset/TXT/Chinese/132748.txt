pRfIJ6zurjEsWmJheDOP6A We actually live just around the corner from here but we never tried it.  One day some friends invited me to go and i t was very quiet and relaxing.  

I must say that everyone(party of 9) seemed to really enjoy their meals.  We all shared edamame for an appetizer.  Some others had the soup, too. No one had any complaints there either...  Personally, I got the Kung Pao Shrimp (extra spicy, please) and it was superb.  Sometimes shrimp tends to get overcooked in stir-fry dishes but this was very tender and flavorful.  There was plenty left to take home and I had a delish lunch the next day.  Also I tried my friend's sushi (can't tell you what is was as I'm not familiar with different types) but it was tasty.   She said she usually gets the sushi there and it's always good.

 Also, the dishes had wonderful eye appeal... rose garnishes made of carrots and that sort of thing. 

The service was very friendly and timely, too.  I'd highly recommend trying this place.  It was a real treat.
