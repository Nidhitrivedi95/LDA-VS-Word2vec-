q_KQbgnaYDlPx8EHTydcBQ use to like this place, my third time ordering sirloin steak with rice and this time yuck the steak is super salty, texture of the meat feels like its been marinated for at least 10 days. The colour is road kill red. One of the most awful steak I've ever had in my life. I took a picture I wish I know how to upload it with this review. Business is tough but serving food like this isn't acceptable even in north korea. All in all I took 3 bites and decided to tell the waitress about it and she said I should have told her on my first bite so she could show it to the chef, not sure why that matters but I told her thats ok im not planning to finish it so you can still show it to the chef, she took it back and came out said she can give me a french toast for free. so at the end i ate 3 bites of nasty meat, some toast and paid the full bill, and i can feel the steak in my stomach as im typing. the table next to me also complained about their food (not sure if it's the steak). waitress attitude is also bad, the soup is basically tasteless so i asked her for salt and pepper and she gave me this look like im crazy, and this is before the steak incident.
