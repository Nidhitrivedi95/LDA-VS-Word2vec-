LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA Food was good, but nothing compared to the location on Frank Lloyd Wright.  Service is EXTREMELY slow.   We came at lunch, and the restaurant was only a 1/3 full.  We got our food before our lunch salads and drinks even made its way to the table.  We had to ask for the status on our soft drinks.  Will stick to my regular location where service is timely, and staff is friendly.
