Afterwards you walk and select your choices and proceed to the cash register. The prices are phenomenal. You can pay less than $3 for multiples of most items. Also every allows you to eat on the go. There is a lot of variety from sweet to savory. We decided to get a chicken bun, beef bun, and two sweet treats. Both of the buns were okay but could use more meat. As well, our sweet treats were a little bland. It's a no frills place so you kind of a have to figure everything out on your own.
