woeN9aLmohpUYu4NSn7IDg Maybe I haven't been out too often recently, but it's my first time in a really long time seeing a HK style cafe opening in a food court environment. Standing at the store front, you can see that they have an extensive menu of typical HK dishes one would expect from a HK cafe, including baked dishes, afternoon tea combos, and various soup noodles. Signs are brand new and they have a nice colour theme. HK-style is my favourite cuisine (if it is considered one hehe..). So as I was standing in this food court, it was a no-brainer for me, I had to try it. 

I decided to order one of my fave HK dishes: Ox tongue with tomato sauce on rice. It was a risk because not many restaurants can master this dish. For a food court, wait time was pleasant. However, my ox tongue came out overdone, very dry and chewy. Actually to the point where I could not chew to swallow it. The tomato sauce was very raw and tomato-y, not the sweet kind of tomato sauce. I would not order this again from here. 

Milk tea was below par.. Milk tea is one of the staple items in HK cafes and is usually relied upon to bring back customers, but it didn't do it for me. Disappointed, I did not get to finish my meal. Other people in my party ordered rice noodles of its variety, those were good. I would say it's safe to order those. 

For now, I would give this spot some time to mature. The food and its prices are reasonable, but since I had this unimpressive first experience, I personally will not be back for a while or go out of my way for a visit. Its colour theme and name strongly reminds me of Fortune Stone on Warden/Steeles in the T&T plaza, which is a spot I regularly eat at... but I could be wrong :P
