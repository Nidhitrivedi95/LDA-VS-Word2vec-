1pZk5sw5m8kPTMdvIp6UVA The food was really good,  but there was so much waiting even though the restaurant was almost empty. The servers were polite, but the wait between each course was ridiculous. We waited over 30 minutes for food in a relatively empty restaurant. 

Also,  there was no way to see which dishes had arrived and which were still coming. Some dishes ordered were missing - it was like the servers were guessing which table ordered the food. Too many concerns with the ordering system when you consider that you place your order directly on a tablet. 

There was little or no communication on the dishes, we were unsure what some dishes were as some pictures just did not match the plates. This can be very problematic when someone has an allergy at the table and we  cannot identify the dishes. Labels would go a long way! 

I would go back for lunch/dinner during the week for the tasty food and beautiful ambiance. 

However, I will pass on a weekend trip until they improve their wait times and the pictures look exactly like the plates. I cannot imagine waiting an hour for some dishes and having my order mixed up!

Lots of room for improvement with the service,  but worth a try for the food and decor.
