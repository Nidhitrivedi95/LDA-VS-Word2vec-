4t_RBsTtU7hhVYJweh46Uw A solid place for your chinese food, with all your asian food needs ranging from fried rice, congee, noodles and meats. We got the duck in soya sauce, chicken with chinjew sauce, deep fried silverfish with spicy salt and some stir fried greens. All four dishes was excellent and not too greasy. The duck had really good flavor, it's meant to be a cold dish but doesn't lack in flavor. The chicken is served with a side of fried leaves that gives an extra layer of texture to the thin slices of chicken. The silverfish was fried to a dry crisp but not oily, making them feel like really interesting fries.

The food itself gets a solid three stars, but the service brings it to four. First of all, the servers noticed I couldn't read chinese so they offered the same menu to me in english (everyone one else around the table could read except me). Really appreciated them noticing and offering a solution without me asking. Secondly, we had ordered the snow pea leaves but the kitchen responded that it wasn't in season and were too old to be served. It's good to know that the kitchen has standards. Thirdly, a toddler at the next table started crying and a server in the area nonchalantly handed the mom a stack of napkins without being asked. Definitely a place with good service.

The only drawback are the drinks. I ordered a lychee bubble tea but the tapioca had obviously been sitting around for too long because they had softened a little too far. The liquid itself was really light, refreshing and wasn't too intensely sweet. But the tapioca was a no go. Avoid the bubble tea but maybe the other drinks will be fine.
