I really want to like this place but they just don't care. Every time I have been in they are out of at least 3-4 entrees. Today, more than half of their entrees were missing and they  only had fried rice left for a side (except for a few chow mein noodles). They weren't even close to busy either.

I should have walked out then and never came back but I ordered an entree I didn't want and a side I didn't want because I was hungry and needed to get back to work. 

They gave me a lot of the side I didn't want but only a few pieces of meat for my entree like they were afraid they would run out of that too.

They have replied on Yelp saying they will look into this problem but obviously nothing has changed.

Plenty of better options around but I just need to remember to call ahead instead of waiting until the last minute.
