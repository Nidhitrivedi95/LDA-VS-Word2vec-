QHZw2L6LV1qmExNJbfhIsQ Overall this place didn't give me a good experience. We made reservation for a dinner at 8pm and we didn't actually get seated until 8:45pm. We ordered their winter melon soup and it wasn't the tastiest. My parents cook a better version...and it wouldn't cost us $65 before tax. Their dishes are quite tasty though, but along a bit on the pricy side. Dishes could be cleaner, tea they serve is quite good and the environment is quite clean and spacious. I asked them to split the bills since I was paying for a portion of it , and they had a fit. On top of that they told the other party that I had not tip them on my end so that they could give more. Very sneaky and unprofessional . Some of the staff there aren't well mannered and the restaurant overall just take of their own self interest first. In my previous visit, they ran out of their steam chicken and either crab/lobster too.
