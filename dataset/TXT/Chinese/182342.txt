XIX4xuzrt3IzvjX9MtHr9g Sometimes you really just want some good old fashioned westernized Chinese food. If this is you, Mayflower is your place. Hubby and I got takeout from here and it hit home on the classic greasy Chinese food we were looking for.

The honey garlic spare ribs were a tasty treat offering a good balance garlicy sweetness, the chicken lo mein was delicious (good balance between sauce, noodles, chicken and veggies), and the egg rolls were also done well with a not-too-thick crust. The star, though, was the chicken balls. Let's face it, if you're going for this type of Chinese food, it's that deep fried goodness dunked in the red sweet and sour sauce that you really want - and Mayflower gives you just that. There is a light sweetness to the batter complemented with a good chunk of meat. Will definitely be ordering this again. 

When you walk in, you can smell the goodness in the air. The pickup area is very simple and the waiting area is pretty small. The staff are straight forward and set your expectations early in terms of how long you will wait for your order.
