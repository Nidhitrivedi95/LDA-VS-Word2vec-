D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA I was walking to my car when I smelled the restaurant. Like other reviews, the aroma smelled so good which enticed me to try the place. The prices were expected to be pricey because it was located in the Paris hotel. I ordered the wonton noodle soup , priced at $18.88. It was fresh and tasty. I am giving the rating 2 stars because the service was terrible. The waiter was rude and inpatient to me when I asked him menu questions. I was solo and the place was not busy at 1 am. Honestly, the only person nice to me was the busser who was helpful and packed my leftovers and gave me a water to go.
