cI7k9zqs_pl3byUDE4cpdA I have gone here on and off for over 25 years. It was always the special place for family birthdays and such. My husband who is not a fan of Chinese food was at one of these events at the Golden Phoenix, when he found their House Special Chicken. He loves it, craves it frequently. So now, we order to go, often, which makes me really happy. The food is always plentiful and delicious, we get it home and it is still steaming hot, lovely flavors. We always get the House Special Chicken, it is crispy, tender and the sauce is light but tasty. I have tried lots of things on the menu and never been disappointed from noodles, soups, fried rice, lemon chicken, egg foo young, you name it, they make it and it is good. We will be back, probably next week for my hubbies next round of House Special Chicken and all I can say is Thank You to the Golden Phoenix for opening his mind and expanding his food world.
