67FzueRMlcTQV3Nuep2qPw Food wise Lotus is a decent Chinese place. And since Chinese places pretty much come in 2 varieties (decent and really not decent) that's good enough. What bumps them above par are two things: they deliver, which is novel for me, and you get SOOO much food. Like 2-3 meals worth of food per $8 combination. Can you say value? Yes you can.

I also liked that even though there technically isn't a beef w/garlic sauce combination (beef w/ other stuff- yes, other meat w/garlic sauce- yes, beef w/ garlic sauce- not so much) they let me order it. And it was tasty...for 3 meals.
