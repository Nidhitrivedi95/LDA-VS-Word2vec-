Overpriced, under-seasoned food and a rude waitstaff to go with it. 

I only interacted with one member of the staff, who seemed annoyed that we showed up (it was 3 hours till closing). He had a bad attitude and pretended to know more about the food than he actually did. 

The ONLY decent thing about this place is $1 16oz PBRs. 

I am not interested in going here again, even though it's open late. I'd rather go to McDonald's.
