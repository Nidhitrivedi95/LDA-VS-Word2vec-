xQljmWh9Lwo_XTqjOV6xwQ I went to this restaurant on Saturday, April 20th to pick up a phone order. The lady who took the order (who happened to speak in a very thick accent) had trouble listening to me and I had to repeat myself several times to finally place the order. Unfortunately, when I arrived there, I discovered that they took the order wrong for one of the items (instead of Mongolian Chicken, they prepared Manchurian Chicken). I advised the cashier about the mix up, and she said there is no way they would have taken the wrong order. They also have multiple people stand behind the counter. One of the males who was standing behind the counter stepped in and repeated what the other cashier said. I found this person to be extremely condescending. He went onto spell out the term "Mongolian" to me, and insisted that the mistake was on my part when I placed the order. I politely asked him what could be done to fix things, to which he responded, "what would I do with the wrong dish then". I could not believe both his audacity and rudeness. In the end, he hesitantly agreed to give me the right dish I ordered. While I waited there for the right dish to be prepared, that person spoke with another gentleman in their own language and he didn't seem too happy. I was able to only make out the terms "Mongolian" and "Manchurian" from their conversation. Overall, it was a terrible customer experience. 

If you do happen to place an order ahead of time, please ask the person taking the order to repeat it back to you even if they are busy and try to rush you (sometimes they are busy, especially on the weekends.
