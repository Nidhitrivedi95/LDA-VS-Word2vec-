xdphjWZymq-3dqOWmA_wwA Henry's Taiwan Kitchen is a nice addition to the the Tempe area. Been here a few times and will surely be back for more. It is hard to find these kind of flavors and so far they have been very tasty.

Inside is very casual with gold colored painted walls. Seating is comfortable with a TV available in the corner. Nice menu with a good selection of choices. Some items are Chinese while others have more of a Taiwanese influence.

Ordered the Chef's Beef Noodle Soup and the Oyster Omelet on my first visit. I had asked for extra spicy soup and was not disappointed. Next visit went with some Wontons in Chili Sauce and the famous Three Cup Chicken. They were both very delicious and put a smile on my face.

The Three Cup Chicken was so good that I will definitely be reproducing it at home. Would probably use boneless thighs instead of drumsticks. This would make it easier to eat and give you more meat per square inch. YUM!

Service is friendly and somewhat helpful. The younger female server seemed a bit new to the restaurant scene and kept pacing back and forth across the floor. Made me a bit nervous and sadly took my attention away from the food. No need to panic. Food brought me right back in the zone as soon as she stopped.

Located in the LA Fitness shopping center next to the drive thru liquor store. No signage on the building at the time of writing this review. This place has a lot of potential so give them a shout out. ENJOY!
