ZGpT6rcgSsJ4GxwTHbvvJw It's lunch for dinner... I know - keep up with me ok.  They have combo plates BUT I can't combine just anything from their menu.  I wanted the Singapore Curry Noodles with Chinese Eggplant and Tofu.  Those together are not a combo plate; so I had to order them separately.

Alright I understand.  I was just trying to see if they'll work with me.  I said that's what I want and anything I cannot finish, I'll take it home.  Agreed.

Wait was not long.  Food cooked where I can see it being wok'd up.  It was fresh, hot, and smelled super appetizing to my nostrils.  Good flavor!  AND they prepared it in to go containers PLUS gave me a plate and utensils to dine in.  

Singapore curry noodles: has chicken, shrimp, BBQ pork.  I didn't expect this much ingredients but it was delish!
Chinese Eggplant with Tofu: can be ordered spicy.  I chose none since Sriracha was on the table.  Very nice sweetness to it.  Squirt some sriracha and taste buds are having a party!

Very well they heard me out; attentive customer service.  Interior is clean; tables were cleared off not dirty.  Prices are decent.  Seafood and specials are little bit pricier.  But I like this place.  

They serve slushies and boba!  Not a grand selection of, but there was Taro and I'm giving yay points for that!
