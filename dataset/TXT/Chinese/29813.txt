The restaurant is super CLEAN.  I can't get over how clean the place was.. everything from the plates and spoons to tables and chairs.  The wait staff was very friendly and menus were nice and easy to read in English with photos. 

As for the food, my table got:

Wonton Noodle Soup - Really high quality and top notch.  No "mystery" ingredients in the wonton like some places.  Broth and noodles were fantastic too.  Some of the best I've had. 

Beef Chow Foon - The best beef chow foon I've ever had.  Beef chow foon has to be somewhat greasy to be good and this place got it perfect.  Just the right amount of grease (not too much like a lot of places do which makes everything brown and soggy).  Ingredients again were really high quality and the noodles were the perfect size/width. 

Shanghai Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) - Really good.  Not as good as the ones I've had over in Asia but still very tasty.

Dessert - Don't remember what it was called on the menu (you'll see it in the big picture on the menu) but it was a bowl of dessert tofu, sweet red beans, black jelly, tapioca with coconut milk, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I love all those things separately.. served together it was amazing!  Definitely try it if you like that type of dessert. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend giving this place a try if you're in Vegas.  The food was high quality and super affordable (like $7-8 a dish).  It's a great value and I'd easily be here once a week if I lived in Vegas!
