dCX6CvWGn8oiPSD_yxrm0Q YUCK! I ordered general Tsos, Mongolian beef and hot and sour soup. I used to like this place. It tasted like my food was 5days old. It definitely wasn't fresh. The hot and sour soup tasted like dirty muddy water with Siracha added to it to spice it up. The general Tsos chicken was disgusting. It was all breading and no chicken. The sauce they used was gross. My dogs wouldn't eat it. The only thing that was 1/2 decent was the Mongolian beef. It was edible but the beef was gummy. They made Panda Express look like a 5 star restaurant. I really think my food was prepared like several weeks ago and RE heated and served to me. Ughhhh...now I have to search for another Chinese take out place.
