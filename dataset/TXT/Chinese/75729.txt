fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA SOOO good. Ordered the regular pork soup dumplings (Xiao long bao), fried squid, and steamed red bean dumplings. Then we saw the mini pork soup dumplings, and intrigued we ordered those too.

Everything was really good and yes the mini pork soup dumplings are just a mini version of the regular ones BUT in my opinion I prefer them to the regular sized ones. I think the mini ones had a better meat-to-skin-to-soup ratio I definitely suggest everyone to try them. Prices are also pretty reasonable especially compared to the Din Tai Fung in Arcadia which I have been to multiple times. And if I had to choose, I prefer this Ding Tai Fung in Markham because prices are better, dumplings are slightly better, and not as crazy busy, the DTF in Arcadia can be up to a 4 hr wait sometimes, RIDICULOUS. 

ORDER THE MINIS!!
