DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA Never heard of Sam Woo before, but apparently my family comes here all the time. As you step in the restaurant, you are surprised with the roasted pig and chicken hanging behind the glass wall. 

I came here with my family. We were seated in one of the large tables and right next to us was another family. It was practically just two parties in this restaurant, cramped next to each other. I was unsure why they didn't seat us separately so we would have more room. 

We ordered honey walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, house fried rice, wonton soup, noodle soup, roasted pig, and flounder fish. (very typical dishes)

Fried rice and flounder fish was okay. The honey walnut shrimp and Mongolian beef was nothing I've ever tasted before. It tasted very different. I expected it to be the same taste with what you would usually get from a Chinese restaurant. But these dishes were so off.  The only thing I liked was the roasted pig which is filled so much cholesterol! 

Cash only!!
