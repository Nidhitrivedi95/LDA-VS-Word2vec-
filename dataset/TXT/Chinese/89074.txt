i55cm4i5C7fSCVONIQ8DRg Fantastic gem! On our way through Cleveland to the East Coast and found this place on Yelp. Very authentic Cantonese cuisine. I'm traveling with my godmother who has lived in Chicago's Chinatown for 40 years and she also gave her thumbs up on this place! Really friendly owner. Would come back if I am back in the area! Highly recommend!
