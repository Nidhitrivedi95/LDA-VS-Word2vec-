rswuhMY5vCbvZvF2wBIhqg Delicious!! The food came out very quick and it was hot and fresh. The waiters were attentive but not annoying. I had the Shrimp Lo Mien and Orange Chicken.  The noodles were great and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Prob the best Orange Chicken I've had here in AZ.  My girl had the Shrimp and vegetables and I tried some and it was also very good. Even my ice tea was good :). I recommend this place, they have very competitive prices. I wanted to give it four stars but :/ Just go!!!
