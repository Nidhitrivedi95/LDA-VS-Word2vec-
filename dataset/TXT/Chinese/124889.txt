ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ So the team lunches brought me to Crown Princess Fine Dining located just a bit north of the downtown financial district. It's actually part of a chain of upper class dim sum places with one location called Casa-Imperial Fine Chinese Cuisine on Warden and Steeles Avenue and the other one called Crown Prince Fine Dining located at Victoria Park Avenue and McNicoll.

So I've already had the privilege to dine at the other two already and now I'm finally heading to the downtown location to try out their food.

Just like the sister restaurants, the food there is quite good. Since it was the Lunar New Year day, the place was pretty packed and service was booming. I actually didn't have too many items from their dim sum menu, except for a couple of dessert items and instead opted for items from their specialty/dinner menu. I tried their Peking Duck and Spicy Garlic Lobster and they were quite delicious and well done.
