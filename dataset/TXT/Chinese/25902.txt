7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew I came here for dim sum with my family on a Friday afternoon after a hugely disappointing experience at China Chan the day before. We were so glad that China King satisfied our craving for dim sum on our vacation and was reasonably priced.

Perhaps because it wasn't the weekend, but they didn't push around the dim sum carts instead leaving them on the side of the kitchen. I would recommend picking up one of the dim sum menus from the front desk to peruse the selection because they don't provide a menu on the table. But basically they have all the regulars and they are solid choices. They gave us a complimentary plate of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce as soon as you sit down. They were very tender and we cleaned the entire plate. 

Being an ABC California girl, I judge the quality of dim sum on 2 items: the steamed shrimp dumpling (har gow) and the custard tart (don tot). At China King both items were tasty and satisfactory but not exceptional. However, when you live in a town where there isn't any dim sum (like ABQ) then you will take what you can get when you are traveling. Additionally, we had the following items which I would also categorize as acceptable/satisfactory but not exceptional: steamed shrimp & beef noodle rolls, spareribs, tripe, sparerib congee, baked custard buns (I prefer the steamed ones), and chicken feet. We ordered the taro puffs and fried long donuts wrapped in rice paper from the kitchen but they took too long to make them and we were full at that point so we canceled our order for those.

I have no hesitation recommending China King for dim sum to my fellow Yelpers. On that particular Friday afternoon, probably 80% of the diners were Chinese/Asian which is always a good sign.
