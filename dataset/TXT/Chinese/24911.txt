70nmPKnAufzeKfRNVE0-Pg Hong Kong Wok has been the most dependable Chinese restaurant in my 2 1/2 years in Madison.  You can mainly find your usual Americanized-Chinese suspects on the menu (e.g. sweet and sour pork, beef and broccoli, fried rice) and some more "authentic" dishes for lunch on Saturdays and Sundays (e.g. congee and a few other items you might find at dim sum).  I used to come here often, and the food has always been pretty good and consistent.  While you won't get a spectacular meal, you'll get a tasty meal to satisfy your MSG cravings.  The portion sizes and price are right as well (under $8 for a meal with rice).
