I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Ummmm this is the best stuff I have ever tried. I get the taro snoh with almond pudding and condensed milk. Just for the record, I'm russian and had no idea what taro and almond pudding were until I randomly tried it here. The combination is heavenly. Oh, and get the stamp card because you will be back for more, trust me.
