chBeDQdaZgrb8iOzqgeCDA I ordered the general tsos(all time fav) and the sesame chicken for lunch. I wanted to try both and see which would come out in top. The fried rice had no taste and was dried out....I might has well have been chewing on the box. The chicken was terrible. It was stringy and had no taste. The sauce was nowhere to be found. I love Chinese food and I couldn't even finish the food. I am not a fan of this place. I tried to reheat it the next day and it looked like it had been in the fridge for over a week. Never again.
