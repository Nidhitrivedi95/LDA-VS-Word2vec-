VGxJbglGlx-a7Gdc55Q6jQ My boyfriend and I went here for all you can eat sushi on Thursday. There were about 4 or 5 tables in the entire restaurant, most of which were doing the all you can eat option. The waitress prefaced our experience with the fact there were only two sushi chefs so there was definitely going to be a wait. We sat down at 7:40 and ordered by 7:55. We received miso soup promptly. We did not get any other food until at least 8:45. Then we waited for the remaining parts of our order which the waitress eventually admitted had been given to another table by mistake. Keep in mind, we only had soup, an order of crab Rangoon, a single roll and two pieces of eel sashimi by 9:15. We asked if we could just pay and leave, we didn't want the rest of the order. The waitress said she felt bad and didn't want us to pay so she had to talk to a manager, which we did not want to pay $50 for less than $50 worth of food. She came back over with the bill and explained that they would let us take the food to go because they were already working on the remaining roll and three pieces of sashimi.. the bill was the full price. We paid and left and will not be back. They cannot support their all you can eat sushi crowd (all of 5 tables) and apparently do not care. The worst dining experience I've ever had. The only reason I give it a  star is because the sushi quality wasn't bad and the waitress seemed sincere.
