9WAnQD1nj1j3zLZ7ONtvfQ I stayed at the Palms this weekend so we ate at Little Buddha on Sat night.  I had a Lychee Martini that was strong, but pretty good.  I had the Spicy Lettuce Wraps, which was a very good amount, portion-wise.  It had small balls of spicy sashimi with some endives to make a little wrap.  It wasn't spicy at all (in my book) but it was tasty.  My bf had the Orange Chicken which was pretty good as well.  My friends got the Chow Mein (did't try) and the Wok Fried Calamari and Shrimp.  It was decent.  It definitely wasn't the best food or the best prices, but hey, it's Vegas.  It's going to be pricy and the "Asian Fusion" is going to be way less Asian than it is Fusion.  So don't go into Little Buddha if you're expecting fantastic Asian food.  You go for the ambiance and simply the fact that it's a "fancy" Vegas restaurant.  

Oh, but DO get the Liquid Center Chocolate Cake.  :)  Beautiful.
