jYF7PNnYcn3fWejv0ZE1-w I have only ordered delivery from them and they are almost always on time if not early. 

The only reason I didnt give 4 or 5 stars would be because of the staff. Sometimes the driver that comes will actually ask for more tip. Thats a big turn off. A tip is a tip and we give that based on our own feeling as to whats reasonable, it shouldnt be demanded. We are never stingy in our tip so I know whatever we have given has been a fair amount. 

food is pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. your typical american/chinese food.
