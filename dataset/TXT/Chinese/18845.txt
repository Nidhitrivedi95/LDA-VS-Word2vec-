5GOrW-PkisP0eXlSxy4AFg My mom and I ordered delivery a couple nights ago. The man answering the phone was very friendly and accommodating, however it took a while to get my street address and credit card number right because he kept confusing the numbers, and I had to repeat it at least 2-3 times. That was a little frustrating, but other than that, it was so quick, that I was surprised when I heard the doorbell ring. 

I like that some menu items (on the dinner menu) have a small and large portion available. My mom got the small and that gave her two meals! We got an order of Crab Ragoons (8 for $3.75) my mom got a small portion and I got a large portion, all for $20! SO much food, for a fantastic price. 

I wish that their whole menu listed descriptions of the meals, what kind of sauce, what specific vegetables were in each dish, etc. Overall, great place, and if I ever want to order in again, I'll go here :)
