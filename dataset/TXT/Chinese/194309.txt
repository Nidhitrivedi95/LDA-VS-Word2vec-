I love the Sweet and Sour Chicken, Egg Rolls, Crab Wontons and Beef and Broccoli with brown rice! Everything is always cooked to perfection with extra sauces. Delivery is quick, but I live close by and sometimes opt to go pick up the order so I can eat quicker! Don't forget the handful of fortune cookies that makes Chinese take-out complete. With these guys on speed dial, the future looks good and so does my dinner!
