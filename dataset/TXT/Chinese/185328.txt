XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA I found this hidden gem under Hot and New , as I was looking for dinner options. WOWZA!! My noodles were being pulled by the experienced chef right in front of my eyes, and then within minutes, my "small" bowl of Special Lanzhou Beef Noodles was on my table. Be warned that their small is the normally large bowl found everywhere else. All the ingredients danced in my mouth. This is just the perfect dish for this cold, and rainy night here in Toronto. The menu is really simple. Two main dishes to choose from. The Special Lanzhou Beef Noodles ( the noodles is submerged in the broth, or the Noodles with Homemade Pork Sauce (dry noodle-style with broth on the side). One other choice you have to make is the thickness of your noodles. The thicker the noodles, the more chewy it will taste in your mouth. Simple right? Check out this place asap because soon, waiting in line will be the norm for a bowl of their delicious hand-pulled noodles. Enjoy!
