cPfnF9PAvVjamEdZM3wTzA This place is scary, and here's why:

1. There is an extremely long line of green mold growth on the ceiling in the dining room that has moisture drops hanging from it- I can't believe this place hasn't been shut down for this reason alone.

2. Absolutely no pride has been taken in the maintenance of the dining room: the carpet is worn extremely thin and is rippling throughout the room and the booths have many tares.

3. Perhaps most scary is the food: If the management takes so little care of the dining area, how clean and sanitary can the cooking facility possibly be??? Furthermore, the temperature of the majority of the food on the buffets is way too low (I'd say mostly room temperature)- well below the USDA recommended safe temperature for food.
