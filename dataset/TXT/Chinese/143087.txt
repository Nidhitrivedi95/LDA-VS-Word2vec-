rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g Prologue:
I've dined at this restaurant for dim sum a few times in the past, however my fiancée had not and so we decided to give it a try together.

The Plot:
We ordered several of our usual favorite dim sum, including Pai Gwut (steamed pork ribs), Fong Djau (steamed chicken feet), Nor Mai Gai (sticky rice in lotus leaf), and Ngau Paak Yip (steamed beef tripe).
We also tried a couple of items that were new for us, including Baked Pineapple Roll with Egg Custard Filling and Cake Roll with Shredded Pork Filling.

The Scene:
My impression after this visit on the weekend is that their Dim Sum dining is now noticeably better, and consequently busier, than on my previous visits.
In particular was a greater variety of deserts, including the Baked Pineapple Roll mentioned above. Anyone who is a fan of Daan Taat (Egg Tarts) should enjoy the Pineapple Roll as much as we did. My fiancée, who is a native of mainland China, and I have never before had a dim sum item like the Cake Roll with Shredded Pork. The opportunity to try either one of these items would make a visit to this restaurant worthwhile.

The Rest of the Story:
The restaurant was very busy on a weekend afternoon; however we were seated within reasonable amount of time.
The service was prompt and courteous and the prices are standard for this level of dim sum.

Epilogue:
As good as this place is now while also being so close to home, this is now our go to place for weekend dim sum.
