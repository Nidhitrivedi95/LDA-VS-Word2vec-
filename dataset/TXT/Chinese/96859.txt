joMyW9KcBEsHJxQuAMulaQ Not bad, not great.  A VERY expensive place though.   For people not eating food, you have to pay $20/head.  If you are eating food, you still get charged but $5/head.  The menu has changed a lot since first opening.  The only options were pizza flatbread for $17-$19 (tasty), or snacks involving nuts etc.  Not a lot of choice.  The drinks were expensive too.  Roughly $7-$9 per beverage.  They trick you though.  I saw "Gin" listed and ordered one for $7 but my partner pointed out that at the bottom, if you order pop to mix it's an extra $2 and if you order tonic, soda etc it's an extra $4!!  $11 for a gin and tonic at a board game cafe are you serious??

All-in-all, a decent place to play some games.  But they really have to figure out their prices and menu.
