UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w We had their dinner. It was about 14 a person and absolutely underwhelming. My best advice is to say save your money and run to in and out burger. For 75% less you can get a meal that you actually enjoy! Run, jog, walk do whatever you can to avoid this food you won't be impressed at least with their dinner. The staff was nice, not their fault.
