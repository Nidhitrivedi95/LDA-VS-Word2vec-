zG3GJiIrF01bwgP0tQdkZg I haven't been back to this place since I was young. It definitely change a lot, but the decor and atmosphere was nice. My girlfriend and I split the Salmon Bites as an appetizer. It was delicious. Fresh salmon wrapped around sweet potato and covered in a sweet and sour type sauce. My girlfriend got the Empire Roll as her entrée. The presentation was nice and it tasted great. I got the King Curry. Definitely good, but would be better with avocado. We got the fried bananas for dessert and I would recommend those, too. Overall it was delicious food and a good experience. The service could be better, but that didn't bother me very much.
