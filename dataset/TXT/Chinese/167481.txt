VGxJbglGlx-a7Gdc55Q6jQ I have been here three times now, and all I have is good things to stay. I have had the sushi on two of my trips and both times it was fresh, tasty, and presented nicely. On my most recent visit I ordered off of the regular menu and had Szechuan shrimp. It was good and had the right amount of spice to it. The steamed dumplings and pork egg roll were both excellent as well.
