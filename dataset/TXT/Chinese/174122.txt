WbQOuI7mVST8XrJotWq9fA Ah the Jug! This restaurant brings back a lot of memories during my University years, you can count on the Jug being open after those dreaded 11:00 pm exams to satisfy your late night hunger! 

The restaurant itself is not very big and seating is limited, good luck trying to get a seat during lunch hours! (do not use their washrooms! you've been warned)
But then again you probably want take-out because the seats are not at all comfortable and the decor is not very nice ... in fact somewhat unclean. 

Their menu is pretty big and prices are extremely affordable with huge portion sizes. The food itself is mediocre at best but you will definitely leave with a full stomach. Personally I can only recommend their BBQ items since they do it quite well compared to many other establishments in the area.

This is probably a restaurant where you might want to come alone or with some friends for cheap eats; and not with your 'date' or for a family gathering.
