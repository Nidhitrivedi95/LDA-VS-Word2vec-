safPeH-s-P56V6wt6G0sFg If asked to described this place i would call it 'Americanized Chinese' but in a good way. 

For one the two servers I had interaction with didn't have thick accents and when asked for their opinion on certain dishes they actually gave HONEST OPINIONS. 
For example, i noticed there were Curry Puffs on the menu, i asked her if they were Singaporean style (used to work for Singaporean people and zomg their curry puffs were bomb) and said she had no idea what i was talking about, the curry puff they sold were pork filled dumplings in a barely noticeable curry sauce. WOW what an honest response!!

i decided to order the most expensive of the Wok Tossed Noodles (wow they didnt call it fried or stir fried) which was the Seafood Chow Fun. She asked if i wanted it wet or dry. all my life i was NEVER asked if i wanted my chow fun wet or dry. Went with wet because never had wet before.

my baggie came and i took it to work and opened up the bag. They gave me rice which i thought was weird, i ordered noodles why would i want rice? anyway the serving size was HUGE and tasted like what you would expect Chow Fun to taste like. 

The most noticeable thing about the Chow Fun is that i got full off the seafood and veggies and at the end had a box full of sauce and noodles.

Overall good experience and i'll come back for lunch specials on days i work.
