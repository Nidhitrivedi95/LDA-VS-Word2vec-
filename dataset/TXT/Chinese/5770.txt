0c6PQILCLwRZ8FIB4AEsGw One of my favorite quick-eat Chinese places. Mao Po tofu, without pork, is the shiiiit! This place is great for vegetarian eaters, because they'll happily replace any meat with tofu for you, and it always comes out awesome.

Usually get food here to-go, but if you do choose to eat in, they have good service, unless they're busy.
