Kk9fhCfdXyg_Cs-kXvnSMg Went to xiang bala hot pot for a uue and i think our party of 8 was pretty happy with our food overall; we ordered two hot pot with 4 different broth; 2 spicy and two non spicy and then we simply ordered 90%of the menu! There was a lot of food and i liked most of it! I enjoyed the sauces bar and the diversity available; one of my only downsize was for service; we reordered a few items and the waitresses either did not bring us what we asked for or brought us something that we did not ask for and we had to ask again to get it; i also wished they had a few more selections for dessert even if the red beans buns were pretty good, a sweet touch to a £16 menu would have been nice; i would definitely go back to xiang bala!
