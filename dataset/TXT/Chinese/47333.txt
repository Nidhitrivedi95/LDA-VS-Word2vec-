bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ I'm very nervous about where I buy Chinese food!  I have to say, I was very surprised of the flavor and taste was in my food!  I always get Mongolian beef NO vegetables and it still tasted amazing!  

If you have any doubts like me, try this place first!

I'll be returning again!
