This is my go to place for soup dumplings.  Every time I've come here for lunch, the food quality is consistent.  The variety of items makes it easy to order too much food.  Soup dumplings.. yes please, beef brisket noodle soup.. yes again,  pan fried dumplings, chive pancakes, hot and sour soup, noodles, beef pucks, the list goes on and on.  Why must I always order everything that looks good.  

How to stop myself from ordering too much.  The formula I try to use is 'number of dishes' = Y x 2.  Where Y is number of diners.  Never order more than 2 dishes/person.  The difficulty is following the formula.  Once again, I've ordered too much.
