jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg This place is absurdly expensive and a tourist trap. They don't have any lunch specials on the weekends or a lunch menu for that matter, so we had to order 1 plate of honey walnut shrimp from the dinner menu (even though it was 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon). 

Honey Walnut Shrimp with Mayonnaise $16.50 -- The portion was small (10 med/small sized shrimp) the shrimp tasted very fishy, not succulent and like they were freezer burned, plus they barely gave us any walnuts. We did not enjoy this dish at all. KJ kitchen's version costs less, gives you more shrimp and gives a ton more walnuts. Or you can go to China Tango Bistro in Summerlin and get a delicious, generous version for only $12! They rip you off here.

Their rice was super hard and dry - I have no clue how a legitimate Chinese restaurant can mess this up? 

Also, I was shocked they didn't have the real deal homemade authentic saté chili sauce in oil. They brought out the commercial bright red sambal oelek from a bottle which tasted weird and sour, not spicy at all. Very disappointing. 

Our 1 dish, rice and a soda was not worth $20, everything was unsatisfactory.

----- to that person who messaged me to move out of Vegas because my honest review insulted him. 

I will not! :P you're not the boss of me. but I will sit here and laugh about your idiocy and share it with all of my friends! :)
