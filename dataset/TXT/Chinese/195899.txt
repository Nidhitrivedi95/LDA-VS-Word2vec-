ZJ2XEwipCckNRhkkJN3qCQ I was referred to acupuncture by my perinatalogist due to high blood pressure during pregnancy.  My perinatalogist and cardiologist are very impressed with my acupuncture results related to keeping my blood pressure normal.  I have been able to maintain a normal blood pressure my entire pregnancy.  Dr Lee also treated my sciatic nerve pain with pregnancy and headaches.  I am very impressed with my results!  Highly recommend!!
