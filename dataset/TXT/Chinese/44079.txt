BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg the food is edible, especially when my standards were lower as a college student, but I wouldn't order from there anymore. It's your normal take-out chinese place, so you would think that it could get at least 2 stars. Let's just say they get 2 stars for food, but 0 for cleanliness, so it averages out to a 1 star rating.

I actually have an awful story about this place, but it's too disgusting to share publicly. If you want to know, I'd be happy to share privately, but I won't take any responsibility for your upchuck reflexes.
