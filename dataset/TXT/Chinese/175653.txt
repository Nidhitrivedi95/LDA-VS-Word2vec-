wJnhUJCOYkncLPZAwaMffA I had been to Room 112 several years ago and remember having a good experience. I came back this week on a business trip and overall enjoyed my experience. I did not have a wait and the waitress was attentive. The prices (especially coming from NY/SF) are great. My only complaint was that the quality of the sushi was not amazing. Obviously I still enjoyed myself and think the value and overall flavor combination was enough to warrant 4 stars, but the sushi and sashimi texture was a little soft and not quite what I would normally hope for. 

I also got the Miso soup and steamed Gyoza, which were excellent. I would definitely come back and hope that maybe I catch them after a new shipment.
