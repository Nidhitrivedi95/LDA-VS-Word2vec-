68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw While in Toronto, I stopped by in Chinatown for dim sum.  I ordered many of the steamed soup filled dumplings and the steamed dumplings.

Everything was very tasty and I would definitely come back.  I am used to Cantonese dim sum with waiters pushing tray carts and dumplings made to order.  Being from Los Angeles, I am quite particular and spoiled about dim sum.  

I wish I had more time in Toronto.  I would have visited other Chinese restaurants for variety.  I am glad I found this place.
