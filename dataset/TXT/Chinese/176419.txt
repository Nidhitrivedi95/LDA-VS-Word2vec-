WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg I think for a place to eat it suffices, it's not horrible, but nothing so spectacular as to write home about either.. 

It's unapologetically bland, in service, taste, and decor. I had the oxtail soup, because I was having joint pain, and the gristle is supposed to be like natural glucosamine and chrondroitin.. Anyway, I digress.. it was barely fall off the bone. Not tender, maybe I had the first of a new pot. It was a lot of work and sticky afterwards. Tired from being up all night I think most people would not be up for it. I was in for some work. Paid $10 for it too.. Maybe should have had it at the California Casino instead.. I don't recommend it unless you need to eat immediately to get back to your table or game. Maybe any of the egg combos would fare better. They made a girl an omelet of some sort while I was there. The breakfast combo I thought was a bit steep. It's not cheap, but not expensive. The days of deals in Vegas seem to be gone..
