-RmFfWUyUU1RPIGtih7J-w I found this place through Yelp and so glad I did. It's a nice change of pace from all the regular fast food that populates areas. It is easy to locate, easy access, and not too far from my office. 

The staff is very friendly and attentive while providing great and efficient service. I like their lunch special combo menu. Portion sizes are great and match the price well.

The egg drop soup has always been good, with consistent flavors. The lunch specials come with your entree, fried rice, soup,an egg roll and a soda. I'm always full when I leave and sometimes even have leftovers.
