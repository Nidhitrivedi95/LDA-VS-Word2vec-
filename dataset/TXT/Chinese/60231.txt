DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ Seriously?? One of the...worst...meals...ever.
I got a seafood and kalbi combination. The shrimp was heavily breaded, dry and flavorless. The mahi was okay. The kalbi was the worst I've ever had to the point of being nearly inedible.
Altogether one of my worst restaurant experiences, ever.
Blech!
I don't understand the good reviews, at all.

If you want fabulous Hawaiian food, check out Island Style over on Sahara. Less good, but still orders of magnitude better than Ohana, is Aloha Kitchen over on Decatur.
