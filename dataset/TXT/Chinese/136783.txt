qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A Overall, i like the food and atmosphere. service is good. The almond chicken dish is delicious.  My main complaint is that they, for an unknown reason,  serve the Merlot chilled,  which is what my girlfriend drinks only.  When we got the drink, even the waiter said that other customers complained the Merlot was chilled.  He said the manager did this. He offered to microwave the merlot for us! 

I had mentioned going their for dinner the other night, and my girlfriend declined based on the chilled Merlot.  

So if you, Mr. Manager, read this, chill out and stop chilling the Merlot. Room Temperature is fine and what everyone else serves it at. 

This may not seem like a big deal but it is for my girlfriend and now I can't enjoy their food.  :(

She lives in Henderson.
