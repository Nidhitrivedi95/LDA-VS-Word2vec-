PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Wanted to try some Dim Sum off the strip. Went to Yum Cha....what a great find!  It was off peak hours but still lots to choose from. The place is super clean and very well lit. All the dim sum staples we tried were very good. Had some delicious sticky rice and a nice serving of crispy pork belly. Also had a good bowl of congee. The owner Sam came over to make sure everything was ok. We struck up a conversation about Malaysia and the great food you can find there. His staff's service was great and he personally asked what could be done better. Now that's customer service! The place is new so hopefully the locals will support it and make it thrive. I want to return next time I'm back in Vegas.
