SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ Ordered the Thai mussels for lunch.
There were about 4 dead ones, they didn't open after cooking like the others.
I think the chef should've taken notice and replace those in the dish so I get the full order.
However it was DELICIOUS!
Service was fast and perfect in every way including fly-by checks.
I'll definitely be back!
