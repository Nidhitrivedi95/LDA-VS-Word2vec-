a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg I love the Jade Palace, in this part of Scottsdale it is hard to find locally owned Chinese dining. The food is excellent for the Phoenix area and almost as good as it is in New York and San Fran. They have all the classic and specialities like Steak Q which are delicious and well prepared! I love their potstickers and fried rice!
