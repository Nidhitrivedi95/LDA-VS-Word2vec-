8keN8Z2sylAEXgMCJMQpDg FINALLY!! God heard my cries and answered my prayers. I prayed God would send a good Chinese food restaurant to Chandler and He more than delivered. Don't let the small size in a strip mall fool you. They are cooking up a storm here. Don't blink because you'll miss it. Hell we use to drive to Singing Panda & eat with the blue hairs & silverbacks. With this place being only 5 minutes from my home we will either eat here or get it to go all the time. This is NOT Gold Chef, Beijing or Panda Express. It's not doughy chicken covered in sugar water with food coloring. The chicken is breast meat chicken battered & cooked just right. The food is fresh, hot & bursting with flavor. The vegetables were brights, charred just right and maintained the snap we all look for. The portion sizes are stupid big and priced just right. We had the orange chicken, the boneless BBQ ribs and mongolian beef. EVERYTHING was amazing. If you want chinese food that taste like chinese food, go to My House. You might see us there!
