Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA AWESOME place! Found it through this site and got the recommended dishes of Pan Tai, fried rice and then yellow curry!!! Yum! Dishes are spicy so review helped me keep it at 2 which was perfect. Our second visit tried Beef PHO which was fabulous! Best I have had! Rounded off with doughnuts for dessert! Great service and great food! A place to not miss!!!!
