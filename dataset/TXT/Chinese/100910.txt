K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw This is the better, if not best, Malaysian restaurant in the GTA. Granted it's not really a restaurant (more of a take-out place, it has a bar and a few stools) but it's run by Malaysians and serve pretty authentic Malaysian food. My favourite is their nasi lemak (much better than the neighbouring Malaysian restaurant's)! They are also good for Nyonya Kuih (dessert food) and we had bought a big platter of it for parties. 

I recommend calling ahead to see if they have the food you want to eat before making trip there (especially for the kuih).
