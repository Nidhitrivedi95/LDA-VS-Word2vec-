uoV4aDfXbRmvyHSezdn--w I'm starting to think that it is, in fact, too much to ask to get a decent Chinese chicken dish on the west side of Madison (after a couple years I've only found one reliable place). Tai's is yet another place I can cross off the list for having seriously sub-par meat. 

I ordered the sesame chicken. The portion size was hefty, the container felt like it weighed a couple of pounds. Unfortunately, the contents were so awful I can't even give them points for serving me enough for several meals. 

My first bite was just a little guy (many of the pieces of chicken were enough for several bites), and I was immediately put off by the texture - well, really the lack thereof. There was no discernible difference between the meat and breading, which I find problematic. The taste was also lacking - it didn't taste like chicken, and there wasn't much to the gooey, blaze-orange sauce. 

The next piece of chicken I went for had a disconcerting dark spot under the breading and glaze. Since there were some greens mixed in, I thought maybe a leaf had gotten stuck under the batter - but no. After cutting into it, I discovered it was dark grey meat. I skipped to the next piece, and noticed it too had a dark spot. Cut into that - same story. The next piece? Almost all fat and connective tissue. Now, before you go, "this girl is dumb, it was probably just dark meat!" - no. No no no. When half of the chicken chunk is white and half is not, there's something weird happening. Also, why does it have no texture? At all? I shouldn't be able to gum chicken without choking. 

Yuck.
