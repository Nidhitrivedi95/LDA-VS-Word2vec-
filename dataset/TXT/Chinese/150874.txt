SxjNgkzAlUG-wt2rSbc2HQ lots of sauce, alot of rice, and not alot of meat. that pretty much sums up my experience at New Ho. Yes it's open late, and yes you can eat +tip for under 10$, but there are many other choices in Chinatown than New Ho King. I found a pebble in my food which cut my tooth. I ended up not paying for the fish, after spending alot of time explaining how i DID NOT ORDER ROCKS IN MY FOOD. Thank god, I would have been in the red if I have to pay the extra 6$. 


Ya.......have a good time?
