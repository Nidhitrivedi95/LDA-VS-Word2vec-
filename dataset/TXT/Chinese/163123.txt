UPF6nUKB_kbMM44xiEc66g Last night was my first time to the newly opened Jimmy Woo's.  Since I was looking forward to this, my expectations were high.  From start to finish, it was a great dining experience!  

When you first walk-up, the space is inviting with outdoor seating, a huge open bar and great energy throughout.  After entering the restaurant, we were warmly greeted and seated right away.  The interior is red and black as anticipated for a traditional Chinese restaurant, but combined with the retro-feel of a cool lounge.  The food was great as were the aptly named drinks such as the Woo jito.  We had a number of entrees including Mongolian lamb and Singapore noodles.  Even the chocolate flourless cake was delicious.  In addition, the entire staff we encountered, from our server to the management, was really attentive and service oriented.  

For a new restaurant, they were extremely well-run and exceeded my expectations.  I look forward to dining here again in the near future and trying some of the other items on the extensive menu.
