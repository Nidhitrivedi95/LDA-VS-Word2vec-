fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ I really didn't like the food here. There was nothing special about it at all. I'd rather get Chinese takeout and save a couple hundred bucks. Had the chow mein, hot n sour soup (  the best thing ) 2 different kinds of lobster (the deep fried was fried in the shell still which I REALLY didn't like), Tao chicken, and Mochi ice cream (boo). Not sure how this is a Michelin one star. There are much better restaurant's in the Wynn. Nice decoration tho, the restaurant is really pretty. I also thought the service was bad, not what you would expect for the Wynn. Felt unwelcome (dealbreaker) had to chase down the server for drink orders multiple times because we weren't asked. Also had to ask for those chairs for your purse etc a bunch of little things that I really don't care about but would expect from a high end restaurant.  I  understand we had the last reservation and people want to go home but that's how the job works and your obviously getting a nice tip out of the deal. Go to Mizumi!!!!
