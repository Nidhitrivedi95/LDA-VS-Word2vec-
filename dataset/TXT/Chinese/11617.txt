2GtIC6u4hVneccWfTlOxHQ I'm not the biggest fan of buffets namely because it's not conducive if you're on a diet, and I'm not a big eater. So a buffet would be a waste to me since the price I'd be paying would not be worth it. With Hong Kong gourmet it isn't that much of a waste because of what they offer. I believe it's $14 for dinner which includes the buffet, sushi bar, and mongolian grill. If you want to load up on seafood then the price you paid is worth it and surpasses that. 

I enjoyed being able to get some stir-fried squid, tilapia, and scallops, and some sushi altho mediocre was sufficient enough for a seafood feast. I like the selection and you know it has to be good enough when half the customers are Asian so that has to count for something. 

The dessert bar is eh altho it's nice that there's a fresh fruit alternative complete with lychees and some other tropical fruit that I'm not sure of but tastes good. Anyways, if you're looking for a good Chinese buffet this is not bad, it's good enough!
