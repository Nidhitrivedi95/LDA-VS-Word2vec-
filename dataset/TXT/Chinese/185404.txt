xyskSLRWf5ixBWSYk5hnDQ I have been going to Paradise for years, before becoming vegan and after.

We go at least once a week.  I enjoy the fact that unlike other Mongolian BBQ places, I can fully spice my stir-fry with all the hot spicy sauce I want prior/during cooking.  The other places don't want to go through the extra work to clean the grill for the next guest, at Paradise it is just done without complaint or comment.  Before cooking my stir-fry, the cooks know to clean the grill so no meat residue is left.  Now that I am a vegan, they know that for my first serving of stir-fry I need Tofu for my protein.  My one complaint, which is minor, is the extra $1.25 for the Tofu, when I'm not consuming anything with meat, either in the stir fry or from the buffet.

The selection of vegetables and meats are always fresh and appetizing.  My kids love making their own combinations.  They know my rule for them is, "Take all you want, but eat ALL you take."  My other complaint is about my fellow customers who have never quite grasped this concept, if they have heard about it in the first place.  Wasting food because you can will drive prices up for everyone.
