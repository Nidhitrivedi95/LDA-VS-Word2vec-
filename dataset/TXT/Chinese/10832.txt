26Kt6gQRF7S6m7crwR0tjw The owners of the restaurant are both very nice. The quality of the food is really good, the short ribs and the squid are both really good. 4 dishes were able to serve up to 6 people. And it only took them 15 mins to have the food ready. I strongly recommend you guys to go to this place.
