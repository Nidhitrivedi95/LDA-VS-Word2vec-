VC-S7T5aSOP9HTKu_TNHKA Beware of dry mouth! I'd really only eat here again if nothing else nearby was open. 

The menu is inexpensive, food comes in large portions but the quality if just not there. They cook with an obscene amount of MSG and grease. They have poor breakfast choices as well and this place just cannot fry an egg properly. 

This place is not the cleanest, even by quick and dirty Chinese restaurant standards.The milk tea is very weak but leaves an awful film in your mouth. Cold drinks here are super watery.
