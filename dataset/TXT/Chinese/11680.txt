2jx_SaBzvIdIwul4JoY9IA I feel very fortunate to have found this place. The portions are American style (huge) but the food is very much what you would expect from a stereotypical Chinese restaurant and wonderfully inexpensively priced. I am a big fan of the fried rice but everytime we go I bring somebody who tries a lunch combo and appreciates the volume, price, and quality of the food.
