I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a place outside of the strip to eat at. It's a spacious venue and 24/7. There's no rush, but the food comes out quickly.

The fresh spring rolls were great and actually fresh. The pho here is rich in flavor - we got the combination platter. I also got Vietnamese Caramelized Pork (Thit kho to), which was flavorful and well done, but not really worth the $18. The mango smoothie seemed watered down, but was still a great dessert drink. The coconut drink was ok as well.

All in all, I would definitely go again though. The food and service were great for a cheap price and quick meal.
