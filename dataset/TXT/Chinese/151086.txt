SykyXR8BFiBRH9ON-Kj9kg I really wanted to like this place. The selection of food options is crazy, the lit up Shanghai sign, the price...everything about this place seems appealing except the food. For some reason this place reminds me of an oriental Bourbon Street Grill and perhaps its because their most popular item is their bbq chicken also known as Bourbon Chicken at Bourbon Street Grill. The portions here are big however, the food I found lacked flavor and was very mediocre. Sometimes its good to have 5-6 great dishes than to have 10-14 mediocre ones which I find was the issue here. They do have various meats and noodles/rice/veggie options to choose from if you're looking for variety. Fish options (spicy shrimp) are extra as they are at many other places. 

Unfortunately I have had better and would walk past this place to Manchuwok if I had the option.
