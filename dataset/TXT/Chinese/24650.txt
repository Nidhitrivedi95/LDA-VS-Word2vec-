6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ Wrote this review a little late but hey, better late than never - especially since I wanted to share what a great time I had at Donburi.

We had ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry and the Beef Tongue (Gyu) Soba Noodle Bowl. Both portions were very generous. The chicken had a great crisp to it. I loved the noodle soup and I'm glad they didn't skimp out on the beef tongue 'cause it was delicious! The staff was very friendly and attentive. I was even given an extra bowl of soup because they noticed that my noodles had already absorbed a lot of my soup.

Overall, I was very content with my experience at Donburi and I'll definitely be coming back (especially once they get their liquor license!) This is looking like it'll be the uptown version of Guu/Kinton. Can't wait!
