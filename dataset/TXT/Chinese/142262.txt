RJnikmkw2aW4gF2zcmxfvQ Hands down the BEST Hakka joint in the GTA. Over the years, I have tried them all (Chilli Chicken House, Fredrick's, Royal Jasmine just to name a few) and I keep coming back here. If you've never been, stop what you're doing and plan a visit. The restaurant is always very busy. There are literally hundreds of take out orders happening simultaneously with dine-in guests, but service is always fast. The menu is quite large. For anyone who is new to this type of food, Hakka cuisine is an Indian adaptation of Chinese food which made it's way to India many, many years ago. It can be quite spicy, depending on the dish. Some of the Hakka favorite staples are Chilli Chicken (dry or with gravy), Manchurain Shirmp, Fried Rice and Sweet Corn Soup. If you are going to do a take out order, be warned that Hakka food doesn't taste as great as it cools, and it does not always re-heat well. Dine-in if it's your first time for the best experience; and if you're a Hakka pro (like me), just call ahead with your order, and race home with your hot, white plastic bag of belly-bursting deliciousness.
