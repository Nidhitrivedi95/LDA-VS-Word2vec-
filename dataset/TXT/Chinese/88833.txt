I've also had them cater some events and they've been very helpful, delivering huge portions of food, on-time and for a reasonable price. 

I've seen the owner in there feeding her kids Chinese water spinach--real Chinese food. I do kind of wish it was on the menu, but alas I'll just go to How Lee for that.
