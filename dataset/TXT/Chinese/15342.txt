3PsmvwxetLz1Tzb-6mNhgA Too expensive, kind of plan, not enough portion for the price and not authentic asian food! 

The only thing I like about PF Chang is their drink menus. Otherwise service kind of sucks and so does the food. They are super busy also; so be prepare to wait to eat overly price food. 

I heard the PF Chang is a lot better in the South Park area, but having the experience I did at this PF Chang I don't think I want to waste my time again.
