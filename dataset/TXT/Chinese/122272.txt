OfqTPtPSQfCVxaSlY4qAxg Not the prettiest place nor the best service in town either but the food is good. Although good I still gave it 3 stars because the menu is inconsistent. If they would serve only duck, roast pork or char siu then this would be 5 stars all the way! But if you order outside of that then it's hit or miss. 

Just like they have in China town shops they have the duck and char siu hanging in an heating box where you can see the food before ordering. You can order it whole or by the pound or you can order them as a combo which they call rice plate. I order the 2 meat combo which comes with 2 meats of your choice stacked on top of a pile of white rice. My 2 meats are roast pork and duck, watch out because they give you enough for lunch and dinner. The duck is cooked perfect where it's still moist and juicy. The roast pork is a roasted slab of pork belly and they chop it up bite size for you. The best part of it all is it's only $11!?!?
