TWkL-VHo6P-WwL8iTvqlYQ Great Lunch or Dinner spot! The restaurant is clean, organized & at a great location. The food is excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful. I love their Online ordering option for pick up! If you go around lunch, the line can be insanely long BUT on the plus side- instead of having customers fend for themselves waiting for an open table, they have a seating/clean up system set up that I find impressive!  That's what I call customer service!! I recommend sitting out on the patio if weather permits.

When getting your drinks- be sure to check out their fancy soda machine! = )  This may be silly but I especially love that they offer orange slices, as well as lemon slices for your water! Not many places have that so that makes me super happy! :D Also- I can't be the only one who's impressed with how sturdy and nice their napkins are? No cheap, flimsy napkins here! 

FOOD time! HmMmmm..  Here are a few things I will order repeatedly: If you want something lighter, I suggest the Traditional Chicken Lettuce Wraps (they have a lot of other lettuce wraps options now), I like their Hot & Sour Soup & Crab Wontons. For a noodle dish, my favorite is probably Chicken Pad Thai. Be sure to add some of the chili paste in there for a bit more kick! Their fried rice is yummy if you want something "basic". From their Signature dishes, I enjoy Caramel Chicken, Mongolian Beef & Orange Peel Chicken. For those of you who must eat Gluten-Free- they got you covered!! 

 I would definitely recommend this place if you haven't tried it! Enjoy!
