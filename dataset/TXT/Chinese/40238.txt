AZ_iSVHQdBiCTnMolLTg3Q China Buffet and China Garden are one in the same, CG is a portion of the restaurant for take out and delivery while CB is obviously a sit down and serve yourself buffet. I really don't have any complaints, as a vegetarian this place satiates my hunger pangs. Veggie lo mein, egg foo young, peppery fried potatoes, veggie egg rolls, mac and cheese, sauteed mushrooms, string beans and mixed veggies are always hot and tasty.
