2dSXKC4BQUFSqsiziNFwtA Nice small restaurant serving plump juicy steamed pork buns at a great value of $7.5 for 10
We ordered a beef wrap, beef noodle in soup and the family favorite pork buns for 2 people when I cuda wuda shuda ordered 3 rounds of those mean steam buns

If you happen to locate this slightly secluded eatery then I suggest you stop by, however do so before the dinner times as it did get a little crowded with lots of families who seemed to be seasoned veterans at ordering only steamed buns
