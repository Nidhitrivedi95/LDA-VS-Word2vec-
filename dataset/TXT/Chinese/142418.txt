RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg My oh my... just thinking about Ta Ta's makes my mouth water!!

I have definitely found my new favorite restaurant. I have ate at many teppanyaki style restaurants and this one tops my list. The hibachi chefs are hilarious, the wait staff attentive and you just can't beat the prices for the amount of food you get. Right now all regular sushi rolls and teppanyaki entrees are 40% off!! WOW!! Tender, juicy, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon for under $15... yes please :) 

Tip: make a reservation before you go. With only two teppan tables they of course fill up fast! Other seating options- you have a full service sushi bar and the regular restaurant tables.
