X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Came here on a Sunday night. It was 35 degrees outside in December so only the one floor was open. 

We had eaten dinner at Hakkasan and were also on a guest list for the club. Because of one or the other, we were given one free drink ticket each. Unlike the Bank, Hakkasan honored our drink tickets for redbull/vodka. Score! Only drink out of the question was champagne.

Hakkasan is different from other Vegas clubs I have visited in the sense that as I had heard, this club really is all about the famous DJ's. Yes, there are some people mingling in the open bar areas but this is really the place to come to dance or be a spectator. It's really a site to behold.
