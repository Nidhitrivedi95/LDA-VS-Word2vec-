68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw Came here for the first time yesterday. I got the chicken wings half sweet Thai chili, half cilantro. I think it could of had been better for the wings, I wasn't a big fan on them. I also got the combo #1, it was super delicious. I just wish it was a bigger portion for the price. The staff was very friendly, refilled our waters constantly. Place was clean and luckily wasn't busy when I went there. But I would definitely return for that #1 combo!
