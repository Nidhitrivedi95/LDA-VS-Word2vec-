4eAKvnILoB8n4wUWd3uy3Q came here for their lunch special "4.99" advertised .... wow.. presentation here straight up sucks.. theres really none.. they throw couple of manchu wok items in a bento box and called it a day..

on top of that it was not even consistent.. one of the other bentos was missing an orange slice.
