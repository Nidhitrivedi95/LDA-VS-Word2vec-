beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw This review is long overdue. I dont know why I never wrote a review for this place. 
Hands down best hot pot place in Vegas. 
I was hooked up on mongolian/chinese hot pot in LA but had to move to Vegas soon after. Vegas has a lot of mediocre shabu shabu places but I was so excited as soon as chubby cattle opened. I can tell most of the servers here are students at UNLV so they really prioritize  on hospitality and service. There were sometimes language barriers but being asian, myself, it wasn't a big deal. The meat is always superb and I absolutely love their strong soup bases. Thumbs up for their daily specials/deals as well!
