The soup dumplings, which used to be one of the strongest menu items, are now bland and overcooked.  The last time fresh spring rolls were ordered they were obviously old and had been sitting in the refrigerator for several days. We've tried to order several items the last couple of times only to be consistently told that they are unavailable, leaving us with more run-of the mill choices that could be obtained at any other number of Chinese restaurants in the area.  This had been a nice option for us with a child who is only interested in "Americanized" Chinese, since they offer both that and more authentic dishes on the menu. However, with the prices being significantly higher than other area restaurants and the food quality being just mediocre at this point, we will not be going back.
