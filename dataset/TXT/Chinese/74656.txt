fseN-tYwcbjtYm7DjjEjLw The customer service is excellent. They double checked my order in front of me and made sure they had my order right before I left.
The food is outstanding 
This place is a hidden gem
No need to go anywhere else!
Orange chicken, sweet & sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, and Beef Broccoli are amazing!
Will be coming back soon
