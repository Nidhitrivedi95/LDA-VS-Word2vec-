Zs8LPufciU-jDpbAVFqKcA This hole-in-the-wall American-Chinese carry-out joint has three things going for it.

1. Large portion sizes. I'm a big eater and I've never finished one of their entrees in one sitting.

2. Good, fresh ingredients. Meat is not over-breaded. Vegetables seem fresh. Very good eggs rolls --- I assume they are made from scratch at that location.

3. Fast, no-nonsense service.

On the downside, the flavor of their dishes probably won't wow you. At best they could be said to "lack complexity" (e.g., their orange and General Tso's is just the typical sugary sauce you'd expect from any Chinese carry-out). At worst they could be described as bland (e.g., the cashew chicken, kung pao chicken, black bean chicken, and especially the sesame chicken leave a lot to be desired, in my opinion).

Taken together, if you're looking for a lot of American-Chinese food but without intricate flavors, China Gate is about as good as it gets. If you want more emphasis on flavor and authenticity, check out Richie Chan's on Lee Road.
