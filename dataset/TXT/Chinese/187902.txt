yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Came here for brunch with my sister before going to the airport, we were tired, hungry and just wanted to sit down. We were seated very quickly, got our drinks, ordered and got our food very fast and with a smile. We shared  #13, special combo pho, and #1 shrimp pork spring rolls. The pho was very good. The broth was very flavorful, the spring rolls came out very fast. The wraps were not the freshest but it explains how fast they came out. The servings were big so make sure you have an appetite! Very good!
