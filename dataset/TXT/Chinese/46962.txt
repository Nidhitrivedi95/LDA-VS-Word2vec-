bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Hello Yelp,

I have been to Singing Pandas twice, both of those times, we waited at least an hour for our food. The first time me and my wife ate at Singing Pandas we waited at least 45 minutes for our food, there was no wait staff available. I gave Singing Pandas a second chance, but the second time was just as bad as the first time. If you want decent  service, please do not go to Singing Pandas.
Go to Panda Express instead of Singing Pandas, you would get the same quality of food but with better service.
