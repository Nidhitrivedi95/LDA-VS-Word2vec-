beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Fun take on two great things, hot pot and the conveyor type meals!!!  They have quite the selection of soup bases and we tried three types of the soup bases.  The original, quite healthy and traditional tasting.  The tomato base, very flavorful but definitely for the tomato lover.  The mushroom base, is very healthy tasting too.  The quality of vegetables, meat, and seafood is very fresh!  The mix is constantly changing according to the staff and chef, you can definitely tell there is a lot of local and seasonal flavors.

Mathew, our server, provided great service with a smile and was very friendly!  

Really fun place, you can do individual style hot pot or community/family style.  Small groups to a large groups, this is a great spot to go!  We'll be back again!
