Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Getting settled into Vegas, I decided to search for a god thai place. I'm missing home and wanted to have a different option for food other than fast food and subway. Found this place and ordered via Yelp (that was kind of neat). The driver came  and brought the food he was cool, at least he didn't lost coming into the complex. The food smelled good. I got chicken basil stir fry and a salad. It was the very first salad option I don't remember. Oh yea also ordered a that iced tea. I was impressed with the packaging. My food was in the container, put in a plastic bag this perfectly and was taped closed. that was then placed in a to go, thank you baggie. I know the packaging sounds like a lot but I hate when I order delivery and all the juices from the food has puddled in the bag. I was plating and tasting when I heard a knock on the door, I run over and it was the driver, he forgot the thai iced tea the first time and brought it back, I had totally forgot about the tea until midway through my food probably. That was coo though, at least he remembers. The food was good, Mild wasn't too spicy at all. I would for sure order again. I ADDED PHOTOS OF THE FOOD IN MY PICS
