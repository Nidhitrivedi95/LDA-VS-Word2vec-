VvSmE1NnTjnaTPHT0WrCaQ This is a wonderful place we keep coming back to. If you're into vegetarian food, basically, you can order anything off the menu, and you won't be disappointed. I've added photos of what we had to the photos section:

- The hot & sour soup is excellent, with enoki mushrooms. "Small" size is great for two people, unless you're making a meal of it.

- The enoki mushroom balls were wonderful, served on a bed of steamed spinach, with a sweet sauce based on soy. Yum!

- The soy drumsticks proved to be an excellent appetizer. Great texture, and very nice sauce to go with them.

- King's cafe is also a teahouse, with some excellent selections. Today we had "osmanthus fragrant dancong" tea ... quality oolong tea with strong peach/apricot accents. Better alone, I think, than with a meal, but it was great nonetheless.

Overall, highly recommended!
