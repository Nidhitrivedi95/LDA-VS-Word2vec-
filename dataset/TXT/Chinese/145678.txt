S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ Hue Thai is a little sandwich place slash Vietnamese restaurant.

I've been here a lot of times, mostly for sandwiches.

The place is pretty big and has a huge selection.

I'll say the service is pretty good, but speaking in another language is never appropriate-just makes it awkward for customers.

It's definitely a solid place, but I can only base that off of the sandwiches. The food, itself, I haven't tried enough to say.

It's located a bit away from china town.

Overall nothing special.
