yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw My Daughter and I moved here about 6 mos ago from Texas and we are working on finding our favorite food spots.  We decided to visit China Gourmet last week for dinner based on others reviews and were not disappointed! This place looks very clean and comfortable.  The staff were all smiles when we walked in and once our order was placed we quickly received our dishes and each was delicious and impressive in taste.  The Tso Chicken was actually somewhat spicy! So many places I have visited in the past that had spicy dishes that didn't deliver the heat.  We both agree that we have found our new spot for great Chinese food! Thank you again!
