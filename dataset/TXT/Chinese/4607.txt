This is the best seafood restaurant I had ever tasted in my life
It's a bit on the pricey side but it's worth the money 
You can see the live lobsters and crabs in their water tanks. The server brings your live lobster or crab from the water tank and show you before cooking.
I ordered lobster dinner for 2 
It came with....
 - Soup of the day
- Lobster fried rice 
- Lobster. My chosen Flavour was salt and pepper 
- Dessert
