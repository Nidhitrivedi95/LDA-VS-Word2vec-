zPcF4fI18gSp42G17oHmmg We loved this place. Traveling from Sedona to the Phoenix airport we ended up here based on yelp reviews. Large strip mall this building set alone with big parking lot outside the door. Quick to seat you. Big comfy booths. Clean bathrooms. The food selection and quality was excellent. The BBQ and sushi were great with so many other standard Chinese food offering. Everything was hot and fresh. Drinks quick to arrive. The desserts were awesome with eight different flavors of hand scoop ice cream flavors. Only $8 per person for lunch is the best value anywhere. I really liked the crab with cheese served on a seashell. Yummy!
