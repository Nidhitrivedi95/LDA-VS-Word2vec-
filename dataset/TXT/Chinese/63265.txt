Dxx9L6_wyfjiZieJJurptw Do not come to this Panda Express. You walk in and food is not ready and they aren't even cooking it. As soon as a restaurant opens it's expected for all the food to be ready as well. They didn't even have sauce like wow is it really that hard to heat up some sauce. I won't be coming back , the food was terrible and looked and tasted old.
