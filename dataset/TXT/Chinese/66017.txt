EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw Excellent dim sum and the  lunch special was great. The staff are very friendly. Service was awesome.  This place is different from other dim sum's restaurant, there is no cart, which is GREAT !, because everything is fresh and hot !  and made to order. 

Not like other places, Dim Sum Cafe does not use too much salt and no MSG, but yet still so tasty. I went there for lunch, it's almost full ! I am glad, because I want them to succeed. GREAT PLACE, GREAT PRICE, GREAT SERVICE !
