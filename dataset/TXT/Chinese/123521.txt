OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA Decided to get take-away from King Noodle on an errand filled  Friday evening... The restaurant itself wasn't too busy, a few free seats and a short line at the bbq area.  I went into King Noodle once a few months ago, but came out empty handed cuz I didn't feel like hanging around when it was busy and the front area was cramped with people waiting to be seated and ordering the bbq.

The restaurant looks bright and clean when there isn't a crowd of people and service was fast... Very fast. I ordered my food and it was ready in 10 minutes.

I got:
- Beef brisket noodle soup
One of the best I've had - The beef was so soft and broth was flavourful, not too salty... Could use some veggies tho.
- 1/2lb bbq pork and small container of rice
Also very flavourful and juicy, good balance of sweet & savoury.

King Noodle food is top notch and prices were reasonable (total was under $13) - that's saying a lot as I have been spoiled coming from Markham/Scarborough. Will definitely be back to try the rest of menu.

Cash only.
