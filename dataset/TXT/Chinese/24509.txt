6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag We decided to try this place after the Las Vegas Weekly ran a rave review. We weren't disappointed.

But there are some low points: First, know going in that the menu is very confusing (in Chinese and English with lots and lots of options).  So prepare to be patient when figuring out the menu because the staff is not much help and spoke very limited English.

With that in mind, China Mama is the best chinese food I've found in Vegas.  We followed the exact recommendations of the reviewer and ordered steamed pork dumplings and crispy beef.  Wonderful.  The dumplings were tender and stuffed with a nice mix of pork and green onion.  The crispy beef was wonderfully seasoned, but a little greasy.

We also went out on our own with a standard Kung Pao Chicken and a very interesting fried rice with pineapple, shrimp and sausage.  The best.  The best fried rice I've ever had.  The Kung Pao was great.  It's a standard, but there are plenty of chinese places that fail with the sauce.  China Mama doesn't.  It's definitely one of the better kung pao's I've ever had.
