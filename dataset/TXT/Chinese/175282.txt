wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA We came on a Friday night and ordered 2 AYCE for $14 (Used the $10 LivingSocial valued at $20) Each dinner is 13.99. Total 30.25

- Across from Hard Rock Hotel. 
- Our server, Angela, said that bc we didn't print our LivingSocial, They can't accept it. WTF. After realizing that it was far-fetched, I told her you can just take a picture of the coupon. She agreed. Management fail. 
- Aside from the initial confusion, This MBBQ offers great options! They serve more than the basics. Tofu is a huge plus for me, along with baby carrots. But pizza toppings? HAHA. Whatever floats your boat. 
- Chef can provide you with optional white rice with your meal. I saw one of their employees stir-fry their rice! Looked great, but not a option for customers. HAHA. Worth a shot to ask ;). 
- Food quality was still fresh! Great to know esp if you eat during dinner.
- Like most MBBQ restaurants, they did not give us fried wantons and soup.
- Nice interior design.
