6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ Service was excellent and very professional- my server, was very knowledgeable of the menu and  was able to make some very good recommendations. I only wish I would have taken all of his suggestions and not ventured on my own.... The two tapas dishes he recommended, the squid/shrimp and pot stickers were amazing, the  edamame was horrible though- under cooked, no flavor whatsoever even though I ordered the spicy. I had three pods, pushed it aside and moved on. The bus boy must know this dish is frequently disregarded, because he was quick to remove the audacious presentation from my table. Fu's pot stickers were, themselves, somewhat under-seasoned, but the vinegar-ginger sauce for dipping provided a wonderful ascension to the dish. The  hosin accompanied duck that I had for my entree was well above average: cooked to perfection and flavorful, the hosin sauce tasted manufactured, however, it was still a terrific condiment. The "Chinese pancakes" were spongy and not over steamed, but exaggerated how filling the meal was. Overall, a great hint of elegance for the Hard Rock Hotel, but not up to the expectations that had been set by the hotel staff and the overly praising reviews I had read both on Yelp and Online.
