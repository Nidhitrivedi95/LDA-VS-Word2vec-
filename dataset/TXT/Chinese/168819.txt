Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA I've already returned and I have to report back all the seating upgrades they have added here. They have added quite a few booths and seating options and can now seat quite a few more people comfortably inside the restaurant, plus the booths are sparkly and red. Nice.

Service and the food were still the stars of the show here. I tried the Red Curry, Roti and Filet Mignon Pho on this occasion. They were all fantastic. The pho is more of a Thai version and has a great heat. The Red Curry was pretty awesome, but I think the Massaman is still my favorite. Looking forward to trying some of their rice and noodle dishes on the next visit.
