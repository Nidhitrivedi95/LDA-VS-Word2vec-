sQFpfRs1Flcw3evCdI2wpA My friend and I were craving some Vietnamese food.   We didn't want to walk all the way to Yonge and Charles for some Vietnamese good, so we decided to check out Asian Bowl.

The decor in this place is pretty cool, especially the dragon wallpaper and the lighting is awesome.

My friend and I ordered the dinner special (viet 2), it came with a wonton soup, pork chop, rice, and beef ribs. The soup had garlic bits inside and gave it a unique flavour to other wonton soups I ate in the past.  The pork chops and beef ribs were juicy and not overcooked, which I appreciated. To finish things off my friend and I ordered the deep fried banana with ice cream.  It was alright but the ice cream had a little freezer burnt, they made up with the quantity of the deep fried banana was all it.

Overall cost was 57 dollars including tip (6 dollars tip).  A bit pricey but it is downtown so prices are a bit high, however, the portions sizes are huge.  If your around Eaton Centre, it would not hurt to give them a try.
