dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ Food looks nothing like the pictures online. My zucchini was watery, and the breading was terrible. I asked for marinara with it. I didn't get that. The general tso chicken is not saucy and tastes like plain chicken. Again, these two dishes look absolutely nothing like the website photos. See my photos for comparison. The white rice and lo mien were good. Delivery was on time. Overall, I didn't get my marinara sauce, extra soy, or extra duck sauce that I asked for. The duck sauce is very very sweet and dark in color. I wouldn't order again.
