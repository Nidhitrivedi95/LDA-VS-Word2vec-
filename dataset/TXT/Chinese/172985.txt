W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ Yusho was located in the back of Monte Carlo near the exit to the Strip. Because of the 2 for 1 deals on drinks, we got two draft cocktails. My drink was called chihai (I think) which had liquor, jasmine tea, and citrus juice. It was not that sweet and masked the alcohol very well. For our appetizier, we got the mushroom soup. It wa s surprising that we couldn't finish it since it was in a small bowl. I got a logan poser ramen which is tonkatsu soup base and had a fried pork ball on the stick. My friend got the lobster based soup ramen with the same pork ball. The server suggested mixing everything in the soup before eating. The ramen was delicious and filling. I was unable to finish eating or drinking the soup. 

The bill came out to around $58 which is slightly steep for 2 ramens and drinks but hey it's Vegas right? The service was wonderful and they were attentive, answering our questions and being helpful.
