We ate here 3-4 times per week but now that bottled beer is $6 for beer that retails at $1 or less per bottle in the package stores we have decided to go elsewhere. The restaurant Ah So about 50 feet from Changs has Sierra Nevada on tap for $3, a larger portion for less than half the price. The food is very good...so...guess where we are now going to be 3-4 times per week.
