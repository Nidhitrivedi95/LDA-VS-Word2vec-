VGKq16vCdPPHMoryy6XTHg I don't really understand this place.  It seems like a cool lounge where you hang out and chat with friends, but the music is way too loud for that.  There isn't any space to dance or walk around and mingle.

I came in with a huge group, and we didn't fit anywhere.  Everyone was looking at us, we were in the way in so many different place.

We came for the coffee shot, and we all had it.  It was tasty.

They were quick to bring out our shots, and passed them all at the same time which was cool.
