All-in-all, the food is of average quality, but you'll get your Chinese food fix when you're craving it.  The deep fried grouper is yummy (though a tad salty), as is the eggplant with pork (which is lacking salt...hmm).  If you don't mind blandness, the cashew chicken is a healthy option, as is the kung po chicken (a little more zing in that one).  

Nothing extraordinary, but the prices are pretty darn good and it works for a quick last minute dinner.
