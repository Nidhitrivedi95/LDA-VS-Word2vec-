zQlaDJqp3c_HAuYP5Ukk3w I have to give this place a three. It is hard to find great Chinese food that is t going to make me feel sick from all the oil. But boy is this place tasty. The shrimp fried rice, the egg drop soup, the tea!! So tasty. The lunch special is the best deal by far, I recommend it if you are working in the area. However, I give Sun a three because the horrible customer service. They are slow and almost always go over my one hour for lunch. I only won't 3 or 4 minds away so I find it silly that I am late.
