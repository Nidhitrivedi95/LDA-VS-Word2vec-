szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A My family and I have been coming here for many years. The service is horrible the place smells old but it stays true to the attitude of all dim sum restautant in china. We come here for the dim sum and dim sum alone. 

Lately, More and more caucasian and latinos i see coming here which is awesome. 

Only on weekends is when they serve dim sum. Get here early so avoid the lines and the crazyness.
