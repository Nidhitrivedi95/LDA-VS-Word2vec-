The place is minimal and nothing special, but what does make this special is their staff and of course their food, it is not great, but just good enough to fulfill your need of Buffet Chinese Food, they have many selections, i would have to say about 20 different offerings, i have never seen any buffet offer Egg Foo Young and that was such a great treat only because i love the dish. 

The staff is great, there was this young fella that made us feel welcomed and there was this female that was great too in serving us new drinks and asking if anything was alright. 

I think we ended up paying under $7 for the food and free refills on the drink, they also offer beer, i thought that was a added touch to their establishment. 

So if your near this place, and are hungry for from Chinese Food, give this place a try.
