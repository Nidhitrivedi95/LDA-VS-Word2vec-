qJ18IGaDsQtzJ6v2UzkdcQ First off the food is way overpriced for the small portions they give. Family meals are small for what is meant to be consumed by a family...... Now the Food is very bland. By far the worst chinese food establishment we've ate at. Delivery service is fast which is good but not good enough for me to eat there again.
