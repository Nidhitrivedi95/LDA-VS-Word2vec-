We had two dishes, mu shu pork and curry chicken.  Although I didn't want the curry chicken, I was afraid to order a chicken that would be breaded or fried.  I was pleasantly surprised by both.  Hopefully next time I can actually get some chicken that is Chinese instead of Thai.  The mu shu was great.  The flavor was good, not too greasy.  All in all, a good experience.
