WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg I never would have given this place a second thought but my mother and brother saw the $0.99 shrimp cocktail. So we had to go in. It's this weird little food court looking place inside the Freemont Hotel and Casino. 

Customer service was pretty decent. I had no complaints there. The woman working wasn't terribly social, but she wasn't the stereotypical Angry Asian Lady either. She was pretty nice, actually. So was the woman cleaning tables. 

My mother and brother ordered the shrimp cocktail after seeing the sign outside. It's shrimp for $0.99. Somehow I wouldn't expect spectacular. They didn't get spectacular either. I don't eat seafood, so I have no opinion on how it tasted. But they got it, and mixed the sauce and whatever shredded up green stuff was in there in too. Big complaint was it was too spicy for both of them. 

They asked one employee there if they could rinse the shrimp off and get that horrible sauce off, not wanting to waste food/product. The waitress, I suppose you could call her, looked at us strangely. Like she had no idea what a strainer was or even how to rinse something off. Some people can burn water, and I would presume she is one of those. Anyway, instead of rinsing the yucky sauce off, she just got them two new shrimp cocktails and they didn't mix it into the sauce again. 

Customer service was good, I had no complaints there. Food was so-so. I looked at everything they had out on the line, and nothing looked exciting. I'm not a big fan of Chinese food though either. 

Would I return? No. It's not a place that screams anything special to me. Like I said, had we not noticed the sign and my family wanted to try it, I would've walked right by it and kept going.
