ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ Seriously... What's not to like about this place?

The selection of food is huge - too large to list. There are some premium foods like sashimi (salmon and yellowtail when we were there - the latter is pretty rare for buffets), roasted duck (portion controlled per trip), raw oysters (portion controlled per trip), etc.

It's loud, busy, and crowded, but that's part of its atmosphere. If you want a quiet place and like being served, this is not the place for you.

I caught myself saying to my kids, "Eat faster so you can eat more before your stomach tells you you are full." That's the truest sign of a good buffet.
