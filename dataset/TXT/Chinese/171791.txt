VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ Let me start out by saying their food was decent. I had the sweet and sour chicken and I thought it was pretty good but nothing special. 

The reason for the 2 star review is their customer service. The other day I came into Flo's with 3 of my co-workers. We were greeted by a very kind hostess and immediately seated. We sat down and waited all of 30 seconds before our waiter came over and took our drink orders. He must have run to the kitchen and back because next thing we know, we all have drinks and he's taking our meal orders.

I bet you are wondering where the problem is....just wait, this is where it gets good. From that point on the waiter never came back to our table. Someone else delivered the food, we had to flag down a different waiter when the entire table was waiting for a refill. Worst of all, I had to chase down our waiter to get our check so that we wouldn't be late getting back to work. I literally had to race after him (in heels might I add) and I followed him all the way to the kitchen and then grabbed him as soon as he exited.

I've never been in a situation where I had to ask someone to bring us the check. Usually that's when the waiter is most on top of things. 

Food: 7/10
Service: 2/10

Will I come back? I think I'll give them another chance, but this better not be consistent behavior.
