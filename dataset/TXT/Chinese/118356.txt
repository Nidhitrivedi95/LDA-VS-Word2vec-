Nl4v432g8ZdnZhAlShj8Sw I am visiting from the states and decided to stop here for food with my fiancé. We received the worst customer service. They didn't come to the counter to take our order until we asked their unattended children in the dining area if anyone was there to help us and the little girl. They charged my card for our order and then told us they wouldn't make us the food because it was an American card and they don't like American cards and refused to give me a refund. I had been using my American card here all week long with no issues. They had the audacity to ask me to write down my card number for them so they could issue the refund later. After 20 minutes of arguing with them, and the husband and wife berating each other in Chinese they finally remembered how to give a refund. If I could give this restaurant less stars than one I would, and I didn't even get to try to food. My advice would be to eat literally anywhere else besides here.
