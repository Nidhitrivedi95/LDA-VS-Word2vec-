TxNeo206T0jMvRRQ4nKSIg After driving pass Wok of Fame for years, I figured it was time to give this place a try. 

It is super spacious and their decor is incredibly beautiful! There were plenty of guests who actually dressed up fancy to come eat here... I guess I didn't get the memo! Haha 

They're known for the live cooking option - you get to pick what raw meat and veggies you want and bring it over to the wok section where you can choose your sauce and they'll cook it in front of you! The idea is cool, but there's only one person cooking it so the line up is very long and time consuming ... maybe they have more people cooking it during weekends? Anyway, I can clearly tell the guy did not enjoy his job... A lot of people don't like their jobs either but they still manage to fake a smile :) 

Quality wise the food is average, just like any other Chinese restaurant but I don't think it's that good of a selection ... I'm a picky eater though so maybe that's why none of the food really stood out to me. One thing I really liked though was that they had spicy mayo and seaweed salad in their sushi section!

I really like the drinks were self-serve AND included in the price! They had a few pop fountains and fridges full of water bottles! They even had one fridge turned off for room temperature water which is a really nice touch!

With drinks being self-serve, there really isn't any need for a server unless you wanted to order alcohol, tea or coffee instead and to clear up your table. It did get annoying because our plates would either be cleared too slow or it'd be cleared really fast but they'd take my drink with them so I had to constantly walk back to the buffet area and get a new drink.... 

I probably wouldn't ever initiate going back here myself, but if there was a large party or family and friends wanted to go here then I'll return.
