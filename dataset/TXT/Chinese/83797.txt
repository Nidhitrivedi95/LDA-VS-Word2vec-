He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw Petite Potato was quiet during my afternoon weekday visit. Service was good and the food and drink we ordered came out at a reasonable time. 

A good place to chill out and meet up with friends. The menu is extensive. Picking just one item could be quite difficult, but I can always come back on another day. I do love the options of both traditional Chinese dessert and other new and funky creation.

Pricing is typical of Taiwanese Tea House. A little pricey but you do pay for the nice ambience.
