UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw Food is very delicious, however this last time we noticed that portions were smaller, way smaller. We usually order 2 entrees to share because it was very well served, however this time we had to order an extra one because what we usually order was not enough. I am not complaining, we actually got to try a new dish and it was delicious!! 


Enjoy!!!
