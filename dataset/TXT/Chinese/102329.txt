khwoDxH5p-D9pLjCvV_Y6A I recently moved here from New Jersey and heard the Chinese food in NC doesn't compare to NJ.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the food at New York Restaurant.  The portion size was large, the prices were reasonable and the food tasted very good.  I ordered the boneless ribs and they were tender and had little fat on them. I will definitely go back and try other items.  They really should change their name so people will know it is a Chinese restaurant.
