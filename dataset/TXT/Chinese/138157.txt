Qn_mBXvKnn9VeOKym0Ussw My friend recommended Tasty China to me so when my daughter and I wanted Chinese food in our neighborhood we decided to try it. We had a great experience. We ordered shrimp lettuce wraps and eggplant shrimp. The service was excellent and the food presentation was appealing. The aroma was so good we couldn't wait to dig in. The portions were ample. We were stuffed and we had leftovers to take home. We thoroughly enjoyed our food. It was hot, fresh,  tasty and reasonably priced. The staff came over a few times to ask if everything was ok. We are from NY and are used to delicious Chinese food. This was just as delicious. I will definitely be a regular here.
