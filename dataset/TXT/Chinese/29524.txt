9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw I'm so overwhelmed with all of the choices they have for the all you can eat! From seafood to veggies to noodles it's awesome! We got the split pot with Thai broth on one side and Japanese Miso on the other. The drinks are good and they have all you can eat fruit as a dessert! Will be back when we go to Vegas again!!
