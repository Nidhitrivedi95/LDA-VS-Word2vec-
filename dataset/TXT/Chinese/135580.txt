QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg Met some friends here for dinner on Tuesday.  It is BYOB, which is my favorite!  Brought some beers, which went well with the spicy food I ordered.  It is a large place, but was not that busy at 6 on a Tuesday.  Had a few starters...but star of the night was the black Dal Makhani that I ordered.  It was delicious!  The Naan was great too!  My friend had the Paneer Tika Masala.  It was amazing as well.  We ate so much we didnt have anything to bring home for lunch the next day!
