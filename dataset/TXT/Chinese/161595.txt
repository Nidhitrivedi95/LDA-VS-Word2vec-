uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw My wife and i visited Magic Noodle on Sunday 11/27/2106.  It was quite packed for our first time there.  Most of the seating was occupied.  Friendly wait staff.

about the food experience.

we ordered Seafood friar noodles and Dragon Wonton noodle bowl large.  The noodle soup was very good for the price worth going back for.  I enjoyed the fresh pulled noodles..should have requested extra noodles since my wife and I shared the bowl.

The seafood friar dish (with fresh hand shredded noodles) I was hugely disappointed in.  I am unable to eat cabbage and literally 1/2 of the dish was cabbage the noodles on the dish appeared to be less than a handful overall.  There was barely 4 small pieces of shrimp and maybe like 3 small pieces of scallops.  The fresh hand shredded noodles were good along with the sauce for the noodle dish..but more seafood please and more vegetables other than just cabbage and onions.  for a dish that is at a price point of $10.99 pre-tax I would have expected more out of it.  I would probably suggest stick with the hand pulled noodle soups and skip the friar noodle dishes.

As for the Dragon Wonton Noodle soup dish, the noodles were the star of the show..the wontons were lackluster in size and the addition of the pork bones in the soup..meh..could have done without it.  Maybe next time all request to leave out the pork bones.  If you want good sized wontons with your noodle soup..would recommend elsewhere.

Would only recommend visiting here for the fresh pulled noodle soups only.
