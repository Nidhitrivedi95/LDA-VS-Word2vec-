_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA A great place to go after the clubs, and when you need soup to help you recover from a night of to much drinking.  
I don't know to much about authentic Chinese food, but this place is ok. 

The dim sum was pretty good.
The porridge is perfect  as a hangover soup. Its yummmy!.
I like the beef Szechwan noodles and rice dish.

Its a good place to eat at when your looking for a quick bite to eat, especially since it's located right next to the the rooms. 

The only downside, the service sucks ass. The waiters are unfriendly.
Its kinda pricey.
