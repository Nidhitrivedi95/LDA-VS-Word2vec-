6_KCUxu2kOgP-pRnSNXG8Q The move from the Decatur location to here was a bad decision.  The restaurant is smaller, patrons have to fight the ciggy smoke, and service was so bad.  

The interior is a lot smaller than their old location.  They at least retained the same chefs as my boyfriend recognized one of them.  The food was ok, but it was $2-3 more than the old location.  Also, to make the place classier, they had a leaky roof with 2 buckets and a caution wet floor sign in the middle of the room.  It amazed me that they allowed people to be next to the leaky roof, and then the maintenance guys came on in to fix it.  I guess late is better than never.  

A note here, I think they were trying to be fancy by giving rice in individual bowls instead of just serving a rice pot. I did not like this because on top of the bad service, we had to wait for our rice bowls to be refilled.  We managed that because I waved my empty rice bowl in the air and yelled "more rice please!"  The manager refilled our bowls.

No one refilled our tea pot until we were done with our meal.  Then two waiters came by and checked it within 5 minutes of each other.  

I would have given this place 1 star for horrible location, expensive food, smaller portions, and bad service, but the Ginger and scallion oysters in the clay pot added another star.  It was cooked perfectly with crispy edges, and sweet succulent, and tender insides of the oyster.

As a local here in vegas, the best chinese food here is still KJ's kitchen on spring mtn rd.  It's also $1-2 cheaper, but way better food.
