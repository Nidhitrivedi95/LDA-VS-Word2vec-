Wa2X66syShuMSVUYAj1C-Q I used to love this place. We would order a bunch of food and it was all excellent. Last handful of times though it's gone from not very good to actually being bad. I went tonight for the first time in a long time and ordered three dishes. After tasting them, two went directly into the garbage. Really was hoping for a good experience tonight but I don't think I will be back.

I'm giving two stars instead of one because the people there are very nice and the one dish tonight that was good was very good.
