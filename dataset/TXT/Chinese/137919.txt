Qme4ZWzZEdZUwnpo-sPPIw Very typical Chinese restaurant you'll find in New York City, but this one is located in Toronto's Annex neighborhood. Close to the Spadina subway station on the TTC's Bloor-Danforth line, the food at this location is good for the price. Although its a fast food style operation, the food surpasses the quality found at Chinese fast food chains such as Panda Express commonly found at food courts at major malls.  With an array of different Asian cuisines (Chinese, Malaysian, Thai) the place is good for a quick bite that won't hurt your pocket.
