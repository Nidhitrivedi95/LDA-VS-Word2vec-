g1UVmCOhQDY7TGSZ2rRT_w This is one of their busier locations and even on a Sunday night at 10:30, it was still packed. The food here is pretty standard along with their other locations. I find this particular location is a little bit heavy on the msg, compared to the others. 

We got the Liver and Beef Ball Congee, which was loaded with ginger (my favourite) and pieces of over cooked liver. We also got the Chili Turnip Patties, which are not as good here, as they skimp out on the shrimp, egg and chili's. Their Beef Tendon and Brisket Lo-Mein was okay, (always get extra sauce on the side) but was a little dry and chewy for our liking. The service here is not the greatest, but they're always so busy. It also can get quite loud in here, especially because it's small and cramped. I still prefer the Centrepoint location more.
