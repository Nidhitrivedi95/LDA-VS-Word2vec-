XgUlUmrktr2Um2gczYeYpg My experience here summed up in one phrase (spoken by my husband):
"This tastes like Chinese food my mom tried to make."

Hmm (ouch!).  Well, I haven't really tried his mom's cooking, but judging by the actual amount of cooking done back at his parents' home, that's not saying much for this restaurant.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by Taiwanese food in California (and back at home), but the dishes I had were just OK, nothing spectacular, and for the same price I think I could get a lot more (portion-wise) at Siam Cafe or Wonton Gourmet.  Perhaps I should have tried the beef noodle soup instead, but until I do, 3 stars for Garden Cafe.
