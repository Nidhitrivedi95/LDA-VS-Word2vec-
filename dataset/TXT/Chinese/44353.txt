BJ9GwNMo8vIgSuKc6B_mOw With vegetarians in our group, we entered the place with some element of doubt as Chinese food is not very vegetarian friendly. We were quickly put to calm looking at the available options and also the waiter himself understanding the needs of a vegetarian pallette. The food was definitely very tasty and the service was really good. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the ambience and the taste itself did not hit the ball out of the park.
