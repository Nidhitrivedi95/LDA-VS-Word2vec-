8IblwilNlenDVwBbEzQEVg I am not a Chinese expert by any means but I thought this was a really good lunch spot. Sketchy looking for sure, but fast, friendly service and the food was really good. I had the moo goo gai pan lunch special. All the veggies were really fresh. Chicken, of course, looked questionable but I've never had Chinese food with "good" chicken. Fried rice was good although no eggs or veggies in it. Egg drop soup very salty but good and the egg roll was crispy. All for $6. I'll definitely be back.
