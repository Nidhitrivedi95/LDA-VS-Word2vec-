For $29.00. Now I'm sure that they have fresh and quality ingredients, but that's really the most I've ever paid for dim sum. It was good, but it didn't wow me. We ordered other dishes, like the Tofu and Eggplant, Shrimp Fried Rice, Egg and Scallion Fried Rice, and Short Ribs. While all were okay tasting, none of these dishes really amazed me. Some of the portions of food were meant to share, and others didn't. Especially my dim sum platter. Which I ordered more out of curiosity. 

Environment/Ambiance: Upscale, classy, dark, could be romantic and intimate if it wasn't so loud. I didn't get to see the entire restaurant but it seemed like a maze and it was just so dark., much like a nightclub. 

Service: I'm a little torn about service. Starting at beginning of our visit, somehow they messed up our reservation and since our party was too big to begin with, they had initially split us up. Upon checking in for our reservation, they had somehow lost the second one. So we would be able to all eat at the same time, we had opted to check in, but also get a table for the rest of our party. They had us wait all wait at the bar for the time being and sat us not only separately, but far away from each other. Which really put a damper on the night since we were celebrating a special occasion. 

Tips: I would probably come back for a special occasion, like a date, a special birthday, or another bachelorette party. But otherwise, I would rather get my asian food elsewhere.
