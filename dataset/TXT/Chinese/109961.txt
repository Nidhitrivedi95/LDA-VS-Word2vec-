LsgE9TBlyvGFF2n7esSd2w I really love Pei Wei, and generally have a good experience at this location. I usually always order to-go, and my order is almost always ready with no wait time when I show up. 

The only thing lacking, is the consistency of orders. Sometimes they really lack in providing more than tiny, skimpy portions for to-go orders. Other times, you get more than what is expected! It just seems to vary each time. And they often run out of cookies or certain other items, which is frustrating. 

But overall, they are really good and easy to order with! The food quality is almost always up to par, and I love being able to redeem points for my orders, as well as always being offered a water if I have to wait for my order to finish, even if it is my fault for arriving a little early. 

This is a place I will continue to give business to. They have really good food for a very decent cost and are always friendly and trying to make it a good experience. It is appreciated, I just wish they would be a little more attentive with consistency of orders when it comes to the portions & some of the quality/presentation.
