PEulzjDwcSL_ujv5mRbc4w In a word...AVOID! 

Food was very bland and tasted like it had actually been made in a wok in New York and shipped via bike messenger to Arizona.

Egg rolls and rangoons were stale and had almost no filling.  Boneless spareribs were black around edges, extremely hard and had almost no flavor.  Fried rice was over cooked, and was little more than white rice with a bit of soy sauce.  

Although the dumplings appeared homemade, they were very bland, and shriveled like they may have been reheated.  They were not even folded like a proper Chinese dumpling but simply folded in half.

Food at local cheap ($5) Chinese buffets are far better than anything I got from here.

I have noticed that the reviews for this place used to be excellent, at least until the last few months.  This usually indicates new owners, cutbacks or a staff that just doesn't care anymore.
