BIqsItY0vyOshMpJ0I4cPg How Lee is awesome, and a very legit Chinese/Sichuan restaurant (from my whitey perspective). Went out to eat there with two friends on a Saturday night, waited for 15 minutes, and loved being a minority amongst tables of Asians. Servers were nice and quick. 

Fried scallion pancakes off the American menu were homemade and epic. We had the cucumber salad (don't bother, it was bitter - like when cucumbers have that bitter skin). Beef chow fun was delish, though the beef was unsurprisingly un-beef like (but not gross or gristly). Plenty of tasty egg bits and crunchy onions and other things. On the Sichuan menu, we had the sichuan kung pao chicken with peanuts. It was delish, great sauce. We tripped out on the weird taste in our mouths that made water taste totally bizarre. Then I noticed a clove-sized spice in the sauce, chewed on one and half my mouth did something crazy. We asked our server: "pickled ash, numbs your mouth." Sweeeet! I love encountering new shit at a restaurant. I also noted the brilliance of putting in a numbing agent to counter the red chili spice. 

In case you're curious, I Wiki'd pickled ash, and it's PRICKLY ASH. Here's the story: "The fruit of several species of Zanthoare used to make the spice Sichuan pepper. They are also used as bonsai trees. Historically, the bark was widely used for toothache, colic, and rheumatism."

Dinner for three was $42 including tip. Goddamn that's cheap!

Two nights later, even though I'd just bought $60 of organic produce from Whole Foods, I ordered How Lee delivery. Veggie dumplings were delicate and yummy; can't wait to try them in the restaurant. Tea-smoked duck was tasty, smoky, fatty, and worth the try - split it with two others. 

China Palace can now go straight to hell for their uninteresting, bland and overpriced American Chinese.  Go to How Lee, you will also become addicted.
