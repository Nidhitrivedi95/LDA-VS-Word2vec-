n2sA7raIheUCgBq14Vlt5w This place is kinda over priced. The food is moderately okay not incredible and certainly not worth what your charged. I've been here three or four times. I have gotten wings and salads. The salads are large but for 10 bucks not worth it. Plus they cut stuff odd. Like a tomato into monsterus bites. The wings are dry and lack basic flavor. Honest I'm really not impressed enough to say I would be back again. But not displeased enough to say I would never be back.  I would neither recommend nor avoid this place.  

Overall it's kinda like the president , you just accept it and go about your day.
