f9ERQpAPOAMv5Ay0kyD3Yw Lately the best thing about this place is the family that owns the place, it is clean and the new restaurant is nice and new. The food was extremely better when they were located at the hole in the wall location at 67th and Bethany Home Rd.  I used to eat the shrimp fried rice at least every week.  I am not able to go to Peoria often, I last went on a Saturday nite the prices were very high but business was good,  I didn't know where I was by that shrimp fried rice it was kind of tatsteless.  I think that was just a bad nite,  the other diners seemed to be happy. Maybe they changed the food to suit the palates of the current customers.  I love the family so much I will go again and tell them how I want my fried rice!
