SxjNgkzAlUG-wt2rSbc2HQ Horrible Phone service - the guy barely speaks english and thinks he owns the place.

He asked me if I wanted sauce on my dish and I asked him to put sauce but not too much, he replied by saying "can you understand me ? are you crazy"

Had the food here a few times and honestly it was nothing to write home about 

Ridiculous...... worst customer service ever; if this place wasn't cheap and open late it would definitely fail at being a restaurant.

Not ordering from here again.... EVER
