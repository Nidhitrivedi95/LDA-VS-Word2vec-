Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA My favorite location for the Thai style noodle house establishment. The food is always good for the price. The servers are usually polite and seem happy when my wife and I walk in. At first, I didn't like their rad na, but now I really like it! I also order the 3 companion and my wife always orders the khua khai.
