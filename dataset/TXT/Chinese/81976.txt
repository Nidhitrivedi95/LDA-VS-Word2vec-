H2RgkjPs3W-CxbyygCJJew First arrived asked to have miso soup and waiter completely forgot my order. The waitresses are very stand offish and have poor customer service. They handed me my food with no silverware or napkins. Never checked on me to see if things were fixed. Just horrible would not ever come back
