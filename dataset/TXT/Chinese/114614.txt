mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w Haven't been here in a while.  We came for dinner...expecting normal dim sum as we had before for dinner here.  No precooked items on a cart.  All must be ordered.  Most items were over cooked and fried.  Took 40 minutes for our final items to arrive at the table.  We had potstickers that were crunchy.  Certainly not right.  The eggplant and shrimp had grease coming off of them.   And no, it wasn't the sauce they forgot to put on - had to ask for that.  They were out of a ton of things.  There were only two other tables seated...now I know why! Don't think we will be back.  :(
