ctTiEiUTY_FvnZ0ovBeZWQ Easily one of the best lunch spots in the financial district!

Ho Ga has been around for years, since before I started working in the area as a student in 2009. They rennovated the restaurant in 2014 to its current state. 

In short: It's cheap, tasty and filling. You can't even get these prices in many suburb restaurants in Markham/Scarb anymore! $7 for a rice, beef, tempura combo with side jap chae and salad? STEAL. 

I've always liked their bulgogi here. Chicken teriyaki is okay, its their cheapest option but I'd rather "splurge" an extra dollar for the beef. I've tried their curry and its a big hit for my coworkers but I always stick with the beef+tempura combo. 

There's even seating in the little restaurant and they offer free water but it's always very busy for a table so come early or come late. 

The only small con: They are CASH ONLY. It's a tad annoying, but that's how they evade taxes and keep prices low. Not an unusual tactic anyways. 

Strongly recommend this if you're working in the financial district and feeling some Asian foods.
