483eMQ9g0GykUJNWTA5q3A Way more expensive than the Red Bowl & NOT WORTH IT. I paid $36 for two obviously old spring rolls that were soggy in the middle and had some mysterious black stuff in them, two over cooked shrimp tempura rolls, a sweet potato roll & two side salads that were ok. Slow service and a high price tag!
