xaUN51X5c4aVn8mHMIjihw Since I wrote a single review about how bad Ho Lee Chow was I figured it was only fair to write a review about a place that is great... this place has the best Chinese Food that I've ever had in the city. Plus it is very reasonably priced! If I am ever in the mood for Chinese... this is definitely the place.
