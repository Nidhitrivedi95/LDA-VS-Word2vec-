2FImjoBv0qvq9NumhcVOyA A friend of my sister recommended South Asia. We went there on a Friday night for dinner. There are usually two reasons why a restaurant is not full on a Friday night, it is either food is not so good or the location is bad. 

The curry beef brisket was very good but the nan was horrible. The satay skewers were so so, I had better. The Hainan chicken is definitely subpar. Service was average.
