HVpwpXneaCWMeEBF7H8jpQ After relocating to Madison, I've been missing the foods in Taiwan so much. Earlier this week, some friends from Houston visited me, they noticed this newly-opened restaurant and asked me to give a try. We had chicken cutlet bento sets, which were way beyond my expectation! Though it's a bit pricey but definitely worths it! We also ordered tea leaf eggs and jasmine tea for takeout, which are the best fits for midnight snacks! The location and ambience is absolutely a plus. Will come back soon for sure!
