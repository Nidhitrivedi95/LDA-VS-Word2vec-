KxqAQ-CJcAPDTJbrnQUTfg Great Wok is an okay option if you are in the Gateway Village part of Charlotte and need to grab some lunch. They have a pretty quick turn around on orders, though mistakes may be made.

The food quality is okay. The vegetables are definitely come from frozen. The sauces aren't all the best (General Tso's was no good). But they do offer a diverse menu. So far the one winner I had from here was the vegetable curry. After a couple tries, I have decided their tofu dishes are not worth ordering.

There is seating inside, if you choose to dine in, however, you are in Gateway Village and unless it's raining there is probably a better place to site outside. All and all, a nice place for a quick lunch. Oh, and they have smoothies.
