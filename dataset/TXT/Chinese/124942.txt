oVtnnGat2Wco0ksQT1cGCA This is my second time to this AYCE sushi place. Comparing to the heart sushi at heartland. The food here is comparatively better. I love their sweet shrimp and scallop sashimi. 

Similar to other AYCE place, it is really noisy, and you have two hour. The one thing that disappointed me is that the dessert. They don't have most stuff on menu. We waited 15 mins for them to tell us they don't have.

Hopefully it would be better next time. I recommend this location, and will come again.
