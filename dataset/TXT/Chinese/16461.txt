44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw The best Chinese food we've had in a long time!  The service is not very good but it adds to the "charm" of Nee House and the food more than makes up for it!

We always order:

1. Salt and pepper pork chops: perfectly seasoned with just enough batter and spices.

2. Lobster with XO sauce:  plentiful with lots of yummy flavors.  Can be spicy depending on the jalapeños.

3. Salt and pepper squid: perfectly battered pieces of squid (no legs though-boooo), deep fried to absolute perfection!

4. Beef Chow Fun:  yummy flat rice noodles with tender pcs of beef, sprouts, onions, and green onions.

5. Chinese broccoli: not on the menu but ask if they have it in stock.  It's sautéed with some garlic and dried fish for an awesome "sauce". 

The prices are reasonable (not expensive at all compared to CA) and we ALWAYS eat here on every visit to AZ!
