I love this place. One of the best in the downtown Chinatown. Especially recommended: all the noodle soups (I like duck and wonton) and the donut in rice noodle. Excellent flavor to the broth without being fatty. Meat is rich, and everything is generously portioned for the price. Good place to take kids or eat alone, as it is always noisy to begin with.
