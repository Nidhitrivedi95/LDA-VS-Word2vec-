OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw The dim sum here were just average. Nothing was bad but most of the dishes (even steamed ones) were just overwhelmingly greasy. Out of everything I have tried only one thing stood out. That was the egg york custard buns. They were were fresh out of the kitchen. The bun was very fluffy and bouncy. The fillings were addicting and the 'pineapple' crust was perfectly crispy and delicious. The rest of the dishes were simply unmemorable. Best of Vegas it might be, but definitely do not compare to anything from Bay Area or LA.
