b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag Decided to try this spot out with a friend. We both got half order of chicken fried rice a half order of Chinese chicken salad and half order bbq pork. Rice was delicious along with the salad but the bbq pork was gross it had lots of fat on it. I would avoid this item ... Our server was good when he was around he took a bit of time to bring water. The manager came over and removed the bbq pork from our check. She was very friendly and had a nice smile. You kinda felt like she was your friend once you left this place. Great job manger person. Over all the place is clean and has a cool vibe.
