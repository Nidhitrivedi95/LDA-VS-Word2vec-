bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg Grit & Grace lives up to the 4 stars. I'll break down my experience for you all!

Busy on a Saturday as you would expect. Need reservation at least 5 hours prior. Service was good and friendly. The atmosphere was hipster/industrial. They didn't have the air on and it was very warm. This is one of the reasons I dropped a star due to me not being comfortable. 

Drinks: scorpion bowl is great looking and tasty but for two people it falls short. Paid $15. Worth $12. 

I recommend one of their signature cocktails they have listed on their menu. These run $8-12 but worth it. Very good value! Whether you like a drink that taste good or someone that likes to taste the liquor, you will enjoy!

Food: think tapas before showing up. This part was confusing because they don't mention tapas anywhere but that is the style. Some items are very small, some are medium. The price will help determine size. 

The 2 dim sum options we tried were good. The tofu is served cold on purpose and flavorful. The pork belly stole the show. We ordered two of these. Dim sum = $5 each. Worth it!

Wife ordered roasted pork ramen. The pork and broth were delicious. I wasn't a fan of the noodles but my wife loved the whole dish. Medium size and was a good portion if you had apps/dim sum before. $13. Good value at that price. 

Steam bun: tasty, but it was a glorified hotdog. It was a good hotdog taste. Just be ready for the similarities in taste. $7. 4 bites and I was done. Should be a $5 appetizer. 

Shaved flank steak: the steak was great. Not much but it was delicious and tender. Not chewy. Good amount of noodles in this make it a meal vs tapas option if you have some dim sum before. $16. Worth $13. 

We will go back. They seem to excel when it comes to pork. The signature cocktails are great but the place was to warm and we would have bought more drinks if they could serve them faster. We will be back.
