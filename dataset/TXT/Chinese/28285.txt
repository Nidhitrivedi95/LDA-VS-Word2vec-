8lPxiYChdJdTV24NJvOB3Q New noodle joint that recent opened. Portion size are really big. Basically you pick your soup base and pick what types of noodles you want from thin to thick. I believe there is 6 different noodle types. I got a small beef noodle which was fairly big in my opinion. Came with only 4 piece of beef which is kind sad but beef was really tender. Not much toppings in the noodles basically some green onions and few paper thin white radish slice. They also server some grill item, got the grilled pork belly which was pretty good as well.
