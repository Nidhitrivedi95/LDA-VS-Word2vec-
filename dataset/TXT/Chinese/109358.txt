lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA I hesitated to try Hong Kong Cafe because the ratings were so low but it was pretty decent.  I'm going to skip the whole value bit.  It's in a Vegas hotel.  

Szechwan Eggplant - 4 star.  Not spicy enough for me but tangy.

Steamed Sole Fish - 4 star.  Simply steamed with ginger and scallions in soy sauce.  I would order this again.  It is the perfect comfort dish after several days of eating out.

Wonton Noodle Soup - 3 star.  Pass this one by.  I suspect the noodles are the dry noodles so they don't taste quite as good.  The wontons were not bad, but not good.  It doesn't taste like the classic Hong Kong style wontons.  It is subpar to the wonton noodle soup at Caesar Palace food court (Ah So).

Note: rice does not come with the eggplant or fish dishes.  Order rice separately.
