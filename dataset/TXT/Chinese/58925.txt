dHJ4PT5C9mr6QPs4o_DaSA We went in the middle of the afternoon, and there were no other guests in this large restaurant besides my partner and I. We were seated at a booth but later choose to move because the overhead lightbulb (recessed) was blinking, causing discomfort on the eyes. 

This restaurant has nice decor, complete with a pond and interesting pieces of Asian decoration pieces on display. (They have a small selection of gifts for sale.)

Our server was quite friendly and efficient. We ordered an appetizer of shrimp blanket which was a shrimp wrapped in a spring roll wrapper with a little cream cheese inside. This was quite tasty. We also had a regular Pho ($8.95), seafood Pho ($12.95) and Princess Pork. While the Pho was tasty, I was disappointed with the portion size. It was served with a plate of vegetables (Thai basil, bean sprouts, and lime) but no other condiments. I had to request some hot chilli oil to spice things up. Also unfortunate was that the broth in the Pho was not beef based. Honestly, I did expect more (food) for the price of the dishes. I have no complaints about the pork dish, though. I would order the Princess pork again but would have to be pretty desperate for some noodle soup to order the Pho again.
