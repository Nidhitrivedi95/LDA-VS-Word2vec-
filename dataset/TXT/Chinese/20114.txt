5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ I stayed at the Monte Carlo for a business trip and popped down to get something at this restaurant. Good location right in the casino, perfect for people-watching, and I had a very attentive server/bartender - I sat at the bar for prime viewing of the casino and card tables around me. The sushi was tasty but a bit on the pricey end - I guess that's to be expected of Vegas! - but $40 for one sushi roll, an edamame appetizer and an iced tea was a bit higher than I expected. Still, I enjoyed the food and I'd definitely go back!
