7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew I was told that this was the best in the city but to be honest I've had better. They had all of the essentials -siu mai, dumplings, chicken feet, rice noodles, congee, chinese broccoli, etc -  but there was still a lot of dishes missing to make this place a great Dim Sum. We came in a group of 10 and was left sitting around wondering what else they had after 20 minutes. 

Some dishes that could be better:
1. BBQ pork Bun - a little dry and small portion of bba pork - end up with plenty of dry dough
2. Ginger tofu - overly sweet and not enough tofu
3. Chicken feet - the sample I had was overcooked to where the skin was soggy. Good chicken feet should have some elasticity to it and more texture. 

I may or may not come back. Try it for yourself and be the judge.
