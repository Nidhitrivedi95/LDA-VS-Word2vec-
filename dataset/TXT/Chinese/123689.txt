OlSpcJY_nXqWbdwdg4SNvA Global Imperial Cuisine suffers badly and routinely from poor, slow service and very obviously stingy practices when it comes to portioning and presentation. Entrees often get sent out a few at a time, more than twenty minutes apart, if they show up at all. The food varies from okay to pretty good, but the above issues plus a pretty stark, unappealing environment don't flatter it well.

Come here for cheap dimsum; avoid for dinner.
