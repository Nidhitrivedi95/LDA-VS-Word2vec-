7Ry-hEfZwaDXe8u-n6v15A I consider Shanghai Dim Sum one of the rising players of Shanghai cuisine in the Greater Toronto Area. This place has one of the best Siu Long Baos (Soup Filled Dumplings) that I have ever eaten. The dumplings are prepared fresh made to order, since the soup inside the dumpling can burn your tongue. (I made the classic rookie mistake, even letting it cool for at least a minute.) The other choices they have (Green Onion Pancake, Shanghai Fried Noodles, Fried Rice) are just as delicious as the soup filled dumplings. 

The service is questionable at best. The waiters were not as attentive as they should be. Even if you asked them for just a refill on tea, don't be surprised for a long wait. 

The prices for the dishes are more than reasonable. You will get value for any dish you order.  I will definitely be back for more, especially for their dumplings. The service is questionable, but the food will make up for it.
