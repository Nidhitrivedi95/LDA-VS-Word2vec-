JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw Because of trade show in town, used to eat Yonaka next door, saw this noodle house, then decided to give a try.  Love their beef noodle and spicy wanton.   Tender beef soup with crafted noodle makes excellent combination.  Very Chinese style.  Even the spicy wanton but not very spicy so you can feel the juice within it.
