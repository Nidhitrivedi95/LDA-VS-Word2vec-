ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ I'm often disappointed that restaurants in Markham barely get any reviews or ratings on yelp. Well I want to change that :)

New City is one of my favourite restaurants of all time. I pretty much come here every weekend for breakfast and occasionally for dinner. The staff pretty much recognizes us from coming here so often and though they don't take reservations, they have a fair "first come first serve policy". This is great because there's ALWAYS a long lineup. Staff is nice, some are witty, each with their unique personality.

Food is delicious and for the price you're paying, it's amazing value! This seriously beats McDonalds guys, like no excuse here. If you come here, I would recommend any of their breakfast for pretty much $5 (my dish also comes with egg, bacon, and toast) and the HK style French toast if you're here in the afternoon.
