U3TUTWRqbW9WeLeWMxi2tw I love the selection of Chinese food here. It's a mix of different regions, from Shanghai style dumplings to Sichuan water boiled fish. I got an order of xiao long bao to go ($6.25, labeled as "Home-made juicy steamed pork mini dumplings"). There were 6 dumplings per order, and while most of them had the lovely savory broth that is indicative of these type of dumplings, 2 of them were dry (Although the meat inside was still tender and juicy). The dumplings were flavorful and tasted fresh. They get bonus points for including a prepackaged plastic spork in my to-go bag (Sporks are cool) :). 

This is a small mom and pop run operation, and the lady co-owner speaks both Mandarin and English. 

I'll definitely stop by here again if I'm in the area to try more inexpensive and tasty Chinese food options.
