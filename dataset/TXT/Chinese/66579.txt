EhlOUjd2dh52SV_XfoORSA My grandmother lives in Washington, PA. Several times a year, I go to visit her and we make the trek to Sesame Inn. I absolutely love their lettuce wraps, Pad Thai, and/or Singapore Noodles. We normally share the wraps and an order of the Pad Thai. It is a huge portion. Even while sharing, we still take left overs home! Great!!!!
