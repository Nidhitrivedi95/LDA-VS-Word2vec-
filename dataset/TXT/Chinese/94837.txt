jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg the food and service was hit or miss, i been here numerous times before. it's depend on the night you're there, you can tell the different in the way the food cook, must be the chef. some night i'm there, the food tasted really good, and then there are night that the food tasted awfully oily!!! They are also a bit more expensive than other Cantonese restaurants i have been to
