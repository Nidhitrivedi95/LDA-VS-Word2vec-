WrYz1HW0YuXG1rPa2Vznjg I never go to Tong Por for anything other than dim sum. But this time, it was my nephew's first birthday and my cousin had the party here. Wow what a pleasant surprise! The food was way better then expected. We had shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings as well as king crab as amuse-bouche. Then came the 10 course meal. Yup... 10! Everything was good and came out hot! We started off with won ton soup. Then some fried shrimp and pork patties, bird's nest with meats, seafood and vegetables. Then came the mix salt and pepper seafood, roasted chicken, ginger and scallion lobster, shrimp fried rice, some green vegetables, sweet and sour fish and finally cantonese chow mein!!! It was good! We were stuffed! We were happy! Oh ya... Service was great as well! After eating at Tong Por for many, many years (since my childhood), i've finally discovered a whole new restaurant!
