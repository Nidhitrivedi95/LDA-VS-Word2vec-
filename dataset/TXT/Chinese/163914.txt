Sometimes you have a craving for a certain food but you really don't want to take the time and trouble to get dressed up or sit in a restaurant so that's when you go for take out. 

Tonight I had a craving for Chinese, and  I wanted someplace close.  So Panda Express it was. As I waited in line I noticed that many of the selections were in short supply and two of the advertised "specials" were completely empty.  I assumed that the cook was in the process of refilling the empty trays. However, I was wrong.

When it was my turn, I was advised that it would be several minutes before new entrees would be ready, so I was limited to what was on hand.  To be honest I  did not find the food to be very tasty, certainly not even good fast food Chinese. 

So this is my conclusion of Panda Express.  No, the quality and taste is not that of P.F. Chang but you could do worse in a pinch.  I satisfied my craving for Chiense while watching my favorite television shows. Sometimes, it's all about choices.
