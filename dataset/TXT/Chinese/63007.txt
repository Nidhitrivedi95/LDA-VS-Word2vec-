dwgeEOAcPuR-GhpMBaJmjA Closer to 4,75 stars. Tucked in a maze of restaurants...and you know what it's in a strip mall which very popular! We ordered their all you can eat hot pot. The good: They have specials take advantage of it. It reminds me of times when my family and I sat around and aye and talked. Before cell phones. The bad: if you don't like cooking or working for your food, this ain't  for you. The Ugly: yup in a strip mall it's always the parking.
Tip: sometimes at all you can eat, your eyes are better bigger than your hunger. $$
