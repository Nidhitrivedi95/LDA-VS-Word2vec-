98gLNkYYJCg4f_uJ7o2wBg Had a bait and switch situation when ordering pick up. Suggest you order off the menu at the store and check what is put in the bag before you leave. I ordered fried rice as a side and got steamed. The price I paid was 30 percent more than the prices advertised in yelp.  The food was of lower quality and definitely not worth the price.
