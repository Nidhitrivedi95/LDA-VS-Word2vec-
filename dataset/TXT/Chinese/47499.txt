bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ *sigh* Where do I start...I'm truly upset & confused as to how this place has good reviews! Me andy fiancé were starving on a Sunday & we were craving chinese food. We ordered shrimp fried rice, sesame chicken, pepper steak, and egg drop soup. Now let me just say the fried rice I thought was decent. My fiancé stated otherwise. He thought the rice was overcooked.  Soup was also good. But the pepper steak was the absolute WORST we've ever had. Flavors were there, but the "steak" didn't taste like steak at all. It was mushy. Had a very weird taste can't even describe. Sesame chicken was ok. Not good after the first day but I think that happens with all fried foods. Waste of $40 Sunday dinner. Sadly, we will not be eating here again. But they do have really great service! Delivery guy was so nice & kind lady that took my complicated order because my fiancé is a picky one. Lol

Oh forgot to add...the cream cheese wontons are MONEY! I would only return for those little fried pieces of heaven...
