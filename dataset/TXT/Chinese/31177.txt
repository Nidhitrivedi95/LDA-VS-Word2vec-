9OD0pQ0QYa_7dO-LbOBFZQ For Chinese pastries, this one appears to be a hit. There are always a room full of patrons slurping coffee and eating some of the sweet and savoury goodies offered at the "Desserts Garden". 
After doing some shopping at Chinatown Centre, this is a good place to stop off for a snack. However, they close pretty early, so by 6pm, there were few options left. I circled the cases a few times before discovering a sweet bit of yum.  A mochi-filled with sweet peanuts. This was the perfect golfball-sized snack and filled with super sweet peanuts. I have also had the pineapple buns, and red bean beans which are a little greasy and buttery, which may be just the best way. 
Also sell a variety of lightly iced cakes and asian 'sweets'.
