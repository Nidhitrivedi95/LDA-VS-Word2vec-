IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ After a few days in Vegas doing what you do in Vegas -- eat, drink, eat, drink, rinse, repeat -- I wanted something "light": Asian food! In more of a hurry and not really caring we ducked in here for a quick lunch. I really wish we would have tracked down a Pei Wei instead...

The pan seared pork (and shrimp) dumplings were very good, but the Pad Thai shrimp fell short. We weren't quite sure what was going on with it, but as my friend noted, "why is it so orange?" might have been one thing. The shrimp were definitely frozen and beyond small, over cooked, etc.

Stick with the dumplings, steer clear of the Pad Thai shrimp.
