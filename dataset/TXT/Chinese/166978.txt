VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA Fresh, friendly and very tasty. We had the Sesame Noodle Kick (rich and spicy noodles done al dente) with the Veggie Bao Zi (4 steamed buns filled with tender greens). The person who took our order was very friendly and offered helpful suggestions. We are soon to be regulars here. A great addition to the west side dining scene.
