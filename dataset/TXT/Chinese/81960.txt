H2RgkjPs3W-CxbyygCJJew LOVE this place.  I've visited Pacific Garden several times and ordered a different entree each time.  Always enjoyed my repast.  Staff is friendly and dad loves the $.99 beers.  Tried their Banzai Sushi Challenge .... That roll was the hottest thing I've ever tasted and I love spicy food!  The Challenge is not for the faint of heart.  Overall this is a local favorite of mine.
