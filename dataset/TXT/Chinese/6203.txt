We ate some because we were hungry but ended up throwing away more than half of it. Hot and sour soup tasted off. All meat (beef in fried rice, chicken in lo mein, pork in sweet and sour pork) were extremely dry and not seasoned. Crab rangoon was ok. Eggroll didn't taste good.  Took one bite and tossed the rest.  House fried rice tasted underseasoned. 

Bottom line,  we tossed the to-go menu along with the leftover and will not be ordering from this place again.
