eXJEiAuNRLbU5EzdAkj9yQ They have several items on their menu that they don't *actually* offer. I wanted a Swedish massage and even though it's on their massage brochure they had no idea what it was lol 
I ended up getting half foot/half body acupressure instead. 

The workers are all Chinese and barely speak English so there was a lot of pointing and body language to get my point across. I wish they used a little more pressure on my body, but that's just a personal preference. As far as foot massages go, it was really good, but body was was less than mediocre, it wasn't relaxing and he didn't work out any of my knots, I just felt like he was pressing/rubbing my body rather than massaging.

I'd recommend the foot massage but not the body, which explains their name..Blissful FOOT Massage.
