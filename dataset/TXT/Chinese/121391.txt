I don't remember a lot of details, but do recall there being some unusual (for a buffet) items such as fish masala and idli/sambar, all reasonably well prepared. I also remember thinking, however, that there wasn't much in the way of vegetables, and that certain staples like nan and pakora were underwhelming.
