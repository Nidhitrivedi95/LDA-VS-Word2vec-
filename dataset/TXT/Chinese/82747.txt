hbuVhfMb8r3kVNZ-thX16g The only good food I find here is their egg drop soup with corn.  This is really yummy.  The corn gives it a sweet add to it.  The spring roll was decent and taste like any other.  I had the Mongolian Beef and I did not like it at all.  The rice was gross, and the meat had a weird after taste to it.  

I'll only come here for the soup and vegetable spring roll.
