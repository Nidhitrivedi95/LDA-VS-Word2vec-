RGg86O5SmjhiVglYYpWkEQ I remember going here with my family almost everyday Friday for dinner. So going back here got me quite excited. However, this time we came here for Dim Sum. 
   The ambience hasn't changed much and neither did the service. Nothing too special. 
    Our food came out within a reasonable amount of time. Everything was a little overly salty for us. However, it didn't over power the entire dishes. Portion sizes are average, like at any other Chinese Dim Sum.
