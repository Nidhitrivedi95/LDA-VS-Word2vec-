The chow mien was just ok, not very flavorful and the fried rice could have used a little more of just something to make it taste better. They had coke products which of course was awesome for me. The orange chicken was good, it didn't have the floral taste to it which was good. I have had other places and they are always so sweet, this one was good. The restroom needed some attention but overall this place was ok. Don't think I would come back because I am looking for that one place that is just awesome. The search continues, but if u are in the mood for just ok Chinese food then this place is good for you. Again it's not bad but it just needed something else to make it better.
