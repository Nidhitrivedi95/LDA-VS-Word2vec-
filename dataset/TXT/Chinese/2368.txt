_AKdBFzkl7GY-daxUCCbVA I think PF Chang's is a nice change when craving Chinese.  On our most recent visit, the place was fairly crowded after 8 pm on a Wednesday night.  We asked for a booth, since all were full, we had about a 10 minute wait.  But the host desk is very efficient and when a booth became available, they got it ready right away.

One of the things we like is the sauce they give you and like that you can pour on the heat, if need be.  Beer choices are a bit limited, but BJ is always able to find something he likes.  For our meals, I got one of the winter appetizers.  The Chili Shrimp Bao is 3 little warm pillows folded and filled with bibb lettuce, chili-shrimp, daikon, carrots and cucumber with tamarind-chili.  This dish is fairly small, but a good dish, if you are counting calories.  It comes in at 550 calories and that works for me.  BJ got pad thai which was served with rice noodles and a side of brown rice.  Very good.  Service here is always friendly and I love the interior design of the restaurant.
