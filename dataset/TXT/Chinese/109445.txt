If you are staying at the Venetian or Palazzo in Vegas you should try the Hong Kong Café at the Palazzo.  Their menu has both traditional American style Chinese food and a modern interpretation to Chinese food.  The food is light and the prices are reasonable for Vegas. We liked it so much we went twice.  The first time we had: Wanton Soup, Chicken Fried Rice and Crispy Chicken Wings.  The second time we had the Pork Fried Rice and the Sweet and Sour Chicken.  Both meals were very good and much lighter in taste than what I was use to from Chinese food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant especially before a show or walking the strip at night because the food is filling but light.  A definite must try.
