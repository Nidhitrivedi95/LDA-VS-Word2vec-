4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A I absolutely love the sticky rice here and if I could rate the entire experience based on that one dish, it would be a solid 4 stars. However, since it is a hot pot place, I had to hold myself back from filling up on the sticky rice and the rice pot with Chinese sausages.

The rest of the choices for hot pot are average. They offer hand made beef, pork, and cuttlefish balls but I find I actually prefer the consistency of frozen ones. The service is rather slow and parts of my order were forgotten on several occasions.
