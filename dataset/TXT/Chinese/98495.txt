Now onto the food.  We ordered only dumplings so I can only comment on that. When the dumplings arrive fresh (about 15 dumplings per order), you should be cautious when biting because they are super hot and quite juicy. The anything curry dumplings are best fried. 

However, after the dumplings  cool  off, they're less juicy and after the 3rd dumpling, you really taste the dough. For others, it might not be a problem, but I like the dough to be a bit thinner so I can taste more of the inside. 

It's good.. But not the best that I've had. And if they didn't have deals on dealfind, I might not have returned since there are better dumpling places not too far for roughly the same price.
