1CeWMRJwyFkQ-fc3MR1Dmg I REALLY enjoy eating here. The place is nicely renovated & very clean, unlike some of the other Chinese restaurants in the area. It's also in a pretty convenient spot near Hwy 7 & Leslie, so a lot of busses can take you here if you don't drive.

Apart from this, the food is soo delicious, whether you come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Honestly, I think all of their dishes are amazing. But out of everything, I find myself craving their fried turnips the most. (But maybe that's because I just really like fried turnips in general...) I think this restaurant is the best for coming with a bigger group of people, like around 4 & then sharing the food asian-family style!
