We tried a large spread of appetizers, sashimi and rolls...  it was good, but it wasn't great.  I'll only comment on a few of the things we ordered to give the gist:  The spicy tuna wasn't spicy at all.  The shrimp on the rainbow roll tasted a little old and chewy.  Most of their rolls with crab have imitation Krab, which they don't tell you, but you can figure it out based upon the prices of the roll that has real crab and specifically states it is real crab.  Our server forgot to bring out miso soup all together, so I don't know how that is.  The crab rangoon was pretty good and had a great sauce.  The yellowtail and jalapeno appetizer missed the mark... I've had it before in other places where it was amazing, so this was a little disappointing.  And the Philly roll had no cucumber and was pretty much all cream cheese, which while I like a good amount, not being able to taste the salmon or anything else isn't appealing.  Some of the pieces of fish were pretty good sized, while others were very lacking - there seemed to be an inconsistency.  If I were in the neighborhood and really hungry for sushi, I might try it again as the prices were pretty decent and they seemed to have a local following, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there for sushi as the experience was a little underwhelming.
