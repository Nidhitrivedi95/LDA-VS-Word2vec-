liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA Worst restaurant I've been to in Vegas.  The service was horrible - waiter never bothered to check in on us until 90 minutes into the meal, when he asked if we wanted anything else.  At that point we reminded him that we never got a number of the dished we ordered (which we promptly cancelled).
The food was sub par as well. I've had better dim sum from frozen Trader Joes than what they served here.
And they stuck us with a mandatory tip for having a party of 5. Absolutely  nothing positive about the experience.
