I was seated right away and the waiter came back to let me know that they close at 9 but insisted i stay and eat. I know how annoying that is but i was seated and hungry so I decided to order. I have to say that the staff was extremely courteous and never once made me feel like I was being a douchebag for walking in at closing time. 

I got the Taiwanese spicy beef noodles. They fired it up in the open kitchen as I sat at the bar. When it was ready, the cook happily handed me my bowl and said to make sure to let him know if I needed anything else. I scarfed it down so as not to keep them waiting any longer. It was delicious. It wasn't quite the same as street noodles I've had in Taiwan but still close enough for an American chain. Plus, the staff was more than accommodating. 

All in all, the food was decent but the staff was great. I'll definitely be back, and at a reasonable hour next time.
