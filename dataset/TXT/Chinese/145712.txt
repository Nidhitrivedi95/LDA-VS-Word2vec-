S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ We came here after reading that they had the best banh mi in Vegas.  This is Vegas, not L.A., so I should have known.  I've been spoiled by the plethora of cheap banh mi places in the San Gabriel Valley, compounded by just having returned from SE Asia.  The Hue Thai House Special sandwich (containing pressed luncheon meat, char siu, Asian pate, and some other processed meat product) was just so so, not anywhere near as satisfying as the Saigon Special at the Saigon Sandwich & Bakery in the SGV.  And $4 for an iced coffee, I don't think so.  It didn't help that the giant television was tuned to "The Bachelor".
