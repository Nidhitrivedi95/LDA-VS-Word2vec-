We tried the five spice beef soup and bibimbap. The soup had a great broth with cilantro, chili, and lime. The restaurant provides any extras you might want to put in there to spice it up a little more. It should just be served in a cup because it's so good you just want to drink it.

The bibimbap was a fun dish with pickled vegetables and the best kimchi I think I've ever had. 

They have a few fun cocktails. I tried the cucumber martini - refreshing!

I can't wait to keep coming here and trying new items.
