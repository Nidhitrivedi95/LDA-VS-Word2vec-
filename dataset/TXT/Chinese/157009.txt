TSGBM2z5BTeJvYQAznz8Fg Service: On point, but it's not hard for a buffet to have decent service. Also they weren't so busy when I was there. Plates were clean, which is more than I can say for most buffet restaurants.

Food: Better variety than a lot of other seafood lunch buffet restaurants. Their seafood game is strong, but their other food less so. I really liked their pecan shrimp and squid salad. However some of the baicai I had tasted kind of funky, their grilled spare rib was really bland, and their duck was a little too salty. Also was not a fan of their sweet and sour tofu. 

Anyway, I just feel like $20 a head on the weekend for lunch is too much given the food quality, but it could be worth it during the weekdays if you really enjoy seafood.
