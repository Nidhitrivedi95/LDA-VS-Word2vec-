liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA This is a fusion Asian restaurant!!!  They offer Vietnamese, Hong Kong, and Chinese food.  The price is higher than any normal Chinese restaurant but be smart and come during happy hours or use local discounts which is 25% off.  Also try to see if the casino offer discounts. 
I highly recommend their signature dish Sate Pho with Ox tail.  If you don't like Ox tail you can request filet mignon.  We are local so the price doesn't matter for us much. 
Beautiful Ambience and the noise level are comfortable.
