JQrh2cmndqRKwTpVveHPDg Change of pace from typical Chinese food.   It's a once in a while place for us.  Decor and seating is very nice.  Certain dishes can be salty.   Price is not bad (if you use the VIP card which you buy for $20 cash...bit of a scam)...there is two prices-Normal or VIP.   This place can be busy so if you have a lot of people, reserve a table.  Another thing is a lot of the staff can only speak Mandarin (English and Cantonese is optional).  Lastly only cash or debit.
