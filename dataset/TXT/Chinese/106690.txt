L_tieGcFMQVSmk7XiA093A Had dinner here with a big group. Awesome food and the service was even better! Everything was fresh and the taro rolls for desert were great. I would recommend this place for groups between 1-8. Make sure if you get the spicy broth not to go for the suicide or killer, unless you have the stomach for it!
