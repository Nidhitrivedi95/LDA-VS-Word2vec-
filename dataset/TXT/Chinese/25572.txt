7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ A friend told me about this place so I figured it would be good considering the Yelp reviews. Came in here wasn't greeted for about 5 mins. Okay, we sit down and took a while to order since we were so confused about the menu. We tried the egg rolls, pot stickers, fried rice, crab Rangoon dip, salad, and fried chicken.

Food starts to come out and honestly didn't look appetizing. Egg rolls were fried way too long, I felt like I was eating straight oil. Pot stickers were okay probably the best thing we had. Fried rice wasn't that good either had a "fishy" taste to it. Crab rangoon dip wasn't that good, I like the idea of thinking out the box and making it a dip, but please stick to the classic way. The fried chicken looked really good but I bit into it and it wasn't cooked! And last but not least they forgot the salad. 

Never filled up waters never asked how we were doing, how the food was tasting. Very unhappy and probably will not be back.
