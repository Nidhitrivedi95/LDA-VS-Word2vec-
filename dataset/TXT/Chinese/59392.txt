dj4eotH4cBqbeIH2CgSmYg I walked in thinking it looks like a better version of the fast food Chinese places and it sure is...Way better.The place is clean and has a separate counter for pick up orders.You can order online and customization is simple.They offer reward points for every purchase.

The food is good and filling.You can order a small or a large bowl depending on your appetite.Its a great place for a quick Lunch or to go if you are in the mood for some Chinese fast food.I love their Entrees especially the sweet and sour,mongolian and thai dynamite.The entrees are served with white/brown Rice or Noodles.You can pick your proteins and customize what vegetable goes into your bowl.They also have a ton of sushi and salads to choose from.

And Yes, they have outdoor seating!
