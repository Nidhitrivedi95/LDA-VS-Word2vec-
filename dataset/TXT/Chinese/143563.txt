ropJyZdmv6NeDU2Vz1I_Hg Golden Buddha is one of our favorite places, because the food is always good and the atmosphere is really nice,with a piano player. We often use a restaurant.com certificate, which makes it more affordable/ But we'd definitely come here without a coupon, especially if we're entertaining guests. I would guess by some of the more negative reviews that language/cultural differences come into play when there is a dispute of some kind. We've had no problems using restaurant.com certificates.
