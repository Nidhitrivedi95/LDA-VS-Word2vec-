tBDkO-vfXrXMnLJu2sF0Hw Me and my friends ordered dried hot pot and dumplings. I was surprised that this place does not serve mapo tofu during the dinner time.
The server helped us with ordering food. There were not enough English instructions to be able to order. The food was overall good, except that there were many bones and dried chilli that needed to be put aside, so we had to order extra bowls just to dispose of them. The food had the numbing & spicy feel, and it was something I wasn't familiar with, let alone my friends.  Considering the cost, I didn't find the food to be terribly filling.
The overall interior didn't leave much room for bags or coats, but the servers were friendly in general. I may come back just to try the mapo tofu during the lunch time, but I wouldn't bring my unsuspecting friends who can't handle spicy food.
