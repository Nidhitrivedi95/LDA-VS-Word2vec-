aAiDjaeWjiD8XxRBGMLKyw Decor - This eatery is mainly designed for take out. They do have a couple of tables, but they weren't clean.

Service - The waitress/cashier/cook was polite, when taking my order. However her co-worker, who was next to her, was on the phone and made loud remarks throughout my time there.

Food - I ordered one of the tofu dishes. I was extremely disappointed with all aspects of the dish. The tofu had a tough outer exterior, like it had been fried and stored for a day or two. The sauce had a very fermented bean taste, which didn't compliment the tofu or the vegetables. Lastly, the rice had an odd odor, when tasted by itself.

Overall - Feels and tastes like a low-end chinese take-out. I won't be visiting here again.
