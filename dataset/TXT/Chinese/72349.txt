Even knowing that this place wouldn't be outstanding, I went in optimistically. I should have taken the hint from being the only people in there on a Friday night at 6:30. Hands down, the worst Chinese food that I have ever had. I mean for real, this place was such a let down. Even the sketchy New China a mile down the road is quite good in comparison. Go somewhere else. Go anywhere else. Except if you're in their free-delivery area, then why the **** not. Actually, just get some frozen Chinese from Walmart, you'll like it more.
