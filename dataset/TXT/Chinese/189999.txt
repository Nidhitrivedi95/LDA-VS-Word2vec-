yhgOJXJd_XAU-8jIvcfq0g First time at this establishment due to Yelp reviews. When we entered the place, it was pleasant and clean. It was very straightforward and the staff was friendly. The food is fresh and flavorful with the exact amount of spiciness. We tried their skewered dishes and each one that we have ordered are grilled to perfection. 
The only difficulty that I encountered on our Mother's Day visit here is the language barrier that we had with our hostess. Naturally, as first timers, we had plenty of questions but I spent the beginning of my ordering process confused. She was trying to give recommendations and explain the ordering process but we had a difficult time understanding one another. Eventually, despite being still a bit confused, we finalized our order and the rest was history. 
This is a good place to dine in and the food is delicious. 
Enjoy everyone!!
