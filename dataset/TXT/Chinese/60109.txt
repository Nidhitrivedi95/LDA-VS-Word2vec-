DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ Brought the Mr here because its sooo convenient for us that one likes ramen and the other likes Hawaiian food hehehe. Im glad this place exist because they have a friendly crew, fast and relaxing eating area for a pretty reasonable price, nothing too fancy but a local joint and great food!
