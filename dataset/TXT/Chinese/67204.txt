em3TpGN9BAA85u2lXewDiQ My family took me to Ming Fu for Mother's Day and I must say the food and the service was wonderful!  We had the teriyaki skewers as an appetizer and our main course was duck, chicken and broccoli and sesame chicken. Our waitress Marissa was warm and friendly and very efficient! She was very attentive and made our experience at Ming Fu exceptional! We will definitely be back!
