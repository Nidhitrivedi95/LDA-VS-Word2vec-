N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ I have been to Patois on two occasions and on both the food has not failed my high expectations! Patois' menu is delicious and so flavorful - everything I have tried is absolutely excellent.

A few favorites: 

- SLIDERS: these things are to DIE FOR. The buns are kind of sugary sweet and they are so amazing. Paired with a juicy burger, can't go wrong!
- FRIED CHICKEN: it's what they're known for, and for a reason. SO GOOD
- 4/20 BROCCOLI BUDS: YUM! The hummus at the bottom is perfection, and the broccoli so crispy and good! 

The cocktail list is extensive, and there are a few hits and misses. The main "miss" for me is their sangria (Dirty Wine) which was pretty much undrinkable. 

So with such delicious food, why the three stars? 

Well, Patois advertises their ability to do large-party dinners. I recently booked them for my birthday for 15 guests. I arrived slightly late (about 15 minutes late for my 9:00 p.m. reservations) but there were about 7 people holding the table... when the rest of the group arrived there weren't enough seats, and we didn't get our food until after 10:30 p.m. It kind of put a damper on the evening, because even though I was a bite late (we had called to let them know), I wouldn't expect it to take over an hour for food, when you advertise your ability to do large groups.

While the food is great, it was kind of a MEH experience!
