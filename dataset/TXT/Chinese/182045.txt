xftWto4IdilizsGdE07AQw If I could I would give this restaurant 0 stars. Food was very basic & overpriced. The majority of their food was very greasy and had looked like it was made hours before.  Considering I had been the only person in there the owner was just standing at the bar awkwardly staring at me eat. The waitress was okay, & when I first walked in, there were workers napping in some of the booths. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone especially with their horrible service & their extremely rude workers.
