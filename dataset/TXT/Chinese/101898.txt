keQlXWfz2K7GukqaReVyow I'm baffled by the good reviews on here.  First, this is not a Japanese restaurant if the name suggested otherwise.  It really shouldn't even be considered a Chinese restaurant as the food does injustice to what is actually good Sze Chuan / Chinese food.  

Second, I'm not the best cook in the world, but I feel like I can stir fry green beans and sizzling beef (or "hibachi beef" as they call it) much better than this place.  The food was way too salty and tasted worse than the Chang Jiang Americanized stuff, especially given the not-so-cheap prices ($15 for the hibachi blob, $10 for the green beans). 

Third, tea is charged per cup ($1.75) with free refills.  Since it was per cup anyways, I asked to have a different tea from my co-diner, but the server was basically too lazy to brew two different kettles, so she told us that they only had one type of tea.  Sure.  They really should just charge per kettle, like almost every other Chinese restaurant in the country.

I really wanted to support Asian restaurants in Madison out of the hope that more will spring up, but this is just plain bad.

If you want to try what is actually good Sze Chuan food, please do yourself a favor and drive to Chinatown in Chicago and go to Lao Sze Chuan.  Then come back and revise your review for this place.
