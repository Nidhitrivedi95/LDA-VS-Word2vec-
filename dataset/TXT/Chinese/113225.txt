Mn8PTuxCUu1A2_RlwXv3kw I'm kind of skeptical when I saw only 3 reviews but since they were all 5 stars, I decided to give it a try. It was a disappointment!

Location - This restaurant is located in an elderly residence. People going to the restaurant or dining hall are not allowed to enter through the main entrance which we didn't know. There was no sign. I was lucky enough to meet a lady who politely refused to let me in and gave me directions. My poor friend and two other customers across our table spent over 15 minutes trying to figure out the dining hall location. The restaurant itself, once you get there, was clean and spacious. 

Food - Good for the pig stomach soup, beautiful beet basket carving with 2 carrot crabs on the appetizer combo and the taro paste dessert. All the signature dishes were substandard. The marinated duck, oyster pancake and wutou fish in broth were over cooked. Even the leaves on the Jiè lán miáo were chewy!

Service - the receptionist was very friendly and helpful. The server had no smile the whole evening.
