MdS6EHt2RZFpn9fQXZc9Ig Opens till 11pm. Very clean place.  Nice decor.  Friendly service.  Good alcohol selection,  although my wine came very late. Great menu selection. Great food quality but portions not as generous as regular HK style restaurants. Place a little echoey, so noise level can be high.  Rice is not top grain quality--pretty fragmented.  Price higher than regular HK style restaurants.
