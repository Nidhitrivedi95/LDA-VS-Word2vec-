2KOXNZVoxpcwen_JmIQdfA It always feels a little odd, to review a chain restaurant. But everyone needs to know this location is better than the rest!

After growing up eating quality home-made pho (mama makes best!), it's always different eating out. Even with the popular, 'Pho Mi 99', even staple dishes can be screwed up. (HOW? It's so simple?!)

Over the years, I've watched quality, even quantity, slip away from some Vietnamese restos. Notably, one of them now serving a third of a beef ball. Not even half. But a third. 

However, the heartland location is definitely one of the best in Mississauga. 

Food here is almost, always on point. Staff are super friendly and timely. 
Atmosphere super casual, as usual - but still super clean and updated. 

This city knows where good food is at. If you come by on a weekend, or even peak hours on a weekday, they're full packed! Beware!
