DDAGwRR0SypD47XD7-ytjA Our 1st attempt to try this new eatery was their 1st weekend and was a disaster as they were completely over-whelmed and we walked after a long wait without even having a chance to order.  So a few weeks later we gave them another chance and well, it certainly was not as busy and got to order in a normal amount of time.  The food thou was just OK, the Tasty Asian Kitchen is MUCH better and was again just OK.
