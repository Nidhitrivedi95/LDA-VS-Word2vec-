uBCRRQJ4ukFaE_UyY6T1uQ My boyfriend and I were on a date night, went to the shark reef, and then decided to check this place out since we in the area. 

It was pretty dead, so service was really fast. We started off with the Spiced Crispy Pork Belly. It was delicious, the avocado mix was some of the best stuff I've ever had. I thought we were for sure on the roll of a great sushi dinner. We decided for our main course, to split the 4 roll tasting course which was $55. It was basically 4 rolls, each with 4 pieces. There was one with beef, which I was leery about, but it ended up being delicious. The other 2 were so-so. The 4th one though, was a lobster roll. I love lobster, but I like lobster with some melted butter and a baked potato, not in my sushi roll. I give this place only 3 stars, because the sushi part of it, wasn't so great. If I ever go back, I'd like to try their actual dinner menu, since the pork belly was delicious, there might be some gems in there.
