JRRduMZI2aU3UCjfNEQURA I decided to go here for dinner with a few friends and was skeptical at first as sometimes i question the quality of these places however when the food came out and i took my first bite that claim swiftly disappeared. 

The place: Located within the heart of Montreal's Chinatown, Keep an eye out for the number as it is easily missed. As soon as you walk in the door the smell of the delicious food hits you straight away which start to make your mouth water for whats on offer. The vibe is similar to other Chinese restaurants i have been, which is good as its not too fussy on the decor just a clean place with good lighting and sound level that you can converse with your friends and enjoy the food. It looks like you can seat large enough groups as i saw a group of 8 eating when i went in. 

Food: Where do i start, my experience with dumplings has been limited to say the least. I could count the amount of times i have had them on one hand. One of these places however was a very established Chinese restaurant. There was 5 of us all together so we decided to buy 3 different portions of dumplings. Each portion of dumplings contains 15 dumplings ! The dumplings were brought out on steamer baskets and were very hot when they came out (which is good). As i took my first bite the juices splattered everywhere (recommend) eating them whole. The quality of each dumpling was amazing and found myself reaching for another before i had the one in my mouth finished. After about 10 dumplings (i eat the most) i was well and truly full to the brim. I could still taste the flavors in my mouth long after i finished them. 

Price: The price of the 3 portions worked out so cheap. Between 5 of us it was about 6 dollars each which is an absolute bargain. 

I would highly recommend going here especially if you want to try something different. 
Also they have fortune cookies at the till which is always exciting at the end of meal :)
