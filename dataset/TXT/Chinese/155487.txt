TkXbFJtFCdM_WTLkHa6Erw I love this Panda Express! It's always clean, the food is always warm and fresh, and the staff are really friendly. Every time I go in, it's consistent. I am a big fan of low carb, so I get steamed veggies and teriyaki chicken. Skip the sauce! We're here all the time, and we are never disappointed. I think it's the nicest Panda Express we've ever been to.
