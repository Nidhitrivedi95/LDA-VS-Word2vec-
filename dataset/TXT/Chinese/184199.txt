xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A This used to be my absolute favorite place to go and have been known to obsessively talk about their chicken pad thai and bubble tea. The most recent visit was a complete disappointment. 
Service has never really been that great but it's not terrible. Our bubble teas, usually slushy like, were lukewarm water. Yuck. The pad thai was still a large serving but noticeably smaller than it used to be (I could get 3 meals out of it, now it was more like 1 1/2) and there were only 2 slivers of tofu on the entire dish. Friends had said it was slowly getting worse but I did not want to believe it. Unfortunately, that appears to be true.
