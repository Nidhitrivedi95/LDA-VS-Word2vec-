7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew This review is based on the lunch specials rather than the Dim Sum selection. I am making this qualification because it seems that the great reviews written so far here are based on the Dim Sum menu. Just basing off what I had, I did not find anything special about my lunch plate. It was good, but nothing distinguished it from similar dishes served at other Chinese restaurants. It was a pretty standard and generic tasting meal. 

I would note though, that I did not even know this was a Dim Sum restaurant until I looked here in Yelp. I certainly did not get offered anything off a Dim Sum cart the whole time I was in there. Perhaps the menu is different during lunch? I don't know for sure. Oh well, I would probably never return to find out anyway.
