nMo0ozHO7cqsPaxw_7N6ow I really wasnt blown away but Dim Sum on the two occasions I have done Take Out. I bave tried a few dishes from the menu and I feel like its your average chinese food. They do have a large menu so you have plenty of options! 

I hear that when you dine in you have even more choices! Im dying to try the steam buns! Ill review again once I dine in! 

I wiah so badly they delivered!
