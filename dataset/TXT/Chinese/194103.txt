zDQZZZhb8VOk8EaoN3HeTA I ordered take away yesterday from this place, I have to admit I've not seen many Chinese places that serve all white meat at dark meat prices & that their food tasted good, the hostess was pleasant and polite, rice quantity was quite a bit more than other places, overall I'll give them 4 stars!!!
