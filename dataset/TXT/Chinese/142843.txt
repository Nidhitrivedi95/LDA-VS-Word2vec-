RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw Whenever I visit the Toronto area, I try to stop by this place for some wholesome goodness.  The congee is fantastic.  It's balanced flavor - not too strong or weak - and just the right amount of ingredients.  For example, I just had the congee with pork and preserved egg.  It wasn't too much or too little in terms of pork or preserved egg.  The only complaint was that one of the eggs wasn't cut through all the way.

Outside of congee, the rest of the menu is also well done.  We ordered lobster with ginger and scallions on top of pan fried noodles.  The lobster was cooked just right.  Not overcooked nor undercooked.  Combined with the sauce on top of the crispy noodles, it was great.

I've eaten here probably a total of 3-5 times over the past 5 years, and I've never had a bad meal.  They've been consistent.  They get really busy during lunch time on a work day.  So be prepared to wait.
