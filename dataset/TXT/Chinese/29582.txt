966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA I wanted something more than your typical Panda Express food. I wanted something new so I headed to Wendy's Noodle Cafe after I read the numerous reviews. While I was reading through the reviews the Mushroom Noodles , Beef and Tomato Rice, and the Chicken Wings stood out so I ordered them. The servings were more than enough for two.

The Mushroom noodles had too much of a pronounced mushroom taste for me. Don't get me wrong I love mushrooms but after a certain point I get nauseated. These tasted better the next day with a dash of Siracha. 

The Beef and Tomato Rice was delicious! It's like nothing I've tasted before. It had tender pieces of beef with tomato gravy over rice. I would come back just for that dish alone. 

The Crispy Chicken was nice and crunchy just the way I like it! They are the best wings I've had in Vegas at an Asian food place. 

I wanted to be adventurous so I tried the Durian Crepe. When I was ordering I forgot that it was known as "the stinky fruit". The creme inside of it was good but when the waitress kept saying I was brave to try the Durian because many people think it smells. I started to see why after two bites. If I could compare it to anything I would compare it to garlic. The taste was very potent . If you are on a date don't order this. 

The food was tasty and different and the service is friendly!
