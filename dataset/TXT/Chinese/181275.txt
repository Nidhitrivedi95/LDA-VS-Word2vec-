XCUXCTHvY8QVR4xU0DF__w This is more of a 2.5-star review. It's a small place where they've squeezed in as many tables as they possibly could with a narrow pathway to access all the tables. Their food is decent enough that I would visit again if I had some serious soup bun cravings but it's just decent. However, I do enjoy their onion pancake.
