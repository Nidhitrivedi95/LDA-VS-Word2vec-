HGuHk935tyokX6kveEviJw Showed up at 5 before 10 am on Sun morning, and the place was already starting to fill up. First the good: spacious, slightly harried staff were welcoming and quickly sat me down and asked which tea I'd like. My pref is always heung pihn but it never tastes like it in any of the restaurants I've been to here in PHX. Anyway, the usuals showed up in carts. I have to commend the staff who have to keep up in Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and English, four times the number of languages that the average local speaks, and they do a good job of that. Had ha gao, siu mai, ha cheung, and sihn juk guen. Now, this is where it falls off a bit. The ha gao were oversteamed and so were disintegrating when you tried to pick them up, the siu mai seemed a bit old, and so too for the sihn juk guen, which was bad being one of the first to sit. In their favor, everything was hot, so, didn't experience any distress. But I was unimpressed. I did spot, heh, some spot prawns which you don't see too often outside of BC, they were pretty pricey, but, live. Later saw a tankful at Mekong Supermarket, still pricey, but wondered if they'd cook them if you brought your own, as other Chinese restaurants do. I'll have to go back for the dinner specials.
