I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Awesome place to hang out and enjoy some sweet treats. I usually come here for the Snoh. It's a light and fluffy shaved ice with very unique Asian influenced flavors. I've tried the taro, thai, green tea, and mango snow so far. All delicious, but I do favor the thai tea and taro with mochi toppings and a black sesame drizzle. I have yet to taste their drink selection though.
