nt-bokSaqLeYc8APwrq6Pw We went to Kweilin on the recommendation of an article in the Guardian. The space is fairly traditional for a Chinese restaurant and not much to write about. 

The food - in particular the seafood - was fresh and nicely prepared. The service was friendly and quick. The paper prawns were very tasty and meaty. Both the hot & sour and the crab & corn soups were delicious. The mains of Cantonese chow mein, the Eight Treasure duck and steamed sea bass were what you would expect from a good Chinese spot. 

All this being said, £100 for 3 people is just insane for Chinese with no drinks. I liked the food but the value for money is just crazy. I've had equally good - if not better - Chinese food elsewhere for half the price. Not sure when I'll be in Edinburgh again and I doubt I would go back.
