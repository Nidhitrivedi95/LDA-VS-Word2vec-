hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Very good place for dinner. It looks and feels modern. The dumplings were well balanced in taste and texture. For example, the veggie dumplings have some nice nut crunchiness. The noodle soup I tried was above average (beef and tendon) and I really liked the chili oil they served it with. Need to come back!  For vegetarians: they have an off-the-menu soup with mushrooms and zucchini and other veggie goodies (my companion loved it).
