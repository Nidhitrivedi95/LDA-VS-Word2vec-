uxSL4FHWiO-fr2iae_d3Bw My husband can't eat rice so he asked what other side he could get with his entree.   I was told we could get steamed veggies for an up-charge.  Ok, sounds reasonable.  He brought us a little plate of steamed snow peas, broccoli and carrots.  When the bill came, we were charged $3.95 for the "Baby Buddha's Feast" (from the child's menu) which actually comes with a child's drink and side.  Did I mention my picky 2-year-old child was with us but chose to eat nothing.  Point is- if I am going to pay for a child's meal, I expect to be offered what comes with the price of that meal.  My toddler would've enjoyed the child's drink and side, that is had we been offered this option.  Our server was not looking out for us!  Disappointed.
