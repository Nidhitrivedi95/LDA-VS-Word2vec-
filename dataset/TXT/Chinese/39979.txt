AXWkHRl0Tv1CLKgJ8-t7GA If you're looking for good Hong Kong style food, this is the place I would recommend. It's a bit far if you live on the island, but it's worth the drive. Been here on multiple occasions, for breakfast/lunch and supper, and I've never been disappointed. I grew up eating Chinese food, so I like to think I can tell when something is actually good. 
For their breakfast, their congee is great, it's thick and homogeneous, I really like the seafood congee, especially with the fried dough. 
I don't remember seeing it on the actual menu, but we've ordered a "Chu pa bao" (which literally translates to pork chop bun) several times and it is amaaaazing. It's basically a slice of pork chop (not in the traditional sense, but its marinated with this thick sweet sauce and probably panfried afterwards) slipped in between a toasted baguette with caramelized onions - oh man. So good. Pair that with their cold milk tea is just superb (I highly recommend the cold milk tea!! - fantastic!) 
For supper everything I've tried there has been delicious, from the chicken curry, to the hot stone pan black pepper beef fried noodles, to their Cantonese style chow mein, everything tasted perfect, like the way I grew up with. 
So if you're looking for good Hong Kong style Chinese food (not the westernised versions) I would suggest Restaurant Jardin du Sud. I wish it were easier to get to though...
And their prices are completely fair too! Which is a big plus!
