hlDcfzRGfmSmL5LpYcRqKA Your typical basic Chinese food in south Scottsdale for when ur hungover or feeling like a fatty. Me and my roomies get delivery here once or twice a month and the food is always hot, fresh, and quick. I think their crab puffs and egg rolls are above average to most Chinese restaurants. If you like spicy foods my go to is the spicy chicken or spicy beef because it's 'healthier' and flavorful (minus the sodium)
