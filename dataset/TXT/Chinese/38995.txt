atSfDP-SLY4GrvBlBPB31Q Tried it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  Made a special trip there just to try it.  I figured if I loved it, I will have discovered a great chinese place which is very scarce in the valley.  I got: 

Chicken fried Rice: Was just ok. Missing scallions, bean sprouts.  Good amount of chicken
Orange Chicken:  just ok.  missing orange slices and the peppers which usually accompany  this spicy dish
Egg Flower Soup:  Just ok. Not enough salt.  No noodles accompanied it which is the usual with chinese soup
Shrimp with lobster sauce:  OK.  I asked for it to be in a white sauce which they did do; however, excessive carrots made the sauce too sweet.
No brown rice was available for purchase.  
Lovely people, ok food, definitely over-rated. 
will not be returning.
