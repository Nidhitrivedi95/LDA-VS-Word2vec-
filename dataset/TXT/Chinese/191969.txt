yYL95YmG-2lI33G9ZLseyQ Terrible experience. We were a group of 5 on Saturday night. Place was fairly busy, but not full. Ordered a steamed fish and three other simple, straightforward dishes. The steamed fish arrived 30 minutes after ordering, but It took us an hour from ordering to get the rest of our food -- and we still were missing one dish! We finished all of the food before that last dish arrived, so we sent it back out of pure frustration over how long it took.


The food couldn't be more polarized. It was either bland or ridiculously salty, though the fish was decent. The supposedly healthy dishes were not palatable, while the marginally palatable dishes didn't seem to be healthy. I don't know what these guys are trying to accomplish. As far as service goes, it was pretty standard, and courteous as far as Chinese places go.

They have some serious work to do in their kitchen. Too bad I won't be able to see their progress because I've vowed never to go back.
