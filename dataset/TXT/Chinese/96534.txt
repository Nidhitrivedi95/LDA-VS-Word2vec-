jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow I've been to a lot of Asian buffets! Trust me when I say this place is not bad at all. It is a really BIG and clean place to eat. As far as the food goes the chicken was not that great. The service was not as well. But the noodles and rice were pretty good. You feel like you're in a fancy dinning place. I will come back.
