CPcy22Hd2F7z0EKG66FMRA for the price i guess its alright. 
The Shui Zhu Yu was not authentic, wasnt spicy and the fish was already cut fish fillet there were no fish heads like you would traditionally find in a sichuan restaurant. The lamb didnt taste fresh and was salty. The price was cheap but I will not be returning.

Update: Also kept giving us wrong dishes..happened twice.
