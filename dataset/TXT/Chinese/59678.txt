dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw Tried great bao for the first time a week ago. I came with an open mind and heart, especially hearing so many wonderful things about this place. I was left disappointed. 

The woman working the food truck was not friendly at all, never said one word to us. No hello, how are you, or even hey this is what is popular on our menu. My friend and I got the pork belly boa and we weren't fans. I had never had such a doughy bun, it was pure white and looked as it wasnt cooked. im sure it was. The pork was completely fatty and i usually like that but paired with the weird douchy texture i wasnt a fan. Loved the little carrot and minced toppings on top but it wasnt something i would try again.

If i do comeback, i'll br trying something else for sure.
