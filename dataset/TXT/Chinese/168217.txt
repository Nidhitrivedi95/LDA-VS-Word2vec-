I came on a Sunday evening around 5:30pm last time and there was a huge crowd waiting to be seated. Luckily the food does come quite quickly. I would recommend everyone to look at the menu while you're waiting to be seated so you can order as soon as you sit down which means you can spend less time waiting and more time eating.
