D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Always my favorite place! I love the red curry with pork. The pork is tender and flavorful. Everything is good here. There are soooo many selections. Reasonable price and good quality food and drinks. Service here is the friendliest service in Vegas. Very attentive and polite. Highly recommend!!
