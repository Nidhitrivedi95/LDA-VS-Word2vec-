The food, as I said, is delicious. I recommend the Jade Chicken, it doesn't fit well into the quesadilla, but if you get it in a burrito is it perfect. It's a sweet and sour type sauce with fried chicken, it is said to be their specialty. I definitely enjoyed it, we'll continue to come back here regularly.
