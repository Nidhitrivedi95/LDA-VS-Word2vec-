yCHCeeoJPwUIjPiBo0cY2A So gross. Like, you'll end up in the ER getting your stomach pumped gross. They should rename this place MSG Sentral! Food has no flavor or spice, too much salt on everything, mains are always over-sauced, hardly any meat in the mains, overpriced, TERRIBLE service both at the store and especially over the phone. I have no idea how these guys have been in business for so long, with so many new restaurants in the area I don't suspect they'll last. Or why I keep ordering from this hellhole. I always forget that two new Chinese/Hakka joints opened up within 5 mins of here, so ya, go elsewhere for Chinese food or make sure you've got a toilet or a hospital nearby.
