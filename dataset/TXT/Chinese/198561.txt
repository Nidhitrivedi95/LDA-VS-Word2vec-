I thought there would be a line up to get in and it would be busy but nope! There were empty seats everywhere. I liked the decor and ambience of this place...very chill and laid back. We came in during happy hour and they have items from their menu for a cheaper price. We were a party of three and we knew the portion size were small so we ordered a bunch of stuff like: lucky wings, soi mung rice balls, Nacho Koreano, fried chicken, pork belly bao, and the infamous Hambaoger. 

The lucky wings were juicy, sweet and sticky. Not crispy though which I was expecting. The soi mung rice balls were like little risotto balls with pork deep fried and topped with a bunch of stuff. Not bad at all, I enjoyed it. The nacho was a great concept! Crispy dumplings toped with spicy mayo and kimchi. I expected this dumpling to be light and crispy but it wasn't light just crispy but very tasty! The five spice fried chicken was my least favorite. I didn't get a Wow factor from this at all. It wasn't the crispy I was hoping for, the flavor was ok and it came in 2 pieces for 6 bucks which was a rip off!! But I must say that the chicken was cooked perfectly just not my cup of tea. Now onto my fave...pork belly bao! The bao was soft! The pork was cooked perfectly and it was very tender and everything just went well together. The Hambaoger was spot on and tasted like a Big Mac but better since their patty is made out of Kalbi beef.

The service was fast and friendly!! This place is great to order lots of food and just share with a bunch of friends.
