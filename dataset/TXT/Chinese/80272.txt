GqBP4UM_z2BAJz_ZUzdecA This small Chinese lunch buffet is pleasantly the opposite of most of my buffet experiences. Usually you find a buffet with 10 tables of choices and only one with food worth eating. This place is very small, and only has 2 buffet tables, but everything is great! Prices are great, and I will probably eat here a couple times a month! No buffet at dinner though.
