I felt bad coming in so close to closing time, but the employees were more than welcoming! Especially Tuc! He greeted us with a smile as he presented us with the menu. Someone very close to me had recommended this place and it's orange chicken, so I had to try it... and my oh my was it the best orange chicken I've ever had! The chicken was moist with a crispy shell. The sauce was not tangy and overpowering, it was subtle and flavorful. You can literally eat it by itself without rice! We also ordered the Hong Kong style crispy noodles. Delicious.. the mixed texture of the noodles combined with the flavorful vegetables and chicken is a combination of greatness! An added bonus was the free egg rolls with a purchase of at least $15! Throughout the dining experience we were never rushed and Tuc was very considerate when he asked us if we wanted anything else before they close the kitchen. Overall great place to dine in. I feel more regular visits in the near future!

Thank you Tuc for your kindness and service!
