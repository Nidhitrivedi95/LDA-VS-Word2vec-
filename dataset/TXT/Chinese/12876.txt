2rJQgNBjjZrYotlZgvBdLg First time. deco is good. service is good. lady tried to explain how to order, but i didnt really understand.

ordered soup with 1 chili and another soup tomato based. 

i suggest not to get the tomato based if your looking for a ramen flavour. the noodles are spaghetti like which i didnt enjoy

the 10sides were ok. 

ultimate question: would you go back? 
no, there are better noodle places to go
