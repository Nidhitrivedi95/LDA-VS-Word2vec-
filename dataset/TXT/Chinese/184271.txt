xULATz2siGXOPia614mg2A Worst service ever experienced at a Chinese restaurant. I paid our (my friends and I) meal with credit card. After running the card, the waitress came back for me to sign the receipt. Before I signed it, she asked me how much I would pay for the tip. I was stunned because the way she said it made me feel like I was silly and I've never been to a restaurant before. She saw I didn't reply to her so she started to speak in Chinese (we were Chinese and we both knew it, I don't know why she kept speaking in her poor English but that's ok). Then she told me I had to pay at least 15%. I don't know why she assumed I didn't know it. I think her attitude was very impolite, and even rude. I will never go there again.
