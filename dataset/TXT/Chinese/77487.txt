Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA Absolutely delicious 2 item lunch special. I got kung pao beef and yellow chicken curry, spicy level #8! Comes w a huge dollop of white rice, smal cup of soup and choice of appetizer..I got a wonton..all for only #7.95! Plus, they are offering 7% cash back through Yelp..by signing up one of your credit cards..then, all you have to do, is use it there, and Yelp credits you back 7% of your bill. Highly recommended. Great flavors.
