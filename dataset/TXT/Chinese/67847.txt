EnOCjP3wBpoICvEZXil4Cg Menu has a lot of choices including authentic selections. Service was prompt until we were served our food then we ran out of soda, we were done with our meals and wanted to leave. There was only one waitress serving the lunch crowd. She never came to check on us and we had to flag her down after sitting for nearly 20 min after our meal. She was in the back a lot and would not look in our direction once our meal was served. Not sure if we will come back.
