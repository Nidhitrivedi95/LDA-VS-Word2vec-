Ezr9koO5DLqWs_0tKYA0yQ This is a real chinese dim sum restaurant frequented by many asians and non asians like. It's always a full house on weekends.

I last came here around the holiday season for a lunch out with the family - we arrived a bit too late, closer to 1 pm. They serve dim sum till 2, but the selection and service is lacking the later you arrive.

If you've never been for a dim sum lunch, you'll immediately notice how hectic these places are, Jing Hua is no exception. Big tables and people everywhere, ladies pushing carts full of bamboo basket and food. If you don't know what to order, just ask for them to lift up the cover and try picking something you find appealing.

I'm a big fan of all their shrimp dumplings, rice noodles and white radish patties. The food is delicious and authentic, really reminds me of my days back in Asia.

It's a messy restaurant, not particularly appealing and the staff often speak very little english or french so be warned.
