iRFaq249LVEFGeXLzPULnQ It's sooooo good! Hot and sour soup, beef and oyster sauce, fried noodle. Sooooooo good! The customer service is sooo awesome and price are reasonable! The restaurant located next to saloon and the entrance looks super shady but inside is clean and nice! The best Chinese restaurant I found in Vegas!!! U need to try this place!
