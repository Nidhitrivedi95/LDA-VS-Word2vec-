b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag Got a late start on breakfast.  So we just ate at the first buffet we passed.  This buffet had a very small selection of food but it was good.  My favorite was the Mimosa. The manager came around and greeted us and accommodated my request for the mimosa and it was the good champange too.  Yummy
