TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ I've eaten here or picked up from here often. 

A friend introduced me to the restaurant.  She's been friends with the owners for years.  I would never have entered otherwise.  The location and appearance is iffy but inside is very clean.

First I started going down their specials menu but when I reached the General Tsao chicken I was hooked.  Portions are very generous and the staff very friendly.

Sometimes I share a meal with a friend as the portions are that large.

Great value for great food
