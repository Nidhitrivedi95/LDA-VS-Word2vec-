The dumplings are not as good as Din Tai Fong. The top closing portion of the dough is too thick and too dry from the Din Tai Fong standard, however the flavors of the dumplings itself is excellent. 

2 adults and 1 toddler, together we ate 6 baskets. My tot ate one by herself. We also ordered shrimp wontons but it's not that special in CLE Asia town. Everything else on the menu is schezhen spicy.

We will come back again, probably only order xiao long bao.
