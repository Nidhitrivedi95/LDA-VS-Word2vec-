TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA Depending what you order, it can be very delicious or just good food. 

As an adult, I am use to specialty hipster foods now. 

However, this restaurant carries a lot of nostalgia for me since I ate here during my teen years.  

I love the lunch specials, they are always very delicious to me.  Plus the service is always good and friendly.  

I'm happy they treated my little one (5 months old) very kindly.  

I like places that are baby friendly.  I do not know about their bathrooms.  So I don't know if it's baby friendly that way.... Just that it's a nice restaurant and I had a good time with my family
