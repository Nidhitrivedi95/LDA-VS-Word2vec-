Food: Ordered the Tofu, aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypot in black bean sauce. Tasted fantastic. Also had the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter, which was terrific as well. We opted for light entrees, as we were about to see Above and Beyond in the club that night.

Service: Hakkasan was kind of busy that night since it was restaurant week on a Friday, so we had to wait a bit for drinks and for our order to be taken. Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and assisted us whenever we needed it. We did run into a huge issue after our visit. We split the bill even between myself and my girlfriend. Hakkasan charged our cards, but the money was not debited from our account until 19 DAYS LATER (26 March). This was very frustrating, considering the drinks we bought at Hakkasan nightclub only took 3 days come out.

Decor: Very dark and dimly lit. Had kind of the nightclub feel to it. It was still a good time though.
