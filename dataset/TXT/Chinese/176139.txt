WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg I'm of Hakka origin and I've been trying to find a good Hakka restaurant but I know a lot of restaurants in Toronto served Indian fusion Hakka dishes which makes my search difficult but thanks to Yelp I found this gem. I later found out the owner of this restaurant is Hakka too! 

But anyway, let's stick to reviewing this place. I ordered Keu Nyuk (braised pork belly with preserved vegetables), Ginger & Green Onion Chicken, and Ma Po Tofu. 

I have to say, the dishes did wow me. The pork reminded me of home and the chicken dish was how my mom would make it. The tofu on the other hand, was not the same as where I'm from but it's delicious nevertheless. The only issue I have with this place was, everything was starchy. Minus the heavy starch it would have been a perfect 5 stars from me. 

I would recommend this place to people who would wanna try Hakka dishes and to my Hakka brothers and sisters, search no more cause this is the place to go!
