KxqAQ-CJcAPDTJbrnQUTfg We used to go here all the time since it's right below us, but the last time we went it wasn't so good. I've gotten many different things here that for awhile I loved. Last time I got chicken with broccoli and it was so gross and watery. I've also gotten the coconut chicken, which is delicious, but I ended up getting sick from it. The good thing about this place is that they offer frequent buyer cards. So once you get to like 9 meals the 10th one is free. All in all I would recommend it, but don't expect it to be amazing every time. I think it depends on how busy they are for the quality.
