f5AenP5rsrnLo9tKtenIew My husband and I love this place. Delivery is fast and food arrives hot. I'm not that adventurous with Chinese food and usually stick to the basics.... General Tso Chicken, shrimp egg fu young and garlic pepper shrimp. All are delicious and reminds me of the Chinese takeout back east.
