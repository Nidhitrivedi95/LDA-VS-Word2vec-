uLUl_dMl6a9m774LGReDVA Don't bother. I have no idea how this place has this many positive reviews. I gave this place a try when I moved here from the east coast about 10  years ago. I forgot why I haven't been back and gave the place another try. I played it safe and ordered the lunch special sweet and sour chicken with an egg roll, fried wonton and fried rice. 

Oops. That was a waste of my money. 

The chicken was simply one piece of white meat that was fried and then cut into smaller pieces  with the sauce on the side. This wasn't terrible but nothing special. I would have preferred individual battered and fried pieces but no big deal . 

As for the rest. To say It was a disappointment would be an understatement. 

I'm not sure I've ever seen "fried rice" with nothing in it but rice. No scallions, no egg, no onions, nothing. Just plain rice cooked with some added brown color with no flavor. 
The 2 wonton chips. Lol. Nothing but fried wonton skins with a pea sized filling of some sort. 
The egg roll. Now this is a first for me too. No bits of Pork or any meat. It was simply filled with bean sprouts and cabbage. Are you guys serious? Bean sprouts!  An oil dripping roll of flavorless sprouts and cabbage.  

Well, hopefully Yelp will be around another 10 years so I can see my own review if I get any funny ideas of coming to this place again.
