OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw My girlfriend always bugs me for true dim sum every time she's in town to visit me.  Whilst on our recent junket to Sin City, it seemed that my local Vegas friends weren't very dim sum savvy, which led me to research and... gamble... on a place I felt would suit our tastes for authentic dim sum cuisine. 

That's when I discovered Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine, via the internet... and it did NOT disappoint!

Daily dim sum is always a plus in my book, and Chang's serves it up hot and fresh.  I found their service to be NICER than the local restaurants here in the OC, which gets major points in my book!  

We stuck with the usual dishes; har-gow (shrimp wrapped in "clear" starch wrap...), vegetable shumai, lo mai gai (sticky rice with meat & mushroom mix wrapped in a lotus leaf...), a few other dishes that I have no clue the names to, lol... AND, we ordered the walnut shrimp from the regular menu.  

Everything from the dim sum carts was as to be expected; hot, fresh, flavorful, and moist.  The walnut shrimp was incredible, although I felt there to be an over-abundance of the mayo sauce for my personal taste.

Did I mention how stellar the service was?  Friendly, inviting, prompt, and not "all up in your face".  I will visit Chang's every time I head out to Vegas, it has become my favorite local joint for good, authentic Chinese cuisine.

Mahalo fo reading!  =D
