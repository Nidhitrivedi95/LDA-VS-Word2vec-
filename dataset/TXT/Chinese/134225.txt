q_KQbgnaYDlPx8EHTydcBQ My friend has heard about the french toast cubes from this place for a while now and it definitely did not disappoint!! It was served warm and just crunchy enough, with syrup drizzled on it and butter on the side. Definitely a must!
My friend and I also ordered the roti and vegetable curry, it's a good snack. The savory flavor is a good compliment to the french toast. I like to eat savory and sweet for balance lol. The roti was the right amount of crunchy on the outside and airy on the inside, served with just enough of the curry for dipping. Definitely would go back
