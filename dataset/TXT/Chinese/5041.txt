01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ We came here for Chinese New Year's Dinner with the whole family.  I wasn't too impressed with the food and my stomach told me that as well later on in the night. We had ordered half a suckling pig which was the best thing that was on the table. Everything else seemed overly greasy and even the shrimp fried rice had a funny taste. 

Service is what you expect at a typical Chinese restaurant...or rather lack of service. My husband's family ended up buying some of the roast pork to go for dinner last night and it was delicious. Unfortunately, I would say try the roast pork, but other than that don't waste your time.
