jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg After trying a Taiwanese hot pot place in So Cal, I decided to search for a hot pot place here in Vegas and I was surprised there was one. I did not know that there was a hot pot place in Vegas, so I decided to try Booming Spot Mini Pot. The server at this restaurant was really friendly and was happy to promote her dishes to our table. I really like the soup of the hot pot because it had the right flavor and spice to it. However, the lamb skewers weren't the best here and I expected better. Overall, the experience here was nice and the food was good.
