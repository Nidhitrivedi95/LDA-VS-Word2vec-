jpHVV9egbixc56MwP8rzbA I did not have a good experience at the Ricebox. I came here after a Hibs game with a friend and got a meal to take away. The price was about standard, but the quality of the food was lacking. The shop was full with supporters looking for a post-match bite to eat, so I would like to give it another chance on a non-match day when the workers have more time on the hands.
I ordered the sweet and sour pork with rice and found that the flavours were really bland and the meal was generally very greasy
On the positive you do get a cool fortune cookie with every meal! Furthermore, the decor of the restaurant is very good and looks modern.
