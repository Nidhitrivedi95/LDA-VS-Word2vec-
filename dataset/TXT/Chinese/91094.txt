IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ We ordered 3 dishes.
Crispy Calamari for an appetizer.
Then, Orange Chicken & Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles w/ Sea Food.
 Crispy Calamari was oily rather than crispy in texture. I did not like the dipping sauce at all, too sweet for me. 
It could have been sweet & sour sauce...try adding the hot sauce.
Orange Chicken was missing orange flavor. It was strong garlic and soy sauce flavors. Rice was on dry side...
Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles w/ Sea Food was tasty. It was over $50 just for food...
