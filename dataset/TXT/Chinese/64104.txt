e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg Headed out for mid-week dinner and was happy to find a lot of tables available.
I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 3 because the staff was amazing.  Very attentive and personable.  Our waitress made all the right suggestions.

The food:  It was good but not extraordinary.  Would I go back... yes, run back... no.
The highlights were the dumplings, ribs and ceviche.
I was not crazy about the curry (and I love curry) and shrimp brioches.

All in all the decor is really nice, great staff and good food.  You will not go wrong here, but don't expect MasterChef.
