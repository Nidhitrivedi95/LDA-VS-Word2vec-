yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA After a long day of walking around the Las Vegas Convention Center - and unwilling to pay $15 for a slice of pizza and a drink - we headed over to this place for some Asian goodness. Frankly, it looked more like a Chinese restaurant rather than a Vietnamese joint inside. And the menu reflected this to a certain extent, where the offering was well beyond what you'd find at a pho place, with dishes that readily reminds you of a Chinese joint in the 626. The waiter / server was helpful, pointing us in the right direction. The pho broth was hot and tasty. Saw a lot of other people eating what looked like stir fried dishes. Definitely going to have to delve into that side of the menu the next time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommended.
