_AiqOS8io_reYZri1OeP1g I wish I had the guts to try one of the drinks with cheese, or that they did a better job of explaining what it was and how it complimented the drink when we ordered. Either way it sounds cool. I ordered my fav the rose tea and it was delightful. The boba (pearls) were fresh and the barista gave me a generous amount. The shop was really cute and small. It did have a nice place to sit so we just relaxed while our drinks were made. Can't wait to come back and finally try a drink with cheese!
