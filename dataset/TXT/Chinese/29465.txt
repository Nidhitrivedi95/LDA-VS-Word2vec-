9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw I ordered spicy red curry soup which was horribly plain, I had to add a lot spicy oil and salt myself to make it a little bit like a real soup! Vegetables were not fresh, some of them were still frozen. Dipping sauce is ok, but definitely not the best quality. Lamb was good, that's why I gave them 2 stars.
