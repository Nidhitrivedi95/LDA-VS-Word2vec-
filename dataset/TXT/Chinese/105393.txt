Kw06PxDkF8gNMVWntmBKTw What's better than wonton noodle soup on a cold day? Nothing!

Ordered the 3 items noodle soup (chose shrimp wonton, beef brisket, and their handmade fish balls) preferred the first 2 better. The brisket was tender, had a yummy mix of tendon, fatty and lean parts. The wontons were HUGE and had at least 3 whole shrimps in them! So good, definitely my favourite. The fish balls was average. It had remnants of something? Maybe it's suppose to be like that? Not my preferred texture of fish balls.

Also got the lo mein with beef brisket. It's dried noodle on a small bed of lettuce and comes with a bowl of soup. Was I suppose to put the noodle in the soup? Dunno but did it anyways and ended up with 2 bowls of noodle soup. This gooey sauce covered the lo mein and made the texture a little odd. I preferred the original noodle soup better, the soup was more flavourful. 

Service was super speedy. Got my food 2 mins after I ordered. In, eat, out.
