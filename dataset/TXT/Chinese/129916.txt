pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I loved this place in Miami and it's pretty good in Vegas. 
I went for lunch yesterday. The hostess was nice and sat us immediately. Our server was fast and attentive. We ordered the best items on the menu-- hamachi tacos, rock shrimp, kanpachi tiradito, sea bass anticucho, and a neo Tokyo roll. Everything was tasty. However, the hamachi tacos use to be better quality fish. You can tell that it's not the freshest. The rock shrimp didn't have enough sauce and it seemed like it was sitting in the kitchen 10 minutes too long. 
Overall I'd come back but I think the quality use to be better. Great service. 

$150 for 2 people is pretty normal here. That's not including alcohol.
