NO-kZ9See-AXcZDtssJMmw I've given them the benefit of two stars because the hostess and I bonded with our pet dog talk, I hadn't eaten all day and I was starving.  Otherwise only 1 star. Lots of over-fried food on the buffet. I don't eat fried food. Ewwww-I just bit into some sushi with a jalapeno pepper in it. I spit it out, but my mouth is still burning. Excuse me while I go throw up!

UPDATE: My stomach STILL hurts two days later. I'm SO not using the buy 10 get 1 free punch card! That's the same punch card that just got shredded. BYE, BYE Volcano.....
