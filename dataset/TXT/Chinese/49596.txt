CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I thought the decor here was clever. They stacked hundreds of bottles filled with dried noodles all along the shelves. It made for interesting visuals.

The food, on the other hand, is just cheap, over priced Chinese food basically. The pho served here doesn't taste like traditional pho either. Their soup base tasted more like Chinese broth and the rice noodles were chewy. Their fried rice was horrible...$15 for fried rice with barely any vegetables or char siu...what a ripoff. I could have done better myself. Their baby spinach dish along with their chicken curry, which I had to admit were pretty good, were their redemption from a one star rating.
