0Mhw1lD_Zwsv4Vo6oQrPWA Toronto has two Chinatown's, one in the east at Broadview and then the one on Spadina, but in pockets around town there exists small versions where real Chinese restaurants actually exists and in one of these on Centre St is Wah Toos. 

Now, as is the case with many great finds, you trip upon it by accident. An old co-worker told me about this place, and one day when hanging out after work we hit it up, and let me tell you, I'm glad we did. Tasty, quick delicious food and lunch specials that are actually full size portions at actual lunch special prices, not $14.99 and they threw in a small salad as an afterthought. These are real deals.

But something happened in between all the love of tasty lunch specials and humongous dinner helpings: bad service. Grumpy servers, a few bad dishes and one instance where I had been incredibly polite and yet the server almost threw the plate onto the table, and then I didn't come back for a long time. 

But one day I was by city hall and had a hankering for some cheap Chinese and didn't want to go to the noise and craziness of the Eaton food court. So I decided to give Wah Too another try. And as the old expression goes, re-united and it feels so good!

The service was great and both servers I had were friendly and helpful. And the food was quick. And delicious. I ordered two specials because it was so good. And I had beaten the office  lunch time rush so it was nice and quiet. And the lunch specials go until 3:30pm!

I had the chicken balls on fried noodle and the Szechuan beef on fried noodle. So good. I'll be back. Again. And probably again. And again!

Go!
