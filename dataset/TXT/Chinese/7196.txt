0PM5oFKO29sZmL5efmHxug This restaurant is a hidden gem in Metro Square. At first, you would think this restaurant is sketch by looking at it's exterior sign BUT do not let that fool you! This place actually has really good food and the food is so cheap! Went with a group of 6 people and ordered more than 90 dumplings and a couple of other dishes and the bill was just at $60. That's unbelievable. Highly recommended. Probably the best place for dumplings/northern Chinese food in Markham. However, you should come either earlier or later as this place gets crowded at the door easily. Restaurant is not big either so waiting times can be long. 

This is another Asian establishment that only accepts cash so remember to bring cash!
