yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw its a Friday at work,,,and no one can decide on lunch.  We received a flyer for china gourmet in the mail and decided to try it. we ordered hot garlic chicken, beef and broccoli, cashew chicken, veggie fried rice and vegie chow mein.  As we were all eating I asked how everything was and....silence....everyone was so busy eating and smiling:)  Needless to say we all enjoyed everything and this will be our new go to spot for ordering Chinese..and they deliver...winning!!!  its not 5 star dining but it is great Chinese takeout at a reasonable price.
