CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw We had dinner last night. It's a clean and nicely decorated fast food restaurant. They have vegetarian menu if you're a vegan and list of organic entrees. Everything is cooked fresh when you order it. We waited about  15 mins or so.

We ordered several dim sum such as Pork sui mai, Shrimp dumplings, Shrimp Sui Mai,  Pork Soup Dumplings and for entree, Tiger Walnut shrimp which was my favorite and I love the crispy Vegetable spring rolls. Also we tried Jumbo Pacific shrimp ball. 

The food were better than I thought it would be. 
A lot of stuff were out that night. I asked for Veggie Tofu soup but there were out and the girl that worked there said they could make Egg drop soup with corn. That was not on the menu but nonetheless the soup was very tasty.  I would come back for some quick dim sum fix.
