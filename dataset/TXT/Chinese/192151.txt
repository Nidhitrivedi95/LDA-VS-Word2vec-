yZZaCLmVbsKqQAdjaszupA Do not come here for regular price, it is not worth it. They often have BOGO deals on their email blast. I came here for one of those occasions and was pleasantly surprised by the food. Don't expect Mandarin freshness or quality but the food is pretty good for greasy Chinese buffet. Buffet sushi is usually poor quality but there were some that tasted pretty good (the eel!).

I wouldn't come here again just because I'm trying to cut down on the buffets and AYCE places, but if you're around the area and starving, give it a try.
