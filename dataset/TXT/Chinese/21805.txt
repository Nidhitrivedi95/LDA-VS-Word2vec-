6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q Had lunch here today and it was great. 

The service was formal but very friendly. I got to try: 

Oxtail Soup
Jade Dumplings 
Shrimp Pad Thai

When she first set the oxtail soup in front of me, I was a little worried. Never having tried it, I did not know what to expect and the visible bone surprised me. Reservations aside, I tried the broth and it was excellent. From the broth on moved on to the carrot, carefully avoiding the bone. The vegetables were also delicious so I decided to go a hard and try the meat. It was excellent. Very tender and had a great flavor. I would absolutely order again. 

The Jade Dumplings also looked a little bizarre as they are bright green. They were also delicious. Very moist and tasty filling. 

The shrimp on the Shrimp Pad Thai were huge and full of flavor. The rest of the dish was pretty standard fare. I had asked for my Pad Thai to be extra spicy but I felt like it lacked heat. All in all, I love Pad Thai and this dish satisfied. 

I will definitely be back to try another dish.
