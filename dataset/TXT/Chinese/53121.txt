cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw Ok Chinese food.  Appetizers are excellent,  main dishes are OK.  Had orange chicken and beef and broccoli.  Don't like that brown orange sauce,  and the beef was a little to mushy,  if there's such a thing.  Referred by friends,  our main Chinese stop is Golden Valley at Extension and baseline.  Yao's did not top that.
