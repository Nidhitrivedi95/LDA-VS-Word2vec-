0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw Long Jin is one of our go-to spots for weeknight Chinese, and one item in particular. The half Peking Duck. The crunchy mandarin beef is a little on the sweet side, but indulgent and wonderful, and pretty much everything else I've tried has been great. My husband's never failed to eat all of his food and then try to steal some of mine. 

But oh, that duck. Fluffy pancakes, crisp scallions, sweet duck...delivered. For less than $30. Sold! 

We've eaten in store a few times and always had a great experience here. It's clearly a family run joint; often there's an adorable little girl running around. (On one visit she kept trying to quietly change the TV to cartoons and getting in trouble, but it was super cute.) And I'm pretty sure the staff is often the lady out front, and someone in back. 2 people, running a whole restaurant, with food and prices this good. Often the dining room is pretty empty, I think they do a lot of takeout business, but it is still a very clean, relaxing dining room that makes you feel comfortable.

Takeout's usually ready in 10-15 minutes, hot, steamy, and so good. They also offer delivery, but they use a delivery service (who I am not rating in this review, or deducting them points for) that can be kind of spacey. They lost our food twice. So now we just do takeout.
