LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA I frequent here because the location is very convenient. Some of the entrees are really good but some aren't. Their wonton soup, Thai chicken basil, lettuce cup, and Mongolian beef are good here. I didn't care for their curry dishes and chow mein. 
The restaurant and the restroom is very clean and service is spot on. It gets busy here but never had to wait for a table.
