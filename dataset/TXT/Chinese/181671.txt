The service has always been great and prompt. My wife loves their sushi selection. I'm fond of the bento box, which is a great deal. Their sushi is very well prepared. Their grill/wok items are so fresh and well cooked, you'd think you were paying double what your bill comes to. 

The atmosphere is great. Good lighting, almost like a good kept secret tucked away next to Harris Teeter. We can't recommend this enough.
