5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Great Chinese restaurant! We arrived at night,so we don't wanna go out then we chose have a dinner in our hotel.this is the first time we ate at this restaurant and they service great! Food is also great! Not too many restaurants at Las Vegas. If you wanna find a Chinese restaurant, this should be ur best choice! Trust me!
