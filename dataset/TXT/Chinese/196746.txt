zpaXQga1MIqPc5nAWZXtdQ After reading reviews, I drove here from North Phoenix (around 12 miles), and it was well worth it! The staff is very friendly and eager to please. Even offered to help carry my "take-out" to the car. The food is delicious, fresh, and prepared very well. There's a large variety of menu items and options. I ordered the egg drop soup, chicken lo mein, house special fried rice, Mongolian beef,chicken teriyaki, and Mandarin chow mein with soft noodles. Next time, I will bring the family to eat-in. It's NOT easy to find really good Chinese food in AZ...I found it!!!
