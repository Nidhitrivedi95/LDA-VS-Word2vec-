M0A8RFdN1UqSd-tIqXFEBQ I can't seem to find a good Chinese place anywhere in Henderson! The restaurant was clean, and the staff was super friendly, and I even got a free drink while I waited for my take-out. But unfortunately, the food wasn't that good. My pork fried rice was mushy and bland. The spring rolls were really greasy and had no flavor. The pepper steak was alright- definitely had fresh ingredients, big chunks of onion and bell peppers. But it too was devoid of any real flavor. If I could rate just the service though, it was exceptional!
