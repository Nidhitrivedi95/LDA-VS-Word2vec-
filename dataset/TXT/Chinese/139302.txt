qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA Came here for the first time in ages & made me sad that I haven't been in a while, it was quite good. We had 8 of us + a baby & the service was great. The menu has changed since I last been in. All of our entrees & apps were very good. The ONE mishap we had was someone in the group ordered a "martini on the rocks" & it came back with no "rocks". And when we asked why it wasn't on the rocks, she said "yes it is". We later learned that she was new, and it was her first week on the job, so we told her rocks means ice :) Not a big deal though!!
