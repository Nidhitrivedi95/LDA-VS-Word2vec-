tuikCn2ljRGN5QHZBnjoqA I've passed this place every morning for the last few weeks and have been meaning totry it.  I was very disappointed with the portion size.  I bought the small stroganoff for $8.99.  And trust me they mean small.  The noodles, beef and mushrooms were nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked.   I would have liked a bit more sauce though.  By the time I got back to my office I found it to be a bit dry.Will need to go back and try something else.
