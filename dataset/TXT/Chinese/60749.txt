dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ After waiting more than TWO HOURS for a delivery, I was shocked to see such a small amount of food for the $60 spent.  STONE COLD food I should mention.  The Thai wings and fried shrimp were just huge blots of fried  cold batter.... lots of dried out boiled rice and two very small containers of tasteless, limp cold food.  THEN they hit me up for a $4 delivery charge............

GO TO WEERA - HEARD EXCELLENT THINGS AND WILL TRY IT NEXT TIME.  KUNG FU THAI - YOU SUCK!!!
