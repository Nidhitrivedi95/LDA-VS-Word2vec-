U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q We had the shrimp chow mein (don't recommend, average) and the pork wonton soup w knife cut noodle (recommend- noodles really made the dish). Service was initially great then restaurant got busy and we didn't see waitress for a long time. But we loved the Beijing bellinis- HIGHLY recommend.
