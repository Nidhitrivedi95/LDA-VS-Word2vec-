kWkW6vVePpBox_fKfGgPjQ My friend, Sarah, and I went here. It turns out the Sushi Chef used to work in Sapporo in Scottsdale. He (Sushi Chef) left and worked for the owner of Pan Asia. I like it because Pan Asia 

1 - Owned by a Jap/Chinese guy. Chef is from a Sapporo. So they have both experiences and Asian cultural. 

2 - We went there on Tuesday night at 6 pm. The restaurant is half full. So it is an "okay" busy for a new sushi restant on a week day.  Can you image if it on the weekend?! It would be busy.  And the reason I want to point out is the busier the sushi restaurant gets, the more fresh fish they are going to have :) 

Over all, I love it.
