Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA I love this Thai style noodle house the best. They are always on point with their flavor! I love the ambiance of the location better as well. It is not as bright, and the decoration is well done. The waitress always gets my order right and they make the best Thai tea. I ordered to go for the first time and I think I will stick with eating in!
