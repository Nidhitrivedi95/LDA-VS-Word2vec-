eZQbDYQTZk0_cBroVxnPWg The third in an ongoing series of restaurants I've actually never set foot in.

Siu Wok has become a favorite of my colleagues and I as of late. They offer the standard items you'd find at any Chinese restaurant and that's about it. They do it and do it well. Plus they deliver ($15 minimum order), which is of the utmost important when shackled to a workstation 8 hours a day or more. If you can get an order pulled together by 3pm, the offering of lunch combo specials can't be beat. 25 entrees with a side of rice, an eggroll and 2 crab puffs, most combos costing $5.95.

One of my favorite dishes is the Pork Chop Suey (not Suey made with Pork Chops, but Chop Suey made with Pork). The veggies are fresh and plentiful and make for great leftovers later in my shift or the next day.

I came very close to actually going into Siu Wok once, but it was Sunday and they were closed. Now I know...
