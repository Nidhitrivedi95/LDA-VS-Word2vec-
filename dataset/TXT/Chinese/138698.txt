QpOAv584eb-ecG4TLEm95g The food here is very good.  So far I have had the Broccoli Beef, and the Hot Garlic Chicken.  Both were very good, and the portions were enough to feed me twice.  Prices are also pretty good, with lunch specials around 6 bucks.  If you eat in, you get free soup as well.  Ive been here a few times now, and the food is always good, and always feeds me several times.  I could never eat the lunch special in one sitting.  Also, the prices are very cheap.  
Overall I am pretty happy with this place and will certainly be going again and again.
