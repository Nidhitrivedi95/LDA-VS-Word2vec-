However, we are 17 min 7.8 miles from door to door..Cashew chicken was garlic flavored, chicken tasted not fresh. Appetizer vegetable dumpling is bland filled with what tasted like greens of some sort? no taste. The order did not come with any sauces such as soy. Chicken and Shrimp TSO is ok, large chunks. Mongolian beef was fair. Smoothies were all good, but order was all mixed up.  We ordered online. No one calls u to confirm or informs u of any delays. It was snowing but not a blizzard.
