jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw Worst service ever! One word RUDE! This place use to be so good, busy, great customer service, not anymore. Went on a Sunday around 1pm and no wait (which I thought it was weird because from what I remember there's always a wait) there were only 5 other groups. Dim sum was horrible and cold and apparently they ran out of everything. Eveything was dirty; table cloths, plates, utensils, cups, everything had to be taken back for a new set. And if you needing anything no one other then your server could help u everyone else will ignore you. Horrible!!
