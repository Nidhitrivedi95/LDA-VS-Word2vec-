fHkiH52AATeRa8Fi2yStpQ I have gone to the same Chinese place since I was a small child so I was looking for something a little different just to try. My boyfriend and I had a coupon so we decided to give Golden Taipei a try. The decor in the restaurant definitely turned me off as well as the lack of traffic in and out. There were only two or three other groups of people eating at lunch time on a Saturday if that tells you anything. We ordered our food, I got sesame chicken. I could have gotten the same stuff at any food court in any mall. Overall, I was not impressed. I didn't feel like it was anything special.
