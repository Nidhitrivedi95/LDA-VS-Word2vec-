m9iqRUgclcsQs-z8c2FTeA I was less than impressed with how I was treated as far as booking an appointment here. I called in to ask the cost of a service and the girl who answered the phone was super friendly. She gave me all the info and offered to book me an appointment. I told her I had to check my schedule and would call back tomorrow and she told me, "That works, or you can use our easy on-line booking system!" I thanked her and did just that the next day... used the "easy on-line booking system!" 

When I showed up for my appointment, I checked in and sat down. I was called up to the desk 5 minutes later to be told that they had no one there to perform the service I had booked. She explained to me that their online system is "under construction" and it doesn't keep up with their in-house booking system. (I don't remember being told this OR seeing a note about it on the website?) She then rebooked me for the following day. 

I realized when i woke up the next day  that I had a conflict with my 6:15 PM appt and I called right at 9:00 AM when they opened to cancel. Before I was even asked when I would like to re-book it, I was told "you know, we could charge you a cancellation fee since it is less than 24 hours that you are cancelling your Brazilian wax appt." 

At this point, I sort of lost my cool and got a little snippy. I informed the girl that I had drove all the way to the office when they had no one there to perform my service the day before AND that it wasn't even FOR a Brazilian wax?!?! At that point she said she would make a note in my account and hung up with me, again, never asking when I would want to come in. Their loss I guess!!!
