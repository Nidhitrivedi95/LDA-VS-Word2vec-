15RvAvPxUBl3HmnGMJdtTQ I wish I would have found this place sooner! We ordered soups, salads, sushi, fried rice and lemon chicken! All were great! When you are seated they give you cucumbered in a very yummy dressing and the fried chips with cold duck sauce also very good! I have ate food from here 3 times in 10 days!! Also they dont deliver where I live but they do you meet you somewhere which I thought was great :)
