TtBNeqXSRh37VD-pW_VbAw South China Noodles Delight for sure serves a delightful bowl of noodles! 

When I entered the restaurant, I was immediately hit by the aroma of meat broth... it smelled so strong, so rich and herbally spicy. This is always a good sign.. that the broth is going to be awesome! 

Oxtail Vermicelli in Soup ($7.50/big) 
- That oxtail is so tender... and flavoured... it must have been slow cooked for hours in a soy/spices based broth in order to achieve that level of tenderness 
- The garnishes: preserved sour veggie, coriander and green onion gave extra depth and excitement to the taste buds 
- Broth is really flavoured... with a hint of herb and peppery taste... no chili oil needed to enhanced that 

Size wise it is filling and good value since it is really time consuming for anyone trying to attempt to duplicate the same bowl of goodness at home!
