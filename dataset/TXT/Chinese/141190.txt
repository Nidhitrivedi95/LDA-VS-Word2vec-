rdifwelsxkuUf-tw2O4o1g I wouldn't display those "new management" banners so proudly Mr. Chop Chop; your quality and service have dropped off a cliff. I kind of feel bad leaving a two star review for a small 'mom n pop' restaurant like this but people need to warned! (I'm also being generous with the two stars also).

The food is here is a mix of Thai and Chinese, plenty of selection but most of it is just mediocre. I ordered the chili mint chicken and I guess the cook forgot to add in the chicken as it was about 70% onions and peppers. My friend's yellow curry was watery and lacking in flavor. My Thai iced tea seemed to have been watered down as well. Service was slow and it took nearly thirty minutes to get our order out despite being the only ones in the restaurant. 

Please bring back the OG Mr. Chop Chop!
