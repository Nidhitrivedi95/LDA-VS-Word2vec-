tIE_8gjZ5aR-JW-qEGbdJQ I like this place because you can sit down, in addition to selling buns they also have full meal options and bubble tea. I have only tried the baked goods which were all good with the exception of the mini egg tart that had almost no custard. 
They offer some choices that you cannot find at Harmony and their fried curry buns are absolutely lovely. They open very early but since they don't have a great turnover it's best to go early for higher quality. Their moon cakes are especially good and not over expensive and the service is the best that I have experienced on this street. 
Something else that I really like is that they sometimes put some of the sweet buns on the warm section at the back which makes them extra yummy so keep an eye out for that.
