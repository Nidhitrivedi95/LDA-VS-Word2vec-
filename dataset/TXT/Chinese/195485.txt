zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ Stop by this place to get some take out PHO.  It was delicious. U have never had bad Pho.   Everything was separated for the trip home.  We were able to have the same experience with creating our own style.  There were plenty of toppings.  It did take a little long to get our take out.  People were getting their food before us and they came after us.
