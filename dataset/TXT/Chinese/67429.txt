emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw After having more time to process, I have decided that I won't come back, even for take out lunch. I'd rather have Panda or Pei Wei. A chain where I know what to expect.

I ordered online again and they had to call me because the online order form does not have the options that they claim. The lunch special online says that you get tea, crab puff or egg roll, soup or salad and the entree. They said they were not able to include the tea and when I got there, he said as a courtesy, they included the soup and it doesn't normally come with take out and to order the a la carte entree because it comes with more. 

I would argue that it definitely doesn't come with more to do it a la carte. I mean, you get more of the entree, but not everything that it claimed online.

That being said, I will continue on and say even if you're concerned about more or less, it's not that great anyway.  The kung pao had some bell peppers, water chestnuts, peanuts, mushrooms and chicken. The sauce was runny and not spicy.

The crab puff is not a puff, it's a folded over wonton wrapper filled with cream cheese.

The soup was not hot or sour, wreaked of white pepper and tasted like nothing. Didn't really end up eating my courtesy soup after all.

Overall, just not really worth it. You pay a little more than a chain with really nothing to show for it.

I didn't eat inside obviously, but there is not even an ambiance to make up for it. It looks like it is falling apart. There is an automated slider when you walk in that sounds like it is going to collapse, a dirty fish tank, and a dilapidated bar and ball room off to the right. As I waited for my food, I looked at the reviews on the wall, all from about 97-98. When I see this, it usually indicates the place has seen better days, which it probably has.

If you've read my review, I commend you and suggest you spare yourself what I have experienced myself.
