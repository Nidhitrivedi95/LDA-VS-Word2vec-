R8Mw0iFenJ3nwXuZb7Ql4A Love that this place is open later than a lot of the dessert places in the area. They have a very very long menu which is kind of confusing but I appreciate the variety. They offer almost every type of Chinese desserts, some of which sound very intimidating. 

When you walk in you're immediately greeted with the strong smell of Chinese bitter tea, but you get used to it within minutes and don't notice it much anymore. 

I've been here 3-4 times and have always gone for the fruity mango and sago desserts. Their sago is really delicious and depending on what toppings you want is around the $5 range. I also really enjoyed their mango pudding. I found it a little softer and creamier than some other places. 

I find that both the presentation and taste is a lot better than some of the newer dessert shops that also serve sago and other Chinese desserts. It's also a little bit cheaper!

Note: they also have a small section of their menu for salty foods (noodles, rice, etc.) if you're not craving sweet stuff!
