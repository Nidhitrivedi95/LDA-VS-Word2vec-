tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg Soup dumplings  have arrived in Cleveland! While they don't quite compare to those I've had in NYC's Chinatown, these soup dumplings are pretty freaking good. For $5 you get 6, smaller, but still good sized dumplings!

Note: The entrance is off superior past No. 1 Pho.

I'll definitely be back to try more from the menu!
