jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw If you need to get your fix of chinese food in vegas...this is the place to come!  The best part about it is that it is open past 3am!  The worse part was that our food took over 30 minutes to come!

I highly recommend getting the Singapore style vermicelli noodles.  Sooooooooooo gooood!
