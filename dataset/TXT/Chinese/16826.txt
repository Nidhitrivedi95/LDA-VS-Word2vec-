4gtPPwx8fBWJ9FGtQqQA0Q Drove by along this stretch of neighbourhood that has nothing whatsoever, so when I saw a plaza with some signs of LIFE I took a U-turn and drove towards the light.  I didn't know what to expect from afar but the closer I got the more I saw the Chinese Lettering.  Just my LUCK to find a discovery and it happens to be spicy Szechuan rather than Cake/Pie.

The Lettering wasn't completely indicative of it being Szechuan but the English Business Name was worst, NEW GREATIME CORP.  I wonder if they took a prior Massage Parlour's Business Name for their own.  Walking inside is the first sign that it is definitely Szechuan Chinese while the Menu had a Logo of a Dragon with "HOT" written in the middle.

Szechaun Dan Dan Noodle($5.99) had barely any Minced Pork but was completely covered in Spicy Sauce known in typical Szechuan Dan Dan.  The Noodles are Grocery variety nothing to note.  Spicy like eating Spicy Chili Oil with a side of Noodles.

Steam Soup Dumplings($4.99) Xiao Long Bao was average with the stuffing and soup however the Dough Wrap is what makes it average rather than great.  I even tasted the Gelatin Soup that didn't completely dissolved yet.

Whole Fish in Chili Oil ($19.99) is more than your Typical Fish in Chili Oil because this one is with a Whole Fish cut with Bones attached.  Head & Tail makes it a 'COMPLETE" meal.  The regular version which they also have is with Fish Filets that makes it easier to consume but it could be of the Frozen variety.  It's A-OK if you can handle those TINY Fish Bones.

I do like that their Menu was mostly Photos so that my Dinner Friend can say "No to this and No to that".  There's still a lot of other interesting items on the Menu.  Hope that others will have a better experience with other items than we do.    :D
