BNeS_hZfmdQWsqewj-LuDA We are from out of town.  In Pittsburgh for work.  From the good reviews, we expected at least a number 4 experience.   Not!  Just blah.  Asked for spicy - nope, didn't get it.  Dumplings were cold in the center.  Then on top of that, no toilet paper in the bathroom..  So here I am with pants at my ankles, duck walking across the floor for the something to wipe my arse...
