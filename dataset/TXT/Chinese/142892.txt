rLyGCFULUSbLCt8J3U0_kA The Peking Duck dish is a must try, not only for the duck but also for the wraps. The peking dough wrap was probably one of my highlights. If you like delicate wraps that are almost as thin as a peel off face mask, this is the place to be.

The peking duck platter comes with a decent portion of duck meat, with some crispy skin and broken up shrimp chips in the middle. The wraps are served fresh and warm in bamboo steam containers. I found that since they are less floury and thick, it can be hard to peel and separate when stacked together. But once you get the peeling going and have that wrap ready, it does taste so good. One down side is that the peking duck did not come with scallions and cucumbers. But none the less, the hoisin sauce combined with the nicely roasted duck and delicate wraps tasted great.
