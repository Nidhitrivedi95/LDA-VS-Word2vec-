w3RH9W99ZIKvw0Qgibdn4w Worst oriental food I've had.
Expensive too.
Only one oriental looking guy working there. 
The veggie noodles I got were not good. Hardly no veggies in it. Noodles were very thick and had a weird bland taste. I had to soak it with soy sauce just so I could eat it.
My hubby asked for a side of white rice and they wanted 6.99 for it. So hubby declined.
Soup was good.
