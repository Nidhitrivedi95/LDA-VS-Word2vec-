zPcF4fI18gSp42G17oHmmg If you're pregnant, stay away from this place.  Seriously, I'm just waiting for my husband and brother in law to start puking with food poisoning.  Even their lemonade is disgusting.  I got a plate with some 'fried rice' and a fried vegetable roll, and was so turned off by the wierd pale yellow color of the rice I couldnt even eat it.
