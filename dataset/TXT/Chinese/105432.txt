Kw06PxDkF8gNMVWntmBKTw I work at a car dealership, even my managers (white/brown), they love the big SHRIMP BALLS aka WONTON from this place. Their food quality is always the same (generally because they are fairly easy to make)  If you like Chinese food/soup, go to this place, you won't regret. They have the best wonton in Toronto I would say.  They only take cash tho.
