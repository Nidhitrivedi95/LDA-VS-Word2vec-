BHX0ghpo_r4lVxGRPEBIQw First time at this restaurant recommended by my friend. Shanghai food is one of my favourites and this place actually serves it well! I liked it a lot especially its dumplings (which they are famous for).

This is a small restaurant yet very authentic looking in the inside. Not many tables but good enough to accomodate. Service was good, nothing too much to comment - just remember to bring cash or debit only for the bill.

I had a chance to taste their steamed lamb dumplings, fried fennel and pork dumplings, typical soup buns (xiao long bao), and a plate of glass noodles with minced pork.

Both types of dumplings were delicious. Some people may not like the taste of lamb in general, but if you do it's a good choice. The fennel dumplings were very interesting, it gave it a dill pickle-like flavour. I loved it and recommend this too. As for the dumpling and bun outer layer, it wasn't too thick and was made well.

The noodles reminded me of korean chap chae but more saucy. Overall, it's a great Shanghai restaurant in the Scarborough hood if you want some place different than the chains.
