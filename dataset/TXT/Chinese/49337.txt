CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Good, albeit pricey option at the Bellagio for an Asian cuisine fix. Ordered the Szechuan Dan Dan noodles and is recommended. Tasty yet you don't walk away feeling stuffed or bloated after eating them. However, also ordered the wonton noodle soup. They provide good number of shrimp wontons but broth was bland and served in a small soup bowl. Noodles in the soup were more than adequate however they tried to pack the noodles with the wontons in a small bowl, with little to no soup that the noodles get swollen if you don't eat the dish quickly. Also ordered Garlic sautéed pea shoots were average. But this side dish can complement an entree for 3-4 ppl. Vegetable dumplings were ok. Service is good.
