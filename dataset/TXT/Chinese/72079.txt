FEWTPBUv-QiugBe-2uXD4A Talk about freshly made food!

Upon ordering, food is made according to your liking. As a picky eater who passes up on a few ingredients this is a PLUS!

Chopstix has become my go to place for Chinese food. The restaurant is friendly, clean and offers a number of amazing dishes. Luncheon specials start at $6.25 and dinner combinations at $7.25. My favorite is cashew chicken and wonton soup- adding some Sriracha gives it that extra oomph to spice it up a bit! 

This is not your next fast food joint that makes food in advance and keeps it warm under a heat lamp. - Try it out!
