8keN8Z2sylAEXgMCJMQpDg Overall disappointed at the experience:

Pros:
- young owner tries hard at winning new business
- decor of restaurant is clean...and you can sense that hard work is being put in place to make the restaurant succeed

Cons:
- i got the sense that old ingredients were being "recycled" versus using fresh ingredients everyday....for the sake of profits.  I ordered walnut shrimps.....and you can definitely tell the shrimps were recycled from several days ago
- owner needs to recognize that shortcuts for the sake of profits will win him profits in the short run.....but will be detrimental for his reputation and growth for long term.....because guess what.....i will be telling many of my friends about the experience
- overall the cost for this takeout experience is above average....it's even more expensive than similar takeout from east coast......my advice is use fresh ingredients.....treat your customers honestly......reduce your costs and pass on to your customers (versus 10% coupons on already inflated prices).....customers are not dumb.......strive for long term growth and honest business practices...and demand the same from your employees
