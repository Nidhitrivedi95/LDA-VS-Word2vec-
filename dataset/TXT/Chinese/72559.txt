fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA Fresh dumplings made right in front of you. 15 steamed dumplings for $7.99 or pan fried dumplings (I think there are 12 in one order) 
I had pork/cabbage and pork/chives. Both are delish. However the wrapper is way too doughy and thick. I would prefer it to be thinner.
Wonton soup was very ok for $4.99 comes with broth, mushroom and bamboo. Broth was decent but disappointed with the wonton itself. Again skin was too thick and not enough filling. Also the filling was pork (was expecting shrimps since it's wonton). I would prefer they charge more and put more filling in it. 

This is a good place for a quick bite. It gets quite busy during dinner and lunch rush. Not a place to mingle with friends. One thing to keep in mind for hot summer days, they don't have AC. We were sweating
