Would I go back? Yup, maybe.
Food: 
Lamb bun. Juicy, bursting with umami goodness. The bun was the whitest unblemished thing I've ever seen, and the pretty factor and flavor have me rating it 10/10.
Chicken Tan Tan Ramen: I eat ramen when I have the flu. So I'm biased. It wasn't flavorful, and mince chicken killed it for me. Plus I hate eggs and didn't ask for the soft boiled one to be removed from my bowl, leaving me nauseous from the experience.
Coffee panna cotta: I'd go back just for this( and I did, except they weren't selling the dessert other than as part of summerlicious) . It was just perfect. Milk panna cotta layered on coffee panna cotta- silky, smooth, caffeinated :)
