wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw Shrimp wonton egg noodle soup was really good! The soup is rich in a seafoody way (reminds me of Japanese ramen), and the thin noodles are chewy. Not fancy descriptions, but it was delicious!

Schezwan double baked pork was also very good. A spicy dish. Comes w/ as many dried peppers as the meats themselves, but it's not THAT spicy if you don't eat the peppers. But the pork! Their textures are chewy and at times even crunchy. The sauce is tasty. It'd be a really good entree to order for a group, but I wouldn't recommend only eating Schezwan double baked pork by itself as a meal, since it's spicy and one-dimensional; you get kind of sick of eating it half way through; though this may be true for all the Chinese meat entree...

And I'd follow the advice from the fellow yelpers on picking an appetizer and an entree for two people.
