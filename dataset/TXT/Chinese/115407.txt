n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A Back today celebrating our anniversary weekend. This place is fabulous. 

David and Charles are outstanding. Ceasars Palace and Mr Chow are very fortunate to have such outstanding employees. 

We again had the pre fix menu. The choices are tremendous and whatever you choose you will not be disappointed. 

Mr Chow gave us a delicious coconut cake for our anniversary. What a nice way to finish a delicious meal. 

The food and service were impeccable.

Highly recommend
