First day we attempted Rol San, the line up was out the door and along the street. Wasn't about to wait that long. Not even for the most badass of Har Gow. We returned later in the week and had the a la cart dim sum. It was good. Somewhere in the top 10 of my favourite dim sum places in the GTA but nothing extraordinary. The food is sweeter than your average chinese fare. The hot and sour soup in particular was a disappointment. I'd go back if I were in the area but I still wouldn't do the insane wait.
