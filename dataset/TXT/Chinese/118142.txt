NKYirjjTpzezUi4Rhj64bA Service: Quick!

Decor:  Clean decor.  They have a cleaning schedule in the bathrooms.  That shows effort.  

Food:  Good.

Review:  Good for a place to just run in and run out.  The food is good, but some say it is not as flavorful as other Phos that they have had.  Personally, I like it.

Reason for stars:  The service is good, the food is good to me, but it gets 4 stars because other members of my party say that the Pho is less flavorful than other places.  It is not the "cleanest" viet restaurant that I have been to, but it is definitely up there on the list and maybe even the cleanest in the area.
