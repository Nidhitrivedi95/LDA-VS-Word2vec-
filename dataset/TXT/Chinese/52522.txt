CIFjkjllhTPGyx9eWBwJGQ Parking is a bit hard to find, but if you're here for take-out or walk-in than it'll be perfect. I prefer the garlic explosion noodles as I like garlic in general. For the price of $8.00 large I find it was quite filling for me. As others have mentioned its best to eat it right away as the noodles are dry like "lo mein".
