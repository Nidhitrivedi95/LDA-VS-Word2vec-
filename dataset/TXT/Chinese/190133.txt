YjlCXwWr9xx6TnHmTFCKGQ I have always heard that this place was over priced mediocre Chinese food so the wife and I gave them a try since everyone's taste is different. I can honestly now say that P.F.Chang's is not over price mediocre food but over priced sub-par Chinese food. The Mongolian beef tasted like it was beef flavored salt, we tried the wonton and egg drop soup and both was not very tasty at all. The lo main I ordered was so drown in soy you could not taste anything else. The only good thing was the dessert wontons and the egg rolls, both of those were ok.
