EjYGxyksao-Jhw86tIAiYQ My aunt and uncle are regular customers here.  They treated me, my 3 year old daughter, my sister and her family of 4 to dinner last month.  The noodles are great, but so are some of the non-noodle dishes, espcially the duck and the salt and pepper fish - DIVINE.

It's definitely family- and kid-friendly.  Too bad I live in LA - I'd be addicted to this place.  But I'll be back!
