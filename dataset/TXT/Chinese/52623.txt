Cjs6QghR-nIninfgAoErvw Moved into the neighbourhood about a year ago and only got around to eating here recently. Now I've eaten there at least 5 times.  I go for the pretty white-washed selections, but all of those have been solid. A dinner for two, with some substitutions from chicken balls / wings to other cool stuff like Beef+Brocolli or Crispy Ginger Beef, usually lasts about 3 meals for two average people. I've had the schezuan noodles and just chinese brocolli in oyster sauce, haven't been disappointed with either. Slowly working my way through the menu, 1 new dish at a time. I haven't made the rounds on Spadina, but I like it just as much as the restaurants in Chinatown. I'd like to try Dim Sum here.. it's also on the todo list. The place is never busy and the interior is spotless. Just get it.
