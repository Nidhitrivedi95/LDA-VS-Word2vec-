JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA Hits the spot when you are craving authentic Taiwanese food. They are randomly closed often since they make meals for conventions and tours in the area. That's why they are so good! Real Taiwanese people approved! 
They have all the traditional Taiwanese breakfast dishes such as salty soy milk, Chinese donut (you tiao), fan tuan. 

Their pai gu fan (pork chop rice) looks popular..I got the chicken rice instead and it was yummy! 
They have mandarin television blasting in the background... felt very very very authentic.
