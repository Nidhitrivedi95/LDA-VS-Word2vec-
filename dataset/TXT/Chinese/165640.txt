V2WLiBR3iGaegRAVNjOndA A guilty pleasure of mine whenever I leave the NYC area.
Has the lo mein/rice, angus steak, and the new chicken option. Food was a little saltier compared to most locations. They didn't have Orange Chicken at the time I went which was a bit disappointing. Other wise, it was ok.
