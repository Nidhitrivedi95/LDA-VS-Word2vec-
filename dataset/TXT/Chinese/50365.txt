cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ Had the best meal here we've had in ages! Everything we ordered just tasted delicious! And we all are picky people to please.

Ordered: 

Chicken satay - delicious peanut sauce to dip in!!

Thai iced tea - always tasty

Chicken basil fried rice - awesome! Highly recommend. 

Panang beef curry - very tasty and flavorful. Creamy and compliments the white rice well.

Pad kee mao with chicken - like drunken noodles - great flavor

Orange chicken - I got this bc I loveeee sesame chicken and this is the closest Thai version of that. It was realllly good. 

I'm well versed in spicy dishes as a desi and the waitress, super friendly and nice staff btw, gave us a spice scale of 1-5. We picked 3 for everything and found it spicier than we anticipated so might go for a 2 next time. 

Overall, will definitely be going again! Great staff, fast service, awesome food. 2 thumbs up.
