WF0I9AwErfaqkPPXM98ywQ Been a couple times now, really like the whole set-up. Would be a nice place to hang out and just relax. 

A nice open concept, with lots of windows getting great natural light makes this place very pleasing to the eyes. At the same time, the decor is very modern yet bright. A nice contrast to other bakeries you would go to. 

I had heard that the steamed rice meals were very inexpensive here. Although it was more than what I had heard, $6 for the meal and a drink its quite a steal in this area. However, if you are hungry, I don't recommend it. I tried the Red Curry Chicken, and it was quite good. Not all that spicy, but nice depth of flavour. The Hong Kong Style Tea here is really good though. One of the best I think. 

Just a nice place to sit in for a quick, inexpensive meal. Definitely worth a visit if you're close by!
