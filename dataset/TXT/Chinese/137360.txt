qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA it's one of my favourite restaurant know I come 
All the time and it the best experience like service was fast the food come fast and it taste amazing and fresh and it's the best service ever and all the stuff where super nice and when you come in you wait 2 mins to get a table or if you planning a party you call and book and to order you use iPad touch and that's cool and the place is clean but they need to check the washroom because sometimes it's not clean like no soap and it's always all you can eat so tea and water including but other drinks you have to pay extra! Recommend this place . 20/20
