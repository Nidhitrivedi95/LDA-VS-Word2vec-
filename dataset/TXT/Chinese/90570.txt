IHt79wxZHkD7QSzlDRDivw Great tasting food at very reasonable prices. Got a 3 item combo (roast pork, bbq pork & duck leg) on rice, with a side of soup for $8. There was more than enough food for one person. 

Everything was really tasty. In particular, the duck leg was really juicy. The bbq pork was different to other places I've tried, but I still enjoyed it. And as others have mentioned, the roast pork is highly recommended. 

Great option for take out bbq
