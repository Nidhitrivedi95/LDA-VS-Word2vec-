OaHJvi10dJbMIaQXg5e2Ag Coming from a place where there are a million and one options for Vietnamese or Chinese food I could be considered a bit of a snob.. I do my best not to get my hopes up for such cuisine in Ohio with limited competition, but this place had some good reviews so ya know... Unfortunately, that has no indication on the quality of food.. pho had measly pieces of flank. Order "$1" worth of tendon... got what would be considered the leftover scraps of tendon at any other place I consider a "Vietnamese restaurant". Beef broccoli was.... disgusting. Meat had a weird sour aftertaste... shall I expect food poisoning??
Any flavor probs came from overwhelming amounts of msg.. so sad, so sad.
Wish I could rate the staff separately... the server was very attentive and sweet... no fault of hers that the food tastes like ssshhhhhhhh
