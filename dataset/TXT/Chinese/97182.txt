JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw My daughter and I tried the shang beef noodle soup with their hand pulled noodles along with their pork and cabbage dumplings for dinner tonight.  It was amazing!  I don't usually go out of my way to eat gluten, but this one was worth the hit!  They make the noodles fresh... not from yesterday, but you're served noodles that are made right in front of your eyes (esp. if you sit at the bar which we did).  It was enough to share with my 4 year old.  The soup didn't taste like it was full of MSG. Bonus!

The potstickers came when we were finishing up the noodles.  It was a little backwards but I still loved how they tasted fresh.  They make the dumplings fresh there along with the skin.  It's amazing and unusual in presentation.  The skin's a little thicker than other places, because they roll the skin there.

The service itself was friendly and prompt for a relatively busy Fri night.  I LOVED the spa water.  Ours tasted like cucumber.  I think one Yelper complaining about the water couldn't tell that it's actually cucumber and not watermelon skin (yuck and who would do that?).  I wanted more water, but I was too full to drink any more water.

If I'm in the mood for hand-pulled noodles in Vegas, I'm coming back.
