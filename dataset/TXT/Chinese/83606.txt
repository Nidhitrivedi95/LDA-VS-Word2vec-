hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA Good variety, flavor is always spot on and we usually enjoy it.  The place is always busy and we sometimes have to wait, but not long.  

They offer two types of soup, have a fresh sushi bar with quite a few selections. They offer a salad bar and the usual jello, pudding, cookie and soft serve ice cream.  My favorite chicken dish is spicy with slices of jalapeno and the shrimp with mayo and walnuts is very good.  I also love the crab rangoons.  

The service is great, the food good, the best Chinese food in a buffet, probably not, but it's a good alternative.
