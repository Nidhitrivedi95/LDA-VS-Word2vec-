Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Very disappointing even with the $20 coupon for being a Luxor guest. "Spicy" string beans were extremely bland. Waitress was surprised when I wanted a better implement than a kitchen knife for applying the plum sauce to my Peking Duck. Not sure where in China (or the U.S. for that matter) they would not use a small spoon for this but according to the waitress a knife is the proper implement. Even the white rice was poorly prepared. There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
