qVVTWSAEijA_D-MI3UNpxQ I would say this is an Asian fast food joint, the food here is cheap and prepared quickly. 
The service is friendly and the portions are pretty big. Their chicken wings are pretty tasty too.
Don't expect this place to be over the top, stir fry come with too much sauce, but for the price you pay it's a good value.
