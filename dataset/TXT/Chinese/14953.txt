3l_rMuRs97IKEA1DCZokOA I discovered this place accidentally while searching for a place to find sushi and was very pleasantly surprised. 

Nestled away in a beautiful plaza off of Dundas it was the only place open after 9pm so we headed inside to find a small yet spacious restaurant with some pretty interesting artwork adorning the walls. 
We were promptly greeted and sat at a rather large booth offering a lot of space with black tea that was unlike many I've had before at Chinese restaurants. 
I found the menu refreshing because they were easy to read, seemed fairly new, in good condition and had pictures.... Glorious pictures that made ordering a little easier and the experience all the more appetizing. 

We ended up ordering wonton soup for 2-4 people and it was a generous portion I will say and extremely delicious.... The wontons were filled with shrimp and this pepper like spice that really made it stand out from other wonton soups I've tried.  We stuck with an old standby that never fails, Cantonese Chow Mein with crispy noodles and it was fantastic as well as the spicy chicken sizzling plate which had just the perfect amount of heat to compliment the tender chicken. 

To top it off it wasn't even expensive, quite affordable in fact coming in under $40 after tax so I most certainly will be venturing back to likely try their hot and sour soup next time
