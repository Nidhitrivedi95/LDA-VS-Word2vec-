H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag Just picked up a little Mongolian beef and Lo Mein dinner special (not on dinner menu but paying a little extra will get you special order). I just want to say that this totally hit the spot. Just ridiculous. The beef is super tender and full of flavor. I knew I had a craving for a reason. Thank you so much!!

Also, I want to note that this is my "Go-To" spot for a quick and delicious meal. The owners offer a $4.95 lunch special that includes an entrée, a side (fried rice) and an egg drop soup (dine-in only), I believe. The all day $6.95 special offers an entrée, a side (fried rice and lo mein combo I believe), one spring roll, one fried shrimp, cream cheese rangoon, a baggies of fried wontons and a soup (dine-in only). It is a massive amount of tasty food for a low price. I come here quite often and have gotten to know the owner very well, she is my favorite person Ever and for a buck or so more, she will customize my all day special with lo mein instead of rice and two spring rolls instead of all the other fried stuff. 

I love supporting this business and while it is not a fancy or a big place by any means, I feel more welcomed and appreciated here than at any other food joint I've ever been to in Vegas (and I've eaten this entire city many-a times over). I'm always engaged in a conversation and humor, which is definitely not a normal occurrence in Asian or ethnic food joint. 

PLEASE support these wonderful people, stop by and enjoy their awesome specials as well as rest of the menu!!
