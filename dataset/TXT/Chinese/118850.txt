So we entered the restaurant and got seated and the waitress arrived with our menus a while later. When I ordered soup I asked if she would be able to divide it into two bowls (which if you're a connoisseur of Chinese restaurants, you'd know this is a benign request). She proceeds to brusquely tell me that that isn't possible but that she can give me an extra bowl-- which is exactly what I requested, one soup in two bowls. I was really turned off by their service which is subpar at best. Won't be returning here because I really don't appreciate rude customer service personnel. I've worked in customer service and I've had to deal with various kinds of people, so I don't really understand why my request warranted a rude response.
