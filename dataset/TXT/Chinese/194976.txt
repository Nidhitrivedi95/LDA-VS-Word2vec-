zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Hubby and wifey tried out the noodle bar for an impromptu dinner downtown.

Absolutely loved the BBQ pork bun appetizer. Meat was juicy, tender, and so flavourful. Wifey had the pork ramen, it was just average. Hubby loved the chicken ramen, which the wifey loved more than the pork ramen. It had crispy chicken bits, which added more flavour to the soup.

Service was quick and efficient.

Checked out the Milk bar, both preferred the Corn cookie over the Crack Pie.

Went here for Winterlicious 2016 and must say that I noticed how the portions were definitely non-winterlicious portions. Was full to bursting after the 3-course meal. Would love to come again for Summerlicious to check out their menu.
