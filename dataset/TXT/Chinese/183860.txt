xSplhd6mlpQzbjUAq3rP6w They have no idea what they doing.   I order the highly recommended item duck fry rice.    When I get there to pick up.   They give me the pho special.   Claim the menu change since this is new owner.   What the hell. How do u take my order on the item u don't actually do.   How in the world a Chinese menu become a Vietnamese item.
