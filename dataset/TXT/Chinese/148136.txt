sePTDv1dGHPID7kwuNzXaA The best and most affordable place to get congee, rice rolls (cheung fun), and fried dough! 

I like to get their pork liver congee as I find that they make the organ itself very easy to consume/tender and it seems fresh. I know...pork liver sounds bleh (and I HATE pork liver) but for some reason it pairs so well with the congee. And, of course, I dip fried dough sticks in the congee which are always perfectly crunchy, doughy, and freshly fried!

My favourite dish of all from here is their rice rolls which (the only word to describe it) is SILK. They are soooo smooth and the peanut/hoisin/sriracha sauce combo goes so well with it that you won't even realize you have consumed an entire plate all by yourself! I would come here for the rice rolls alone. 

I think we ordered 2 fried dough sticks, 3 congee, 4 plates of rice rolls, sweet cruller (my favourite because I love sweet "bread"), sesame seed ball, and fried dough wrapped in rice rolls and it cost us  less than $40. They have been very consistent with the quality of their food, and with their cheap prices I'll be coming back forever!
