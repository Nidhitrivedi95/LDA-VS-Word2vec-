nFktMPlUZh06-dGTg4HdPw I came here as I was craving spicy chinese food for lunch. The lunch price that many have reported is no longer correct- lunch special is now $8.99 + $1 for springroll. I don't think the price is that great for what it is. I ordered General Tso's Chicken - it basically tasted the same as some food court places such as Manchu Wok. There was also not a lot of chicken but a lot of onions and peppers. It came with a salad. I think next time I will walk north of Sheppard for spicy Chinese places.
