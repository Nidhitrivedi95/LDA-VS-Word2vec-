I have almost no memory of Hakkasan not because of what I drank earlier. It could have been big. It could have been small. There may have been seats somewhere. Where was the bar again? What did the bathroom look like? There was just so many people packed on people that I couldn't tell what or where anything in the club was. 

Based off of pictures that my bachelorettes took, the lights looked incredible. 

The drinks were outrageously expensive. It is Vegas but two soda vodkas and two water bottles added up to $66. I guess that's the true price of free entry for girls. 

Two rooms played different music. I wish I knew that. I missed the first 5-10 minutes of Porter's set until one of my girls suggested "He might be playing upstairs."

I like clubs but I don't like feeling like a sardine in a can. I guess you can't have both.
