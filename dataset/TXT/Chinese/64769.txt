E9aC5bLfXdQVZ5csvLuLJg Ordered the House Chicken today like I have for the past 4 years - and it was very dry, chewy, and over cooked. Obviously it had been sitting in the pot for a long time. I complained nicely to the server and she got on the phone with the owner then came back and told me that they will "make me another dish but will not refund my lunch. It's not our fault". I looked at her and said "Then is it my fault?" She says "i know what the chicken tastes like, but we're not refunding you". I told her I'm not hungry anymore. So I just paid for my dish and left. Like I said I've been going there for years cause I love their food. They lost my business forever now.
