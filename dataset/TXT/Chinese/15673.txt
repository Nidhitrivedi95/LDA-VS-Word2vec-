3qrfY-XCUKVyrO5T6GskqA My favorite hole in the wall place in Oakland was closed for the holidays, and since I was hankering for asian food with not a lot of time on my hands, I chose Noodles & Company.

It was a Thursday night around 6 and the place was busy.  It's not a huge place to begin with (seats maybe 35?), you're all kind of close in, so no privacy.  It didn't bother me, but it did noticeably bother two girls that sat adjacent to me.

The thing that did bother me was the noise.  With all of the hard wall/floor/ceiling surfaces, but we're all kind of packed in a small area, plus everyone's talking, the tipping point on the noise was the piped in music.  It was Loud with a capital L.  Was this a nightclub or a casual restaurant?

Since I was there by myself it wasn't a deal breaker, but I would have had trouble carrying on a conversation with a mealmate.

The service at the counter was pleasant and efficient and it took very little time to get my food; I ordered the bankok curry noodle dish (regular) vegetarian style.

The Japanese-style soda machine is kind of cool.  I chose Diet Raspberry Diet Coke.  In a word:  don't.  Raspberry goes well with Sprite and iced tea, but Diet Coke?  Not so much.

Noodles & Company is a healthful alternative to fast food.  It you keep your dish as is without adding meat/tofu, with a drink it's about $7.50.  If you have a more hearty appetite, you'd do better at Chipotle or Qdoba, or if you're hankering Asian food, nearby non-chain Spice Island.

Final verdict:  does in a pinch, when I'm not starving, but not a restaurant I'd actively seek out to eat.
