adI5BlJCtvWq2uAwmyndXA This visited was for someone's birthday and it was my first time, so double cause for celebration. 

We ordered the buffet menu for over 12 people. I think the waiters did a fine job getting all the dishes out one after the other.

The Sauvignon blanc was nice. So pretty pleased the have a good wine. 

Fell in love with the dumplings, fried or boiled - they are all delicious! The crispy squid was tasty too. 

Quite chuffed at myself for using the chop sticks that were on hand instead of asking for cutlery, I almost got the hang of it. 

I think I will be back to get more dumplings very soon!
