So when you go in and find some of the lights out because they are saving electricity, just sit down and get over it.  Putting your initial impressions on the back burner for a moment will be greatly rewarded.

Make sure you start off with one of the soups.  They are amazing and fresh.  I guarantee you will not have had anything like it.  I also recommend the Green Curry.   The daughter had chicken lemongrass something or other.  it too was really good.  But I am a Green Curry guy and this was way, way over the top good.

This is worth traveling a good 15 - 20 miles for.  Or further if you really crave the good stuff.

They have a full bar and it is great for larger groups.  The hostess is awesome.
