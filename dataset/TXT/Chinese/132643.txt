ppXIA5UKdFV8sLWQLf-zUQ I'll admit from the get go, I understand  Chinese buffets are not where one would go for gourmet chinese but this place wasn't even really GOOD.

The selection was seemingly okay, hardly any vegetable or vegetarian options (actually outside of desserts, green beans and some fruit I don't think there was any).  They advertised sushi(which I rarely venture beyond a California roll at most buffets) but the closest thing to sushi was cooked mussels on a half shell  or shrimp on ice.

All in all as far as food goes it wasn't even in the realm of "good".  My husband had some Orange Chicken and claimed it was bland and nothing orange about it.  Most of the meat was fatty and blah flavored.  I was okay with the food at first b/c they had green beans, I could eat plates full of green beans normally.  These were wrinkled and withered looking but I marched on...truly wish I hadn't!  They were more like bark covered twigs pretending to be green beans!

For the good: they seated us promptly, got us drinks and made sure they were full the whole time, place seemed clean enough.  Although I can't attest for the bathrooms since we never used them.
