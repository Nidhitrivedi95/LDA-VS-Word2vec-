MhnihE0alud0ereVInSt8Q Ok. This is my FIRST time using yelp!!! That's how HORRIBLE this place is. Also, my first & definitely my last visit here as well. I ordered the chicken lo mein for lunch, there was about 2oz of chicken, and 1oz of it was just gross fat, I almost puked when I started chewing, and quickly spit it out.... absolutely disgusting!  I ask the guy, where is the chicken? It's pretty much cabbage & noodles, and the entire entree was tasteless,  he said because I ordered lunch & there are different levels of entreees? Huh????? I wasn't expecting a pound of chicken, but literally 5 tiny pieces and a big chunk of fat! Yukkk.......the place had abs no air..it's az it's 100 degrees...dusty dirty fan was overhead, counters not tidy? Just all around gross! Save yourself the money.....and go to panda express across the street, I did.....so, I baught myself 2 lunches. 1 to throw away 2nd one to enjoy! Oh and they forced me to give a star?  It's actually a zero star, if throw in the rude service
