wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA AMAZING!!
I come from LA, land of great japanese asian cuisine. So when i walked in here, i really wasnt expecting too much(even with the 4.5 star yelp review). After a long weekend of partying in vegas, asian food is my cure.
We ordered few appetizers, skewers, and few recommendations from the server and literally everything we ordered was over the top delicious. My personal favorite was the scallops! It was large, perfectly grilled and chewy. Japanese street corn, pork belly, garlic maguro, beef tongue.... was all good.
The ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and service was two thumbs up. Our server was patient, polite and helpful.
I highly recommend this restaurant for dates, family dinner or a group of friends. We had 5 of us and had a long table for ourselves in the middle.
