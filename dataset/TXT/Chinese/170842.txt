vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA food: they have most of the items at a dim sum place. with dim sum it's hard to describe. you just know when it's good and when it's not as good. this was the latter. ***2/5

service: they dont go full circles. i was waiting for a cart to come by and it keeps going the other way. as soon we get a cart, we ordered as much as we can. then when i dont need them, it keeps brushing by. the server couldnt be found after some time. ***2/5

value: prices arent too bad, but for what you get, it's not worth it. ok for first timers, but for those have a more experienced dim sum palette, this place is lacking. ***2/5
