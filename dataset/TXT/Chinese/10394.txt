In my three visits here, I have tried the beef ramen, beef curry, chicken wings, salt and pepper pork chops, garlic chinese broccoli, mango pudding and almond pudding.  All were pretty good with the stand outs being the chicken wings and the almond pudding.  The chicken wings were crispy without being breaded and nicely spicy since it is served with hot peppers.  The almond pudding takes me back to growing up in Hawaii.  

Overall, the decor and ambiance would normally get a deduction of a point from me, but the LOW prices get extra credit earning the star back.
