ioJYj9mFRprldQ3Yf2CLTA This is the kind of place that makes people think Chinese food is trash.

Their chicken is just breading dressed in sauce and their fried rice is soaked with soya sauce. I felt sick after the first bite and much sicker a few hours after I finished.

The service was awful too. I was ordered and got my food an hour before their closing time, but as I was about to sit down and eat they said I had to leave. When I mentioned that it was still an hour from closing, they said "fine, 2 minutes" so I got up and left.
