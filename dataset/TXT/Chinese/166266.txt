vbVJzKDhHlhMnKRpES5QzQ Think I'm kind of obsessed with this place. This is where I got hooked on mapo tofu (AKA the tofu for people who don't like tofu). 

You might have to wait outside for a half hour in 100 degree heat after putting your name on the list for dinner, but it's worth it. 

If you can go during the week during lunch chances are the wait will be far shorter and you'll get seated right away if it's just 2 or 4 people. 

The mapo tofu, wontons with chili oil (give them a good stir!) and toothpick lamb are my favorites but everything I've tried here is good. 

If you can, go with a small group and go family style to try a bunch of different dishes. 

Service was a bit more, uh, "traditional" and brusque in the past, which didn't bother me. If you're unfamiliar with Szechuan food (protip: it's mostly spicy) the waitstaff can answer questions, also if like me you want to branch out a bit. 

They're getting some great quality peppercorns! Really nailed that "heat and slight numbness" that's characteristic of good Szechuan.
