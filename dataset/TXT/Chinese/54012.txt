cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ Definitely one of the better buffets in the GTA. I don't normally visit buffets unless there's a birthday, graduation, or special occasion and my massive group of a family insists on going out to eat and gorge on food together as a way to celebrate. For this purpose, Dragon Pearl does the job quite well.

Service is quite pleasant. Food quality is average, but there's a decent amount of variety and the atmosphere makes up for it. Lots of tables, decor is grandiose and ostentatiously decorated. Great ambiance for a celebration or special gathering. 

You should try to get: the rice cakes, the black sesame ice cream, the deep fried chicken wings, the chicken dumplings, the dim sum items, the peking duck (keeping in mind that you shouldn't expect amazing quality, it's decent for where you are and what you get), roast beef, honey BBQ ribs. Don't expect over-the-top quality but these are decent. 

Your should pass on: the sushi and the noodles. Save the room in your stomach. They're both quite plain and lack the flavour you would expect. 

Overall, this wouldn't be my first choice for a meal on a regular day, but it's certainly a good choice for a big family meal, celebratory gathering, or even a special after-church lunch. Make reservations, especially on weekends, as they tend to get very busy.
