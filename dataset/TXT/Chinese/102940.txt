Used to be my favourite spot to visit in The Sausage, as viet/thai is hard to come by this far west.

Very friendly staff remembered my face from my last visit well over a year ago.  Vermicelli bowl was good and not great.  Noodles were a little over boiled and as we were the first to visit that day, its not like they'd been sitting around for a while.  Spring rolls, chicken and pork balls were okay in their defense.

Wife's pho was not that good.  Beef brisket was overcooked and broth is/was not up to their previous standards.  Plus the fact that this place is more expensive than the one closer to home - http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pho-mi-89-oakville

Good luck, Big Bowl
