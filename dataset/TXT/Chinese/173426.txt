W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g Ok first time here and the over all experience was very good. First off I was greeted by a very pleasant and courteous woman who seemed very friendly. I came here specifically for Vietnamese cuisine. I ordered cha gio and pho dac biet. Cha gio was good but the nuoc mam (dipping sauce) was too fish saucy just needed a bit more sugar and vinegar or lime juice. The pho dac biet was good. My only complaint is that it had to much clove. But these are just my opinions and preferences. Give this place a try! I can not say enough about the friendly service. It is a very inviting place and should be given a chance by anyone who loves Asian cuisine.
