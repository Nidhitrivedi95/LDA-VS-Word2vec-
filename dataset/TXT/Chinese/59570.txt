dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw First off, can we agree that it's kind of lame to leave a 1-star review for a place you've never even tried?

My bf and I were in Vegas last weekend and were looking for something different than our usual buffets and whatnot, and through Yelp we found just what we were looking for.  It took us three tries before we finally succeeded in trying Great Bao (third time's the charm), and it was super worth it!  

MUY IMPORTANTE TIP:  Check Twitter/FB before you go to find out when they'll be open or if they're already sold out.  DON'T rely on the salon employees, especially when they tell you "Oh...I think they're at the farmer's market today.  You should check Yelp.  I'm not really sure how Yelp works, but you'd be able to find out there."  Err...

We each got the 3 baos + 1 drink combo for $10, plus the sesame noodles w/ chicken.   The pork belly (so soft), roasted duck (mmm crispy skin!) and chicken (crispy skin here too!) baos were so flavorful and delicious - it's pretty amazing that you're eating all of this inside a beauty salon, but even if you weren't inside a beauty salon, you'd still be amazed at how tasty everything is!  

If there are other people waiting, you WILL have to wait your turn to get your food.  There are only 2 people working this joint, so don't get all pissy just because you have to wait a few minutes.  Sit on the couch or at the counter/tables if there are available seats, play on your phone, read a magazine.  If you're sensitive to salon smells, sit at the tables outside, your food will be brought out to you.  Good things come to those who wait!!!
