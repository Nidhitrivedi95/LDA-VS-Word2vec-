DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA There's a Sam Woo at vegas?  It better be damn good!  Unforunately, it was not.  It was some of the most blandest chinese food i've ever had.  It's super authentic because I can taste the gutter oil here.  The food was extremely greasy and under seasoned.  It was all lukewarm and it just wasn't very good.  The only thing this place has it going for them is that it's open pretty late.  Other than that, stay away from here.
