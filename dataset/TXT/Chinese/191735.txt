We get there and was taken to small room where they were setting up the sound system and karaoke machine. We waited fifteen minutes for them to TRY and figure out how to get it to work. After all attempts failed they took us to another room. The system was working in this room, but after singing one song, the microphone died! We had to go ask for new batteries. For someone as technologically savvy as myself their system is not user friendly at all and very limited with the selection. Then once you play a song there's a 50/50 chance they don't have the instrumental for it and you have to sing along with the original artist. Are you kidding me?! There's an option to turn the original artist off and when we did that the lyrics and music were TERRIBLY off! When you turned it back on it worked perfectly! They obviously have an issue with their system they need to fix! Overall my whole party had a terrible experience. To top it all off, when it was time to pay, they tried to charge us for the time they couldn't get the machinery to work. When I tried to explain that, the employee holding our debit card charged our card anyways. Needless to say, we don't be coming back. It was my brother's birthday and we went there to celebrate and my brother left very unhappy. We tried to make the best of it but they gave us very little yo be happy about. I strongly recommend Karaoke Q Studio over this place!
