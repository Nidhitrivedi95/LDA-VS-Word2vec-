OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I have dined at practically all of the dim sum places in Las Vegas, and I'm sorry to say that this one just doesn't cut it versus the others like Orchid Garden or KJ Dim Sum at the Rio. Here's what happened on my most recent experience at Chang's on a Tuesday just past the busy lunch hour:

* I sat for nearly 5 min with no server asking for water and hot tea or any of the dim sum carts around. Not a good sign. 
* The shrimp har gow and beef tripe tasted very bland with no flavor at all. Not at all what I expect from any dim sum place.
* Are you telling me at 1:00 on a Tuesday afternoon there are only 2 carts of dim sum available to choose from? Wow talk about lack of variety (and I pretty much lost my appetite after three dishes).
* I overheard an elderly couple at another table voicing their frustration at their server that they had placed an order for sesame balls for the last 15 min and never got it and that they need to go. The server apologized and expedited their order in a to-go container. Didn't know if the server charged the order or not for the couple but still an unpleasant situation to be in.

Unless the management take note and make change towards improving their customer service and appeal of their business, I will most likely not return (not even for a special offer or discount).
