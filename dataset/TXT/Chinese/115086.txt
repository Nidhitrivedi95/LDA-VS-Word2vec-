n_J4ryIX_f2CVdse8Wd-Ig Being the closest Chinese restaurant to my place, I head here whenever I'm in the mood for a bit of dirty Chinese. I always get the family special, which includes a spring roll, soup and main dish for $15, which is enough food to last me 2 meals. The food is pretty westernised (just the way I like it) and the spring rolls are my absolute fave! Crispy on the outside and soo yum. I also like that they put a piece of cardboard in the bottom of the plastic take out bag so the food inside doesn't tip and spill. The prices are pretty reasonable - around $11.50 for a main - although some of the seafood dishes can be anywhere up to $27. You get 10% off when your order take-away too, so that's a bonus point. The food isn't amazing by any means, but it gets the job done. I'm glad to have this restaurant so close to me!
