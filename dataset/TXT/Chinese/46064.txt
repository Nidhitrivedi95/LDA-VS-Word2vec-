BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I really liked the fact that they have a good amount of dumplings per order making sure it fills you up. Most of the dumplings were very good but some like the beef with chives dumplings were not as good. The beef and chives ratio was 1:3. The chives would take over the meat and all u would taste is really the chives. Also it was a pricey in the end especially since they only accept cash.
