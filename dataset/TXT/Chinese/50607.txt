CGgUHkAKU0QBsdGvXxfMuw Here's the best value on the menu as far as I'm concerned: Egg Foo Young, any kind. You get not one, not two, but three HUGE onion and sprout packed egg foo young patties, the size and thickness of a homemade hamburger, along with enough veggies and your choice of meat to make a whole second meal, all in a delicious brown sauce. Two gourmet chinese dinners for a paltry 7 or 8 dollars!
