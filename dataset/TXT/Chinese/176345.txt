WNvceXcngWjZz_IinDwYwA Party of One - two of us went to lunch but paid separately.  I had the Bigger Plate - 3 main courses and one side.  The Chow Mein noodles were dry and tasteless.  My friend had the fried rice and said the same thing.

The food area is like Boston Market - everything is out and you pick what you want.  Server got two things wrong in the order because she said it was loud and could not hear me.  I said Orange Chicken and she served me Grilled Chicken.

The Orange Chicken was good.  The Honey Walnut Shrimp was ok - but all breading and the Teriyaki chicken was good.  Her mushroom chicken was ok to good.  

She got the spring rolls - same as the one's you get at Dollar Tree - we paid two for $1.95.  No sauce served with them.  

I had the Cheese Rangoons - one was so overdone - dry and to hard to eat.  The other two were ok.  We did get sauce to dip in - but had used it on the dry noodles and rice.  Rangoons were $1.95 for three.  

If you buy the "up-grade" meats there is an additional charge - $1.25 for the shrimp.

Servers were polite and pleasant.

So - half our food was ok to good.  The other half was tasteless, dry and hard.

Bigger Plate $8.50  
Cheese Rangoons - 3 for $1.95
Lipton Lemon Tea $1.95
Up-graded meat $1.25

TOTAL LUNCH BILL $14.71.  Could have had a sit-down steak at Texas Roadhouse or Olive Garden for the same money and left happy.

NOT HAPPY - WILL NOT GO BACK TO PANDA EXPRESS.
