EbgUkmDxPUa2fr0rc8EFJQ I'm on a gluten free diet. I think I've tried most of the items on the gf menu and have yet to be disappointed. The spicy chicken has the right texture of crispness, sweet and spice. Sooo good! The Mongolian beef is excellent. Fried rice is delicious. The pad Thai is good. The only thing, no fault of PF Changs, but if I get take out on the crispy chicken or Mongolian beef by the time I get the home, they're both soggy. I recommend eating there while it's nice and hot. The gf desserts are delicious too.
