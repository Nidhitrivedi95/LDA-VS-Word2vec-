5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g Beef noodle soup was alright; I had better, but the fried chicken on rice was pretty bad.  I was expecting the typical five spice Taiwanese fried chicken but it was smoked chicken?? Wth? It tasted like smoked ham but with chicken if that makes any sense.  Just weird and off. Definitely disappointing and will not come back.
