cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw Me and my wife got take out one night, we were not to impressed it was ok. There is a minimum $ amount for takeout so we had to order more than we really wanted. To top it off I woke up at 2AM sick as can be with liquids coming out of both ends. Needless to say I havnt/won't be back again. I would say 3 stars but when I wake up at 2am puking I have to say 0.
