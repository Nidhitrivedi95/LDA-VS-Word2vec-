gTUaz3Wlh8eyQ3s7T-6txw Steam House really feels like wasted potential. It has cheap, generally tasty food on the one hand, but terribly slow service on the other. Their stir fried vermicelli and baked rice entrées are consistently good and sufficiently portioned. All of them available for $10 out-the-door. 

To capitalize though, you will have to wait 10 minutes for someone to notice you at the entrance, and lose your limbs trying to flag down waitresses at any point after that.
