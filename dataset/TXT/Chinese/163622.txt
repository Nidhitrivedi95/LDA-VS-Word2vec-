URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg I like china Chili..

Definitely would come back. I always end up going here maybe 1 every two months. I like specific dishes they have here. Chicken Salad  and Salt and Peppered pork. definitely order those if i come...mostly because it is a craving. I can't turn down jalapenos. :)
