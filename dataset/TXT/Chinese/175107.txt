wfWcE4K7vQX1Fjao9Q-12Q WOW! EXCELLENT food with EXCELLENT service! The teriyaki chicken is to die for! Very tender and flavorful! The bento boxes (Basil Chicken & Teriyaki Chicken) have more than enough portions, that there is no way an "average" person will least unsatisfied both mentally and physically. YOU WILL BE SATISFIED! 
The pad thai with chicken and shrimp is also worth mentioning. The combination of flavors blended well with my pallet. 
The pot stickers and crab wontons were also good, but nothing out of the ordinary.
