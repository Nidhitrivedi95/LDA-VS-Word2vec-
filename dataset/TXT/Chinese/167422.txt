VGxJbglGlx-a7Gdc55Q6jQ Delish. Came here during hurricane sandy to celebrate my sisters birthday. They treated us like special guests :-)

Tried a few rolls (spicy girl and crazy boy) and a few appetizers (gyoza, crab Rangoon, chicken skewer) and a few hibachi items. 

Everything was tasty and fresh. I would definitely come back again.
