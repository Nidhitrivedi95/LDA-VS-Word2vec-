D9bf5U0y_0MnL9wMFc4bKQ I made a reservation for a Friday night using tab. We decided to try the July 2015 tasting menu for $65 per person (for those who want wine pairings as well, it is an additional $35).

Food - All the dishes were fantastic. Some stand outs from this tasting menu include the liver pate, the tuna sashimi and the dessert was amazing (a strawberry shortcake with compressed strawberries). Although each dish was tasty, I was surprised by the lack of Asian influence in the dishes for this tasting menu. Despite the higher prices, I feel that the quality of the tasting menu is worth the higher price.

Service - Great. Our waitress brought over extras for us to try during our dessert, including a dessert rose wine. I thought that was a nice touch to end the tasting menu.

Ambience - We were seated on the second floor, which feels less lively compared to the first floor. I would recommend asking to be seated on the main floor if you want more of the trendy/lively atmosphere, especially on weekends.

I will definitely be coming back to People's Eatery.
