FykLjv4tIq618q8F2pvTKg Looking at the reviews I was excited to try this place. When I got there I got a bad feeling I wasnt going to like it. The service was horrible. The girl at the front was on her phone as she sat us down. She didnt even greet us. The food was horrible. Hurt my stomach for two days. Our waitress was concerened more about talking to her co worker then helping us out. Will never go again. Total fail.
