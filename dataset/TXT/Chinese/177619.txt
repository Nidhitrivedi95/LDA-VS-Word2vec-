wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA I applaud the fact that they are open for lunch. Hopefully they can work the kinks out and act on customer feeback. Very minute portions ( I get it, it's tapas) but the value is not there. Please consider increasing your portions if you decide to keep the prices. While the service was acceptable, it missed a couple of beats ( forgot drinks, long wait between dishes) Thank you for the Korean snacks upon seating. It sure was enjoyed. 
The food: probably I would give two stars to food only. While I appreciate the side salts, food was very bland with no sauces to accompany. The only flavorful item was the Special grilled squid ( $8 for half order) The chef choice of Kushi at $12.95 was a ripoff. Order your own Kushi separate. The veggies (okra, green onion, asparagus) were good. The meats were killed twice: very overdone. 
If they did their homework they checked Kyara, and even Ichiza. But it does not compare as of now. 
I love local businesses. I will go again after a few months.
