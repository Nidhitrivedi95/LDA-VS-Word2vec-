qEe0mdIax3pz3DH4RPj3sQ Like chinese food? Love spicy food? Must try Backyard Garden.  The food is simply tasty. Lot of flavour. They use alot of peppercorns in their dishes. I Love their eggplants and pineapple fish.  

The restaurant is simple and unassuming. Waiters don't speak english very well but enough to get by.

It's worth the drive to Markham from Downtown.
