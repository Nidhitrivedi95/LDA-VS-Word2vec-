Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Very popular dim-sum place in Vegas. Esp. since its "Dim-Sum All Day". Been our dim-sum to-go spot until we had an unsanitary dinning experience here.. & honestly, would not be going back. Too disgusted! 

Me & my family were having dim sum for lunch when my sister lifted her silverware and napkin she found/ felt a live COCKROACH fall out onto the floor. Did not want to kill it until the manager saw that it was alive. Trapped it under plenty of napkins for the lady to see/kill it for herself. Had no appetite afterwards.. Had to wait for the food we had already ordered and refused to order anymore after we placed our first order. No manager came to speak or apologize to us. We were not acknowledged at all until we finally got our check and even we had to  mention it ourselves to the lady at the register to alter our bill when we paid. Service was horrible & a clean & sanitary environment is important in the food industry!!!!
