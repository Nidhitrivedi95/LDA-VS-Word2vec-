9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw My favorite Chinese restaurant, EVER! Authentic cooking for such a great price. Staff is ok. You just ask for water or they don't provide. I guess it's like that at most Chinese restaurants. 

They have daily lunch specials that range from $5.50-$7.50. I believe it's from 11am-3pm. Yay!

Everything is cooked to order and well seasoned. The restaurant itself is not fancy, but if I can get good food, I'm there. Parking can be a nightmare during peak hours. 

They have a large menu for you to chose from. This is definitely a spot you can dine in from lunch to midnight hours!
