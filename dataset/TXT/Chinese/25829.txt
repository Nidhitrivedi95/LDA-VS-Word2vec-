7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew DIM SUM!  I was worried when I saw how small the dining area was, but it worked out perfectly since I was starving by the time we arrived.  Immediately we were asked what we wanted to drink (tea is .80 ea), and then all the carts came by.  Each cart had several different dishes on them which helped get us going real fast.  The owner (?) was super friendly and brought us all the sauces we wanted that wasn't on the table.  The servers weren't too pushy or sensitive about it if we refused their dishes which is a plus.  I will definitely go back again, although my coworker wants me to try a different place down the street.  We'll see, so far this is my favorite for dim sum!
