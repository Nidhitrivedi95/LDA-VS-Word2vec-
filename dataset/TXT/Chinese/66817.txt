eI1ZHGOr2Pus842KrZD5ZQ We went there on Sunday around 9:00am and got a table of two right away. The restaurant is in aulic style. It's not that noisy, maybe it was still early morning when we were there. We ordered 7 items and it was approx $65 after tax and tips. The scallops and Spinach dumpling is realLy good. The sesame fried ball is highly recommended as the sesame is liquid and We love it. Salted egg yolk bun is my must-have item for dim sum and it is not bad. The shrimp rice noodle is filled with shrimp. The Shanghai style pork dumpling is kinda authentic as I  am a Shanghainese. Overall, this is a descent dim sum place that I will definitely come back.
