C1JNZrYl3H-YzF1dys9SoQ this is your standard, generic Chinese food restaurant. I'm giving it better than one star cause it won't make you ill, but it's definitely not deserving of a recommendation. have been twice (co-workers' insistence) and the second time was marginally better, as I tried the spicy peanut tofu which was pretty good. I don't eat the meat dishes so i can't comment on those, but I do eat shrimp. the seafood dishes were also nothing great, just bland stuff that all tastes the same.
