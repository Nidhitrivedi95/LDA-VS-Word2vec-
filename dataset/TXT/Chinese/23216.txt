6sATfFam9_q9uod0I2aCsg I thought I have written this restaurant but somehow couldn't find it in my review

Recommended by friend that it is good.  Browsing through its menu really found that there are a lot of varieties not found in traditional vegetarian Chinese restaurant.  

The most memorable dish is the A vegetable palm.  It is something different, soft but you can bite it.  Usually you can order fried A vegetable but never did I find the palm to be used.

The presentation of all dishes are nice and clean.

At the end, the waitress introduced us <U+4E94><U+53F0><U+5C71><U+91D1><U+83B2><U+82B1><U+8336> Wu Tai flower tea that is good for your stomach.  We bought some to try.  This is a good place to have vegetarian dishes.  Whatever you pay minus expenses is used to fund the building of the Wu Tai temple in Pickering that is now under construction.  You can have a meal and at the same time do some fund raising.
