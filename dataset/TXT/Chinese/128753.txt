PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ The rating of 3 starts are from the following:
Food quality :  no more than one star
Ambience:  for a Chinese restaurant four stars
Service:  for a Chinese restaurant definitely five stars

Food:  in general,  OK for their beef rice roll,  duck feet,  quite good on their beef tendon,  very succulent and tasty and very tender.   However,  the har gaw was terribly dry,  the fried dough sticks were not at all crispy and more like two pieces of soft bread cut into pieces and tasteless, and the vegetables in garlic sauce was mediocre at best and a bit chewy at worst.
So some items were OK but not spectacular,  some were definitely sub-par and the variety was not great. 

Ambience:  tables were made of solid material that looks like corian, which makes them very easy to and is well kept clean.   The building has a nice high ceiling about 12feet, with lots of hanging bird cages the typical more contemporary black ceiling with grey exposed ventilation pipes.  Very nicely done.   Spacious dining room is not yet cluttered with too many tables and chairs,  so it feels comfortable to the patrons,  providing a relaxing atmosphere,  unlike most Chinese restaurants. 

Service:  this is where these people truly excel at.   The waitress even poured us our tea with a smile and continued to check back with us for service,  changing plates if needed,  etc. .  Pretty much unheard of in Chinese restaurants. 

Overall it is a place where you can get seated quickly for a quick lunch but stay away from some of the dim sum items.
