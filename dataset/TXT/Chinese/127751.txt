pdr6U7qSa9jIivVy_glF-w I can only do 3 stars for China Town Buffet. While i enjoy many of there dishes, I've had too many experiences with them not keeping there dishes replaced as they get low or emptied. So if you don't fill up your plate on your initial trip through the food lines, you might not get refills on anything you like. That, is my number one complaint.
 I agree with many of the other posts that they need to work on keeping their presentations more clean. The fish tank should go. It's not kept up often enough, and just looks bad. 
 Another thing, let me pick my own napkins. I don't know about you all, but I really don't like my napkins tossed in a stack on the table corner. They look like napkins the previous customer didn't use and they got left on the table. Yuck!
  But like I said, I'll give em' 3 stars with very little work, they be at 4 stars. Long way to go to get to five.
