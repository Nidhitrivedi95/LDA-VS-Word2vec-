NJyTPOukXuLK8vabKw7nvA Im giving this place 5 star for my love of fish in chili oil soupy dish. They always do my fave dish excellent. Everything else is good too, but my one fave is enough for me to rate them 5. Service and interior has improved very much over the past 5 years (renovated i dont know when, i was away from toronto for few years)
