7U73RqIg6JA0WThxWUV3uA We ordered from Jade for delivery. I was excited to try it based on all the feedback. We ordered through Yelp with an estimated 45-60 minute wait, which was fine. After an hour and a half, I called and was told our food was out for delivery with no ETA. We didn't get our food until 2 hours later. Needless to say the steamed dumplings and crab rangoons were cold and soggy. The sushi was great, except for the fact we had already eaten assuming the delivery was never going to arrive. 

The only reason I am not giving 1 star is that I believe the food would have been good had we gotten it in a timely fashion. We will definitely never be ordering delivery from Jade again.
