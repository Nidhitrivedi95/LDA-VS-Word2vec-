z9lOfnUorcbWR_xS0DSeHw Ah, what can I say. Seems like a very popular option amongst international UW Chinese students who wants a taste of home, as it is in a very convenient location and the food quality is as authentic as it gets here in Madison.

Food - on our visit, we had the ox tripe and tongue appetizer along with sliced chicken in garlic sauce (classic Chinese dish but replacing pork with chicken) and shredded pork in bean sauce. Food was great but we should've went with a veggie dish instead of meat on top of meat. Spiciness is my thing and this place quenched my desire for spicy Chinese food. 

Service - compared to the food, service is lacking. After we were seated  no waiters came to our table for the next 15 minutes. I had to tell the person up front that we're still waiting to order. After we were finished, it took another 10-15 to give us the check, we were thinking of just walking out without paying :P

Price - if you're really desperate to eat authentic Chinese, the price isn't a factor. But compared to most Chinese eateries, this is definitely on the pricier side. For 1 appetizer and 2 dishes and tips, we paid close to $40. But the serving size makes up for the price since it took me 3 more meals before I finished all the leftovers :)

Will definitely be coming back whenever the urge to have spicy Chinese food comes back!
