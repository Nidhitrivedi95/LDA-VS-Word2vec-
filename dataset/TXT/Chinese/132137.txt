PM5vkmr8FqOIWE0pe3C2Fw It was our first time doing hot pot and overall I found it a fun experience. The staff were really friendly and walked us through how the hot pot process works and they had lots of suggestions on what to order. 

When we arrived we entered our info onto an iPad and got a text when our table was ready. The place was packed but we were seated in around 15 mins. 

Our food came really fast and everything we ordered came out together. I tried the original soup base spice level two and it was really hot. I can handle heat but it was a bit too much. My vegetarian friend isn't sure his veggie broth was actually meat-free so heads up to double check. Overall the food was pretty tasty and there were lots of different food bites to try. 

The cost was $40 pp for all you can eat, no upgrades, soup base, drink and tip. We paid cash but weren't told about a 10% cash discount (just noticed that in previous reviewer's comments). In fact their credit machines were down and they only accepted cash.
