mHIMBcS1rS77yTW47-77zA Nothing special. Maybe because I didn't find the "soup dumpling"  tried the spicy wonton and the capella wonton, both soup.  The broth was great.  Also got scallion onion pancakes, very crispy but lack taste.  The bbq pork chow mein, crispy noodles was unexpectedly good.  They offer sweet soy milk, which tasted fresh not powder with hot water add.  

Waitress was really nice and patience with us.  She tried her best to explain the menu.  I don't expect to return but if am in the neighborhood I wouldn't oppose it the idea.
