BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA Second time with a large group. Service was quick and friendly and the food was average to above average. The juicy pork dumplings stood out by far. Unfortunately a lot of the steamed and boiled dumplings end up tasting the same.

I will continue to recommend based on service and quantity but the food could be better.
