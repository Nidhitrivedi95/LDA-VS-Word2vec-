5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ Great food but worst customer service ever. We decided to eat here for business/family lunch since we were staying at Monte Carlo. We made a reservation for 7 people and were planning to order things from lunch menu since it was very reasonable. When the server (i think he was a manager) sat us at the table and we asked for the lunch menu, they didn't want to give it to us because they dont provide lunch menu for party of 6 or more. Now this made us really upset because when my dad called to make a reservation and asked if they have a lunch menu, they didnt inform us about this. Dinner menu is super overpriced and we ended up paying $124 
I give 1 star for the quality of their food but zero for their service. DONT COME HERE.
