Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Total disappointment!! Bad quality food , generic preparation, chicken is difficult to eat, small over cooked dried pieces in chowmein or soup. We tried their Hakka chowmein,  fried rice ( dried white rice with dried pieces of chicken and shrimp )chilli chicken and sweet and sour chicken and 2 kinds of soups . Please avoid each and every one of these preparations.

We had much better Hakka chowmein and dry chilli chicken at Tibet Kitchen . 

Will make it a point to avoid this restaurant whenever we come to Toronto .
