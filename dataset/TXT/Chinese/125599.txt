Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w I have been eating here for over ten years, but the last couple of times the food was not as good. Last week we ate there and everything was barely warm, fried shrimp was cold. I told the waiter and the Manager, nothing but sorry. To top it off they charged my card twice. I called the Manager and he said give it a few days.well, still on card so having to dispute it. My last visit to what used to be my favorite.
