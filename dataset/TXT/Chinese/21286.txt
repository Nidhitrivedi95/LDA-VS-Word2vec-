68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw I've been to the restaurant a few times now and I can say that the food is solid. Not the best Chinese food I've had but nonetheless the food is good here.

I'm a fan of dumplings so I tend to order different types each time I'm here. So far I've enjoyed each type that I've tried (steam soup filled and vegetarian). Hope to try them all some day. We also had the mapo tofu which is our favourite dish here and we've also had fried rice and meat dishes which were good as well.

The food arrived quickly and the servers were fairly friendly and checked in on us often.

If you're in the Chinatown area Asian Legend is a fairly good option if you're craving Chinese food.
