eMTE-wqpk_YWaV3mf7Ii3A I walked by today and saw a sign saying that the restaurant had been sold and was closing on March 26. The Spring Rolls chain seems to be going out of business. Their Brampton restaurant has closed as has their two Mississauga restaurants. I assume that the new owners will renovate the place before it reopens. Not sure when that will be as renovations always seem to take longer than planned. A Japanese restaurant will replace it.
