_5XClj4E5VCIsEscbrrPKg My group of 4 came here wile waiting for a table elsewhere. We had such an amazing experience, I'm sure I will be back for the full deal. Megan (?sp) the bartender gave amazing service. She Suggested great drinks. We tried 3 different ones from cocktail menu at $15 a pop and they were all worth it for sure. Sampler app item was 10/10 for deliciousness and the tofu item ordered by our token vegetarian was completely eaten. I can't wait to return.
