gnkyosoOepBUqog7iDdggQ Probably my personal favourite restaurant in the area.

I come here at least once a month, and usually order the Pork Bone Soup w/ Red Miso ramen. I absolutely love their Taiwanese Fried Chicken Nuggets, and the fact that they have Presotea! All time favourite bubble tea: Royal Earl Gray Milk Tea Family.

Can be very crowded at times, such as weekend lunch. Seats are usually immediately available at other times.

Service is alright, noodles usually do not take too long. The chicken nuggets come pretty quick and keep us happy while we wait. Waitstaff can be a tad bit rude at times, but it usually does not affect the experience. 

Overall, amazing place!
