pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA My friends and I went to Sushisamba to celebrate a bachelorette party. We were very excited to try this place since it had been recommended by several friends. We arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately. However, after 15-20 minutes, no waiter came by to introduce themselves or get our drink order. Long story short, several managers came over to apologize, brought over a round of drinks and dessert, and made sure our every need was looked after. Our waiter, Mike D, was extremely friendly and helpful too. Some of the girls in the group had special dietary needs. He made this a priority and ensured all the food came out properly. Also, some of the girls in the group did the tasting menu and Mike D picked out some amazing dishes! I would definitely recommend doing the tasting menu since you get a sampling of so many different items. Overall, Sushisamba had amazing food and service and really made it a memorable experience for our whole party. We would definitely go back again! Thanks Mike D!!
