This little place caught my eye as it was packed with people, spilling out into the tables on the street. The vibe is very casual, almost like a street stall you may find whipping out bowls of noodles for the hungry masses.

The main thing here is obviously the noodles. I had the flat large noodles with the beef, pickled mustard and shiitake mushroom broth option. The flat large noodles was a delight, as they are less frequently seen and were very good. Great texture, and the right balance between chewy and tender. The broth was flavorful without being too salty or heavy. In summary, a delicious big beef bowl.
