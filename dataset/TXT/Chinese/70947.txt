fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ So I have been going to the Wynn A LOT, pretty much every much every month for the past several months. My mom has been getting comped so I have been gorging at pretty much every restaurant at the Wynn.

Wing Lei was on my list as its the only chinese restaurant in the US to have received a Michelin star. 

So I had to get the duck. But instead of having them chop it up and put it in lettuce cups i told them to just chop it up and give it to me. I loved the dual preparation of the peking wth both the buns and crepe though. And the duck seemed to have hardly any fat on it which was surprising since duck is normally fatty. It was the best duck I have eaten

I also ordered the lobster, mongolian beef, a fish course and some green beans and the corn and crab soup. The crab in the soup was big chunks of blue lump crab. 

Im not a huge Chinese food fan but the food was very very good. And of course the prices reflect that. But you are in a fine dining establishment so the overall experience reflects that.
