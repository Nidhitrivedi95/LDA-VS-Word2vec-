Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg The worst service ever:( I have eaten at this restaurant before, and I like the food, but this time around, it was not a good experience at all. 
 I was dining alone, not that should matter, but maybe why I was treated poorly. I practically had to flag down a server to get a menu, never was brought water, and it took forever to order. Then top it off I was never brought utensils and never brought the appetizer I ordered. The waitress handed me  my bill while I was still eating!  
 I will never come back and I come to Vegas a lot.
