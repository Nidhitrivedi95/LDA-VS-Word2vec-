_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA It's decent asian food.  But to be honest I don't see the need for me to ever come back here while I'm visiting Vegas, when I can get the same food for half the price any other time (I live surrounded by asian restaurants!).

They were out of flat rice noodle, therefore the server recommended the si jiu beef noodles.  The beef and sauce are poured over a bed of crispy thin egg noodles.  This is generally a good dish, and this one was not bad at all.  The beef was very tender, and I liked the noodles once they absorb the sauce.

The combination fried rice was just OK.  It tasted fine, yet something was very plain about it.  I had to add hot sauce so it wouldn't be so boring.  Instead of having slices of meat, some of the meat was shaped in little rectangles, making it seem very cheap.

Sooooo considering that you are in a casino in Vegas, not a bad choice for asian food.  For my own preference, I would rather go elsewhere.

PS: Depending on where you are sitting, you can also watch sports on the TVs right outside the restaurant.
