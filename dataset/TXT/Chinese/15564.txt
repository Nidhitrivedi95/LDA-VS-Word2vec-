3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug This is a place for feast!  Especially such as lobster, king crabs or fishes.  I've had couple excellent seafood feast back in some NYC highend restuarants.  However, I must say the lobster I had here was the best in all honest.

I  do not speak Chinese but my boyfried was greeted by the boss and everything was ordered within a few words of greeting.  He seems very personable and all the customers love him.

We had a "Buddha jumps over the wall" soup.  I am not a fan because it is too rich for my taste.  It does seem to grew on me every sip I took.  Given time for enough try, I might love it.  I do understand that it is an expensive soup with many seafood, herb, chicken ingredients and brewing for a long time.

The lobster 4 ways feast.  It was such a big production!  The waiter show me a huge live lobster first and I almost freaked out.  I control myself very well without offending my man. It was a close call though.

The first plate was my favorite by far and the best I have ever had.  Steamed lobster.  So fresh, so tasty, so bouncy, so juicy.  The most amazing part was the clear noodles under the lobster.  The noodle has absorbed all the taste and I could not stop.

The second and third was fry lobster and fried lobster with salt and pepper.  They were good but not as amazing as the first plate.  The final plate was lobster fried rice.  It was pretty good too.

The place was definitely a bit too pricey for my preference.  I would prefer a more high end setup and quieter amostphere for such price.  That is the reason I rated it 4 stars.  However, the food and service totally was deally excellent.
