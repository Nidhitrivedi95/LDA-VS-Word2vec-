E9aC5bLfXdQVZ5csvLuLJg The first time I came here I wanted to buy some boba milk tea but all the servers/cashiers ignored me even after making eye contact so I left. 

However, I decided to give them another chance because they were pretty busy that day so I was willing to let that one bad experience slide. This time I tried the stir fry beef noodles (beef chow fun) and to my dismay, it didn't even taste as good as the one I make at home. For its price, ($7) the quality was not good.  I'm not planning on eating here again.
