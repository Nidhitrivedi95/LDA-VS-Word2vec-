FKdyzqDoPvRAEYP_2TjbzQ So, my boyfriend and I decided to take a trip downtown and have some hot pot (for him it was going to be his first time, and for me ... would be my second/third) however anyways, we reached downtown around 7ish and we went inside the place, which is located in the basement, since we had to walk down narrow flights of stairs, so girls, if you're wearing heels or anything please be careful because it's extremely steep. 

The air was slightly stale, and smelt like the place had not been aired out in awhile, and the place was small, yet cozy. 

When we got there we were greeted by an elderly gentleman, who sat us down and gave suggestion on what to get, we order the beef, chicken, lamb, dumplings and got some veggies and noodles from the refrigerator near the front entrance (the selection was quite few and almost everything was empty), where we also made our sauces. I recommend the beef, it was absolutely delicious, however both my boyfriend and I got incredibly sick afterwards because the food did not settle with our stomachs. 

Out of the 5 stars, I give the place a 2 because of the variety of the noodles and veggies were few, and the fact we both got sick.
