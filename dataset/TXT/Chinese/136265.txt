qfa4p28aOu9-VQ30mwQzUQ This seafood restuarant has been around forever and recently they started their dim sum menu. Dim sum special is till 11 am, s/m/l dim sums is $3.00. Tea price is $1/ person. Im not sure if they have this special on the weekends. 

I came here at 9 am on a Thursday morning and it wasnt busy at all. There are limited tables because the space is so much smaller compared to other dim sum places. But staff were friendly and dishes were clean. Im guessing no one knows about the dim sum special becuase it is not stated anywhere on the menu. However I found out through their staff.

There are some interesting dim sum dishes on the menu. I got the fried cruller with rice noodle (cheung fun) covered in cashew pieces. The cheung fun is quite soft but the cruller was over-fried. The steamed walnut bun was really interesting. They actually had alot of walnut pieces inside the bun with a sweet filling. Im not a big fan of walnut but it was still interesting to try since it isnt offered anywhere else. The steamed chiu chow fun gor had alot of crunchy veggie filling and not too much meat which I like. However the skin is a little too thick for my liking but skin is still soft. The last thing I got was the steamed duck feet with taro. It was wrapped in bean curd with a huge taro, chinese mushroom, and some sort of meat. This dish was a little blend compared to other dishes but I thought it was still pretty yummy. Their hot chilli oil isnt spicy though :(. 

Everything came out fresh and hot. There are other interesting dim sum dishes I want to try so I will definitely come back.
