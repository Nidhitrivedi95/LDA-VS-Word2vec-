_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w I prefer omei more than this place.

Payment, bring cash/debit because they don't take credit cards.

Decor, nicely laid out restaurant with 3 out of 4 walls being walls of seafood.  It is nicely lit with good looking chandelier.

Service, it was not up to par but I think it was because we had lunch at 2pm which was overlapping their lunch time.  Plates weren't switched, we had to flag them down to get more tea/water.  They did seem to be in a rush to get us to order even though our whole party wasn't there yet and they were only 10 minutes later than us.  They just kept coming and asking us what we wanted to eat and we kept telling them we are waiting for others.

Food, we ordered the $368 combo, which consisted of crab 3 ways, 1 lobster mountain, a soup, veggie dish and dessert.  The food was okay, the presentation I think is the stand out at this restaurant which you can see from the pictures.  Don't expect too many choices besides the seafood dishes here.  I thought the soy crab was the best dish they had.  I thought the egg one was too salty, and the rice dish was okay.  The other dishes were okay, nothing amazing.

Price, it seemed comparable to Omei, but I like Omei's food infinitely more and their dessert by comparison is out of this world.  Here you only get one, no refills, whereas at Omei, you get 4, and you can ask for more at no cost.
