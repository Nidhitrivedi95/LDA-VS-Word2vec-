1jNteKQ2JuF6Sk1SI9X23Q My nostalgia from living in the US - I always and will always have a place in my heart for PF Chang's.  I would definitely recommend some dishes.

CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS - yum!  Ask them for the extra hoison sauce, it's delicious as you wrap the lettuce in the delicious chicken mince mix.  I compare all of my lettuce wraps to this one - it's quite delectable. 

The AHI CRISP was delicious, I don't normally like deep fried food, but the raw fish on it was a good balance.  

Love the DUMPLINGS, they are a bit small but they are quite the appetite openers.  Aren't the best dumplings but they are quite tasty and would recommend.  

WOK-CHARRED BEEF - it was tasty but there was a lot of celery, I was wondering for a hot second where the beef was.

MUSHU PORK - loved this as well.  Can't go wrong, it's a salty dish, I really do like the fact they offered to wrap it for you.  

My absolute favourite is the SPICY GREEN BEANS, this was absolutely divine, it's a bit salty but I am partial to green beans.  It had great flavour and tastes great with noodles or rice.

They get the points off in service, should be consistent and it never it.  I had a business lunch there and it took almost 2 hours and the waitress was flustered.  Yuck.

Overall, I love PF Chang's, I feel like for a chain restaurant, they do a great job making some legit asian food.
