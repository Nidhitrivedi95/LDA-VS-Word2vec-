aHVhlCvmlNnnPf-LgclNNA We are staying at a hotel nearby so we thought this style food sounded good. We had the pork egg roll, egg drop soup and hot and sour soup. Those items were unspectacular. For the main courses sesame chicken and Singapore rice noodle. Well the sesame chicken was very greasy and taste like it was burnt in the deep dryer. The Singapore noodle was over cooked and mushy and was cooked with too much oil in the wok. Was not a happy meal. Will not return.
