eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g I reviewed this place when it first opened.  It was really good then but wow has it ever dropped in just about every aspect.

The food used to be really special and well made dim sum.  Now, it is average at best and maybe even below average for some dishes (especially the desserts).

The decor is still not bad, but you can see so much wear and tear in the plates, cups etc (lots of chips and dents).

The service is probably the biggest drop.  They used to seem to pride themselves in providing a more high end experience.  Now the service is actually below par.   We ordered a fried rice dish and it was really poorly divided into bowls.  I would say at least half a bowl of rice ended up on the table. I could have done a better job blindfolded. 

One particularly annoying thing is when we paid, the waitress counted each dollar (literally down to the dollar) in front of us as if she wanted to make sure we paid or tipped enough.  Really rude.

I used to recommend people to check this place out or even bring out-of-towners here for a special experience, but now I have to recommend to stay away.  What a shame.
