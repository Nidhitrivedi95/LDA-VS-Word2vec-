4WmI1fnjvfI5OyV1B6emAQ New Choice has decent food and late hours and that is about where it ends. 

The cleanliness of the restaurant is questionable at best. It is not kept well most of the time which can be gross when you're trying to eat. Their cups are usually dirty. 

I would say 90% of their employees do not speak English which is extremely annoying because they give you a clueless stare when you order and as opposed to making sure they have your order down correctly, they make guesses and bring you the wrong order. 

On the other hand, the one's that do speak English, are rude, uninviting and try to rush you with your order.

Also, they do not accept reservations and are cash only. I personally do not know many restaurants that do not accept debit or visa/mastercard other than New Choice. 

Overall, I would not recommend this place. It is too bad because their food is not half bad.
