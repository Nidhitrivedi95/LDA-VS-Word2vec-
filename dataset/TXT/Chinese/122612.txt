OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Solid Dim Sum place.  Nothing fancy, but good reliable Dim Sum.  It can get very busy on the weekend so get there early.  One caveat, they have a small side room with a couple of tables in it.  Try not to get seated in there.  It appears the cart goes there last so the food might be sold out or less fresh.
