yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Good place to eat after a hard night of drinking.
Pho Tai is pretty good (from what I remember).
Cheap. Well all pho is cheap haha.
Service, if that's what you wanna call it, is pretty much nonexistent. They take your order & bring your food... and that's about it. A friend ordered duck and it had that bad smell and they took forever to make it & bring it out - we were pretty much done with our meals by the time it was out.
I wish this place was closer to the strip so that we can walk here. Usually we have to take a taxi  =\.
