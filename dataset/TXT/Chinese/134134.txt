Q_Iia5C2quTUVfE5_8jObw We used to go to The Royal quite frequently when they were still on their old location.  But since they moved to the bigger location, we didn't go in until tonight.  The place was barely 1/3 full on a Friday night (not a good sign).

We ordered sweet n sour ribs (meat was tough as leather), string beans w/ shredded meat, hollow veggie stir fried (a soupy overcooked mess), clams lightly cooked w/ ginger (completely flavourless), breaded shrimp (turned out looking like a western chinese dish and tasted just as bad), and a crunchy egg noodle for my kids (sauce was like glue). The only saving grace of the night was the free dessert.

Overall a terrible meal. Don't know how this place can survive serving food like this.
