They started off the meal with a bowl of soup, what we had today, was Ginseng and Pork.

We ordered quite a few items on the menu:

Deep-Fried Oysters ~ Not bad, wasn't fishy nor soggy. It was quite crispy and tasty.

Deep-Fried Bitter Melon ~ This was a first for me. I never really liked eating bitter melon but this dish was ok. The bitterness wasn't that strong and the batter they use to fry it was quite unique and tasty.

Fried Pipa Tofu~ I've had this dish at other restaurants before. But their was just as good tasting.

Braised Ox Tail ~ This came in a big wok and was placed on top of a portable hot pot gas stove. It was in some kind of tomato and veggie sauce. This was also a pretty good dish.

Fu Yu Stir Fried Tung Choy ~Very Fresh and Tasty, but a bit on the salty side, but goes well with rice.

Maggi Sauce Shrimp ~ These large shrimps were first light fried then toss with Maggi Sauce. Taste was very good.

Ying Yang Rice ~ Half is a White Cream Sauce Fried Rice, other is A Tomato Base Fried Rice. This was also not a bad dish.

Black Bean Sauce Stir Fried Clams ~ This one I only had one piece of it, but from that one piece, the taste was ok as well but a bit salty, if you eat it alone without rice.

At the end of the meal they also give us tong siu (dessert), what we had tonight was, Chinese Kelp Green Bean Sweet Soup.

Also I saw the one post of this place prior going to dine at Fok Yuan, from Elaine K. stating she ordered soft shell crabs. But apparently they weren't in season, so we didn't get to order them tonight.

Overall the food was quite good, I would go back and try more stuff. 
But I minus 2 stars for the ambience itself and also the wait staff wasn't too friendly. But I think they can win you over with the food they serve.
