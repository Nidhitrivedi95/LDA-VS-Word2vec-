Food comes out fast, and they have this make-your-own hot pot type of thing that I have yet to try. I'm usually disappointed with spice levels at other places, but I get a good kick out of the noodles here. I would watch out for some dishes though as I came across a problem with biting into an excessive amount of sichuan peppers/some type of peppercorn that left an unpleasant feeling in my mouth. 

Service was okay...they were very nice but seemed inexperienced or just didn't care. The waitress didn't bother repeating what we ordered and ended up putting in an extra order. Didn't apologize or take it back so we ended up paying for it....eh lunch for tomorrow I guess.
