yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA We had our last meal here before leaving Las Vegas.  My friends kept talking about this place and I basically felt skeptical about whether or not the Pho was going to be good.  Having been to one other Pho restaurant not too far from here which wasn't great.  The place had an updated interior and had lots of people coming in to eat.  Ordered my usual of Pho Dac Biet, basically all kinds of yummy tendon and tripe in it.   Strangely I think this was the best meal I had all weekend.  

One of my friends freaked out that he had tripe in his Pho when he ordered Tai Chin.  Really funny, cause I knew right away when he was asking wtf that meat in his bowl was.  He asked to have the problem fixed and they easily made it right.  From what i know, there are more mediocre or flat out horrible Pho restaurants in Las Vegas.  I can safely say that this was a pleasant departure from the mediocre.
