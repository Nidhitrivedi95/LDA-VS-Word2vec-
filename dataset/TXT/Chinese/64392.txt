I have only eaten at Mandarin Wok a few times within the past semesters, but every time has been somewhat disappointing. Their soups and noodle bowls skimp on the meat and vegetables, while their standard dishes are simply lackluster. Portion sizes seem smaller than its competitors and for the price paid, Cravings definitely has better value.

The menu is tremendously large and can be confusing with unfamiliar customers as well. With almost an entire wall filled with an "exclusive" Chinese-character menu, it is recommended to bring along a native Chinese speaker to help decipher and select the better items. 

While there might be fantastic dishes hidden amidst the heap of possible items, Mandarin Wok for the unfamiliar customer is not a smooth stop-by-and-eat type of place.
