dblGQtHAzNy1ACis1m2shw Been looking for New York style Chinese food for years in Vegas. We visit every year. This is it! Everything we ordered was delicious. Hole in the wall eateries like these are usually delicious in New York. We ordered takeout & ate it for lunch & dinner. Have some left for breakfast. Very reasonable too. Owner (former New Yorker) of a large supermarket in Vegas hipped us to this eatery. Thanks.
