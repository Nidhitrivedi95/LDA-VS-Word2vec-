qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A Worst customer service & waited over an hour for a take out order. I said hi to the manager as she rudely walked by & never even smiled or not even a hello. Staff looked angry except for the guy & girl doing take out orders. After I finally got me food I sat and waited another 10 minutes for my change. My sushi was warm & couldnt eat it by the time I got home.
