ZJdBctpe_qbXXwAVMBk0bQ Hi there, it's a pretty decent place to have lunch and dinner. I visit it almost everyday for lunch since it's really affordable and food taste fresh. They do offer huge portions even for lunch special. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed. Have a good one! Eh forgot to add its very quite and clean inside which is usually not the case for Hakka places!
