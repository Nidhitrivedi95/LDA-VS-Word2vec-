oxS9yB0o6dsNyHviLmjZFg Pleasant surprise in terms of taste profile for most of what we ate- spices were beautifully balanced and meats were perfectly cooked... almost everything is good here. The only two downsides for this resto was 1. When it is very cold outside sitting near the windows is not pleasant... we were very cold until we had tea to warm up with and 2. The "fried rice" was way over priced and a disappointment. While everything else on our table seemed to be prepared with fresh veggies ... the fried rice obviously had been made with frozen peas and carrots added to it and cost way too much. That being said... the portions of most dishes are large and the presentation of everything else was beautifully done. Would come back for sure... we would just sit away from the window and avoid the fried rice. 

Wish they would offer delivery
