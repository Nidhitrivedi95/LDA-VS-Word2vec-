Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA Uh oh. Looks like things went downhill.. came in again and the wait staff was very rude upon arrival. The table we wanted was not ready which we had no issue waiting for. We were given an attitude when asked if we could sit there. When we asked nicely for water while our waitresd was wiping down the table, she actually IGNORED us. She seemed angry that we asked for the table to be cleaned and water. It was 95 degrees out. The real kicker was seeing the filth next to our table. I'll be checking out the other place nearby. Wanted this to be my go to.
