0kag5JGemji05P3oxx4lpg I ordered delivery from here recently and was pleasantly surprised. I had read previous reviews that had me putting off ordering from here. But, when I was moving and had nothing to cook with or eat with since it was packed up, I ordered from here. And the delivery time was about on par for other places. It was a bit busy when I ordered, given it was right around lunch time. But when it was delivered, it was still hot and yummy. The volcano chicken, one of their lunch specials was good; it came with rice and crab puffs. The happy family was good as well. This is a place I'd order from again. Oh and I did like the fact that when you get delivery and use card, they bring the card reader with them rather than giving my card number over the phone.
