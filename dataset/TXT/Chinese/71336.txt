fcpGO67gqGptI-1vZpXPtA Great place near the Concordia area for hand-pulled noodles (you can see the guy pulling them in the back of the restaurant, too). I'll agree with the reviewer who said that the soup doesn't have an impressive depth of flavor, but regardless, it is damn good. You get to select from a bunch of different noodle widths, I like the second widest flat ones. The portion sizes are generous so don't feel the need to get the large. I would also recommend the meat sandwiches (as a side dish).

Service is fast and friendly, and there is lots more seating in the back area of the restaurant. I do like the lan zhou noodles at the restaurant in G&D in Chinatown better, but the space is so small, it's often hard to get a seat and even when I do, everyone is seated so close together I feel like I'm going to get hot broth spilled on me. At M. Trois, I can go with friends, have a conversation, enjoy my noodles in peace.
