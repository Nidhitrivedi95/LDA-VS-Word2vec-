nl_gkvVXtsIlhGE0sP0qFw Food is awesome and fresh, but let's be serious....we come for the CRAB LEGS!!!! Always available and huge and salted and steamed just right! We still can't believe they've kept their prices down considering how much crab flows through this place. 

Sushi bar is decent, seafood selection is good....ice cream bar is a nice touch....

Bathrooms could be kept up more, but wait staff is attentive when its brought up to them.....
