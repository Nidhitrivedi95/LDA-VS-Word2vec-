dAFfbEWpjYbzxIwlt9FGeA Man I don't like giving such critical reviews, but this place just wasn't very friendly.

The glass outside says "£5 lunch special." Nope. We walked in and asked, and the man just pointed at the menu. The decorations were lovely, but the food was very expensive!!

I grew up eating Chinese food, and I even ordered in Mandarin. I asked the guy, and he's from Beijing, an area's food I'm familiar with. This wasn't even close. Perhaps they were catering to tourists, but if so, the prices were too high. It's a trade off--cater to tourists and be cheap, or cater to authenticity and stay expensive.

The dishes also didn't come with rice. Whaaat. Very sad. If you're a poor student like me and my friends, don't come here. Maybe if you have money and want to pretend to eat fancy Chinese food, you can come. But to me, it's a rip off. Sorry.
