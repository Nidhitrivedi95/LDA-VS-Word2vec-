fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw Decent fast food Chinese. I got the cashew chicken (my go-to dish at all take out places) and the mixed vegetables. The cashew chicken had huge pieces of chicken and plenty of cashews, along with some veggies. Pretty tasty overall. The mixed veggie dish wasn't bad either -- good variety of veggies, nice and crispy in a garlic sauce. This is one of the better take out Chinese places in southwest Vegas (at least compared to China a-go-go and Jackie Chan).
