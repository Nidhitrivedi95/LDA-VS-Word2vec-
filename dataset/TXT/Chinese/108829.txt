lkM72Y21bjBqUGaW7iL7tQ pretty big chinese restaurant. i miss the lions that they used to have infront of the building, it was kinda part of my child hood.
the dim sum was quite good though. it's pretty much what you'd expect. nothing super fancy. the most memorable thing for me was the durian pastry dessert. my sister was eating one as my brother-in-law (Caucasian) was telling a story, as soon as he finished the story, he had this disgusted face, looked around and said, "something stinks!" meanwhile, my sister and I who love durian and i personally don't mind the smell at all just start to laugh hysterically as he realizes what it was.
