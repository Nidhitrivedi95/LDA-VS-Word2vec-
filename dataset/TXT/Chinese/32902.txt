a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg For some reason this place has their Best Of reviews on plaques by the door. I've been here a couple of times at the behest of friends and both times, it's been miserable. Last time, we were a table of 10 so I forgive a lot if they are not specialists in larger parties. I was there with a friend and we were shown to the last booth in the back at 530P on a Wednesday. Our server was a middle aged gentleman and far from friendly. No attempt at upsell with cocktails or apps. I asked why they designate their egg rolls as NY egg rolls. Answer: because they have pork. WTF?  The 4 top of senior citizens next to us got the fried wontons and sauces as a complimentary app, we did not.  We did not get water refills and I had to ask to have hot tea refilled (which they charge for the initial fill).  Serving dishes come out warm and they offer only cold plates. Our food was cold within 5 minutes. Enter a table of 6 Asian people (3 children) and they are provided chopsticks and attentive service. It was assumed by our rude waiter that we were not adept at handling chopsticks and weren't offered any.  For two people, we ordered 4 dishes, not apps so any waiter would assume the tip would be decent. The  "best of Phoenix" lo mein is greasy. The spring rolls are passable. I didn't even want to try the mixed veg plate as it was swimming in oil. Fried rice was ok, very very bland.  Our waiter was so surly it was ridiculous even trying to get the bill. I am so annoyed my friend picked up the bill when the food was cold, and she tipped the server when  it was an exercise to get any service and we didn't get the same service afforded to others.  

This place is terrible. Anyone who awarded this  'New York Style Chinese Cuisine" or "Best Lo Mein in Phoenix' should have their palate cleansed and tested before returning to work.

Overpriced. Greasy. Poor service. Rude.
