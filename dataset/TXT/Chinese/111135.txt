m3tNor-GTl-aAST5AmEqYA Dined here just this past Saturday evening and well let's just say that this place has officially managed to restore my faith in buffets.

Typically I'd never go to a buffet, reflecting on that "tried one, tried em' all" mantra.

NOT THE CASE HERE^^^^!

My family totally peer pressured us into accompanying them to Lin's Grand Buffet and admittedly after the 4-5 hour drive out from So Cal, ....we were seeing mirages and envisioning Flintstone sized T-bone steaks appearing upon the side of the road...

Walked into this place and GOOD GRAVY!!! I became vague and delusional from all of the food choices. There was a bit of a wait but it expired as we simultaneously paid upfront for the meal. Shortly thereafter we were seated and then it went down like four flat tires!!!

Picture Ontario Mills Mall (if you're in Southern California) or the Minnesota "Mall of America". There's absolutely no way upon visiting you could ever fathom conquering each and every store within a one day visit.

That was my sentiment here. I felt DEFEATED.

From the salad bar complete with mussels and shrimp....down to the orange chicken, soups, teriyaki steak....then over to the Mongolian station which sits adjacent a steak preparer, whereas you can request your cut of steak and have it prepared to your liking.

This place has EVERRRRYTHING!!!!! 

Seriously. Californians are getting so reamed....paying more for less. Nothing in So Cal has come close to this place well unless the name is followed by "casino" and even then, you're paying twice as much accompanied by the cost of parking.

Hands down, I would definitely be willing to travel completely out of my way to come back here. I had 5 plates of food (and provided a star for each plate, lol) and left stuffed yet ....I still don't feel remotely as if I came close to sampling everything.

This place is the TRUTH!
