ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg Have you ever gone to a formal Chinese dinner and you sit on a round table with a lazy susan with 9 other friends or family.  I reminisce the servers preparing slices of crispy, fatty, rich peking duck skin, with a dab of hoisin and a sliver of green onion in a hot steamy bun.  They would make it one by one as my mouth watered, which seemed like an eternity before they finish making the 10 servings and placing them on the platter.  Onto the lazy susan it goes and one by one they disappear as your tablemates take one.  As it reaches your turn, you allowed to take one......ONE!  You quickly devour it only hoping someone doesn't like duck and there is extra....No luck!

This will never happen at Jasmine's Sunday brunch.  I know i wrote a note so good review of their imperial peking duck, but this is totally different.  The brunch is about $60 and IMHO the best buffet in vegas.  Unfortunately my focus was on the peking duck, tsui mai and seafood.  I easily ate my $60 worth of about 10 peking duck buns, 15 oysters, a dozen shrimp and probably about a 1lb of king crab.  The meats are forgettable, as they were dry and too thickly cut.

The duck...oh the duck.  Its freshly made on the buffet line, by a guy in a suit who expertly slices the crispy duck skins off a whole peking duck and prepares it just like you remember....but you get to take as many as you like......YES!

There is also a noodle station where i think they served pho, but thats not my thing, so i cannot confirm.

I can confirm they dessert room off to the side, where they had a whole room full of dessert samples, a chocolate fountain to dip marshmallows, fruit and rice crispy treats.  There is also an action station that served crepes, i believe.

The service is impeccable and the lakeside view of the Bellagio fountains is beautiful.  Im glad i gave Jasmine another chance as this is now my favorite vegas buffet.
