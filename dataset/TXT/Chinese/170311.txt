VVW8mxu8Ru2UR3lVJYA81Q Great place for customized soup noodles! Great options for the noodles, toppings and soup base. For soup base I usually like the Malaysian Laksa, peanut sauce and chili, or simple fish broth. Noodles are pretty standard depending on your preference. And I usually go for the beef brisket and tendon since veggies come standard with all bowls.
