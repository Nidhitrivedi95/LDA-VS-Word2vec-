The wait isnt too bad in the morning, only took about 5-10 minutes to be seated. They have pho, which is a big expensive when you compare it pho place back at home, but i guess it isnt too bad for Vegas. The Beef noodle soup with egg noodle was fulfilling  - they are not stingy with their noodles and meat. 

I will say though, the service wasn't all that great. It good forever to get a glass of water ad to pay our bill. We asked for our check and they gave it like 20 minutes later. 

It's worth trying, especially if you're craving pho.
