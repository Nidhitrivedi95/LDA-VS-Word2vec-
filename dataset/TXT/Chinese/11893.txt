2m4092MsMzEHkuxodaj6-g Is this a Japanese or Chinese restaurant? It's actually a fusion of both!!
We saw the Japanese and Chinese menus posted on the wall outside the restaurant.

We were quoted 20-30 minutes. Weird...because the place was empty. We gave them our phone number and got a call from the restaurant after 10 minutes. 

Ordered kung pao chicken ($13.00) and Yang Chow fried rice ($13.00). 

We knew it's Americanized when they served us complimentary crispy noodle appetizer with mustard and sweet & sour sauce. The food was okay, but my expectation was low. It was not bad for an Americanized restaurant and for the price.

3 stars!!

Ondori Asian Kitchen is almost yummylicious!!
