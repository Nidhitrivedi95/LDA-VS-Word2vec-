O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw Gave us tea that we didn't order, and charged us for the tea. I complained, and got told that it is on their menu that they will give customers tea, and charge for it. Strike 1. Received wrong amount of bill like everyone else below. Strike 2. I had nothing but Rol San food on that day, and when I got home, I was in food poisoning. Strike 3. NEVER AGAIN.
