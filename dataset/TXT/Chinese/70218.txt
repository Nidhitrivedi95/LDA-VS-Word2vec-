f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ This last trip, was the first time I've been back here. This use to be my go-to spot about 9 years ago when I lived in the Casino for 6 months. 

This time around, it's not as good as I remember it to be. Didn't seem fresh. We got here around 1:45 and that's not too late for Dim Sum. Shumai quality and flavor went down. Use to be one of my favorite here. But service was on point.
