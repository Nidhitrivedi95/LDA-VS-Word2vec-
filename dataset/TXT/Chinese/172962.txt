W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ Been wanting to try this place for a while. Went in, got seated immediately, place was super dead. Staff was very friendly. Ordered the teriyaki bowl and chicken wings.. One thing that bothered me was my boyfriends bowl game out 10 minutes before my wings so he was half way done by the time I got my wings.Teriyaki chicken was breaded.. Tasted greasy but good flavor. Chicken wings were deboned which was nice and had a good flavor but you only get 3.. The two items together were $25... Not terrible but left hungry..
