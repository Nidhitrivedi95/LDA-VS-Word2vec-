8vt3SbOLQjEk9btgltq1BQ Jessica is magnificent! I was looking for other options for my extreme allergies & general stress when I stumbled upon acupuncture. Jessica knows all about acupuncture, Chinese medicine and general health. I felt so comfortable the first time I came in & immediately knew this was for me. We decided weekly appointments would work for me. I feel like a new person. It's become a therapy/relaxation session for me. Even once I moved away I've since come back to see her because I don't want to find a new acupuncturist. Jessica you are wonderful and anyone who wants acupuncture should see her!
