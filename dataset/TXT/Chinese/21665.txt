The quality of food is exceptional and no MSG was detected in the food during our two meals at this restaurant. Although it's a bit pricy but it's worth it if you wanted to have a nice and light Chinese meal/snack in Las Vegas. Great customer service too!

Furthermore, the selection of wine in their wine list is not bad at all! Highly recommended!
