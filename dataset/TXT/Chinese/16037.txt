3TRgD3KLVis61eGvMZrykA Came here for lunch yesterday.  The place was packed.  My friend commented that he was the only white face in the whole joint.  The should tell you the kind of food they served.  Real deal Cantonese cooking with a little northern flavor thrown in.  They have a lunch menu with 2-3 dollars discount from their regular menu.
The meat ball porridge and the fish ball porridge were as good as any I ever had.  The sticky rice fried rice with dried sausage and dried pork belly was not stuck together, awesome. 
And then there is the service.  So un-Chinese restaurant.  Manager Bill made some great recommendations, and he is always checking on the diners.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive, they actually look at the customers when they are walking by and will stop if you wave at them, and they all speak fluent English, wow.
Will be back to check out some of the dinner specials.
