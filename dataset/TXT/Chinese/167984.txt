VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng TLDR: sodas/tea not free; to-go available; ample seating; no charge for leftovers

This Buffet @ Asia location reflects the hard work of employees in making this location safe for the public. Make no mistake: not all locations are the same. Be wary of the other ones!

The service up front and table side is pleasant. You must pay prior to seating and no refunds are made once the transaction has completed. A gratuity is charged for parties over 8, but they check waters often enough and the waiters/servers never stop moving. 

The food is par and not over the top. There isn't a flavor that stands out and it's pretty standard. It's what you expect at any Asian buffet place. Panda's express makes this location seem sub-par, but I'm sure others might frown upon my opinion. 

Drinks are not free. They cost $0.95 which is not a bad deal, but maybe you might want it for the Chinese tea. The restaurant also has a sushi bar and soft serve machine. The rice is too vinegary, but that probably means it's safe at any temperature.
