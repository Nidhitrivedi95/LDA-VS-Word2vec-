NKMkvLWatV9v7zbMNS6D3g After moving into the area I tried several terrible Chinese food places before I found this one. From the outside I wasn't really sure what to expect but I'm glad I took the dive. I've never had anything bad from Jackie Chen's (in all fairness I tend to stick to the same things). I've recommended this place to several people and they have all enjoyed their food. I've always taken food to go so I'm not sure what their sit-in experience is like. When I order to go my food is always ready quickly and hot and tasty when I get it home.  The best Chinese in the Parma/Old Brooklyn border area.
