szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A Well I'm afraid I cannot give a fair review. We arrived shortly after 8 PM and there were slim pickin's left on the buffet and they weren't in any hurry to put fresh food out. What little food I did try was OK. Will have to give it another shot at an earlier time I evening I guess. Very disappointed this time around.
