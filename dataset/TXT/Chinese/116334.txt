n72smZw1iVORdnjGfFT0FQ This used to be one of my benchmarks in Richmond Hill for well-priced and abundant Chinese fare, but in the last few months the quality of the food seems to be dropping and things have become a little average. The char siu was one of my favorite dishes because it was flavourful, crispy and well-executed, but has become too fatty, slightly undercooked and resembles boiled meat. The quality of the dim sum also has taken a turn for the worse. I've tried most of the items on the menu and it's quite a shame, I've been coming here for years but now look for some new options as far as a Hong Kong-style take-out in the area.
