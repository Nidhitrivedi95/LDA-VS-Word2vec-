HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Definitely a different concept: Asian street fare in an American diner. The server was very nice and suggestive on the menu. We waited a long time for our food but when the food came, it was actually very enjoyable. The potstickers were very nice in taste, I enjoyed the dumpling sauce. The best part of my visit was trying the duck and the pork belly baos. The duck had the right crisp and I loved the sauce/veggies. The pork belly was very tender but I definitely enjoyed the duck bao more. I also ordered the sesame noodles and that was O-K. I expected it to be much more umami and tastier. 

I would try them again but I do not care for the location so idk.
