yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I really wanted to give this place stars but when you live in the Bay Area and have access to so many pho spots this place just does not meet the mark.  Especially when they want to charge 8.50 a medium bowl..... The decor has been updated since last yet the service and food is the same.. just pricier.  I have heard that their crab/crayfish night is the fun/tasty however I have yet to experience it.  This review is based on 8 different returns to the restaurant... different times of year, different years.  Yeahhhhhh-- not again.
