3fw2X5bZYeW9xCz_zGhOHg I have visited here a few times for dessert and each time, I had a great experience. 

For the decor, it's this traditional Chinese themed, with stools as chairs. They aren't comfy but they still seat you. 

Let's get to the food. I don't know about you, but I love their water. The water that they serve is actually with red dates, and it tastes amazing. For dessert, I've ordered from the shaved ice to the herbal jelly to the walnut paste. For savoury food, I've tried their steamed chicken rice in a clay pot  and the rice noodle roll. All I can say is I haven't been disappointed with the desserts, but it doesn't blow your mind, it's what you expect with your usual Chinese dessert.

And the service is okay...nothing impressive but nothing great either. 

What's worth trying? Definitely their savoury foods - surprisingly you see a lot of people order food here and it's pretty good.

Tips: if you plan to order the steamed chicken rice in a clay pot, be prepared to wait for 20 mins! 

I have returned multiple times so I would recommend it.
