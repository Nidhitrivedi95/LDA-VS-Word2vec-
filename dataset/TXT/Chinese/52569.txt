cjatara6LkXRu2BXD_jxlA This new place opened up recently and my party of 5 showed up at 7:30 pm on a Friday night to check out what the hype is all about. 

We arrived to see a huge lineup, and we were worried that it would be a long wait. They said it would take an hour or so for a table, but luckily, you can leave your name and number and they will call you once they have a table for you. We took their offer and hung out at one of the BBT places in the same plaza for 35 minutes or so before they were ready for us. 

Their charcoal grill is visible when you walk in through the front door and all the seating is in the back. It is actually pretty spacious and well ventilated. It didn't smell like charcoal when I entered and didn't leave with any smell on my clothes.

We ordered the following:
- Lamb
- Beef
- Chicken
- Chicken Joints
- Chicken Heart
- Beef Artery
- Grilled Oysters
- Enoki Mushrooms
- Whole Squid
- Garlic shrimp

NOTE: When they say "4 pcs", its actually 4 skewers for each order. So if you mark 3 beef, you will have a total of 12 beef skewers. 

The order didn't take long to arrive at all. I am guessing a rough 5-10 minutes wait between ordering and the food arriving, and the food all arrived in a hurry!

We must have ordered at least 40-50 skewers, and somehow, we managed to finish most of it.

The food wasn't that bad, but they put a lot of spices and seasoning on them. Might be too salty and spicy for some. The typical ones were pretty good (Beef, Chicken, Lamb), and the grilled oysters were spot on. Keep in mind you are at a skewers place, don't expect the moon.

I liked the beef skewers the most as they were juicy, tasty and the most flavourful. Pretty much everything tasted the same since they used the same spice rub on most of the meat. 

The veggies and the seafood are wrapped in a tinfoil packet and is cooked on the grill. They weren't that great, as there wasn't much of a taste to them besides the hot pepper they placed while cooking them. 

Avoid the garlic shrimp and the beef artery, they were bland and really hard to chew. 

Bottled Water (yes, you read that right) is free, (chilled or room temp). Pop + Alcohol are extra. The alcohol is pretty pricey, not worth it in my opinion.  

We finished at around 10, and the line and crowd really thinned out at around 9 ish. If you are looking for a meaty meal late night, come after 9 and you should be okay to get a spot. They are opened til 2 am after all. 

Would I go again? Probably, but not any time soon. Not something would every week, or even month.



TLDR: 
Pretty Decent Skewers place. 
Don't be scared of the lineup.
Come after 9 pm if you want a short lineup. 
Most (if not all) of the food is spicy. 
Stick with the basics (Chicken, Beef, Lamb). 
Avoid Garlic Shrimp.
CASH only (at the time of this review)
