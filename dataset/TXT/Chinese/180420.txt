X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg DOES NOT DESERVE ONE STAR!

The WORST experience ever! In town to celebrate the hubby's birthday and to see Steve Aoki perform. Was excited to have made VIP table reservations, but as soon as we got there, IT WAS SO UNORGANIZED! There were no lines for VIP guests, and the guy who was handling the list was a total asshole, letting people who he knew in only and making up the excuse that they didn't have enough runners, but some how those people who came in late were able to pass everyone else. Like what kind of shitty service is this? 

I guess this is what we get for going cheap! Decided to go elsewhere and drop 6k on better service than $2500 for this shit. 

We are never going here again!
