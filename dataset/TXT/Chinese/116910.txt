NbaP_lZTns_GbTSkQz_KIw This place is large and spacious! Lots of tasty treats all around! 

All of our food that came out in the baskets were steaming hot! Only few selections of food when waiters walk around with food carts, the rest is ordered on a sheet of paper. 

Very hard to find parking spot in busy times, so I'd suggest coming a little early.

As for the food - LOTS of food to pick from, even if you're a picky eater, there's something on the menu that I'm sure you'd like. The food all came out fresh and quick!

The servers don't talk much but are still fairly helpful when asked for help.
