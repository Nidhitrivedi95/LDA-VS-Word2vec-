ccdcyzc1oSucd-qRlnYR0w I would rank this place closer to 1.5 stars.  I like their super large (and cheap) helping of crab ragoon, but not much else.

Everything else here has been pretty gross.  I had their duck once, and it was super old duck.  I'm sure it was cooked for at least 3 days and then stuck in the oven to heat up, so it was super dry, tough, and disgusting.  That pretty much sums everything up.

Every time I come here, I am disappointed.  Why I continue to visit is beyond me.
