KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA Found this place through Yelp. It's an amazing place. Awesome food. The people actually care and help you with the food selection. The food tastes amazing had tandoori chicken, reshmi chicken + the manager suggested we should try their signature Butter chicken Nachos, they were just amazing.. We were a group of 8 and we order 1 drink per person and 3-4 appetizers and 4 veg/non veg dishes along with Naans and Shrimp Biryani. Our bill came up to $220 (with taxes & gratuity included) But we got a 10% discount through Yelp :-). I would for sure visit again this time for Dosas. In all an amazing place..:-)
