bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Where to begin?! The food is AMAZING. I can't pick my favorite but we loved pot stickers, shrimp fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, and lo mein. It was all so good. 
Also the entertainment was AMAZING!! So much fun and such a variety during tribute night. From Elvis to show tunes to Whitney Houston- they brought in really talented performers. The owner is insanely talented and super friendly. I plan to go see their piano night and guitar night too!
