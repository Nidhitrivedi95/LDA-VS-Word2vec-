qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A I love PF Changs and this location represents the chain well! 

My group landed here after celebrating a friends birthday at Pinot's Pallete. After 3 bottles of wine, and 2 hours of drunk painting, we needed food! 

They took our party of 6 in despite the fact that they were closing in 15 minutes. I was fearing that the waiter would give us bad vibes and attitude for keeping him after closing time but to my surprise he was extremely pleasant. David knew the menu well and even went out of his way to find a drink that tasted similar to what we wanted to order since they did not carry a liquor we needed to make the shot.

Food at PF Changs is always the same despite the location so it's hard to write a review on the food but when good service is given it is important to acknowledge it. David was kind, efficient, personable and hardworking. He dealt with our wild group of 6 well and I appreciate him for the great experience.
