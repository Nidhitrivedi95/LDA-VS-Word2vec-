hw1g0S9HtNKSH4dJl8-oPw Why O' why did I not check yelp before I went here??? Stupid.  Worst place EVER, if the zombie apocalypse happened and this was the only place with food I would STARVE.  It cost $50 for 4 people, you pay first so your screwed when when you actually see the food.  The place was HOTTER than Hades, table was dirty, no ice in the ice tea and something was floating in it.  Nasty kids coughing all over the place.  They had very little food which was probably a blessing in disguise, I picked up a piece of sweet n sour or should I say sponge of oil?? We walked straight out of that place and went to McDonalds.
