oRgoOhwCex1X9j1iQ9ou3w came here many times after we discovered it. I've learnt the trick - arrive around 930-10, you get a nice seat right away, relaxing while you order, fresh food appear on the table as you laugh at the starved suckers that are lining up. (no seriously i refuse to go and line up for an hour and half for dim sum on a weekend morning, this place is so buzy it's like.. not even humane) only problem is getting up in the morning on a sat is kind of tough.

amazing dim sum for a fabulous price! nope i don't own the restaurant or anything but you MUST come and try it!
