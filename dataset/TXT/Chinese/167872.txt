VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng Came here for dinner, place wasn't busy when we arrived.  We came here mostly for their crab legs and sushi and I have no complaints on that, sushi were fresh and the crab legs were continuously brought out and other food as well. Overall the food were great and our waitress was very nice, I didn't see any stacked plates on our table, she was always walking by removing plates from her area, she was very attentive.
