I am a fan of their authentic Chinese food, but their non-traditional Chinese food is even better and this is the only place in Urbana-Champaign that reminds me of Chinese restaurants in Chicago. And that's a good thing for HOG.

Their fried rice is amazing as always, I usually get the Shrimp or Combination and the entire staff there is friendly. Gotta love this place. If you haven't visited it yet, you should.
