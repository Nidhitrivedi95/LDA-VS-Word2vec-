Qn5QMHOV6f5uHbxvrTPGRA I decided to try ordering from their food truck today.  They had a lunch special for $12 which was noodles and 6 dumplings.  The food smelled wonderful.  The dumpling sauce was a bit spicy to me. Fortunately I like spicy food.  Unfortunately there was cilantro in it and I'm very sensitive to cilantro.  Even a little piece will ruin the entire dish for me so I was disappointed with that.  I'm not sure if it's possible to get it without the cilantro but it may be worth asking because it was otherwise delicious.  For the noodles they were out of everything but the Dan Dan noodles.  When I took a bite they were good but a bit dry.  I then realized the sauce was on the bottom of the dish so I mixed everything up.  Once I did that the noodles were delicious but a bit too spicy even for me, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately the rest of the day my stomach has been very upset (it still is even 12 hours later).  I think it may have been all the spice or perhaps an oil they used that bothered my stomach. I'm not sure I'd try it again but if I ever do, I'd definitely order something different.
