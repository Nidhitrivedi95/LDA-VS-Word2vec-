Their soup broth very flavorful. I only tried the Hauxing Fried Egg Noodle, but it had a great tomatoey flavor to it. But what really blew me away about this place was their Chili Oil Chaoshou. The Chili Oil had such a deep and complex flavor. It was salty, sweet, spicy, savory... But none of the individual flavors were too overpowering. 

There's this cool modern style that resonates throughout the restaurant from their menus to the good presentation. I can't wait to return.
