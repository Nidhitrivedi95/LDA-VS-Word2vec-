l9vx-OTdDPU-oHZ17aVxdg I won't wade into the authentic Hakka vs. South Asian Chinese fusion debate, but I will say that Federick (not Fred) is my fave spicy hakka chinese joint in the city, bar none.
Since they renovated both locations, it's a decent date atmosphere, if a bit crowded and hectic, and the food is second to none. Not upscale and fussy, it's large portions of well-prepared, hearty, spicy deliciousness.

Standouts include the best-in-the-city Chicken Pakora, intense dry Chili Chicken, addictive Kan Shue Green Beans, and my guilty pleasure, the Lunch Special Sweet & Sour Shrimp, over fried rice. The regular sweet and sour shrimp are large and bouncy, but the lunch special shrimp are smaller, but there is an obscene number of shrimp for $6!  Truth is that I've never had a dish I didn't love here.

Go! Enjoy!
