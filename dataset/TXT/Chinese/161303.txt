udKD_WVoQZYww1sDYdebPw The prices, service and food here are all swell! It's a tiny joint with hand drawn signs and crappy little chairs, which makes it kind of cute. The staff are very friendly and attentive.

Last time I came, I ordered a lunch special that came with stir-fried vegetables, sweet and sour chicken balls, and a mound of vegetable fried rice. Twas all scrumptious.

Portion sizes are generous, so you will leave here with a full belly AND wallet. Woohoo!
