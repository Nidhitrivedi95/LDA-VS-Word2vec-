OUB81Dpb6m7HjW4ZmeSlmw These tasty little snacks are dirt cheap. You can get two for 6 and a half bucks. They are so tasty. I love the spongy bread things (bao) and the variety of fillings. I always get jerk chicken filling. These guys get 'fusion' right. Great spot for a quick and delicious snack on Queen and Bathurst.
