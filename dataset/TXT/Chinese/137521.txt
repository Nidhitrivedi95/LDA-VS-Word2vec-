qJ18IGaDsQtzJ6v2UzkdcQ On this particular evening we were "those" kind of people rolling in approximately 20 minutes to closing.  One might be met with some attitude while messing up the end of the night routine; this was not the case and the welcome was warm.  

I ordered up a dinner combination which consisted of General Tso's chicken.  Combination included soup, egg roll, crab rangoon, and fried rice.  Craving noodles, I went with a $1 noodle upgrade.  The noodles were just dandy!

The meal was hot and fresh.  The quality of service never lingered.  I look forward to returning.
