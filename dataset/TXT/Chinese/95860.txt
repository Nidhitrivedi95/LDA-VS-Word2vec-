JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA Horrible, horrible service (more like non-existent); mediocre food; more expensive than places that serve a similar menu... Need I say more? 

Have been here more than once because of one reason or the other, and in the end, it just really wasn't worth it. And to top it off, you gotta get your own water! Such a weird establishment...
