ecn5dq7bFA6wCeeNnXxSzw I like the Wei. I enjoy your kung pao shrimp, lettuce wraps, Pei Wei spicy chicken, and a recent fan of the lemon pepper shrimp. 

I have not been able to find a decent Chinese take out by me. The west side is being dissed no pizza, no china-men, no fish. I need to open a restaurant clearly. 

I find the dishes to be large, tasty, and relatively inexpensive. It's Chinese take out and next to the places I have tried in the area Pei Wei is a rock star!
