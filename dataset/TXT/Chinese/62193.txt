DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA Even giving one star is too much for this restaurant.

We ordered fried shimp with eggs, saw it on the menu for $12.95 with rice. We told them we didn't want the rice, just the shrimp with eggs, they ended up charging us $17.95 for it, we confronted the staff and said that is a regular dish and not a rice plate and it costs that much.

The rest of the food were full of msg, the bbq pork was nasty tasting, the whole night, all 4 of us were drinking water none stop from the msg thirst.

On top of that, they charged us 18% tip added to the bill, for this calibre of restaurants, and for a table of 4 only, what right do they have to add the 18% tip to the bill? And cash only??!

Never coming back and no one should come here either.
