OfqTPtPSQfCVxaSlY4qAxg Good for cantonese style bbq with whole ducks hanging and bbq pork on display. BUT today when we visited, we watched the owner come in through the front door, put on his apron and immediately grabbed a duck and started chopping away for my duck lo mein. Didnt wash his hands first! Who knows where he just came from.
