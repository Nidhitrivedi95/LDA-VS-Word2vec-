eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ MMMMM Umami! 

When this place opened, it took me a long time to try it. Not sure why. Maybe the location and parking? Maybe because it's in what appears to be an old single family home converted to a restaurant? Who knows. All I do know is, I should have just gone because when I finally did, I was so impressed. 

First visit we sat at the bar for dinner. Our bartender was great. Chatty and attentive but not in your face. We both ordered ramen, different kinds. SO. GOOD. I am pretty picky with ramen. Texture of eggs, ingredients thrown in, the flavoring - it was all perfect. I was really happy with my selection. 

My second visit was for brunch. I wasn't sure what the menu would have for brunch as I typically only associate ramen and the like with dinner. We had bacon dumplings, the omurice (rice omelette) and the biscuits and tonkotsu gravy. Everything was really good! 

I definitely recommend Umami!
