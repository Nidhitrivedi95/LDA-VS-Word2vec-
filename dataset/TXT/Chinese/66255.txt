eh9e2wfsXNRa4BgVSXUu7g Never coming again. Small cafe that's pretty aged and dirty. The breakfast menu is written only in Chinese, but the All Day menu on the opposite side has both languages. I asked the cashier if there was an English translation to the breakfast, to which she replies that both sides are the same. Umm, no they're not. Had to get my mom to order for me. 
They mixed up our order and gave us the wrong type of noodle.  They also messed up other people's orders too. My mom's soup noodle was supposed to be vermicelli, but they gave her ho fun. Ok fine, not a big deal but you could tell they were just going to push us take to it no matter what.   My own bowl had a pink lipstick mark on the inside. At that point I was done bc this is exactly the type of place that would just pour your food into another questionably clean bowl and hand it back to you. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is bc their milk tea is good, although I would consider it the same as every place that brews a decent pot. 
Go to their other Markham location that's on 16th Avenue, much better quality food,  reasonably clean and much better service
