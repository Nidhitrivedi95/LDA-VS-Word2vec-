There are several thai places around and they've been okay. The one I really like is a little ways away and is a bit expensive. We finally tried this place that is actually walking distance from our house. 

I got the red curry and it was fantastic. I've got my thai place. 

Then my kid let's me try his orange chicken. And bam, I've got my chinese place. 

We will definitely be back. Diane was a great server. In fact, now that I think about it, the service was crazy good. She asked if I wanted more rice and before she'd left the table someone had some there. Same with the drinks. She asked the drinks then asked our order and by the time I was done with ordering, a guy showed up with my drink. I think she was punching the order into an iPad thing, but it was super quick. 

Anyway, fantastic. Great food. Great service. Oh and it's cheaper than the other thai place I liked.
