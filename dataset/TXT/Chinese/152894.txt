t5vvlSgoeHF9uY6VkokmSg A very typical Chinese business: you either get acceptable service for a low price or you get really shitty service for a low price. Unfortunately, I got the shitty service.

I ordered delivery from them but the driver ever came. An hour after I ordered, i called to see if the driver was on his way, and of course I was promised the food was on the way already. Another half hour passed by and the food still didn't come. 

Oh well, that's what you get for buying Chinese food sometimes.
