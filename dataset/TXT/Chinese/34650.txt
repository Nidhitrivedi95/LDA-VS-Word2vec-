We got one of the last tables, for two, stuck in the corner, but still happy to be seated.  The menu's arrive and my husband has already made up his mind, but tonight, they are out of duck!

So we both end up with a combination BBQ plate and shared a side order of noodle.  The noodle was good, my BBQ plate was decent.  The fact that they are busy, the service was just fair, and we missed out on their specialty. 

 I enjoyed people watching, there were so many people, obviously not from Vegas, talking non stop, and getting dish after dish.  I think that one big table, got everything on the menu!  That's probably why we were after thought in our server's mind.

It's worth a trip back, to get the duck and see if we agree with so many others, that it's in the top 100!  We just need to figure out when they are slow.
