AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA A restaurant where everything is vegan/vegetarian??  OMG yes.  So much yes.  I can't remember what I had, since my date ordered for me, but it was SO good.  I met Chef Kenny, as well, and he's a sweet guy.  The server was very attentive and friendly, and took good care of us.  I look forward to coming back here many times!!
