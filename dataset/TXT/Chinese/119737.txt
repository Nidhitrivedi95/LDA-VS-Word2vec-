NyGlEmuYcpZSKfk6IwJeSw Tavernakaya has grown on me quite a bit since my first visit, which was closer to 2-3 stars. They have a variety of really tasty Japanese food and the new space/atmosphere is versatile for many different occasions. 

It can get crowded during the weekend rush, but recently, it's been easier to get a table. Their bartenders are awesome and they have great happy hour specials (4-6pm M-F, $3 Sapporo and Spotted Cow!). Also, they have a prosecco on the drink menu that is comparable to other wines. I normally don't order sparkling wine out, but if it's the same price, why not!

I think my favorite menu items to get are the sushi rolls. On my most recent visit, our table got the Madtown roll and the TKO roll; both quite good. I also got the miso soup to start, and it was a bit higher quality than what I'm used to. On a previous visit, I had gotten the General Tso's Cauliflower, and that's also one of my favs. The tuna tartare was small for the price and just ok. The fried rice dishes are pretty standard They have recently expanded the menu a bit so that the sushi items are on the back. That's a nice touch, because it was a bit confusing before and the options were limited. 

TK also hosts DJs on most weekend nights, which gives the place a totally different vibe. Make sure to check their event page before going to see if there's a cover! Sometimes there is. 

Our service was a bit shaky this last time and seems to be a theme. Nothing that ruined the meal, just a number of people bringing food to the table while our waitress was MIA for most of it. We asked for water 3 separate times until someone finally brought a pitcher over.

I can't wait to try brunch and see what other DJs are playing in the next few months.
