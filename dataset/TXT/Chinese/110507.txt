Lv9wzkvPrVG-VdPGcw53_A went there for a birthday dinner last week. The place was busy, with many large tables already started eating. 

Ordered lobster & crab set dinner. The food came relatively quick. However, most of the dishes were salty enough to make everyone drink water or tea. The lobster after cooking did not feel worth its weight before cooking, and the extra charges for the <U+907F><U+98A8><U+5858> style, was not worth it, due to the lack of ingredients. All other dishes were just average, and a bit salty.

The service was good though, which earned the  place an additional star.

IMO, Fisherman Wharf lost its touch when compared to Fisherman Club down the street.
