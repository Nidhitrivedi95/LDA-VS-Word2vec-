omMiNDhPYAX4TPfv4xrBLQ One of the best asian cusine plavces I have been to here in Las Vegas.

From the hot and sour soup to the main entrees, such as the orange chicken and creme cheese wontons, this place was amazing.

The food was amazing, fresh and presentation was on point!

I highly recommend Asian Fusion to anyone who wants some authentic asian cuisine
