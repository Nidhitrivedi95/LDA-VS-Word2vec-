ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w This was my best dim sum experience in the GTA and I've been to my fair share of dim sum restaurants.  Their dim sum is elevated without being over expensive.  For example, I find the quality to be similar to Lai Wah Heen, but at a more affordable price.  The custard bunny dessert dumplings are famous for a reason, and all the other dishes we got were on point.  No complaints.
