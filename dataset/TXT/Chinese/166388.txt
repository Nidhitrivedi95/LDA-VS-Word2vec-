VbY4yD6UmA9jKKxHscrxvg I had heard such great things about this place prior to my first visit. Maybe my expectations were too high. The sushi was delicious but I could not get my server to return so that I could order more of it. We were engulfed in conversation until someone in my party brought up that it had been thirty minutes since our waitress had been over to check on us. We had to ask another waitress for help. After that it was another thirty minutes before we got our second order. I don't think it takes that long to cook. Our first order came out promptly so it was weird that the second one took so long. I hope that is not the policy but the food was good enough to try it again and maybe we will get the right server.
