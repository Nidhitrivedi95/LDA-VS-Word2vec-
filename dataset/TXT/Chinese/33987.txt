AbgNPAnuq8X90DUw5FQ2sQ One of my favorite "tsah tsan tangs" (HK style cafe). Modern trendy restaurant with pink and blue touches that somehow work well together. This place has interactive ipads and kinect at the entrance for kids to play. The food combinations are just as unique as their decor - baked meal in brick toast, lobster yee mein, soft shell crab fried rice, pumpkin congee. Not the best in terms of taste compared to Congee Queen but definitely yummy and makes me want to go back and excited to try another unique dish next time.
