_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg We only go here if absolutely, positively...necessary. My partner ordered the Mongolian beef last night and he said there was a lot of gristle in it. I don't know about you but that kind of turns my stomach. The spring rolls are fine and the lo-mein is passable. Just plan on taking your order out as the kids they have working the front are none too friendly. I went to the restroom and the bathroom had several small live and dead roaches in it. I had to make sure I got out of there as quickly as possible before one of them crawled on me! I don't know about you, but if a restaurant has a nasty bathroom, it says volumes about the kitchen. I do not want to come back here. Shame, considering they kind of make up their own hours and stay open sometimes until 2:30am.
