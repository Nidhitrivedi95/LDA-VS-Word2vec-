GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw Hands down the best Chinese food I've had in Cleveland. Nice decor, very fast service.
Had the jasmine bubble tea which was a bit sweet and milk based- fresh bubbles (tapioca) which was nice.
The menu had a lot to chose from- we had the seczhuan chili chicken which was SPICY but very tasty & fried.
The beef & vegetable pot was excellent- less spicy than the chicken but very good. Nice portion size- we had plenty of leftovers. Can't wait to go back & try other things on the menu!
