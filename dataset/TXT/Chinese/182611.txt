XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA Most of the dishes is of asian origin and excellent.  Lots of shrimp dishes.  The sushi bar selection is basic, but good for a buffet.   Grilled dishes such korean kal-bi and asparagus brings something a little different. 

Lunches are really good deal.  Dinner adds additional dishes such as snow crab legs, frog legs, snails and sashimi along with a higher price.

Staff is good with some of the wait staff working there for years.
