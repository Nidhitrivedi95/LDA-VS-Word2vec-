TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ We ordered:
Mixed Chinese appetizers with peanuts, thinly sliced tofu and pig's ears. They were not kidding when when they said its spicy (but in a good way). Not for everyone especially the pig's ears. Okay to try once. 

Beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles- broth has a hint of sweetness due to the sweet pickle. It's different but I'm willing to try it again in the future. 

Beef rolls- beef is thinly sliced and tender. Very good. 

Green onion pancake- crispy especially on the sides. We like it. 

I love the decor and the way are the round tables are separated by the circular privacy walls. Very chic. 

Overall, good food, fast service, reasonable price. Will definitely be back. :)
