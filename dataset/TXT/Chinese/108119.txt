LGZPjmhEg2QYeGZ2PKnpQw Pretty solid dim sum! 

Definitely one of the better places; not overly salty or oily and good portions/presentation. Dishes are served hot and ready (dim sum served cold is a big no no) and service is quick. Dim sum selection is pretty standard, although I've had better beef meatballs. 

I wouldn't recommend any type of spring rolls though (taro was a big mistake LOL), they're just incredibly oily and generally tasteless. I tried the Foie Gras special that was essentially a piece of foie gras and a piece of fruit I can't remember (mango?) wrapped in a spring roll and fried. I feel like they used duck and the consistency was like jello...felt like it's kind of a waste to use the ingredient like this. Dim Sum is a little more expensive than other places, but the decor and environment is more upscale. Place is also a lot larger than it looks (many VIP rooms).

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place for dim sum! Solid food and comfortable environment.
