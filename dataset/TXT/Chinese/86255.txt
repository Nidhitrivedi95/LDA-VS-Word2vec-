HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA One of the best burgers I ever ate.  The fat choy came out on a buttered brioche type bun and high atop the burger was this absolutely perfectly cooked sunnyside up egg.  I was so darn good, I had to give half to my hubby.  We also shared the pork belly bao, which was outstanding and the won ton soup.  t was about 9:30 when we got there and there were 2 people sitting at the counter and then two women walked in to pick up a to go order.  It was very clean inside and all the bar stools at the counter were perfectly lined up at an angle.  This was my first time dining there and I will certainly be back.
