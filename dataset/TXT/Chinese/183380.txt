xP2zIIqXxW8QNiJqJyE92A First time we have been to this Chinese restaurant!
We saw good things on yelp about this restaurant, everything was true, food was delicious and the portions huge.  Cozy little restaurant, friendly. Pictures of everything on the menu! Thank god we shared some of the dishes. The Won Ton soup was split by the four of us with. Several seconds. Egg Foo young was also huge and my friend Adrian and I couldn't finish it so she took home lunch for tomorrow as didMark who couldn't finish his pepper steak. We will be sure to go back again! Sorry we didn't take any pictures.
