hbuVhfMb8r3kVNZ-thX16g Honestly I had a great experience and I ordered on grub hub. Usually grub hub orders take a long time and they bring my food cold but not from little dumpling. I ordered orange chicken and their appetizer combo with steamed rice. First off it was ALOT OF FOOD and it tasted great. I liked it definitely replacing Panda Express from now on!
