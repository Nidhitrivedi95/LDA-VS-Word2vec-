8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ Well presented and great tasting. I had the hot and sour soup, 2 egg rolld, and a seafood basket made of fried noodles with shrimp, scallops, fish, asparagus,  snow peas, and a veggie I could not quite identify. All were great and made for quite a feast.....but not cheap. I will be back.
