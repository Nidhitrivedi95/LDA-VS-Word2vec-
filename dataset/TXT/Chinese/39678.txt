aWu1homxB6lciXU6-ZlpSQ Hmm...is it me??  Granted I don't have much experience with Taiwanese food, I wasn't thrilled with my food.  

I ordered some stinky tofu and beef stew lunch box with bitter melon, chinese greens and green bean sides.  The stinky tofu was more pungent than I expected it to be and the vegetable sides all had a very similar spicing which made it difficult to enjoy.  

I may try out Wei's again with my sister-in-law who is from Taiwan and see what her opinion is.  Until then, I remain....not a fan.  Boo....
