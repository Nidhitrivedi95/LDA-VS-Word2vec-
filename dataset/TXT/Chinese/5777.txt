0c6PQILCLwRZ8FIB4AEsGw I wanted to find a place close to home that served Fried Pork Chops so I could eat it with our leftover Chinese food. When I called in my order I asked if it was enough for 3 people. The lady said ,"I don't know it depends how much you eat". I thought that was funny ...but for the record it was more then enough for three people. We even had left overs that lasted for one or two more meals. It tasted okay it wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it to be and it had a weird aftertaste. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying out one of their lunch specials though.
