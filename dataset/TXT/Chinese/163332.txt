UpXigk3SzQR9v4xct_xEVQ Please reconsider of going to Mandarin unless you want massive diarrhea after, this is the worst buffet I have ever been to in my life, it's not even real chinese food yet alone even edible food, I did not eat half of the food on my plate because honestly it's garbage....they had chocolate covered bacon, like seriously is this CNE or something..,,oh yea and bacon lettuce tomato sushi, WTFFFFF is going on with this place and their made up creations

I can't believe I paid $26 for this...the only thing good about this place is the service but almost all the cooks and servers did not speak English......we asked where the sour cream was and they pointed us to the whip cream......this place gives chinese food a bad rep. 

You have been warned don't be fooled by their stupid mandarin commercials!!!!
