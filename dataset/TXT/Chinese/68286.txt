eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ Very much just a small great place to eat.  Everything I've had here is great and I try new things all the time.  My wife loves the Pad Se Ew with extra chinese broccolli  and the vegetable rolls.  The Tom Kha Kai is the creamiest that you'll ever find, Red Curry, Spicy Beef Salad, Silver Noodle Salad, Rad Na, Papaya Salad, Thai Beef Jerky, Curry Fried Rice, Seafood and Fish Dishes, they are all awesome.  If you don't mind the humble surroundings and just want great Thai food be sure to try it out when you are on the East side.
