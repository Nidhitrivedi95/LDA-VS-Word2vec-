But I decided to sit tight because I will go through WHATEVER I have to, if I suspect there is a decent vegetarian dish to be had at a great price.

And boy, did I have a good one. I ordered the Lemongrass Tofu, and asked for it extra crispy! They prepared it exactly the way I like it and for WAY LESS than I'd pay for the Lemongrass Chicken at Vegetarian House. Plus it's near my office so I can go there for lunch! Yay!
