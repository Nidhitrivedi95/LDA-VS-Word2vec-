GKmbGnQ2WmlU7ntVPI4mYA I would be remiss if I said nothing was good, because the egg rolls were good and the white rice, because it's white rice and that was pretty good. But everything else was kind of sub par. Maybe it's what I ordered. The quality of the chicken on the general tso's was really bad. You hope for crispy chicken with a spicy sauce, but this is soggy and the breading is gross. The lo mien hardly has any vegetables, and is also pretty bleh. Stay far away from the crab rangoons. 

I wanted to like this place, I had gone to the one in Vermilion and was even more disappointed. Seeing these reviews, and knowing it was under different management  I thought it would be better. The people in the restaurant love it, but it's gross.
