fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A I came in to have dim sum with my parents but unfortunately they only serve it for lunch. It was too late to turn back so we ordered a couple of dishes which included the egg soup, the beef with vegetables, fried squid, and sizzling scallops. The egg soup, sizzling scallops, and fried squid were decent. However the beef with vegetables was sooooo hard to chew to the point where I didn't bother to try it. The food is very bland and needs more flavor/salt. The steam rice was also very hard too. 

However, the service provided was wonderful. Maybe because there were only 3 small groups in the restaurant? They continued to check on us and made sure we had refills on the hot tea. So that's why I'm giving them a 3. I will definitely be back to try the dimsum.
