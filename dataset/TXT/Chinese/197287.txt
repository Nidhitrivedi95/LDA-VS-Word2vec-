ZQqiZAC4H4SI82W3RmaTKA So the one day i didn't bring lunch to work i decided to drive around the office to see what sounded good. I saw this place and said "what the heck. Ill give it a try" and let me tell you IT IS THE BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT I have EVER been too! The services was AWESOME and the food! OMG THE FOOD! was DE-LI-CIOUS! So good, i told my boyfriend that we must go there together! I had the Spicy chicken lunch special with fried rice and it came with an egg roll. I think the price was right too! I most definitely recommend!
