1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA The food is really affordable! It's a godsend when things in Vegas can get pretty pricey. Came here for a late dinner and there were only a couple other tables occupied. I ordered the famous Hainan chicken rice, and my friend ordered the chicken curry. We also got an order of the roti and chinese broccoli to share. The Hainan chicken rice was...mediocre. I really wanted it to be amazing. The chicken was OK. It wasn't quite a moist and silky as I was hoping. The rice could have been a bit more fragrant. I know I can't really be that picky when it comes to Hainanese Chicken rice as there aren't too many options. The chicken curry was flavorful, but would have liked it to be a bit spicier (or spicy at all). Finally, we ordered the stir fried chinese broccoli that came on a hot place. It was actually my favorite part, but they did leave some of the tougher parts of the veggie, and I personally don't like that part of the vegetable, but for the most part, the Chinese broccoli was nice and crisp.
