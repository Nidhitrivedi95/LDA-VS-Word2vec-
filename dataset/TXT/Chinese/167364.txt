I've only been for a few casual meals all of which were great. But I try to go back when I can. I know it gets a little crazy later at night but I prefer an early dinner here since the food is the star attraction. 

Where else can you go for dim sum, dumplings, pizza, chips and salsa/guac, and pita with a hummus-esque dip. Personal faves are the 3 cup chicken, spicy cheese wontons, and basically any pizza.
