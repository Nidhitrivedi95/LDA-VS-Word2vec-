_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Honestly it is so damn hard to find a descent Asian place to eat near Palazzo. Why?! We just wanted Korean food and walked to Ginseng 3 which is apparently closed for renovations so we walked back to our hotel and came here. 
It's right in the casino by the poker room and although it was really busy we got seated right away (small party) and was greeted fairly promptly. Our food came out much faster than my expectations and also exceeded my taste expectations!
We ordered the schezuan beef soup and chick mushroom vegetable soup which both hit the spot. AND THEY HAVE ASAHI HOORAY!!
The beef soup was so salty though and thank goodness I asked for less spicy...
Overall pretty cheap and easy option to those staying at the hotel!! Not quite sure if it's worth the travel if you're elsewhere. 
Bon appetit!!
