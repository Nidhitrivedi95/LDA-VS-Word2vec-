0k5W44XU4uSEsPA163LKjQ Worst Panda ever. I love Panda, but cannot stand this location and the kids that work there. Out of the 5 times I've gone there (because its close to my house), I have not had a single good experience. I will never go back, hopefully. Not only are they rude, the give horrible portions, cold food and their soda never has syrup in it. Had to pull out of the drive thru and walk inside every time to get soda that didn't taste like carbonated water. last trip, when I told the employee the soda did not have syrup in it, he was rude and blew me off. they have been rude every time I went there. I made the mistake of asking for lite to no veggies, they said they would try, but when I got home, I saw they actually gave me extra veggies and only 2 pieces of chicken. There is plenty more I can write. Save yourself, do not go to this location!!!!!!
