J_btDyZbIv0hZNjrw56zlA I thought this place was great.
Needed Chinese take out on New Year's Eve and didn't know where to go. I took the first parking space i could find on Spadina and walked till i found a really busy restaurant, pledging to order take out from there.
Plan worked perfectly.
Took a couple of blocks to find a really busy place and saw New Sky.  It was packed to over-flowing. And with cause.
Ordered three dishes:Scallops with vegetables: Scallops cooked perfectly (at a time when the kitchen must have been insanely busy),  Beef and broccoli. Beef tender and tasty.  And seafood rice. Yum.
Will definitely be back because it is a really great Chinese restaurant.
However, quiet it is not.

Enjoy.
