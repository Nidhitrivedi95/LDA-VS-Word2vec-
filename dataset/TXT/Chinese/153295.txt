tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg We visited this restaurant because my wife wanted to check out the Wild Horse Pass Casino. We decided for this asian restaurant and oh boy... I had the F'n Loaded Sliders and let me tell you: best sliders I have ever had in my life! Worth coming back just for that alone. My wife had the Pad Thai and that was okay as well. Visit this place... try the sliders
