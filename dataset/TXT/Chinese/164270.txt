UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ The wife and I wanted Chinese . we found George and son on yelp , outstanding service! These people are at high standards of service , they do not take one table or section , I watched them move around the room to service customers . friendly , very cozy , clean place . The food was excellent . they have the every meal that other restraunts have but have some I have not heard of . some of the usuals have a slight difference , overall , I've found a new restraunt ,,,
