moauW4l96E3BEK7aXDiMsQ I have been here several times and keep giving it another chance, but my last visit is my final one. The brown rice was undercooked and the entrees had been sitting in the warmer too long. The meat was dry and chewy and the veggies soggy. One thing I noticed while I was sitting there eating was the difference in the portions being served. It appeared the to go box was getting much more serving than the dine-in plate, so if you want more food get it to go. Seems like the servings are not equal depending on who is doing the serving too. This place is one of the consistently worst Panda Express stores I have been to.
