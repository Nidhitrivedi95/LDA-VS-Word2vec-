tw8I1hZdlGpwO2QaAIeQWg Hello yummy food!! Kumo is old news now. Fuji is my new buffett go to!!! The sushi was amazing - just wish the staff labeled what was what. Didnt matter much to me though since Im open to trying anything. The hot food was hot and amazing. I saw the staff constantly stirring the hot food areas and checking for needed re-fills. My favorite hot food item was the coconut shrimp! The interior has also been fully renovated and is soo clean. I cant wait to go again!!
