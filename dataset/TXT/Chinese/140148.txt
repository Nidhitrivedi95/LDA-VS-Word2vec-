r2qLNZaYTZKjvVXfXB1BLQ I admit that I'm picky with noodle places,and the reason I picked this place was because they have one of my favourite bubble tea shops (presotea) inside. I love this 2 in 1 concept (bubble tea bar +noodle bar),also using a tablet to place your orders (eng/chinese),service was just o-k,most of them don't speak english,but I guess they don't need to if the tablet does the job already. In terms of the food,I had the minced pork "dry" noodles, no soup eventhough they indicated this item in the "noodle soup" column on their menu. The sauce on my noodles was a bit bland,I had to add tons of chili oil & vinegar to bring out the flavour. Overall experience, not too bad for a place that just opened last week, I see lots of room for improvement and I will come again to try an actual noodle with soup in it.
