pImcSPg5tEkuvqHF7JnpoQ I popped into Ginger the other night with a friend and it was all I thought it would be for a Chinese dinner.  I am really particular about my Chinese food because of all the horror stories I've heard as well as a few personal experiences. 

We ordered two entrees, Chicken with cashews & snap peas accompanied with Garlic Chili Shrimp with Broadway noodles.  Both entrees were delicious! The food here was clean, you could see what ingredients were used, it tasted fresh and wasn't greasy. 

There are a few Chinese restaurants in the area and Ginger Bistro is by far the best!  

Its going to be my go to place whether I want to dine in or take-out.
