TSGBM2z5BTeJvYQAznz8Fg We arrived on Friday at 1200. We were seated in a booth in the far corner. We sat and waited for someone to take a drink order. Our wait was 10 minutes. It was not booming with customers to warrant a 10 min wait.

When we went for food, they were out of fried rice, small fried chicken wings, and orange chicken. We went back a few minutes later, they were still out.

We had an infant with us who was ready to leave. I had to stand and signal for someone to bring me a check. Our waitress never looked our way. Another lady acknowledged us, and told our server to bring the check. We then watched her deliver drinks and take drink orders of someone else.

We waited at the front for the check and to pay. Service was terrible especially for a buffet when the expectation is to bring me a drink in a timely manner and my check when I'm ready to leave!
