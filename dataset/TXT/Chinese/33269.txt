a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg I remember when this place was the Shanghai Restaurant. It was one of three restaurants on the block in the old Chinatown, the others being "The Three Sisters" and "The Gold Coins." The Emperor's Palace is in the old Shanghai location, but it has been completely remodeled. It's a very clean restaurant. Sure the decor is over the top and looks like something out of a set from "The King and I," but let's talk about what matter most: the food. It's excellent and you can have it prepared American style or traditional Chinese style. I really enjoyed simple broccoli and chicken with fried rice. Very good. It's become my favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland.

UPDATE: I like the interactions the waiters have with you about Chinese food when ordering. I'm trying to try more traditional Chinese style prepared dishes and today did not disappoint. My server suggested I try fresh garlic sauce Chinese style. They'll even put it on the side for those who are not brave at heart. The regular garlic sauce is great as well and can be put on the side to limit calories, fat and salt. It's a great way to expand your awareness of Chinese foods. And you can say no MSG. I'm a big fan of this place.
