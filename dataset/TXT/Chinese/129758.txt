pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Came in for a late lunch on our last trip to Vegas. It was our first time here and we fell in love with the atmosphere and ambiance of the place. It's really awesome inside although I hate the location. I never find myself down by Palazzo so it's a little out of my way. But anyways- the Rock Shrimp appetizer is amazing! I've been dreaming about those shrimp ever since we left! Our entrees were just okay. I don't think it was necessarily bad food, we just need to order something different next time. Overall we love Sushi Samba and can't wait to come back!
