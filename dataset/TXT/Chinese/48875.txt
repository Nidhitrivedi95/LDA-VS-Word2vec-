CanfdSFEs_o_h9SBvxyXlg Pleasantly surprised at how satisfying my meal was here.
In the food court at College Park, next to the entrance to the College subway station. 

I came on a Sunday around 2PM and sadly they only had one option available: #6 Beef noodle soup or rice for $7.50. I wanted to try #2, which was the BBQ duck noodle soup for the same price but I will come by earlier next time. 

They put lots of things inside the clear plastic bowl: soup, lai fun (thick rice noodles), beef brisket, bok choy, crispy bean sprouts and grated carrots. Was this the beefiest soup I've ever had? Of course not. But it still had the beef flavour. I was very happy about getting lai fun because a lot of restaurants don't even serve this type of noodle anymore, and it was cooked well. The beef brisket was tender, but still some chew to it. All in all a great meal and I will be back. 

Only recommendation I would have is that they should provide Asian style soup spoons as well.
Cash only.
