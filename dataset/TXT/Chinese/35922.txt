aHVhlCvmlNnnPf-LgclNNA station square isn't my favorite place to be.  the reasons go something like this:

1. entering the square is a headache, never really know where to park
2. parking costs $ and remembering to validate is an annoyance
3. even after validating you may have to pay a few bucks for parking
4. exiting the square and taking a left isn't always easy- make sure to exit at a light
5. the mall at station square is a joke but it does have a lottery ticket machine!

The 2 best locations in station square are:

1.  Sesame Inn
2.  the lottery machine

Sesame Inn is good stuff.  The egg rolls are bomb.  Get a dish with shrimp in it.  The shrimp is gigantic.  The spice could use some help though.  Between Sesame Inn and PF Changs, I'd choose Sesame Inn everytime.  It's a hit in a very obscure place in station square.  It's my spot!
