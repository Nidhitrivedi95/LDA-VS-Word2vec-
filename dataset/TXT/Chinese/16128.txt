3v1c2BsFFcWlpV3S3LS8dA Quick recap: bad customer service. Do not order any dish with breaded chicken. Ginger chicken is the dish to get if you find yourself here. Would not recommend this place to friends and family. 

There was very little amounts of chicken in the orange chicken. Mostly breading and very chewy. Rice was good, dumplings were nothing special. Sweet tea was pure sugar. 

When I tried to exchange my orange chicken for something else due to poor quality, they told me that was not possible.

This is a first for me. Never have I been told it was my fault for ordering something I didn't like. Even after I showed them the lack of chicken in the nuggets they told me there was nothing they could do.
