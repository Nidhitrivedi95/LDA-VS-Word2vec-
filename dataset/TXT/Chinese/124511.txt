osvcl7Fh_J5VwUikh5Vskg a new favorite, all kinds of hk style food at cheap prices. there's a huge selection of drinks and food, and there's tea time specials in the afternoon as well as a 10pm-midnight special. 

when I came I got the French toast & ice cream which was delicious. and got the fried chicken platter which had deep fried wings, legs, fries, onion rings, chicken nuggets, bacon wrapped sausages, fried fish balls served with ketchup and gravy for &14.99. it was DELICIOUS and HUGE. we also got some hk style milk tea and it was pretty great.

definitely coming back to try all the other yummy looking items on their menu.
