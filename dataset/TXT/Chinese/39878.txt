ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ A restaurant that I have been coming to since I was born.  A hk style diner that is always busy packed with people..  Food is not exactly THE best but,  for the price,  convience and quality of food,  my friends and I always seem to always find ourselves back here over the years. 

Pork neck on rice is good,  and baked rice is good,  steak sizzling plate is really good too.  If you are getting sizzling plate,  ask for the steak to be cooked rare or even a bit slightly under rare,  so by the time it comes out and you finish cutting into it,  it becomes medium rare :o
