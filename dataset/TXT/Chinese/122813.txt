OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Who loves DIM SUM? I love me SUM! These was pretty good. What I liked best was the variety of carts going around. They also had a waitress walking around offering entrees such as fried rice and calamari. 

It was somewhat busy but we were able to get our food FAST. Because of our hunger, I think we must have spent 10 minutes in there inhaling the food. My only advice... slow down and enjoy the dim sum. Otherwise, you'll end up like me: bloated and full after a measly 10 minutes. HA!
