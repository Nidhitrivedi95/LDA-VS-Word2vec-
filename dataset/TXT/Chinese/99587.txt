Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ I just moved here in vegas and my friend and my boyfriend decided to go for a dimsum and we found this place here on yelp, the seats are empty maybe like 10-15 people or less, so i ordered pork shumai and i also ordered beef ball the shumai is actually good it was very tasty, so when i tried the beef ball it tastes nasty like its been out for more than an hour, the taste i really couldnt explain it in details but it taste like wood, mold its like mix taste i ate the whole thing and just keep dipping it to the soy sauce but unfortunately didnt work. So i leave the two pieces in the mini steamer bowl. I asked the lady (she has like a dora hair cut) if she can take it back she said, sorry but u order it i cant do anything. I was super disappointed it was really really gross, so i told my boyfriend this will be the first and last and i didnt left any tip coz i was so disgusted and she was very rude to us from the very beginning.
