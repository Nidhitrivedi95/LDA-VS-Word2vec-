hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA I went here for lunch last week with a friend of mine. It was cheap, fresh and delicious. They had quite a crowd for lunch, which was no problem, the dishes were filled as fast as they were depleted. The Chinese dishes were all above par. The salt and pepper shrimp and the salt and pepper squid were my faves. I didn't try the sushi because I was bothered by the fact that it was all covered in plastic wrap, which meant that one would have to touch it to pull it up to get a piece. 

Overall it's good for a Chinese buffet, cheap and fast too!
