ZlrHrg7jrbO6blqwfa0MkQ I'm a lunch patron because they're close to my workplace...

When I go here, I'm looking for two things:  good food and quick service.  The former is always delivered, the latter, well...mostly, they do get busy.

Personally, I get the Pork Fried Rice and occasionally hot and sour soup.  Simple dishes, admittedly, but their execution is what impresses me most about Baoding.  When the plate of rice arrives, you can immediately tell that they JUST MADE IT.  No, its not some dish they made a lot of and left under a lamp.

The soup is always great.  The service is also nice.
