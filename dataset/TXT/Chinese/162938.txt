uP2-0N59oW5lggIyvdfWkQ Ordered from here a couple of times, both dine in and take out. The food is decent and worth trying. However watch what you order, as a few dishes (esp. the duck) are pricey for chinese food. As opposed to other yelpers the duck is not something my party and I are fans of, as after two minutes the duck is cold and has a funky taste to it and the skin doesn't stay crispy for longer than a few minutes.. we much prefer the crispy beef and the duck stir fry which is really tasty! Be advised cash only
