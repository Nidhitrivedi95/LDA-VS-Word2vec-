We were craving congee after a long night out. Ordered the thousand egg variety, and the duck. The thousand egg congee didn't have the yolk, my favorite part :( Just the brown gelatinous "whites"... so sad. 

The duck pieces in the congee was surprisingly pretty meaty. 

We also ordered the three meat combo with chicken and pork. It was decent. 

I'd probably come back if I was craving hole-in-the-wall greasy-spoon Chinese/viet food.
