bBdBNFFyIVUwY-L3kqa3zg Want to feel like a celebrity in a crowded Chinese restaurant?  Bring a 6'3" West Indian man with long dreadlocks and his beautiful wife to dinner with you.  Not only will everyone stare at your table, you'll get extra attentiveness from staff as well (curiosity, perhaps?).

Steamed Shrimp Dumplings were average for us.

Rolled Onion Pancake With Sliced Beef, our friend loved this one.  I have a feeling that she would return for more.  (Personally, I could inhale 2-3 of these easily.)

Stir Fried Ho Fun with Beef.  One of our favorites, we love the smokey flavor in noodles.  It reminds me of Pad See-Eew.

Our friends ordered Kung Pao Shrimp.  The tall fella cleaned the entire plate (while the entire Asian crowd watching in awe).

Fish Filet with Chili Sauce was a hit!  Each fish filet was well seasoned with garlic and the sauce, extremely flavorful.  Despite the 3 Chili spicy rating, this dish was packed with the right amount of heat.

Sautéed Snow Pea Shoots with King Mushroom was delicious.  

"Sorry to interrupt, but, this is REALLY good, guys," it was the first time our super tall "celebrity" friend raved about  food at the beginning of the meal!  And that pretty much summed up our experience.
