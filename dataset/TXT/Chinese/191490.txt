yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A I have eaten at the Flo's in North Scottsdale since I was a kid, so when I saw their sign up in Tempe, I got pretty excited. I told my friend we had to come here for happy hour because they have fantastic deals - half off almost all apps and half off all drinks, yes ALL drinks... awesome! I had the mandarin oriental and my friend had the tytini. Her drink was... odd. It wasn't bad, but it didn't taste like anything I have tried before. My drink was very tasty, sweet, but not overly so, and easy to drink. For 4.50, you can't beat it. We also decided to get 3 apps, which have been very delicious at the other location including the pork potstickers, the spicy/limey Lao lettuce wraps, and the spring rolls. The Lao lettuce wraps were as tasty as I remembered... I like how the chicken has a lot of flavor from the chilies, lime, and spices and it's especially good with some potsticker sauce on top. The other two apps were horrible failures. The potstickers up north are typically fried, these were steamed, which isn't a problem except they tasted... off. Like something about them was bad. They were inedible and we left them behind (which is kind of a big deal if you know me because A. potstickers/dumplings are one of my favorite foods and B. I never leave food behind, either it's eaten or boxed). The spring rolls were greasy and flavorless. I hope the lack of deliciousness was due to the restaurant just opening. Regardless, I would return for happy hour drinks if nothing else.
