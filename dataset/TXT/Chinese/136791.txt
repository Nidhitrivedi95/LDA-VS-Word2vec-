qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A Used to love PF Changs when we lived in CA. Have tried this location three times and each time thoroughly unimpressed. The service is fine, that's why two stars and not one, but the food is really blah, often like warm, and just lacks the pizzazz that I used to love Changs for. Way too expensive for the quality as well.
