Kn57RIWAdnVfJHI1loLXOQ I have to say, I was a little hesitant to try a new place I knew nothing about. I definitely will not be as hesitant in the future, the food was delicious! We wanted to try something new so we settled on this gem. 

It wasn't too busy for a Monday night and the teen ? Guy that seated us and took our orders was very quick and pleasant :) We were seated in a booth with a shiny copper curtain for added privacy. 

We ordered Bombay chicken dinner combo, shrimp fried wontons and a sizzling plate. So yummy :D

The service was really good, food came out promptly and the portions were so generous! I think it's a family owned restaurant and the food really gets the spices and rice just right. 

Definitely will come back !
