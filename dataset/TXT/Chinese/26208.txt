7rh29SPJMkyeI2BJcjqzLQ In the South Blvd area and was looking for take out Chinese.  Tried this place based on convenience and Yelp rating.  The restaurant has dine in options and decent parking spaces. There was a decent selection of items and combinations on the menu.  We ordered the chicken fried rice and chicken and shrimp egg foo yung. I was a bit turned off by the impatience of the man taking our order at the register as he didn't seem to like that we asked him to re-confirm that the chicken fried rice has onions but no other vegetables (peas, carrots, etc.), yet the "free" friend rice that he offered with our egg foo yung does have vegetables.  He dropped his head and stopped talking like we were slow. WTH?!  Then says "I try to be nice so I offer the fried rice).  I started to walk out, but didn't.

In any event, our food was bagged with the patties separate from the gravy, and two additional containers with the two fried rice. There was also a greasy looking fortune cookie in the bag. Upon serving the food, the chicken in the chicken fried rice appeared to be barely cooked side. I braved it out and it tasted ok (I'll follow up with an update if I get sick :) ) The egg foo yung patties were rather tasteless and the accompanying gravy tasted like canned beef gravy - not good.  The "free" fried rice actually tasted pretty good.

I wouldn't recommend this place and definitely will not be going back.
