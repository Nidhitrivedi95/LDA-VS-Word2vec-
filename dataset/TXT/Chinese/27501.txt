The food always comes out very fresh, and while it can be on the greasy side, I haven't noticed the Saltiness other reviewers have mentioned. 

Make sure to try the Taro Puffs, and if you are feeling adventurous, the BBQ chicken feet are also really good! 

I do wish that they did cart service, but I can see how that might not be very popular out here. Otherwise, if you like dim sum, definitely give Nani a try!
