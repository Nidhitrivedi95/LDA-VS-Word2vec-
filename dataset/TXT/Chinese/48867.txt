caBiQN3OwW4P3hfUFm2vQw This is the second time in a row that I have stopped in first time about a month ago approx 2pm this time 830pm. Both visits exceptional! Store is clean (table, chairs, counters) food is ready and good. Service was great with samples offered. It appears "Ping" is in charge and runs a tight ship. I appreciate it, it shows at all levels she cares. Been a long time since I let half my meal get cold to write a review, but they are doing a good job at this location. Thanks Panda at 9th n Bell rd.
