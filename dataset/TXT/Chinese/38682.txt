AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA So my guy and I were told about this place by our vegan friend, and we are always game to try anything healthy and "Asian"...so when we place our orders, I was excited ...
And man were we satisfied! !! 
Great service, very friendly and attentive, food was hot and came out quick ..and boy..was it good! !!
Ordered the honey shrimp with a side of white rice ..and a noodle dish ..we seriously chowed down!!!! For being a place where they serve "faux" meat ..I COULD NOT TELL! !! holy snikes that chef must be a magician!!! Hahah...I would def recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone ..and if you are a pure meat eater ..I have one thing to say ...JUST GIVE IT A TRY ;)
