JdoBiBRgeS_KKaNaU1sofA When I asked my dad what he wanted to eat for Father's day, he immediately said, "Chinese food!"  You can take the man out of Arcadia, but you can't take Arcadia out of the man...Anyway, after a brief Yelp search, I chose Dong Ting Spring because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.

When we got there, I was impressed by the clean, rather cute decor.  But the place was empty except for one other group.  My parents started having their doubts, but I remained positive.  Maybe it was still early...

First mistake: my family doesn't eat spicy food.  So we asked for everything mild, which they made for us.  But if you don't eat spicy, why bother going to a Hunan restaurant?  D'oh.

I actually thought the meal was okay.  Nothing was truly bad but also nothing was great.  My parents hated it though...so much they wanted me to write this review.  Apparently one of the dishes was supposed to feature shrimp...and instead consisted of huge bunches of broccoli and a few sad little pieces of shrimp.  And no one really touched the catfish.

If you don't eat spicy food, then you can find better Chinese food elsewhere.  But if you like your food hot, then I still think it would be worth trying this restaurant.
