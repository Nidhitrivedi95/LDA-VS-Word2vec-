uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw 24/7 fresh hand pulled noodles what more can I say? If you're at Magic Noodle, I don't know why you wouldn't get the noodles. You can hear them being smacked and pulled and made with your own eyes. I only come here after really late nights so I don't have a problem finding a seat.
