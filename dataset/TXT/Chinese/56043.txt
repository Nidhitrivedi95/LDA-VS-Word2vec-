cykzJbkgweJvZsvkrHMR7g I was craving phad Thai, and decided to give this place a try, bad idea! The cashier/waiter charged me for an a la cart price instead of their lunch special, when I pointed it out he gave an attitude, (it may only be a buck and some change difference) but he should've been apologetic about the little mistake. Bad customer service! 
The wait was also too slow, they had fans on and the door propped open. I guess their exhaust and air wasn't working.
