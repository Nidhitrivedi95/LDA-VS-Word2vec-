dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ Very good menu selection with many many items that will please anyone's appetite. I always get the Thai tea and it's not too much tea and not too much cream so it's perfect. The egg foo young is great with lots of toppings and the Tom yum shrimp soup is flavorful and filled with a good amount of shrimp. Definitely visiting again. Docked one star because when they're busy service is slow.
