yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I love this place! I always recommend it and always bring people here from out of town. It is always packed but I have never waited too long, not a lot of room to wait but who cares because the food is bomb and you really don't wait that long. 
Huuuuge menu and we like to try new things but my favs are by far - a big ol' bowl of Pho! Add broccoli because that's how I roll, I love my greens. The Drunken Noodles are awesome....I could def eat that whole plate myself, my boyfriend and I usually order a couple different things, meat plate, veggie plate like buck choy and then pho - we def get into the family style dining. That's what is so awesome - you can get your own thing or share! 
Boba is great, smoothies are really good and the spring rolls are always a starter. and then you can catch an awesome show at the Las Vegas Little Theatre right behind it afterwards :)
