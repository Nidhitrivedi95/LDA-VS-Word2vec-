idQuN4Kxl0UO-6LQtrq2eQ I gave it two stars because the place was very clean and I enjoyed the noodle bar. The rest of the food was not good. It was way too greasy. I love crawfish but I could not eat it here because it was covered in grease and didn't look or smell cooked. (It still smelled like the ocean and was very dark) They also should retrain some servers. They were standing around staring at us hard and seem to be rushing us out when nobody was really even there. They brought the check out so fast. I would not come back unless this place was just a noodle bar. On a side note I thought it was weird there was a wedding going on while we were eating.
