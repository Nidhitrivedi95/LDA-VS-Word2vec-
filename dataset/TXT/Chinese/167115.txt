vgc-XO64Uw7otc3sxmns1A It's been years since in last wrote a review about a place, something has to be very wrong with the food for me to spend the time writing about it. Here it is. 

I ordered a sashimi on rice for lunch.

- Salad was OK, it's soaked in ginger dressing, it's like a ginger dressing soup.

- the sashimi rice bowl came in on a flat plate, get it? 

- It says "10 pieces of sashimi on rice" on the menu. I got 8 pieces of small and thin fish with 2 piece is fake crab meat. Fake crab meat is not sashimi, get it right!

- Ginger tastes rotten, it tastes like medicine.

- Fish are THIN, and NOT fresh! It's very very fishy! I could not swallow the salmon the fish tasted like it stayed in the fridge for weeks!

- Rice has too much vinegar, it was too sour.

- There are loads of cilantro in it, it must be a Chinese or Vietnamese chef that prepared it. Sashimi does not require cilantro to accompany with!

I have had sashimi all my life around the world and I read about food preparation and cooking all the time. Cannot believe I spent $15 (with tip) on a plate of disappointment.

I'm never returning here again, period.
