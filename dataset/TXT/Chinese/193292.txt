ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Asian fusion at its best! Dumplings, sweet buns and the tuna chips were amazing. My favorite dumpling was the pork belly, so smokey, so tender! The corn fritter dumplings were a must have! Speciality cocktails out the wazoo! I feel like you cant go wrong on this menu! Great ambiance too boot!
