I walked in and got seated right away.  They gave me a tattered breakfast menu that was relatively cheap, approx $7.99 for a meal + drink.  I ordered the congee beef with fried noodle and a iced lemon tea. 

The iced lemon tea got delivered with a Chinese newspaper.  Here is where things get a little droll.  I told my server that I didn't want the newspaper as I was reading a e-book on my iPhone.  She looked at me in surprised and straight up asked me, "you don't know how to read Chinese?!" I confirmed negative.  She walked back to the cash and you can hear her say to another server, "the (leng mui) little girl doesn't know how to read!"
Server 2 response: Really? Does she speak Chinese?
Original Server: Yes she does, but she can't read
Server 2: Did she stutter like go "um" or "eh" when she talked to you?
Original: No, she spoke ok but she doesn't know how to read at all

& here I am, awkward as hell sitting literally a metre away from them?!?!?!?!?!? 
It was funny afterwards but I got a little embarrassed as the other patrons took a peek at me.  

OK, I digress.  
The food came out fairly quick, roughly 5-7 minutes.  The congee was a little watery and the beef was obviously frozen and only dethawed as my congee boiled.  I didn't finish the congee.  The fried noodles were very standard and had a good load of bean sprouts fried in.  It wasn't bad but just a little too oily.  My iced lemon tea wasn't steeped long enough ): so I was literally drinking lemon water with honey.  

My bill came to $8 something.  

Overall, I'd rather trek a little farther and go to New City by Kennedy and Hwy 7.
