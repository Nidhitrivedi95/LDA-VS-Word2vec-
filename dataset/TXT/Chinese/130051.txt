pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Our first night in Vegas we decided to dine in the hotel we're staying in.  After reading up on the food literature left for us in our room and yelping every single one of the restaurants, I settled on Sushi Samba.. well.. because the pictures looked pretty.

This place is a trip.  The decor is out there and colourful.  It was interesting to just sit there and look around.  

I can't remember exactly what we had but I'm still thinking about it.  There was peruvian corn which was something new to try.  Tough little things but still good.  We had some lamp that I actually didn't really care for because it had so much fat on it but the flavours were very nice because it was both sweet and salty.  We also had some kanapche tiradito and seared kobe beef and those two were the best I've ever had.  

It was freakin expensive but I love the tapas style and they had the BEST COCKTAILS EVER.  Just when you feel that alcohol burn about to hit you, it doesn't.  It had enough alcohol that you wouldn't need 10 drinks to get a good buzz but it didn't have the burn and scrunchy face effect.  My hero.
