p2X4WdGMsi26t_6hN3Hz4w Note to Pho lovers: They do have it! But I didn't try it. Someday I'll get around to trying Pho. 

What I did have were the fried dumplings and General Tso's Shrimp. 

The fried dumplings were quite a strong way to open our early dinner. The potsticker wrapping was wispycrispy and not without a little oil undrained from them, which I kinda like. I was told they were filled with chicken which isn't a variation I've ever tried before on this preferred Asian app of mine.

The General Tso's Shrimp was candy-coated, Tempura-battered rawk fury! A gluey, gooey, delight, it went well with that mound of viscous, fluffy white rice. 

I tasted my friend's Sweet and Sour Chicken, and man it tasted like a pancake with some chicken inside! I liked it but would have preferred more chicken. With batter that good though, you could almost forgive that slight misstep. 

The service was excellent also, and the restaurant itself is nice, clean, cool, and relaxingly informal, the menu moderately priced (2 people=$25. 95 not including tip) . The owner appears to be a fellow Gen-Xer and even had her two little ones bringing us drinks.

"Mommy, the bald man wants another water," the little boy told his mom.  

Adorable. I guess ya gotta start 'em young in this business, right? 

Now the question is: Who has cuter kids? Tong Garden in Brookline or Mekong Restaurant? I'll leave that up to you to decide. 

I'm glad we came here to eat prior to the Scorpions concert. We would have gotten pizza somewhere, but everything else seemed closed today. Thank heavens for people who party too much on July 4th, or else I might not have gotten to try Mekong. 

Yeah, why do YOU think half of Pittsburgh was out of business today? Hmmmm?
