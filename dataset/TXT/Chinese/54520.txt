csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA It looks to me like a chain.  The decor is too modern and purposeful.  Apparently it is not a chain.  It has been at least ten years since I laughed at the neighborhood Chinese restaurant adding Japanese food to its offerings.  "Fusion" apparently came and flourished without my knowing it.  This is the popular food about which I know the least.  I will say this: the food tastes good.  The ingredients appear to be fresh and of good quality, the prices seem to be very reasonable, and the service is friendly and efficient.
