aY-lZvoTHAFl9k6dcfcAxQ I wasn't impressed and we visited based on Yelp reviews.  The food was okay but not spectacular.  I can't see myself visiting this place again.  We were served promptly and the food came out in under 7 minutes.  It just wasn't impressive though.  I'd rather spend an extra $15 and go to PF Changs.
