TA1Q7RWVzMigi5X3FAmctw I was introduced to this place by my girlfriend, and boy am I glad that she did. The manchurian shrimp, chilli chicken, and chilli beef are some of the best I've had. The spicy dishes here are actually spicy, and packed with flavor. This place also has one of my favorite chow mein in the city. Prices are fair, service is OK, but the food top grade.
