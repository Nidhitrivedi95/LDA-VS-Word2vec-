We always over order at this northern Chinese restaurant, leaving completely stuffed and satisfied.  Soupy xiao long bao! Pan-fried dumplings! Steamed, fluffy, yummy buns!  I am salivating dreaming of a northern Chinese food heaven.  Forget the pan-fried green onion pancakes though, they are mediocre.   At $6.99/$7.99 per 10 buns, it is good value when you leave so full.

A bit of a hole in the wall, and without the crowds or decor like Ding Tai Fung.
