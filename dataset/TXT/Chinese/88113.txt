I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg ****** Same day update since Yelp won't let me write a separate one on the same day ******

I've never been too prideful to admit that I've made a bone-headed move.  In my initial review of this place, I irresponsibly wrote that that they use "artificial flavors" in their shaved ice without knowing for sure and just throwing it out there based on assumption. I've since amended that to just "flavor."

This was brought to my attention by the owner who, despite having every right to rip me a new one, sent me a very polite message regarding my initial review, informing me they do not use artificial flavors and inviting to check out their kitchen next time I stop by, which i will, and also suggest you do.

This does nothing to change my review at this time.  The taste is what it is to me, and my reviews are mostly taste-based, though I did very much appreciate the message from the owner.  This is mainly a public mea culpa, plus some additional information for you to consider.

****** Original review ******  

Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Don't get me wrong, I'm really, really glad that a Taiwanese-style shaved ice place is here in Phoenix.  It's the best there is here in the Valley and you should go.  But coming from Southern California, where there is ample delicious shaved ice, I have to rank this guy somewhere in the middle of the road.  

My biggest knock on this place is the flavor.  The flavoring they use has a really distinct chemically taste and aftertaste.  It's not so off-putting that I wouldn't go back, but it does bump this place down a couple notches.  That being said, the texture of the ice is perfectly fine, and I like the variety that they have.  

Always add the condensed milk.  It's one of the best parts of Taiwanese shaved ice.
