vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA We came here on a Friday morning with a party of 8 ppl and surprisingly we got seated right away.

We ordered a lot of dishes. I'm picky when it comes to dim sum. However, all the dishes I've tried here tasted fresh and not too oily surprisingly. 

The only complaint is they don't have too many serving-carts while we were there. So we had to "order" several dishes that we wanted. So yes service was slow-or maybe we were really hungry. So don't come here with an empty stomach.

The porridge was really stand out to me. It has a very nice balance-not too bland. Portion-wise was decent as well. 

Overall I would come back.
