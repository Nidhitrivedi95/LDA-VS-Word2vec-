KF1ngA96RBiRM5h8V7IQ2g This is a sit-down restaurant with waiter service that serves both meals (like beef noodle soup) and dessert. Two things I thought were lacking:

1. I asked the waitress if they had any vegetable dishes or side dishes, and she said no. So, if you come here for a meal, don't expect any vegetables.
2. I sort of expected a dessert place to have some Asian pastries such as a sesame bun or red bean paste bun, but they only have snow ice and drinks (bubble tea, etc.).

I ordered the milk and strawberry snow ice (around $6.25). It was big enough to share between two people. The dish consisted of a pile of fluffy, lightly sweet white "milk-flavored" shaved ice, with sliced strawberries and grapes on top. The flavor of the ice was like white cake or sweet cream, but very light.

I thought the price was a little expensive, but then again, I split with a friend, so I only had to pay half the cost.

Looking at the lunch entrees on other people's tables, I'd like to come back to try some of their meat dishes.
