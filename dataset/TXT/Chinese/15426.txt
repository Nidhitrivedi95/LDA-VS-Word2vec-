3PsmvwxetLz1Tzb-6mNhgA Once you get over the rather long wait at the bar, everything is really good. Saturday afternoon at 2 pm and the place was jammed. Got our usual chicken lettuce wraps (still so tasty), Asian BBQ ribs (meaty and OK), and entrees of honey chicken and salt and pepper prawns.  You may pay a bit more at PF's, but the food quality is consistently good.
