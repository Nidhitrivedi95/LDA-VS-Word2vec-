hRbUkwU9awUan32CD-mdHA One of the better dim sum places in GTA.

It used to be so packed here that you sometimes had to wait outside, but it has since slowed down a bit.  Still need to wait sometimes on the weekends.

Hope you can read chinese, because on the back of the dim sum mark sheet they have some noodle and rice dishes for special.
