X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I totally loved this place. I went to Hakkasan my first night in Vegas on Thursday at about 1am and there was no line a 20 dollar cover and Tommy Trash was performing. The crowd can get a little overwhelming, especially boys who can't handle their partying and get very disrespectful. But the venue itself with the lights and screen, dancers, DJ booth, the tables are amazing. I went the next night and got a table for Laidback Luke, Amaris and Arthur were my handlers and the service was SO GREAT! Later in the evening our table got upgraded to a bigger and closer table to Laidback Luke for no additional charge. It was the best 30th birthday I could ask for. Do realize that there is a 40% mandatory gratuity. Expensive but the place and service is worth it if you want to do big. Still pretty good place to just go to without a table as well. My fave club in Vegas hands down. Oh and the resident DJs are top names, so that's also a huge plus: Tiesto, Laidback Luke, Tommy Trash, Danny Avila, etc.
