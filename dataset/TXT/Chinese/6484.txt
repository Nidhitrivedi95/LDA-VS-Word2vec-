0J-QM0fIxBNNiSK_n19y9g Wishing I got the food other people on here reviewed but unfortunately I don't know what we got. Hardly any cream inside the crab puffs that at first I thought they sent them just fried.  But my son loved them.  The orange chicken wasn't tasteful and the chicken was hard and over cooked and therefor dry.  They got two stars for not messing up rice and for quick delivery. I ordered through Yelp, I did think that was neat.  I'm still questioning if it's really "chicken" teriyaki that I'm looking at.
