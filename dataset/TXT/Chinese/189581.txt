The food was subpar, the wait is crazy long, and most importantly the service wasn't that great. So what makes this place special? I'm no entirely sure, maybe I just caught them on a bad day. The one thing that had me really not happy was that when my girlfriend and I wanted to pay our bill, they took the money quick but didn't bring back our change. Not sure if they were just expecting us to leave and forget about our change, but it seemed like they did that to a few tables. Very sketchy thing to do. 

Anyways, I think any other Pho place would be just as good as this one. Way overhyped and not worth the wait. And definitely not worth them trying to just keep your change.
