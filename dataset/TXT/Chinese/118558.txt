Carts continued to come quickly - we were never left wanting for food. Lots of options to choose from. Our favorites were: sesame balls, fried pork bun, steamed BBQ bun, steamed shrimp dumplings, Chinese broccoli, and the pork and shrimp dumpling. We saw that other tables were also able to order things like duck and lo mien but we came just for the dim sum. Great service. Place was completely packed with a full waiting room. Worth the trip.
