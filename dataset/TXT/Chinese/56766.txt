d_jxInosU_3cAYI0qi34UA This place is near where we live and in the same mall as my dentist and podiatrist -- so we are there quite often.  Price is right!  The two of us can easily eat for $15-20, although if you go for the lobster it surely has to be more expensive.  Tea is offered free.  Service, while not overly polite, is quick and food comes from the kitchen steaming hot.  Lots of families and larger groups eat here too since they have large round tables in the center and smaller booths at the sides.

We think all the food we have ordered has been very tasty, although clearly high in fat and salt as is food in most Chinese restaurants. Among our favourite dishes are congee, shrimp in maggi sauce, udon with seafood and XO sauce, tango mango chicken and shrimp, fried turnip patties, oyster patties and deep fried dough fritters.  It's hard for me to list only a few dishes because we've never eaten anything there we didn't like except for the shrimp wonton!
