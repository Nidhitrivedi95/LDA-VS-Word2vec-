jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw Food was horrible.  My fried rice looked and  tasted like yesterday's dried out rice.  It was hard and crunchy.  Disgusting!  The war wonton soup was disappointing.  Soup had no flavor and the ingredients were soft and bland.  The only thing I enjoyed was the diet Coke that came in an unopened can.  Over $70 for lunch for 3.  Never again!
