-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ Yummy Grill is a quick grab bag of Asian cuisine. There are elements of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Hawaiian influence in their menu. This is one of those places where it is easy to stop in while running some errands.

The food comes out quick and the prices are reasonable. For three people, we had lunch for $35. That included three entrees, one roll, and two hand rolls. The food is solid and there was nothing to complain about. I had ordered the Mongolian Tofu and a Spicy Tuna Hand Roll. My main meal came with a large scoop of rice and two cream cheese rangoons. As a lunch special, it came out to be a little under $7. The amount of food was generous and filled me up. Kept me filled until dinner and that is rare with Asian food. 

They are set up like a fast food joint more than a sit down. The prices are a little high for that, but the food is good.
