NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og I don't know who these people giving high stars are but they have no taste buds because this food is flavorless... Which is very hard to do with Chinese food. Everything tastes LITERALLY watered down. Look at the sweet and sour sauce it's clearly cut with water.   I expect them to be out of business soon
