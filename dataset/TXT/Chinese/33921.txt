AbadN65irz8uSL8z6fkoBg We come here every time we go to Vegas.  Why?  Because it's super cheap and the food is good.  The dishes are around $5 to $7 each... that's crazy.  Free soup during dinner too.

Ok, this isn't 5 star, fine dining.  You have to judge the food on it's price.  The food is pretty damn good, especially for such a low price. 

Not sure why their are so many low ratings, maybe they expect the glitz and glam of Vegas.  I think I may be the first 5 star rating because I love this place... why?

Good Food - Great Price = Win!
