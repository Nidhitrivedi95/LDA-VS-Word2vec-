fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA All reviews I came across raved about one thing, the steamed soup dumplings, and as it turns out, with good reason. I'm a dumplings fan and this xiaolongbao is one of those things you just have to try if you enjoy dumplings. It's quite a dish a have to say. 

The integrity of the wrapper is such that I actually made a point to leave one dumpling behind to check how long it could last without the soup seeping out. It didn't. I lost patience and ate the damn thing. I put the entire dumpling in my mouth to savor all the juicy goodness.

I guess that's the only thing I can remember about this restaurant. I ordered some noodles and some other dish which tasted so-so and is now lost in the depths of my memory.

4 for the soup dumpling. 3 for everything else.
