pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I stopped by the bar for a quick bite and a drink in between shopping and dinner.  The bar was kinda in the middle of the shops, so that was a little strange for a high end restaurant.  I had the tuna small plate (forgot the name) and an acai cocktail.  The bartenders were friendly and steered me towards a small plate when I said that I was hungry but had a dinner reservation later that night.  Keep in mind that the prices are high here!  My app and drink was $30.  I would love to stop back in for dinner when I'm in town.
