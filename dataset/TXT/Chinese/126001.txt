oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q Summary:
Panda Express, done quasi-Indian style. Atmosphere was pretty good, portion sizes were big, and service wasn't terrible. That said, I was unimpressed with everything else. I had:

Curry Chicken spring roll
Spicy Delux chicken (one of their specialties)

The chicken roll was inventive. Indian spiced ground chicken inside a spring roll wrapper. However, it was fairly puny for the price, and even came with a little plastic packet of generic plum sauce. Disappointment.

The spicy delux chicken was another thing altogether. Now let me preface this by saying I LOVE Manchurian chicken. It's one of my favorite dishes in the world. I've eaten it in dozens of restaurants, my mother makes it every time I visit home, and I really appreciate the complexities of flavor. I was told that this was Manchurian chicken. If that was the case, then this was by far the worst I've had. The sauce was thick, tomato-based, and sweet. The chicken was far too heavily battered, and worse, was soft... as if it wasn't freshly cooked or wasn't cooked thoroughly enough. It reminded me of a generic Panda Express red sauce chicken, but made with better ingredients and barely any vegetables.

Bottom line:
The food was filling, quantities were big and its relatively cheap for that. However, if you have a complex palate and want good food, go elsewhere.
