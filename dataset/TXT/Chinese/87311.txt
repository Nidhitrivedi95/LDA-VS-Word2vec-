I do appreciate that they don't go crazy with the whole peppercorns as many Szechwan restaurants do because I don't enjoy the numbing aftertaste. 

The prices are very reasonable, especially if you come for the lunch specials. For any person that remotely loves spicy and Chinese food, Szechwan Garden is a must.

-Fish fillet with hot chili peppers
