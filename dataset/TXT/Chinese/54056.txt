cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ We were in this place several times before but quality of food has been gradually deteriorating. As my wife and I are seniors but with all of our teeth we cannot splurge on restaurants on regular basis. Tonight however we did and what a disappointment. Each of us got a ticket for so called lobster. It was half of the tail no claw and tough like shoe. I got lured by good looking rare beef. I am beef eater but this was cut wrong way and was tough to be even cut by restaurants table knife. Some of sweet and sour spare ribs were OK but some were so dried up as if left from previous day. Sushi bar was good and fresh and vegetables and mushrooms were excellent. Conclusion: NEVER will we go there again. If we would like Chinese food we will go to regular restaurant and order what we want. If any cuisine is not up to par you can send it back to kitchen. 
Definitely not worth $70- for two seniors diners with 1 Coke and 1 tea
