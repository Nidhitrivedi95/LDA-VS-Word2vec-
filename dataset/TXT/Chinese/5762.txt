0c6PQILCLwRZ8FIB4AEsGw We frequent this place once a month.

For the most part they are great for dinner.  On our most recent take out experience was pleasant.  Tonight, we ordered the "Dinner A" which consisted of:

- Egg Drop Soup
- 2 Spring Rolls
- 2 Cream Cheese Ragoons
- Pork Fried Rice (our choice)
- Orange Chicken (our choice)
- Chicken Chow Mein (our choice)

The total came out to under $28.

Food was prepared quickly.  The restaurant was clean and the employees were nice.

When we came home our food was nice and hot.  Each take out box was filled to the brim and our family of five were completely satisfied.

One thing that had me raise my eyebrow was the fact that at the bottom of our orange chicken box, it was lined with broccoli.

The over all experience has been positive! :)  The service is consistent and we had a memorable experience when the place first opened:  We dined in and they were super friendly and gave away freebies and extra food and were very accommodating to our rambunctious little boys.

When we are in the mood for Chinese at home, China One is the number one choice for us.
