HTAAMVDZ4P0VX5F9euJBoA Best Szechwan (Sichuan in Mandarin) restaurant in AZ.  Being Chinese and having lived in China for 2 years, this is the real deal.  My family dines at this restaurant almost weekly. 

Our favorite dishes are Tong Qing Spicy Chicken, Crispy Onion Pancakes, Hot & Spicy Fish Fillet (aka fish fillet with hot chili peppers), Yu Xiang Rou Si (forgot the English name; it's pork strips with bamboo shoot).

Almost every Szechwanese dish that we have tried is good.  Other non-Szechwanese dishes may not be that great, e.g. beef noodle soup (niu rou mian), little dragon buns (xiao long bao).

My only complaint is the occasional sewage smell outside the restaurant.  I think it's fixed now.
