lVMsHJHxZKI1Wl6izAfJug Ending up here on a whim after looking at the noodle shop down the side walk. I didn't feel like noodles, so another time.
     We made the right choice.
     This isn't your normal westernized Chinese food. It's from Taiwan and it's great. 
     There are no egg rolls or crab puffs or other apps. Just great food.
     We had the King Pao Chicken, There was a ton of chicken and the peanuts were tender and fresh.
     The Shrimp Fried Rice was fantastic. It had a wonderful light flavor and the shrimp was tender and perfectly cooked.
     We nibbled on the spare ribs. They had a nice light crunch on the skin and a delicate sauce.
     I'll be back soon so I can enjoy a Hot Pot by myself when my wife visits her sister. No one likes to share the best foods.
