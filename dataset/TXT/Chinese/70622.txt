f9ERQpAPOAMv5Ay0kyD3Yw This is a very unusual Multi Asian Style Restaurant that has a bar and also offers many seafood dishes. They offer familiar Asian dishes of many kinds and many interesting sounding Asian inspired dishes. The interior of the restaurant was very dark and filled with comfortable booths.  I tried the Vietnamese Sun Devil Chicken with brown rice. The chicken in my dish was tender and they gave a nice assortment of fresh vegetables. The sauce on the menu was described as spicy and aromatic but all I got was sweet and soy sauce. My waitress said they usually make this dish with jalapeños but I didn't get any and they just used a few red pepper flakes. It seems like they were out of jalapeños and a few other things.

My husband tried the Szechwan Meatballs that were suppose to be in Szechwan Sauce that was suppose to be DOUBLE HOT. My husband said the meatballs were tasty but the sauce was like sweet BBQ sauce that wasn't hot at all. Guess they were out of some more things here too. He did tell the waitress about the lack of heat and she said most people love that dish and told us to order it extra extra spicy next time.

It seems that this restaurant is a little hit and miss.

I'm giving it a generous three stars because the meatballs were tasty and the chicken was prepared well.

2.5 stars
