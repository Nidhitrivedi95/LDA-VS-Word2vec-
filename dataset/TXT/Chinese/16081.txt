The server at the counter was more concerned with the call-in orders, which I guess is more common at this location due to the small amount of tables, but disappointing. It took me over 5 minutes to place my order. After being seated, with no one else there, I retrieved my order and was satisfied, but not impressed. The meal was very greasy & the rice and egg roll were so over-cooked. Won't bother again.
