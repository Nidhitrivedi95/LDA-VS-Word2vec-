3PhF188adiC8ZutKRP9gyQ My go-to for Chinese desserts, or "tong sui". I love love love their steamed milk/steamed eggs ("dun lai" or "dun dan"), which is like the insides of an egg tart. Also a fan of their small meals, which is satisfying and filling. Not fancy, or healthy, but satisfying.

My gripe is that their menu reads like the Tax Act. So many add-ons, and options, and combinations ready. I mean, customization is great, but the self-ordering menu is kinda like a scantron test from hell. I prefer to give my order verbally! And demonstrate my mediocre chinese!
