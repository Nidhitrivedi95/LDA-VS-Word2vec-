My mom so happens to call me to ask me if I want to get food with her, and I said I'm too tired to move. She says, well, I'll pick you up and we'll go to this Peruvian place. Off we go, as my admittedly tired self tries to make small talk. We end up here, at Little Dumpling. The place was mostly empty... a party of four was leaving there table, and another table had clearly just been left, too. Or was it...?

So we sit down to wait for our menus and drink orders. A kid comes up and says he'll be right with us and heads into the back of the restaurant, into the kitchen area. Great. So we wait. And wait. And wait some more. He emerges with our menus like ten minutes later and asks what we'll drink. Inca Kola, of course. Then he takes our orders, as we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted while we waited. 

We finally get our food, and it was pretty good. Nothing amazing, but it wasn't as poor as my mood. My parents were not too happy with their food, though I was. But we all agreed that the portions were generous, and a pretty good deal. My parents would have rated this place four stars on value alone, though I give it three: yes, it was a value, but so is a $.89 cheeseburger... but that's not why we came here!

During the hour or so we were here, the other two tables were never cleared. They sat there the whole time, while the kid who served our food chilled in the kitchen. Another family walked in as we were walking out, and they seemed to know the kid who worked there. They asked about his sister or his mom or something, and he seemed happy to see them. I bet they didn't wait ten minutes for a menu...
