WivZPC3bKDWpu_pGhvK10w This place has the best all-shrimp wontons outside of Hong Kong.  I don't eat pork, so it's hard for me to find all-shrimp wontons.  But I've managed to find places in NYC , Philly, SF, and Chicago (all Chinatowns) as well as numerous places in TO to try them.  I love shrimp wonton noodles.

My parents hate this place b/c like another Yelper complained of, it is not the best atmosphere.  The menu & condiments jar are "sticky", but frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.  Every time I come back to TO, "Jin Jin" (its Chinese name) is the first place I request to eat at.  

I love their beef ho fun (they will separate the beef out as I don't eat beef, great customer service!).  I love their shrimp wonton noodles, best noodles & best wontons.  They are so friggin' cheap.  A meal consisting of like 6 dishes totals $40 after 16% tax (oh Canada, I still love our universal healthcare!).

I like nice restaurants, but this place is so f**king good that it will always be my favorite Cantonese resto in TO.  I don't know if they speak Mandarin; if you don't speak Cantonese, just stick with English to be safe.
