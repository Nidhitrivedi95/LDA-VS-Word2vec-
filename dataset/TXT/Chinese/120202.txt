O_J5e6aoskxhGx8meOm1Og Love this place! My family has been coming here for the past 10+ years. My hubby and I love the General Chicken and my brothers love the Orange Chicken. My parents love the Beef W/Broccoli. Their crab puffs are SO. GOOD. They're my favorite crab puffs ever although they are a bit pricy. I think it's around $7 for 4 of them. Their soups are also yummy.

Things I would pass on: the Dragon Rolls and the Lo Mein. They're nothing to rave about!
