Dl-hhPCjRJM221XSwiuTbg The food is delicious and all my stars go toward that... BUT it's definitely more expensive than I'd like; the individual pots are neat but I think it's mostly for larger tables; they don't seem to have basic soy sauce -  we had to ask for it and they were confused; the service was a mess (granted it was a busy Saturday) but always super polite -  we sat there unacknowledged for 15 min, then the food came before the broth. My friends who ordered the "fancier"  broth didn't get it for another 20 min on top of that; no one answers the phone and, when they do, they greet you in Mandarin (they even left me a voicemail in Mandarin to confirm my reservation). That being said, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt (as it's still "relatively" new). I would definitely go again - I think the food speaks for itself here. Because I had great company during the long waits and the service was friendly, it wasn't bad enough to turn me away for good.
