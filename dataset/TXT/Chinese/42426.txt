I had the pork belly bites which were cooked perfectly but the mayo was a bit too much. Also had the duck confit with scallion pancakes, duck was a bit dry (which is hard to do with confit and also duck) but the scallion pancakes were delicious and tender but chewy. 

My friend ordered the short rib which was very nicely cooked, but the sesame sauce was not that great and the cream cheese biscuits just seemed out of place. 

For the price, I expected something a little more mind-blowing. Nice ambiance, nice staff, just not overwhelmingly good that I'd come back.
