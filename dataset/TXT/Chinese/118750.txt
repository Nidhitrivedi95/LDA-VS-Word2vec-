NnV0LkIs5YjUSPzAP1nWXQ I'm a fan! I think this spot has a lot of potential. They were very clever about their logo for I'm wondering if they are affiliated with the popular North Hollywood CA bhan kanom Thai. It looked and felt familiar but the food is solid. We didn't do a lot of food it was basically breakfast so we ordered an entree each and one appetizer. 

Lad Na Shrimp 4.5/5- they put some extra love by adding a fried egg on top and it loved it. It would've been perfect if the noodles were more burned. I love it when the noodles have that extra char from the wok. 

KraPow fried rice shrimp 4/5- could've been better if the rice wasn't mushy. The flavors were on point though I would still order it again 

Todd Mann (fried fish cake) 5/5 -very traditional dish it tasted like my mom or grandma used to make it. I loved it 

I love the service they were so nice and accommodating and I would come back for sure to show you guys some love!
