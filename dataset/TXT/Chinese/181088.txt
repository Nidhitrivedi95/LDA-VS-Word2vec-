XaqWUocr0MlYVi5yusjk0Q I usually get the crab rangoo, General Taos chicken and the mooshu pork, all of them come rather consistent and delicious. This time I ordered the Kung Pao chicken by bias confusion and  the jumbo shrimp on a limb.  First off there's nothing jumbo about these shrimp except the breading it's fried in. I had to break open and search for the shrimp and when I found it I could've sworn it was imitation crab meat, it could've been for all I care because I through it in the trash where it belonged. I had to eat one more bite to search for the flavor but they must've forgot that too. 
Everything else was good as usual but the shrimp should've been forgotten at China wok and I wouldn't have mind.
