The food is a tad overpriced in my opinion.  This wouldn't be the end of the world, but everything seems TOO SALTY.  Dumplings, salty.  Hard boiled egg appetizer, salty.  Ramen, like drinking salt.

The menu is a limited and while the dumplings are ok, ask about a low sodium option before you order.
