1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA The "authentic hoi nam chicken" was microwaved and rubbery. So disgusting. We also had the pork knuckle noodle soup which had zero flavor. Zero! And the other special, which was on their poster, was a thin steak on top of spaghetti and the sauce, when I tried to pour the sauce, it plopped out in one big coagulated blob. Nasty!!!!! 

Should've known when I saw just one table occupied when we walked in. Couldn't have known though from the shoddy service because come on, this is a Chinese hole in the wall, you don't come for the service, you come cuz the food better be the bomb! But it wasn't! 

They get one star cuz it was damn cheap and cuz the fried chicken wings were not bad and the salt and pepper fish was tasty to some people in the group.
