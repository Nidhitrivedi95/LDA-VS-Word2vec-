3rkxTx8DoZSl7_FryhXCVQ Maybe it's the fact that I'm sick and therefore am not in the mood for incompetence, but I find myself quite displeased with this place. I had ordered the egg and tomato noodle. What I received was hot water ( with a sprinkle of chicken broth) noodles and some tomatoes sprinkled inside with an oily fried  egg on top. All this costed me $7.99. Just.... No.
