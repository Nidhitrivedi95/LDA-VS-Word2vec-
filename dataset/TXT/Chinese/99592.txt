Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Most of the Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas serving dim-sum are pretty good.
Quality at most of them seems to never quite constant. I was told many of the dim-sum chefs do not stay at one place too long; or staying in Las Vegas too long (too much temptation from gambling).
We like the Orchids Garden because they serve dim-sum all day.
Wish they would fit the parking lot at the back.
