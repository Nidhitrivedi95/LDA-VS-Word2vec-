Q62lGVKqoKJ09lZNt2qpfw This is my first time having Indian Hakka fusion food and I must say, I am a fan. The chili chicken won me over. There's something wonderful about chicken.. Crispy.. Fried... And tossed in a sweet and sour sauce. 

What to order:
Chili chicken 
Veggie pakora (kindof spicy)
Singapore rice noodle
Crispy Shrimp with a yummy dipping sauce

On another note, the place is clean, has several TVs playing Bollywood music and the staff is nice.
