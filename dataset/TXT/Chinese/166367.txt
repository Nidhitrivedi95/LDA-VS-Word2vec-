vbVJzKDhHlhMnKRpES5QzQ Looking back at my weekend in Vegas, this was probably one of the best meals if not the best. My family and I got there at 11am and we were seated at the last open table, one of the larger ones in the center. We noticed that some smaller parties (of 2 or 3) had to share the other large tables. We were lucky that no other small parties came in while we were eating, so we had the entire table to ourselves.

We ordered the Pork with Garlic sauce (<U+849C><U+6CE5><U+767D><U+8089>), Water Boiled Meat and Fish (<U+6C34><U+716E><U+5169><U+6A23>), Mapo Tofu (<U+9EBB><U+5A46><U+8C46><U+8150>), Tan Tan Noodles (<U+64D4><U+64D4><U+9762>), and Spicy Chicken (<U+8FA3><U+5B50><U+96DE>). For all dishes, we could adjust the spice level, so I liked that as someone who generally can't eat too spicy. Everything was authentic, and our family of four actually finished all five dishes. I would say my favorite dish was probably the Pork with Garlic Sauce, followed by the Spicy Chicken. The chicken had a lot of bones to work through, but the flavor was totally on point.

Service was just okay. I think I was dying of sweat and tears halfway through our meal, but it took a while for the server to come and ask if we wanted more tea or some iced water. However, given how delicious the food was, I wish I had come back here a second time before returning to California. Will definitely recommend this place to my friends back home!
