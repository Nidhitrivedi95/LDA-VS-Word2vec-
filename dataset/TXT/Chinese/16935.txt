I suggest going with a group so you can order a bunch of dishes to share. I like that their food a nice mix of different things. 

I like the Braised Bamboo shoots, which were slightly sweet and crunchy. If you like bamboo  shoots you should give this a try. Another nice cold dish is the drunken chicken soaked in liquor.It reminds me of deli chicken, Chinese style.

I love their soup dumplings! Some of best that I've had. The dough is not too thick. The best part is drinking the soup out of the dumpling before you eat it. The pork also had a nice flavouring to it and the dumplings were cooked well. 

A nice alternative is their steam buns that is served with condense milk. You can either have this as a semi dessert or it pairs nicely if you want something a bit filling and will pair well with any of the other dishes,

Another dish I really enjoy eating here is the deep fried tofu with garlic sauce. The tofu is cooked really perfectly so that you get that nice crunchy texture and the inside is silken and soft. The sauce also has a nice spicy kick to it.

Some of their dishes can be very spicy so if you don't like spicy food, be careful of what you order. I would suggest just trying different things off the menu I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
