ywtDqnrLeWzG7Q-9ORmSsA This place is meant for take out I wouldn't really reccomend coming here to sit down for dinner unless styrofoam cups and plastic soup cups are your thing. The food on the other hand is fantastic, super falvorful and huge portions. I always get the mongolian beef however the last few times I've ordered I've been telling them to tune down on the spicyness. One time it was just way to much.
