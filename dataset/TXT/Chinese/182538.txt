XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA I would suggest a visit here to those in the area or traveling through. This place has nice selection and is busy enough to keep the food hot and/or cold on its serving stands. There is a good selection freshly prepared sushi. This place is worth a try. Oh yeah and everyone that works there seemed friendly enough.
