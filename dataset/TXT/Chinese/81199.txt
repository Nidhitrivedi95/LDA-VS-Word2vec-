GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg Saw a ton of cars in the parking lot but walked in no one was in the place. Took them 5 minutes to get our drink order. I was nervous for revolving because of the temperature of the food. Luckily the first item seaweed salad was cold. I got the Las Vegas roll which was more batter and rice than anything else. Came during happy hour most of the rolls they offered were a dollar less and lots of rice. The items on the conveyor belt were limited and they ran out of tamago. It was very bland and wasn't impressed
