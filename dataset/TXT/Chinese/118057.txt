NKHvmp19c6wrm0dZXcLtmQ I went to the restaurant in Mississauga.  My husband and I ordered the beef brisket with noodles and the curry chicken.  It was delicious.  The service was great.  I like how they have buzzers at each table to get the servers attention.  We also ordered dessert.  The dessert was amazing.  I will definitely go back.
