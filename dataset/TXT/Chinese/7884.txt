18xmM5Z3fwcI6UD0M4M8mg China Buffet King is a more authentic version of the Mandarin Chinese buffet. For those unfamiliar, this is an Asian all-you-can-eat buffet with "over 250 items" located in Richmond Hill (north of Toronto).  Access to this restaurant is best from the back of the plaza beside the "H Mart". Ample parking is available but often full on the weekends because of the popularity, large capacity (hundreds of seats) and price of this establishment.

I have to be honest I don't love coming here due to the crowd but if you have to go to a buffet (for family or simplicity reasons) I much prefer China Buffet King to their rivals.  

The weekend lunch menu is quite typical starting with the soup section featuring congee, egg-drop and wonton soups.  A modest salad bar provides the requisite greens for the non-Asians (salad is not a typical Chinese dish).  The staples such as fried noodles and rice, spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken balls, spare-ribs, deep-fried wings and the list goes on.  

The feature items include a decent dimsum bar with freshly made dumplings, buns and others small edibles.  A popular sushi-bar is also present with various rolls (salmon, California, etc.) and actual salmon sushi with fairly generous sized slices and normally sized rice balls.  Typically at AYCE sushi places the salmon is sliced paper-thin and the rice is plus-sized.  Only problem, they have the slowest and oldest chef preparing them to artificially metre their consumption (think short supply).

To finish off your meal there's a dessert bar consisting of many flavours of ice-cream and a variety of baked items and fruit.  Nothing fantastic but most are nice to end the meal on a sweet note.

Service is actually a cut above their food with helpful and friendly staff.  Again I'm not a fan of China Buffet King but in terms of food and price (~$25 for a weekend lunch) it is of decent value and quality.
