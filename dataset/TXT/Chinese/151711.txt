t-LnJne10SHAWATKYdQdJQ The food was good, but the service was absolutely terrible! I have been working in food service since I started college, and the service I had today was the worst I've seen. The waitresses were nowhere to be seen on the floor for over 20 minutes after we were seated, because they were sitting in a corner talking with each other. At one point, my mother was choking and coughing extremely hard in an attempt to breathe, and not only did no one come to check that she was okay, but I had to actually catch the waitress' attention just to get a glass of water for her. No one was attentive to their customers while we were there. I realize that HuHot is a chain where you put together your own food, but basic customer service is an essential component to any successful restaurant, regardless of the set-up. There is no excuse for the way we were treated today, and I may very well never come back.
