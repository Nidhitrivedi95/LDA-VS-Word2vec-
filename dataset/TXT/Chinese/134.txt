-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg Stopped by with my 8 year old daughter for dinner while one night while visiting Cleveland.  The meal was yummy.  I've had better but this place was nice.  As we walked in, my daughter commented on the wonderful aroma in the air!  We ordered 2 apps and a pho.  
We started with 2 pork and shrimp summer rolls with a special house sauce.  It was good, I never had it with pork inside.  The Thai basil and mint normally found inside was missing.  I thought the special sauce was mostly watered down hoisin with crushed peanuts on top.  Nothing special.  The lettuce wraps were just sauted shredded chicken and bib lettuce leaves served with a sweet sauce.   We ordered the rare beef pho.  It was serveral slices of thinly rare beef in a bowl of delicious broth and noodles.  Very good.  It was my daughter's favorite part of the meal.  The atmosphere was nice, wait staff was helpful.  They even had coloring books for us to use at dinner.
