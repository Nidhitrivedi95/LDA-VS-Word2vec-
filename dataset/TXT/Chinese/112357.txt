Mge4KiFP09sWeKpbM6J65w I have eaten here twice now. The first thing that you will notice is that the restaurant completely looks like crap ; they are going for the authentic vibe apparently.

The first time I had chicken with garlic sauce ($6.40 with tax), pork with dried tofu (~$12), and the second time had chicken with dried tofu ($12.85 with tax). Overall the winning dish was the Chicken with Dried Tofu (but the pork variant was good too). The lunch menu prices are insanely cheap around $6, but you don't get a ton of food either. The chicken with garlic sauce dish was loaded with veggies that I dislike, such as celery, but the flavor was pretty good. The lunch special came with 2 crab/cheese ragoons which were very good. 

Service is non existent. Water didn't come with ice, and there were no refills. 

Credit cards are accepted here and as of the writing of this review doesn't have a minimum charge like most Chinese places do.

And getting down to the creepy washroom is a challenge unless you are from Vietnam.

One possible complaint is that the second time I ate here, I developed a headache about an hour after eating and it went away a few hours later which concerns me that large quantities of MSG is used here (I am sensitive to it). Be warned.
