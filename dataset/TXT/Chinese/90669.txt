iiEjVLb4JDLE2xl8YGR-Gw I thought I was just going to another Chinese restaurant in the 600 block of Park St. and BOY WAS I WRONG!!!

Ok so here is the skinny so far.... Chili King has taken the place of Angkor Wat and while the overall atmosphere didn't get much of an upgrade I was extremely impressed with the quality and authenticity of the food! I am hopeful that the atmosphere will improve as the staff become better acclimated to their new surroundings and maybe they find a way to pipe in some music or something.

I can only judge by what I know and the Vegetarian Sauteed Triple Delight in Spicy Sauce was YUMMY! The bean curd, bean sprout, and Chinese cabbage were spot on and I am not sure what the sauce is made out of but it had more depth of flavor most dishes I have tried in the past. I asked for mine "extra spicy" and got about 10-15 extra chopped up Serano peppers which really turned up the heat :) The sauce was the perfect amount, the food came out quick and piping hot.

My other half ordered the Tofu w/Country Style Sauce - this dish is much milder and was perfect for her as she definitely is not a fan of the spice. I thought the portions of both dishes were spot on and her came with mushrooms, snow peas, bell peppers, and carrots. I felt this dish was also very authentic tasting and not overly "Americanized!" 

Now they do have two sides to the menu - on is more "American" style food and the other is the side we chose to order from. They have a very large selection of choices and I do not think anyone will go away hungry - (though keep in mind they are a newly opened restaurant and as such didn't have all the menu choices just yet ie. they didn't have egg rolls available just yet)

As we were walking up and past the other two Chinese restaurants on the block we were a bit skeptical about how this one would fair (especially after the last place to try this locale) but we left pleasantly surprised and happily full!
