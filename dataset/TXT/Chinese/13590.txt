2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q I honestly think that the quality of the food and customer service okay. I have been here many times because we get comps, but I would much rather use it somewhere else. I usually get the mini hotpots, which they are known for. I got two of them, one spicy and one normal. We then ordered the beef special and the seafood special. The overall hotpot experience is fine, I just feel that it could be better. Dirty cups were provided and we asked if the workers could change it, but it seemed like it was a burden to them. And one worker in particular ignored my mom multiple times which I find pretty rude. I understand all the workers are busy, but you don't have to ignore your customers. 

Oh yeah, and the restaurant itself is bad. Bad spacing of the table, really small restaurant, bad ambiance.
