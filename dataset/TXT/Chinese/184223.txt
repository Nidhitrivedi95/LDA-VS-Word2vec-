It was basically overcooked spaghetti with about 2/3 covered in some thick, sweet/spicy sauce and exactly 4 pieces of tofu. The noodles were not stir fried, let alone fully covered in sauce. There were hot and cold spots. The sauce tasted worse than trader joes. I am honestly shocked that a noodle place with such close proximity to a university has such unacceptable food. While I have given many 1-star reviews, this is by far the worst place I've rated.
