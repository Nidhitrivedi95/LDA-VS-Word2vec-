czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA Last minute dinner choice for our group of 10. Had plenty of room and nicely decorated. Believe it is also grand opening recently. $20 gets you all you can eat for 90 minutes. Good deal for teenagers on up. My group have 5 kids under 11 and had to pay full price. Our group 6 kids and for adults came out to $241. Little pricey for a strip mall place to eat. Food was very good and flavored well. Your basic Korean BBQ where they bring you your choices of meat and shrimp and you do the grilling at your table.
