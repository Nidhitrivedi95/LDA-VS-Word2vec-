yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Came in sat down promptly and order right away.  10,15,20,25,30min ..where's my food??? Saw about 3 different tables fill up..saw that they too ordered right away so 35, 40min..what do I see?? I see those 3 tables getting their food before me..WT.F!!!45,50min I think..I was too mad at this point or maybe an hour went by until I finally received my food..if the food I ate was any good (beef cube with brown rice) I would've given them 2 stars but it was bland and the portion was really small for $14..overall I don't think I'm ever coming back..what a wack ass experience.
