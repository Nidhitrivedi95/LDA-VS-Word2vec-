AYr2URtjoQ8Toh8_Jr4G6A The last time I went there they had a minimum order for occupying their seats, which meant that we had to find somewhere else to drink the bubble tea. Not too wild about that. In fact, that's why it's also the 'last' time I'll go there. I can get the same thing at their Squirrel Hill location, which is better in every conceivable way.
