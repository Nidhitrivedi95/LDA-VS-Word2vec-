3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug I was a regular at this restaurant growing up as it was one of my family's favorites many years ago when it was at another location.  A few months ago we visited this location and were totally disappointed.  The service was rushed and impersonal and the food just awful.  We thought it was a one time thing and decided to return today for lunch.  We ordered 2 dishes, noodles and sweet and sour shrimp.  The shrimp came and was heavily battered and the sauce was separate.  The batter was so overwhelming and the shrimp tasted like nothing, maybe previously frozen.  The vegetables that came with the dish were raw (peppers and onions) and the pineapple was canned!!  The noodles were was beyond tasteless and was barely edible.  We will definitely not be returning and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
