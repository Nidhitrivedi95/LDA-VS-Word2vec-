Qn5QMHOV6f5uHbxvrTPGRA I enjoyed the dumplings at the Dumpling lady. We came to the Company Store specifically to try these little dumplings. The location is great, minus the parking situation in NoDa, We grabbed a drink sat outside and ordered some crab, spicy beef and then some noodles. Everything was good, but loaded with sauce. No complaints here. Not the best dumplings I've ever had, but they were good and it made for a nice evening at The Company Store.
