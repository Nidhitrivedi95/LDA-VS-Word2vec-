6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q The restaurant near XS was closed so my wife and I decided to come here. We really enjoyed the vegan options they had. The price was about a hundred dollars for the both of us. We only had the dim sum and one order of lettuce wrap. The Gardein Shumai was pretty good for not being the real thing, but the dumplings stuck together. The Gardein Buns were really good. Overall we really enjoyed ourselves. Great atmosphere and friendly service, even though it was pretty slow. The food was pretty good too. I believe I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if I wasn't a vegan.
