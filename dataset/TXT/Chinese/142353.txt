RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg From the name and Yelp listing (Asian fusion, Chinese, thai?), I wouldn't have been able to tell that they serve sushi- but it's actually a hibachi/sushi joint in the style of Bennihana or Ohjah. Front windows advertise 50% off regular rolls and teppanyaki.

This place is a steal, for sushi: $40 got us two regular rolls, two special rolls, and a gigantic salmon skin hand roll, plus tax and tip for two. The pricing can't really be beat. Their discounted regular rolls are decent (if a bit heavy handed on the rice), but the garlic ponzu sauce had an odd chemical after taste that I did not care for at all. The WHATS WRONG and MUMMY special rolls were both artistically presented and tasty, with ample amounts of fresh fish. And that hand roll was gigantic! 

Good value for the sushi found here. Service was decent, attentive without being overbearing. Check the specials board behind the sushi bar for featured rolls: the Lady Gaga Roll sounded good, and the What's Wrong was a hit. 

Note that they have a large dining area: they were able to accommodate a 10 person graduation dinner group without reservations without a problem.
