079CV1EE5WLdQqVEVYFeHQ we went at 845 on a friday night with our baby and she still seated us and was totally sweet.  Best Mu SHu I've had in the valley.   I also had the ribs, and those for some reason are hard to find here in Phoenix.  they were pretty good.

I'll go back, but it was a little spendy.  the ambience was just ok, but with a baby and our lateness the food came out fast and was pretty good and she wasn't mad (or at least she pretended not to be) so I'll take it!
