0k5W44XU4uSEsPA163LKjQ Went in drive through about 3 PM on 11/28/2015.  Spent about $18 on one 3-item meal and one 2-item meal.  Very simple and uncomplicated order and customer.  The drive home was only about 3 minutes.  Family was VERY disappointed with all of our food, I was shocked at how much incredibly worse it was than most of my Panda E. experiences.  The rice was hard and uncooked in all of our containers.  My 'mushroom & chicken' was a soggy, nasty looking mess of almost exclusively mushrooms, more gray, soggy and falling apart (same with the chicken - looking especially anonymous and nasty).  I get that dish a lot at other locations so I know what to expect.  Also paid extra for the shrimp/walnut and the shrimp was limp and weird looking.  As usual, not the time nor energy to drive back and make it right.  That's the whole point about drive thru.....Unlike a motel or a full svc restaurant, the customer shouldn't have the onus to come BACK and give you a chance to make it right - there is no back, they have moved on with their afternoon - you get it right the first time.  
Apparently, when you go inside a Panda, under the customer's watchful eyes they make better judgment calls about the portion selection process (old vs. new, etc).  But during drive thru they take advantage of your ignorance and serve you the nasty stuff that the dog wouldn't even eat.  Or it may actually BE the dog.  Either way, my portion of "dog" was bad, sir!
