E8ugJa02FVCgfnjqV817iw The "bun mang vit" (duck and bamboo vermicelli noodle soup) is pretty good.  This is boiled duck meat in a vermicelli soup base.  This is my first time here and a Vietnamese friend recommended this as the dish to try.  Well I was not disappointed and thoroughly enjoyed the dish.  It hit my body well.

I put all the cabbage and leaves in and squeezed the lemon.  I also added a teaspoon of the the red pepper fish dipping sauce.  Mixed it together along with the jalapenos and the dish tastes good.

The red pepper fish dipping sauce is used to dip the duck meat as well for extra flavor.  Also another Vietnamese friend recommended that I try the Chinese dishes here as they are cooked Hong Kong style.  Will do that next time. :)
