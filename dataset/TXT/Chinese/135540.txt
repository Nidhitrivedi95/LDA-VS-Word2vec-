QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg Solid 3 stars. We enjoyed our meal fully. The paneer tikka masala was very good and the shrimp biryani was as well. We ordered the garlic naan was good but I must admit I definitely prefer the naan from India Garden in Oakland. Theirs is much bigger and seems more authentic with the big crispy bubbles and then the soft chewy center also. All in all good place. 3 and a half stars if I could give a half.
