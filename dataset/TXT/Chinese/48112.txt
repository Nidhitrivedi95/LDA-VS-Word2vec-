c4-w_6Xv4i2qRE3c4Qas7w We went here to avoid a long lineup at Mother's Dumplings. It turned out to be a decent alternative. I actually liked the super casual cafeteria atmosphere. Everything is very reasonably priced and comes to the table quickly. Of the things we ordered I really liked the pan fried green onion pancakes and the steamed spinach with shrimp and garlic dumplings. Next time, I will pass on the deep fried mash taro with curry chicken and the pineapple and ginger drink.
