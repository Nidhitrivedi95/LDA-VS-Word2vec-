9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw The food was very disappointing. We ordered delivery and there were multiple items left off the order. Their wonton soup contained shrimp which is not listed on the menu. Not an real issue unless you are allergic to shellfish. The fried rice was littered with egg shells, and even after the driver returned with the Egg Drop Soup (forgotten off the order) it was basically water with cornstarch and egg whites added. Over all this was a horrible delivery and experience. There are just to many other restaurants in the area to be buying from them again.
