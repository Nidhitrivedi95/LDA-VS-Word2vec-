rsQAS-k7GldsJm7UAtVyYA I ordered a rare beef rice noodle soup for pick up. When I got home I realized that they literally gave me frozen beef. Not rare beef, FROZEN. I thought maybe I had to let it cook in the broth but that wasn't the case. It was red and had blood on it still. Aside from the terrible food, they have horrible service. Upon arriving, the people that work there looked annoyed. I don't reccomend this place to anybody. I recommend every Vietnamese restaurant besides this place. You will be wasting your money. If they do get your food right, the service isn't worth it. If I could give this place -5 stars I would. I could have been in the emergency room if I ended up eating the food so I'm never ever ever going back here.
