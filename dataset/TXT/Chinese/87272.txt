HSz7sKZBjJkishjxqUvOMQ Why did I get seated staring at the nasty fish tank? The lady owner of this long-standing restaurant has always had the same grumpy/angry face for the numerous years I've been here. I guess this is what Chinese restaurants are all about. Bad service but cheap good food. When I say good food, I really just mean their french toast. You get 3 large triangles of french toast that I am always craving for. However, I want peanut butter in them....
