yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I agreed with Marie T. Food is ok, but the service is definitely the WORST!!! We ordered wonton to share between my husband and myself as a soup for starter. The waiter brought out the wonton bowl as big as a "pho bowl", so I asked the waiter for a small soup or rice bowl to spilt the soup up. He said, "ok". So we waited and waited and waited... Nothing. Another waiter came by, I asked for the same thing...again nothing.
