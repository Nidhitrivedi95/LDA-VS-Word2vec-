kj1KQgC-mCRV4vYZlWitzg I always visit this location being the closest to my house. Restrooms are the cleanest i have seen in fast food. I visited around 7pm yesterday. The dining room needed attention (which is the first time i have seen it in need of). Kym was my server, I was offered multiple samples and felt she really cared about my visit to ensure i come back. Other times have visited i felt rushed (mostly during dinner time, which is understandable) and seems like there is always a new face working, aside from the two girls in the front: Cher and Kym. Over all, i am always satisfied with the food and i will continue to return!
