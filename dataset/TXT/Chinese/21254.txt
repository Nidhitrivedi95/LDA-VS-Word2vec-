68PJJkcq_i0SlLqO6t7Qxw My friend took me here for dinner one chilly evening.

The food was fantastic. We ordered pot stickers; snow pea shoots in lemon and garlic; beef and scallion pancake roll; beef shank noodle soup. We ordered other dishes but those were the stars of the show for me. 

Portions are big and the food was flavoursome, hot and well seasoned.  Beef noodle soup is s definite favourite of mine and I have since had this as take out. 

It is quite intimate in terms of the seating and I agree with what others have said regarding the spacing of tables.  The restaurant feels clean; staff were attentive; reasonably priced too. 

Will return for sure.
