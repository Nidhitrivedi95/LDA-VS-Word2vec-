jNiZgCwZj4CNw1noxiC8PQ Mandarin is in a nutshell a nicely decorated canadianized Chinese buffet with many options to offer. The service is okay, though sometimes it's slightly hard to catch the staffs attention to clear plates. Buffets are always quantity over quality- but Mandarin has many options to offer for appetizers, mains and desserts. The food isn't bad, but that doesn't make it good. I've tasted much better for a reasonable price. For those health conscious readers, healthy  options here are harder to come by. So make sure you do that extra work out.

Good for groups - pricing is meh ... Can be cheaper. 

The decor has this nice appeal to it- Asian themed.

Somehow - I will make a trip here every year during Christmas time :)
