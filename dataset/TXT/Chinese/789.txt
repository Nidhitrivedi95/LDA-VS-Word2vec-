-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ If you don't have anything nice to say dont say anything at all. That's not my motto.

I had been wanting to try this place out for a looong time but hadn't been able to. So we sat and the hostess didn't really want us there. Then the server didn't really either, he wasn't rude but you can tell he had preferences between guests. He went to the people that were next to us about five times and he only came by us twice. Including the people to the other side of us. 

The food however wasn't very good we both had the pork rice bowls. The pork hadn't been cleaned whats meant to be trashed was in my plate as food. You cant also tell it was the cheap kind of pork. Eww. Terrible.  

Also had the pork buns which were actually good but again they weren't cleaned. Rather would've had the spring rolls or even the wonton soup for a the full dinner.

Its also not a thing of mine to review drinks but I had a mountain dew and that was $4 we had two of those. Which meant I paid $8 for 2 sodas. Ridiculous. Seriously, not worth it but good enough to try after all this time of wanting to come by here. 

Service was also very slow. No just noooo. I mean I really wanted to like this place but the pork sides really need to be cleaned off. That's disgusting. $44 for two people and would have been a lot less had it not been for the $8 sodas. Again stupidity to pay that much for two sodas. I would have stopped at the gas station and boughten a drink there for $3.50 less. 

Sorry yall to work on the prices and food. Also service wasn't rude but he was in the kitchen most of the time how would he know if his guests need anything if he's always in there. 

Also the place was small and you can tell they really force people in there. Need to take out at least 1 table per section. I could hear what everyone else was talking and eating they were about less then 2 feet away from where I was sitting. I could hear how much their dinner was lol...

Sorry.
