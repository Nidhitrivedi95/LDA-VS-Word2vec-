OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I don't get to have dim sum very often, but we were craving it and this place got good reviews so my friends and I decided to check it out.  We were a little put off when they asked us if we would share a table with another party, but after we refused to share they found us a table pretty quickly.  The food was fresh and delicious, lots of choices and everything was a hit.  The pork buns were still warm, the turnip cake was delicious, and we were so excited that they had porridge and the Chinese donuts!  Service was not great, but that's no surprise- the food more than made up for it.  I didn't have an egg tart at the end of the meal because I was stuffed, but those at our table who did said they were incredibly fresh and tasty.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm craving dim sum in Vegas!
