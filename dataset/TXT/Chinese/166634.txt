ve7-f5urgRoFvhoez9eUjA Really enjoyed visiting this new Chinese restaurant not far from my office.  It took over an old Pizza Hut building and to be honest, it still feels a little like Pizza Hut inside, which is a little bit surreal, but the owner came out to greet us and we felt very much at home there.  The restaurant serves Thai food and Chinese.  If you want, you can also order off the "Chinese" menu, which gives you more authentic choices- the kind of things that real Chinese people order when they go out.

My friends ordered the lunch specials which are a good value.  I ordered the "Sasha beef" off the Chinese menu.  It was really tasty- just what Chinese "BBQ" tastes like.  I also ordered the Red Curry which was a bit mild for my taste, but still quite good, even though it had zucchini and I don't generally like zucchini.  Wouldn't have minded if the sauce was a little thicker.

Thirdly I got the shrimp with lobster sauce, which is a classic Chinese banquet dish.  Really loved the sauce on this- very authentic.  

My friend's dishes were interesting- not quite the typical breaded and deep fried Chinese American food.  As a result they were lighter tasting- like you are a guest at someone's house.  It is likely a lot healthier for you- you don't feel dirty after eating it like I sometimes do after eating American Chinese food.  

Portions are a good value and the hostess was very sweet.  I plan to come back or order delivery from this place in the future.
