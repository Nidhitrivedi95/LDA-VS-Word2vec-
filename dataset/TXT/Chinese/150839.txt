SXAXzOwp0I2wiA1V3iMtbg We were sooooo hungry so we ordered lots of foods! Egg rolls, beef with black bean sauce, wonton soup, shrimp lo mein, moo shoo pork and kung pou chicken! Whew. that was a mouthful of orders indeed. Everything was delicious. Kung pou chicken and the noodles were especially good. Moo shoo pork left a bit to be desired but it was still solid. But the real gold was beef with black bean sauce. It was different from what I tasted at other restaurants. It had authentic taste. 

We also wanted to order some foods from Thai menu but we were not familiar with the cuisine so we only covered Chinese section. They do takeouts too. 

The restaurant is clean, and server was friendly. Foods came out so quick too. 

We will be coming back here often as our neighbourhood lacks decent Chinese restaurants, and this really hit the mark for us!
