Ns4tjgLfqR1qawGlNFROBA So I went here for lunch today with a friend and it turns out the specials that are advertised on here are no longer being offered, however, our nice waiter let us have the happy hour menu as it was still advertised. Very nice! So she got some sushi for wonderful prices (two rolls for 5$... seriously?!?! wow!) and I got the lettuce cups, which were really tasty, and the potstickers which were not good. They were fried, but not real crispy, and they had this gloppy, weird tasting sauce on top and then served with just soy sauce. Kind of weird and overall not pleasant. The food they were cooking smelled good and the lettuce cups were really yummy so I would come back... probably just for happy hour though.
