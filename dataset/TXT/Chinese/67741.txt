eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g Went there for Mother's day dinner, but received very bad service. Staffs were rude and poorly trained. Considering the quality of food was about OK (actually the food from competitors have better taste), a $500 combo for five ppl was just over priced. Overall it's just not worth it. Won't go again.
