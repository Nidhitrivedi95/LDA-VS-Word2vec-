As for customer service, I really don't like being pressured to order things that I might not like to eat.  I think it is normal to upsell your products, but being pressured to order more was the last thing that I wanted when I am eating out.  They may think that this is good service, but for me, this is borderline poor service.  Well, maybe this is how this restaurant considered to be good customer service to breath down the customers' necks and tried to coerce them to order more.   

The highly recommended baos really lack in amount of meat, flavours and fluffiness.  I have tasted many baos in my life before and I usually loved the ones that are fresh and fluffy.  However, the bao offered by this restaurant for $2.10 each was gummy, soggy, and the outside was covered with spots of watermark.    I was glad that each of us at the table only ordered one bun per person.  The sesame oil peanut butter chicken with noodles was good with bold flavour.  The lamb with cumins was just bad news as I didn't really taste any lamb flavour and the cumin flavours were not strong at all.  I think the cumin maybe stale as it was so mild that I barely tasted any cumin flavour.  The bao and the lamb were both a big disappointment.  One of the waiters or maybe he is the manager was extremely impolite as he was banging on the table every time he refill the tea for our table.  I rather him not come by if he cannot even put the teapot onto the table properly.  I simply wouldn't come back to this restaurant as the price was steep, food was not okay, and poor customer service.   We each ended up paying $45 for 3 small baos and 2 dishes.
