I_WWH2vYccjz-QxW3u1zJA Ok I cannot really genuinely review this place because it is a buffet.  
Eat! tons of food and choices. Well maintained and freshly renewed by the staff.
Some days this place is packed other days it is not so packed but always busy.
It is one the best buffets I have been to in Phoenix Metro.
I am not a fan of the buffet but I can put up with this one, 
They have most of the items I enjoy at a Chinese buffet
