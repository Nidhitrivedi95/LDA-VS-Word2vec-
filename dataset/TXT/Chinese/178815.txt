X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ Wow this place was Delish!  Every dish we tried was so yummy.  We had the roti appetizer and beef satay and both were completely finished.  Then for entrees we had the beef and broccoli which was more broccoli heavy, but I was okay with that, really flavorful and fresh. We also had the mango crispy chicken, my husband really enjoyed it, but the sweet and sour sauce that it came with was a tad too sour for me but still very good.  Lastly we had the Beef chow fun, the noodles were perfectly cooked with a decent amount of beef. I topped it all off with a Malaysian Iced Tea which I loooooved, and could have had five more glasses.  Too bad I am not a local or else I would definitely return!  Servers were kind and considerate, and the restaurant was clean!
