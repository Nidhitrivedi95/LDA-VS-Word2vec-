TA1Q7RWVzMigi5X3FAmctw Love Hakka cuisine in general. This restaurant is small with very casual, family owned business with grandma working along with son and daughter in law and one girl as the waitress, the staff is not friendly whatsoever. I have been here several time but they are more busy with their pickup catering then actual seat down and eat. 

Good size portions and all they curry or dry dish tastes the same for less price. All the gravies are same tasting. Despite that my friend I went here on regular basis

However I stopped going here when once we ordered fish and chicken pakora and you won't believe the it came out totally uncooked. As in it was fully cooked from outside but totally pink and wet from inside. So I asked the waitress if she can request chef to cook it properly so I split open one chicken pakora in front of her. She had the guts to tell it. It's Cooked and it looks like that. I looked at her and said I am not an expert in cooking but I am an expert when it comes to eating maybe I am and this is not cooked what so ever so please take it. She looks at me confuse and takes it away. 5 mins later she comes out with the same pakora that the chef has deep fried and now it's all burned and it's not raw from the inside. I called her again and made her take it away and so she did and she rolled her eyes at me too. The only customer service I got was they didn't charge me for the food I didn't eat. 

For some reason my phone always loses its network range when inside. Maybe it's my phone.
