UX85E6Bo0pYzLD4Cq3xjwQ First time eating here today, I ordered a Dan Dan bowl to go.  I get home starving and ready to eat.  As I dig in to take my first bite I noticed my noodles were not thoroughly cooked.  As I go in for my 2nd bite I see a long strand of hair blended in with my noodles. Barf! So gross,  my stomach is turning.   
This was very disappointing after having a long day and wanting to go home,  eat and rest. What a waste of money and food :(
