b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag I was staying at NY NY for a work event, travelling alone as usual. So I pulled up to the Chin Chin bar right after the trade show I was working for a quick dinner before going upstairs to my room to crash. 

The bartender was wicked friendly, and made me the most delicious ginger martini ever (I needed one!). There was another guy at the bar who had just received his meal, and it looked AMAZING. I just gestured over to his order and said I'd get exactly that!

Brown rice, tangerine beef, and steamed mixed veggies... YUM! I was only able to finish off maybe 1/4 of the rice and maybe only 1/2 of the beef, and it's too bad there's no fridge/microwave combo in the rooms or I would've totally gotten leftovers, but it was so worth it! And oh yeah... I had that for dinner at least 2 more times during my week there!

Not the best Chinese food I've had (the food came out waaaaaaaaaay too quickly to be made fresh - the "crispy" beef was soggy!), but still really good for a quick dinner. And the bartenders have always been really friendly!

And the breakfast buffet isn't bad - fried rice and bbqed pork for breakfast, yes please!
