NdpvGGF4cLrdnA6ydSZz3g The one waiter we had was great but the manager clearly does not care about retaining a customer base or anything even close to such intentions. I went there for my sisters birthday and I am a vegetarian. They did not have any vegetarian soups, which is fine, except when I asked for just hot water in my pot, they said they had to charge me 2.50 for it. I was completely ready to pay the 23.99+tax for hot water and vegetables, but half of their items on their menu were also not available. When we asked to speak to the manager, he refused to come over and was hiding by the counter. 

With that said, the rest of the party I was with was impartial to the food. The beef was tough, the options were limited, they didnt even have tongs or soup spoons which would definitely help in the cooking process. Overall I miss our go to hot pot place that recently closed and was really hoping for a replacement. I will definitely not be returning and will be advising others to go elsewhere.
