7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew I'm on this mad hunt to visit every Chinese food restaurant in all of Arizona - without gaining 200 pounds....  So, I went to China King the other night.  What a strange evening!  This is a pretty big restaurant, but it's odd because it looks more like place to have a low budget wedding than to go out for dinner.  The atmosphere doesn't have much personality.  The bright florescent lighting should have been in an office, not a restaurant.

We were seated by the big tanks of live lobsters.  Though I love to eat lobster, this disturbed me.  At one point, one of the waitresses grabbed a lobster from the tank and put it in a small white bucket.  I watched in amazement as the lobster jumped around in the bucket in a mad panic.  Then I thought I was going to throw up.  Here is someone's order, jumping around in a bucket.

Look, I know this stuff goes on.  Animals get killed and served in restaurants every day.  But the part that bothered me was I was SITTING RIGHT NEXT the tanks of lobsters on death row (I am aware this may be a personal distaste).

Anyway, the service was not the greatest.  The waitress was pleasant, just in a hurry and not really attentive.  We didn't get any water (until we asked) or crunchy noodles with dipping sauce.  I ordered the chicken with vegetable combination dinner, which was very good.  My husband ordered the garlic chicken with vegetables, which he liked as well.  The portions are pretty big as we had enough for another meal for two the next day.

So, basically, the food is good and the service is so-so.  If I were to go back, I would get my order to go (and avoid the live lobster show).
