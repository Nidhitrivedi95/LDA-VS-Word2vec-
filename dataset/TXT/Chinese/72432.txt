Presentation of pan fried dumplings was unique and pleasing, but flavor was unremarkable. Best choice was the three way combo that included a mushroom tofu version.  Not sure about the seemingly-artificially-colored hot sauce on the table. Place was generally clean.  Service was efficient on a hot noontime midweek. We are family of 4 from NH US and have traveled in search of best dumplings (especially xiao long bao aka "soup dumplings") including Flushing NY, San Francisco and throughout asia.  This place did not offer XLB, so cannot comment.

It appeared to us that this place and Mothers Dumplings close by were the highest rated, so we went to both on our whirlwind afternoon tour of Toronto Chinatown.

In the final analysis, we would return here but it wouldn't be our first choice.
