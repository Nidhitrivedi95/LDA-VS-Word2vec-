uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw Note: The restaurant was closed for a few days back in the summer due to not passing health inspections but is now open again.  I don't see any visible upgrades or changes though.

There's always a slight wait, but as the food comes so quickly, the wait time is not too terrible.  

The noodles are pretty good, though the meat-to-noodle ratio is sub-optimal.  I'd like more meat to go along with my noodles, but i guess that's their way to get you to order their side dishes.  They have a wide variety of side dishes for pretty cheap, and in particular their skewers are really good.  I've tried the beef and lamb skewers and even the fried tofu - all were right off the grill and very delicious.
