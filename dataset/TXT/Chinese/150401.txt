SUktrYdNQD8k2vvkM4OpfA I realize that the standards for Chinese food in this town are extreeeemely low.  However, the fact this joint has such a high yelp rating leaves me distressed over the taste buds of my fellow yelpers.

Fried rice- fairly standard, right?  I've never had such a horrible and disgusting excuse for fried rice.  There was nothing in it.  No bits of egg, no meat, no shreds of carrot, no scallion, no onion, no peas.  Nothing.  A scoop full of sticky brown-ish rice.  It smelled like cardboard and had no discernible flavor.  Just rice doused with soy sauce.  Effing gross.

The chicken did not taste like General Tso.  It was like they added a tad of soy sauce to the sweet n' sour.  It was not spicy.  It was not flavorful.  And the meat itself?  Dry, tough, stringy, chewy.

The rangoon were filled with cream cheese, but they didn't seem to have any crab.

This place blows.
