They had a hostess from Hawaii that had great conversation etiquette and was very entertaining, the servers were extremely hospitable, and the food was delicious. Between the soup and that lemon chicken I had to leave with leftovers because it was soooo filling. 

I would say the Lemon Chicken took the win. It was placed on a bed of cabbage (which I'm not personally a fan of, but I get the hype). The lemon sauce that came with it was to die for. I literally DRENCHED my chicken in it after a test taste. No regrets. 

They were really up front that the sides are a la carte which I appreciated, but I do with it AT LEAST came with rice. I get buying alternative sides, but rice is a staple. It should be included in a $17 plate of glorified lettuce and a single breaded chicken breast. I'm just saying. 

Other than that small little detail, perfect experience, highly recommend.
