z8oIoCT1cXz7gZP5GeU5OA Don't let the outside exterior fool you, this restaurant serves authentic fresh dim sum that is very reasonably priced. In it's past life, it was a bar called Daybreak where you could sing karaoke in a separate room. Daybreak was a pretty shady bar where shady things happened in the washroom but the beer was cheap.

So one day I was hungry for dim sum and I was in the area, so I decided to drop in. They have done a pretty good job of renovating the inside, they have kept the washrooms the same as before and the patio the same which is still an eyesore that has not been renovated.

They charge $2.10 for most dishes on the weekday and $2.40 for most dishes on the weekend. They also charge .80 a person for cha wei, in English it translates to a tea fee which is pretty common for every dim sum restaurant but normally it's $1 or higher.

Normally I order  a lot of the basics like har gow (shrimp dumpling, siu mai (pork dumpling, har cheung (shrimp roll) and my favourite fung zaau (chicken's feet).

At Milliken Bar & Restaurant instead of old ladies pushing carts around, you order from a sheet and a waiter or waitress will bring the food to your table when it's ready. This process usually ensures that the food is freshly made and hasn't been sitting around. The food like I mentioned is fresh, pretty well executed, decent sized portions and tastes good. The service is not bad, pretty comparable to most of the dim sum restaurants in Scarborough.
