3qjztON1RW5Hn6QJLDl8ug Me and my boyfriend visited Omei last night, upon arrival it was very busy because of Chinese New Year, so we waited about 30 mins for a table for 2. 
The hostess was very nice and aplogized for the long wait. We sat down took a quick look at the menu, but we both craved lobster, so we ordered the lobster "special" two 1.5 lobsters seasoned with ginger and scallion for $80. About 10 mins later the food came out hot and fresh and we dug in. Food was very delicious!!! Although it was on the pricey side (two drinks and lobster special with everything included came to $119) 
Its okay though as I dont mind splurging once in awhile, overall quality was good. I would deffinately visit again.. maybe try something new next time :)
