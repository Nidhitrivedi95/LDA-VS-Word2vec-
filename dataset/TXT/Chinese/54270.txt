We ordered the house super bowl congee, fried Turnip patties, Cantonese chow mein and seafood fried rice with dry garlic. The food came out a little too quick for us, so some of the dishes were only luke warm by the time we got to them. However, the flavours were on point as the seasonings were well balanced with each other. The servers were attentive and quick.
