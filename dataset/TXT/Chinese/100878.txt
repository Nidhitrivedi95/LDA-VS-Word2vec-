K2CdjES-IZDDEgetOnf0Vw Learned about this place thru a Globe and Mail article which highlighted lesser known spots in the East End. It lived up to the hype. If Malaysia is "truly Asia" then this was authentic street food. What stood out for me was the time that it took to cook each dish. You could that they were not just mass-producing all the dishes. By the time I got there, half the dishes were sold out at 2PM on a Sunday! My only suggestion is for this family to diversify into the food truck business and bring their awesome food to the downtown streets. They would make a killing!
