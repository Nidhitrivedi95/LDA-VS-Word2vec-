D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Just a quick update from my earlier review....

1.  Went here on a Friday before we were headed to the strip for a show.

2.  It was about 5:45 pm and the place was not busy, but no, no tables for four of us as they were going to have two large reservations coming.  We were offered to sit in their outside area.

3. You can imagine, it is about 80 degrees in shade at this time of the year and I was a bit "irritated".  

4.  However, they were very pleasant, served us very eagerly and treated us very nice.

5.  They advised us of the happy hour and all the snacks they had that were awesome and inexpensive like:

WIngs
Thai Nachos (very nice)
Beef Jerky
Pot Stickers

There wer about 8 others like edamame, fried tofu, other meat dishes that we did not order .

This really made me feel that place is great because even in the adverse situation of being told we could not have a table inside when it was freakin empty, and still having a great time and great service means that this place is the REAL DEAL.

GK says, check it out!
