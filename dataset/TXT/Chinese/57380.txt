D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw I can't say I enjoyed the food here all that much.  The roti appetizer, although good, was so greasy.  Maybe that's why it was good.  The only thing that was ok/good.  The tom yum soup was lacking in flavor.  I added lime to it and still didn't amount to much.  The pad thai was nothing to write about...so that is all she wrote.  

Ok, there's more.  The wait to get my check took awhile.  I gave them my credit card.  They said sorry but our machine is down, can you pay cash? I said no, I didn't have cash on me.  They said ok we will imprint it the old-school way.  Fine, do what you need.  The imprinted receipt came back to me.  They pointed to where I can put in the tip.  Hmmm...

Of course I tipped!  But to point that out...really??
