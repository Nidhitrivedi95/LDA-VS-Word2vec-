rwKJHC-DE2aLTZiS_xFy7g Came here after a long day of school and I was starving! I found their noodle soup actually really good; not because I was starving lols. I had their house special, which included various topping. They have two selection of noodles, thick and thin. I tried both and I really don't have a preference. Imo the thick one is a bit more unique to have. The broth was tasty and I loved how every bite I had always had a different topping, such as tripe, radish, porkchop, beef, Bok Choy etc. Definitely had my noodle fix. Place is clean and they give complimentary lemon water.
