aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg My FAVORITE place to go to for Crispy Roasted Pork, Roasted Duck, BBQ Pork, and Wonton noodle soup. We've been coming here since they first opened and haven't been anywhere else for these yummy dishes since. 

Crispy Roasted Pork - Has the light crispy skin roasted to perfection. The seasoning on it is spot on as well

Roasted Duck - When they first opened their ducks were always plumped and meaty like they were on steroids. Now it's been a hit or miss but is still perfectly roasted and seasoned

BBQ Pork - very moist and seasoned well. Love the fatty parts lmao

Wonton noodle soup - wontons are perfectly made and not under seasoned. Noodles aren't over cooked or under done. Comes with Chinese broccoli and the broth is seasoned good unlike other places

Place is great. This place is pretty small so is always packed!! For to go orders call in advance. For crispy pork make sure you call if your coming late at night in case they're sold out. It happens pretty often. Don't forget to bring cash since it is CASH ONLY! Enjoy!
