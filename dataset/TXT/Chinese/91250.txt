iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A I have been craving Egg Foo Young forever and after reading the reviews on Golden China on Flamingo, decided to give them a try.  

We wanted to have the food delivered so I gave them a call....the order process was very easy...my order was easily understood, repeated back to me as well as my address and after giving the girl my debit card #, concluded quickly.  She quoted my price and said the food would be arriving in about 45 minutes from the time of our call...Well, 20 minutes later and there he was.  Excellent delivery time in my opinion...

We ordered 2 lunch specials, orange chicken and the cashew chicken both for $5.55 and an order of my egg foo young (veggie) for $7;95.  The lunch specials were packed with food....I only tried a few bites of the cashew chicken but I must say that the chicken itself was very tasty...my only problem with that dish was the cashews themselves...they seemed "stale"....

The rice and chow mein was plentiful...maybe a little bit more than you'd get at Panda Express.  I did not try the Orange Chicken, but my brother in law said it was "ok" but he liked Panda better.

The coveted Egg Foo Young was good but extremely "thick" which dropped down my rating from 4 stars to 3....The portions were huge, the taste was good but the thickness of the pattie was just too much.  Gravy that accompanied was put on the side, not on the pattie itself and that was appreciated.  I like being able to put on the amount I want..not the amount the restaurant thinks I should have.  I have to say, it was quite good. 

Will we order from them again?  I don't know quite frankly.  We have a Panda right across the street that has better Orange Chicken and gives the same portions of rice/noodles...but they don't serve the Egg Foo Young...so it's a toss up.....but if you want a lot of food for your money and want "decent" Chinese food, this is a good place to go.
