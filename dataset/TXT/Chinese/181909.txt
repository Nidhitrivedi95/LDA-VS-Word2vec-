Xfod0UWr_9B-TOM6qxVIwQ Just moved to Sdale from the N. Valley and after reading the recent Yelp reviews for this place (and the 4 star overall rating), I thought I would try it for delivery.  Took about 1 hour to get the food and wasn't impressed at all.  Blah Moo Goo Gai Pan and my roomie didn't like his Chicken Lo Mein much either.   Hot and sour soup was so so as well.  I did like the fried wontons they give you for free, thin and crisp unlike most Chinese restaurants. Throwing the delivery menu in the trash and won't be ordering from them again.
