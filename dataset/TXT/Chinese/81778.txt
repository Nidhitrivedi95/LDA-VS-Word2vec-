H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag We've lived here about a year and half and had seen this place right next to our house but never stopped in until tonight, and boy do I wish we had gone sooner! Amazing prices, excellent food, fantastic service! They have all day combination plates that are a very good portion, complete with soup and a little variety plate of tasters. I had the Orange chicken combo plate with fried rice. Definitely one of the better orange chickens I've had. It was very flavorful and hearty, while also light and fresh. My husband had the Hot & Sour soup, which I tasted and it was very good. He really enjoyed it! We both left completely satisfied and looking forward to our next trip. We'll be back soon!

**Update: went back a couple days later to try the Wor Wonton Soup- excellent! Also had the General Tso's Chicken combination plate, my husband had the Kung Pao Chicken combination plate. All the food was delicious, very fresh and made to order. So glad we found this spot! New local favorite!
