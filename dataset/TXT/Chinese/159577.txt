U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ Read about this place on a Yelp so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm somewhat picky about Vietnamese restaurants as I travel to Bay Area a lot. But this place is exceptionally good. The service was solid and very friendly. Place is very clean and well maintained. You can tell they take pride in making their restaurant welcoming. But most importantly the food is fresh, well prepared and very tasty. I have the seafood phu and it was fantastic. The vegetables were crisp and fresh. 

Pho Chandler had good traffic so you know they are pleasing their clients. I look forward to my next visit.  

Well Done Pho Chandler!!!
