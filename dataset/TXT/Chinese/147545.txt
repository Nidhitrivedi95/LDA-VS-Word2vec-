 We were here for lunch and the lunch menu was sufficient. I stepped out side of my comfort zone, from the normal beef w/broccoli and went for the Shrimp and Chicken dish, it was fantastic. The plate was well put together, and the portion size was plentliful.  It was a spicy dish, but was nicely cooled with the steamed rice and the celery in the dish.  We had 2 sides to pick with our lunch, I ordered the Veggie rolls, which were by far the best veggie rolls I have ever had.  I also order a wonton soup which was considered an appetizer, it was excellent, two wontons in the soup, one with meat, and the other stuffed with shrimp. My husband ordered the Mongolian beef with a salad as a side, the salad came with the ginger dressing and it was also excellent.  I tasted my Husbands beef and it was tasty and not chewie. 

We have visited several upscale chinese restuarants in Chicago and for Charlotte I was pleasently surprised, I would visit this place over and over again and bring many friends and family here. the atmosphere was very nice, and the decor was also very nice. The bathrooms were lacking a little of what the seating area had to offer, but it was clean.
