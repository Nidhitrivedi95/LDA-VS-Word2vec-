vsi_PMRgyFy4_vVfQErtCA I've heard great things about the dim sum here. Unfortunately I was unable to try it as, despite there being many empty tables on both floors of the restaurant, they refused to seat my party of 4 because they were "too busy". I've never been flat-out refused service at a restaurant before. So if you do decide to go check out the apparently legendary dim-sum here, perhaps call first and see if they're in the mood? :(
