0aA5l11oXes0aS6mkN5lMQ My partner and I were excited to try this place; we both love Chinese food and spicy dishes and we love supporting local businesses. 
I ordered from the vegetarian portion of the menu and the dish that came looked interesting but it was about 50% fish. I explained that I don't eat animals at all and since the dish was in the vegetarian section and didn't specifically say it contained animals, I was expecting a vegetarian dish. The waitress asked if I liked vegetables (really) and suggested a tofu and bok choi dish. I was a bit apprehensive because "tofu and bok choi" tends to be incredibly boring, but as the staff recommended it, I thought it must be a good choice. NOPE! The dish was swimming in translucent, viscous, whitish sauce that lacked any flavor besides salt. I ate a few pieces of tofu and they were bland and squishy, the bok choi was limp and similarly flavorless. I didn't bother trying the frozen carrot cubes or peas that were floating in the sea of slime. After a few minutes, the sauce began to congeal. It was, quite frankly, disgusting. 
A server asked if I liked the dish and, trying to be nice, I told her it was very bland and not to my tastes. She asked if I wanted to take it to go (uh, no) and when I said I did not, she picked it up, made a strange face, sticking out her tongue, and took it away. I don't know if she didn't see that I was looking at her or if she was sympathizing.
I'm sad to say, the rice wasn't even good. My partner did like his dish and said the fishy tofu was pretty good but also had a slimy sauce. They charged us for all 3 dishes and a 15% tip on top of it! The tip wasn't indicated anywhere that we could see, so basically it's a rip off.
