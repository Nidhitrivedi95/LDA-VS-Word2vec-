cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A Quite possibly one of the worst eating experiences I've had in a long time. Chino's used to have a restaurant in South Chandler that I actually enjoyed. When they closed I was disappointed as going to their other location would be quite the road trip. My family was in the area due to helping out a friend so decided it's a great chance to get our Chino's fix. I was so very wrong...

First thing that hits you when you enter this Chino's, the smell...I believe it was either sewage or just "bathroom" odor that permeated the restaurant. The service person that was taking out order was pretty rude during the order process (not once asking us if we wanted to sample anything). I had filled out two forms as I thought that was the process for ordering but he quickly gave me an odd look and said he needed to redo my written order properly...

Finding a clean table (which wasn't an issue at the S. Chandler Chino's) was a journey. Everything was dirty and all the tables looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a long time. 

Once we got our food that was when the true disappointment began. My Emerald Chicken had tendons and gristle in it (not appetizing at all), and my Jade chicken was essentially fried but without any real sauce at all. The Emerald Chicken also had an overwhelming amount of ginger minced in it. The black beans that I used to love were VERY salty and pretty much inedible. The final strike was the amount of rice I got on our combos which was essentially a row of rice on the plate the width of two fingers. My finally bill (insult) for two combos was ~$20.

Overall, will never be returning and will not recommend this Chino's to anyone that still had the great experience of the South Chandler Chino's in their memory.
