-GDfRHphXjccSWhliFHnzg My family has been going to this place for years. It's not a fancy place but it provides consistent solid lunches at affordable prices. The service and food quality is always the same.  Fast, cordial, large portions, freshly made, and true authentic Hong Kong flavours.

We often get Yeung Chow rice, a few noodle dishes, and a big bowl of Juhk (congee). It always comes quickly, fresh, and with good amount of meat and vegetables. The snacks (deep fried bread surrounded by the rice noodle) are tasty and freshly made. I can't complain! Our entire family can be stuffed full for less than $30.
