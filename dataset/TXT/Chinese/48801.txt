C8uW23iYTDSaSSqAGIzd6g Not the best Chinese food you will ever eat but for the price it's pretty good value especially at lunch times when you can get as much as you can eat for about £7 during the week. Try to avoid mid afternoon though as they don't replace the dishes as often and some of the food starts to dry out. The view over the river is excellent but avoid sitting by the glass wall/window in hot sunny days as you'll dry out and heat up quicker than the food. The starters are the best and I prefer to have more of that than the main courses that all have a similar taste to them which may be down to the oil used. Pretty good choice of main dishes with rice or noodles. Puddings are basic with ice cream, cake and mixed fruit salad. If you want a cheap feed though you can go far wrong.
