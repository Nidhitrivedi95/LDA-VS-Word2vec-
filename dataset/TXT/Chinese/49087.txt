CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Way over priced food as expected since it's inside the Bellagio. I thought it would at least be semi decent but everything my group had was very lacking. I got the Penang Kuay Teow with beef and it was a decent portion. The beef was tender but the noodles were not cooked well. Still kind of hard and no char that rice noodles need. Flavorwise it was lacking. All you tasted was spice and grease. My friend got the wonton noodles and hated it and said the same thing about the noodles not being cooked enough. The sesame chicken was decent though. Service wise it was ok and the lines here can get long. I would rather take my $20 and spend it elsewhere
