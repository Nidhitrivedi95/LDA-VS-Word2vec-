r6WO_jkx4rkMMauvPvMDeQ Fast delivery is the only thing good about this place.  Beef and broccoli tasted like shrimp.  The chicken was horrible.  I couldn't even eat the rice that came by itself.  It was so bad that it made me sick the whole night.  I threw out almost $30 in food because I couldn't eat it.
