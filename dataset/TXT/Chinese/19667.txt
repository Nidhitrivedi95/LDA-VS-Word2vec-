5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Fantastic  chinese food in Vegas on the strip located inside the Aria!  You just need to order 1 thing here:  THE DUCK.  The best hands down.  We ordered it twice.  It was expensive for the duck but may be worth it if there's a big group. 

Don't order the cod though.  It was overfried and dry.
