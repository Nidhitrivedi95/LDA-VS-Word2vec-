csOR4N615Qc94jSP0tLftA I really like this place. It has the best noodle bowls around. I love the hong kong noodle bowl (So yummy) and its very affordable. One of our favorite things other than the price and portions is that we can bring our five yearold here to eat. They do a lot to accomodate the kids (Changing TV stations and making custom chop sticks that are kid friendly) We have made this one of our favorite stops for fusion style asian food.
