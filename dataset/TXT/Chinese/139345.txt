qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA Try eating at PF Changs yesterday evening but there was over an hour and 45 minute wait so we left. Came back tonight plenty of seats dinner was good but nothing over the top to write home about the Asian cuisine was comparable to most Asian restaurants. The atmosphere was nice and the wait staff was friendly.
