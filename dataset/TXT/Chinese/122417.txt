oH3V-79Cldz_6sWXi0yuoQ Dropped by here for lunch on a Sunny afternoon.. The restaurant is empty... 

I was given the regular menu and decided to order the Beef Hand Made Noodle ($6.99) and after I ordered the other waiter said they have lunch menu for the same noodle for $4.99..and he suggested the Beef/Lamb pancake with sweet and sour soup which is good value.. I decided to stick with the beef noodle soup.

The dishes served here are really less oily and salty. There is hardly any oil in my clear beefy tasting broth. It is just the perfect saltiness for me and the beef too is not fat, really tender and soft.

The noodles since it is hand made are of different fhickness... I do expect that, however some of them are double the width of the others?? What happen is some of the noodles are more cooked and some more al dente... This is the only thing I am not too happy about.

The deco is really nice and chic too... no sticky floors, no sticky tables.The lunch menu are so reasonably priced! I will definitely be back again to try out other dishes!!
