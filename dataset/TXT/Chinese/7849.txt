15RvAvPxUBl3HmnGMJdtTQ I was in the area and had a craving for sushi so stopped in for lunch. The last time I was here was probably 15 years ago when I worked in Carnegie and would come every few months for lunch specials, which were always good.

I had a dragon roll (primarily eel and avocado) and two orders ikura (four pieces of salmon roe sushi). Both were very good, and I will be picking up takeout from here quite a bit in the future since I am in Greentree fairly often.

For those eating in, service was fast, efficient, and attentive. It was on the early side of lunch time, so not very busy yet.
