yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Got tired of eating along the strip, so we all decided to head off the strip and go for some authentic asian cooking...some comfort food since it was freezing cold out (literally, temps were at freezing point or below).  For a party of six, the bill came out to be just shy of $90 and that's already including the tip!  How can you beat that in Vegas.

We ordered:  (2) Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Ga -Chicken Rice  Noodle - 5.95; (2) Kim Lon Egg Rolls; Pho Tai 5.95; (3) Rare Steak Noodle Soup; Special Combination Tender Beef Noodle Soup - Pho Dac Biet 6.95; 4 Avocado shakes; Soda Chanh Duong - Soda with Fresh Lemon - 2.50.

Service was good and food came in a jiffy.  I'd definitely be returning and the name of the place is hilarious...just say it really fast and you'll get what I'm talking about =)
