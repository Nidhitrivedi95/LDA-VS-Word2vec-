fvnaLCkyIyCw7vQuO8-H3g I came in for dinner on a friday night with my grandparents. The food was good but the service was horrible. It was my grandparents who paid, and they were a bit confused about the tips. When the waitress saw that they left less than 10%. She said that 'in Canada we have 10% tips, its different from China. And that servers survive on the tips.' I know that we are suppose to pay 10% tips, and servers need tips. But that remark was uncessary and very rude. I am not coming back again.
