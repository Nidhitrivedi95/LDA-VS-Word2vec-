qF4A1GW3WNA9bVCvMZSjKw Wanted to try something different at this food court and unfortunately made a bad decision. The prices were cheaper than the other big rival store which convinced me to try, however you get what you pay for! The quality of food served here was terrible. 

Ordered a brisket ho fun noodle soup and honestly it was not edible and had to throw it out. The beef brisket was hard and not ready, not to mention it only came with 3 small pcs.. overall was tasteless. Also ordered a fried rice noodle and it was also tasteless, the ingredients were not fresh for both orders, and sidenote, drinks came in a small foam cup instead of proper take out cups. 

All in all, terrible experience and will not return. I'd much rather pay $1-2 more for quality food and larger portions at the big store.
