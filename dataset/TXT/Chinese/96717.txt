jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg Not much to add here especially after reading Yuhi's comprehensive review. I'm not a big fan of Shabu-Shabu type hot pot restaurants since I can't get over the idea of paying for a DIY restaurant. With the exception of a Korean BBQ, I want to be served when I go out and eat. This place fits the bill because everything is all done for me. I ordered a Beef Hot Pot and my wife ordered the Vegetable Hot Pot. Both were very tasty and exceeded our expectations. I would like to see them add Pork to their menu in the future. We were also told they will have a "Summer Menu" with cold dishes.

Not quite a 5 (but close) since we have experienced one place that has more variety of tastier sauces. Don't forget to grab one of their business cards and get your reward stamps. Buy 10 pots and the 11th is free.
