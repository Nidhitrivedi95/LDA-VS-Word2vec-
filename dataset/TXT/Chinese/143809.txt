rROHsa0BQsKjxNnfYjBF9g This place has terrible customer service over the phone....I called to make an order and told to "hurry up" and order about 4 times. They didn't even say hello when they answered the phone.....I already knew what I wanted before I called and was not taking a long time to order.... they need to start having manners or they will keep losing customers.....I was prob going to spend about 100$
