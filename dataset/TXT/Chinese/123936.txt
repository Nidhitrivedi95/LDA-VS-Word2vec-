OnGPegQGuQ5_uuFLvezvKw it satisfies the craving but delivery is slow. if you want spicy, you gotta ask for extra super spicy, or you will hardly taste it. I got crab rangoon, and they had only mayo in them. I called to inquire, and I asked if there wasn't supposed to be crab in them. she laughed and said "no". guess thats just how they make them but every other place I've had them at has crab and cheese. 
I may still order when I'm too lazy to leave the house and craving chines, but definitely not my first choice.
