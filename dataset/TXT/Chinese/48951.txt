CbsS6VvPsIvpytUbLAu71Q Probably the most Westernized Asian buffet that I've been to in Cleveland.  The dishes are all fairly greasy.  On a Saturday night, there were some items that looked appetizing... and others that looked like they were out for a long time.  I glanced at the sushi section briefly - and didn't try any.  The California rolls looked okay, but I would be hesitant to try anything with raw fish.  Both of the steamed fish entrees offered were overcooked and did not taste the greatest.  The best things I had there were probably the fried items (sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken).   

In summary, below average to average quality food in this buffet.  The one selling point here is the low price - hard to beat $7.99 for dinner at a Chinese buffet on a Saturday evening.
