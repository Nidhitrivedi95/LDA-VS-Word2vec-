IbOrNwCdMTd-eicZ9B2CiA Noisy, loud, old, outdated.   Very sad hotel needing a major overhaul.  Staff is friendly enough though......

Without a doubt, the absolute worst breakfast bar I have ever had.  Cold nasty eggs.  Bacon overcooked, oatmeal is concrete so I couldn't scoop.  Fruit is set out and not ripe.  

Seriously how do you screw breakfast up and charge 20 CAD?
