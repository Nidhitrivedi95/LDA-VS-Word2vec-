QDJBn7I1EdtP9w4nYT24Pw Great Chinese cuisine, not the best.. but very good. The staff is always very friendly, upon entering the establishment you are always greeted by ALL of the front house staff. 
    
I haven't eaten in house.. I always order to go. I usually stop by on my way home from work so I just want to get home, get cleaned up and eat. They are quick to prepare the order ( don't know if this good or bad, either its pre-made and quick heat or they are just that good. Will never know) Usually without a line ahead of me I'm in and out within 10 minutes

Not sure why other people are complaining about this place.. You get what your pay for. Its no 5 star restaurant. With that being said, being in the neighborhood its in its a far better choice than some other places along this stretch of road. 

For about twenty dollars you can feed 3 people. Or a family of four to five under thirty dollars, and not have to worry about getting sick. I'd soon eat here many times over than other places along this stretch of Indian school rd.
