XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw The main entrées were tasty.  We tried a lamb dish, which was very good.  The duck was ok.  Nothing fancy, but just delicious because it's duck.  The dumpling wraps tasted homemade, but the dumpling fillings were just ok.  The taro dessert (which we were told was an entree) was probably the highlight of the meal.  Prices to me were higher than I'd like to pay, and the portions were ok except for the white rice.  They only filled the bowl half way, but charged $2.  For something so cheap I'm not sure why they would be stingy with rice portions.  Service was the typical lack luster for Chinese restaurants with delicious food.  Overall, I will not go back unless I have an undeniable craving to eat authentic Chinese food that's slightly over priced.
