s6L6SdVYhPcOQEDmNIg1-g I ordered some food here for the first time over the weekend to go and was blown away by the amount of food they give you. One order of beef and broccoli was enough for two full servings. Today my brother wanted Chinese food so I told him about this place. This time we dined in. The service was the best I have ever received. I am not sure if our server was the owner but wow. He was amazing. He gave us all free soup and the kids really enjoyed it. I will deff be coming back to this place. We were even allowed to use the coupons on the to go menu. I am so glad I found this place on yelp.
