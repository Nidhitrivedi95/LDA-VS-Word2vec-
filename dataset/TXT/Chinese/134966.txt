qAbXHsddBhmfQFegGiV7Dg Love this place. It was one of those restaurants that I passed for years and never went inside, and when I did I regretted all those years of having not. The prices are fair for what you get and the women working the front are polite. There are lots of options for meals and I usually go with popular choices like teriyaki beef/chicken or orange beef/chicken. I would say to try those if it is your first time. It's also next to a smoke shop I like.
