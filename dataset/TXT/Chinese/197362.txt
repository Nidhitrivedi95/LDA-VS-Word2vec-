zRGCIIez1z4ve5Hppa7eVQ The best chinese food that I've found in the Aurora area.  Doesn't blow your socks off but let me know if you can find a better one.
I find them fairly friendly and very quick to turn around a takeout order.  I have never dined in there...only takeout.
Never had a bad dish so will keep going back!
