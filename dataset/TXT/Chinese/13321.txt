Warning: Don't have too much of the spicy hot pot... it's really spicy and addicting and can cause serious ... damage. 

The food is fresh and delicious. I went during Christmas and random carolers came in and sang wonderful carols. Tip to owner: hire kids to sing carols? 

It's a great place for groups. When you go, they will ask: "small or big pot". Get them to show you the difference -- but essentially, the small pot gives you your own 2 flavour hot pot, whereas the big gives you a two flavour hot pot to share with the person sitting in front of you. My advice: Take whichever table is free. 

Very similar to iCook, but I would say that this place is smaller and doesn't have as many soups to choose from.
