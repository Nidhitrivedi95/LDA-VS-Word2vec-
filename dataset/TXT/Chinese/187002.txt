yeOsE6Hnl_EiLJw2L5NXLA If there were 0 stars I would definitely give that!!!!

Extremely small restaurant that has 2 entrances which is made the place consistently cold because of the doors opening from both sides.

Service is terrible, only the owner serving and doing take out orders.

All tables except for us got a free daily soup as starter and some fruits (oranges) as dessert. I am definitely sure it wasn't any kind of combo because we ask and she said there's no more but tables after us got.

Food is JUST average, any other restaurant can do better. Reason we went to eat because it was the closest to the hospital and we were limited to our choices so we decided to try it out.

Never refilled our tea and when we asked she totally forgot about it then it never got refilled. We realized they forgot one of the dishes we ordered when we were finished our meal, we asked her and she told us kitchen is cooking it already. When she turned around to ask the kitchen, I heard that she was JUST putting in the order so we decide to cancel. Then she gave us the worse service ever! Giving us grumpy and mad faces!

When we asked for the bill, she just gently threw the bill on the table and walked away not caring. 

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE GOING!

If you want Chinese food, there's one 1min walk away from it in the same plaza.
