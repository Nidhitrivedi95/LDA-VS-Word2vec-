Seriously, don't eat sushi here. It isn't gross, but it isn't the best either. Actually, they have pretty decent happy hour prices for sushi, which will suffice when you are hungry. 

Go here to drink. My friends and I gathered at the bar and had a great time. The decor is cute too. I heart most things Asian. 

Tina, one of the bartenders, is great, too! Very friendly, plus she makes a mean plum vodka/plum sake drink. 

Cheers!
