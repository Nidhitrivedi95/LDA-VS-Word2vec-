YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g For the price the food misses the mark more often then it should. The lobster dumpling really lacks flavor and texturally the lobster itself is subpar. A standard har gow from most of the dimsum places nearby taste much better. The worst dish I had here was the vermicelli with crab. The price for the dish was very steep and there was no flavor at all to the dish. There were a few lumps of crab scattered throughout but the dish was bland. If you took the crab out no one would notice and then it would be a 3$ dish. 

The white fish and softshell crab dish is a neat idea and plates beautifully but eats rather poorly. The crab stuffed with fish already has a fried texture and so the accompaniments of an entire plate of fried things (egg, garlic, etc) adds flavour but just doesn't eat well.

It seems with Susur's restaurants you really can have a good meal IF you order the right dishes. Though for the price I don't think I'll experiment a 3rd time. Most everything I've had here is definitely sub-par and I'm embarrassed to say I took a friend here on her birthday . 

The dimsum sauces brought to the table though interesting are unimpressive. The shrimp cheung fun and cocktails are the only highlights. I do believe Susur is a great chef with tremendous knowledge ( displayed in how well the meat is usually cooked ) but he really does need to start trying again because this just makes me sad.
