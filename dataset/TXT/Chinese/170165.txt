VVUL1lzBOipXJlOG1wURMg People in Markham/Scarborough sure love their Hakka food. It's this spicy asian cuisine which seems to be sort of addictive. Deep fried, stir fried whatever you have it. 
I have been going here since it first opened back when I was in elementary school. It's so good!  Service can be good. 

Tangerine was a staple from back in the day at this location in Markham. I've tried way too many dishes to count, but they've been a variety of the seafood, chicken , rice and noodle dishes. All adjustable according to your spice levels. It's a nice casual atmosphere with decent decor. Enough to have a small party or dinner with a group of family/friends.

Good soups too for when you're feeling sick!

Decent prices for dinner and good lunch deals!
