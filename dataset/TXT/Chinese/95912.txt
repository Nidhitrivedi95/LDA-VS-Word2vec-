jKduhy-gJ9hyFzd1au6pOg I've been to this location before and I've never had problems until today. I actually never noticed they had a drive thru. I go in and an employee is very upset apparently he has been working an hour over his regular shift and is complaining about it. Manager sends him home and she takes over. This is were it gets crazy. I have five orders to place and they run out of the broccoli and beef also the mushroom chicken. Staff is going crazy because they are short on food and their drive thru window is packed. We had to wait maybe 18 extra minutes which I didn't care. Also their soda machine was down. We head home and the fried rice and brown rice was undercooked. In my opinion they need to get rid of the drive thru and employees need better communication skills.
