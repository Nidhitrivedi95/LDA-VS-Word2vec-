LV9Stq-s3H4dqaTE1Z7rwA I think Flo's deserves a 5 Star Rating! I have been frequenting this place for over 5 years now and they have maintained a consistentcy in both menu options, flavor of food and price! I cannot stand going back to a restaurant where they have changed their cook and the favorite dish is no longer on the menu, or it taste totally different (and usually in the 'not so good' category) than what I remembered, and on top of it, the prices have gone up $2 or $3 dollars!!!! Good Lawd!  . . . 

Flo's Asian Kitchen has been good to me! One thing I would like to add also, is that in the 5 years that I have been going to the Promenade location, I have seen veteran staff members! Which means that Flo's must be a great working environment as well! The service has always been great! 

I recommend the Chow Fun w/chicken & shrimp, or the spicy chow mein noodles. The lettuce wraps are a great choice if you are trying to cut down on the carbs! The menu is Asian diversity perfect!
