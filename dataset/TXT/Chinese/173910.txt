wakI-46P1BLMnf4zdH3V2g Obviously this restuarant has gone thru an ownership change. Loved this restaurant for years and ordered about once a month. Recently had a charge show up for 1.40 for a delivery. Called and asked as I was a block away that I normally would tip driver. They indicated that I should I adjust my tip. I indicated that  that the delivery charge was insufficient for the driver and bordered on slavery. When driver came to door I said I would not tip and driver should check with owner. Owner called me and  told me that they would not deliver anymore.   CHECK THIS OUT AM I AM IDIOT???????
