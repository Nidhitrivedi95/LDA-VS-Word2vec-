1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA If you are looking to get some cheap Chinese food...it doesn't get cheaper than BIG WONG. It's a good place to eat if you are having a bad day at the casinos haha. This place is legit. We got the spicy shrimp wonton noodle soups and the curry fish balls. The food was delicious and the portion sizes were big. I was sad I didn't find out about this place until the last day when we about to leave Vegas. The place was pretty clean and the service was good. I highly recommend this place!
