_fTBHNW58xuw0MMbgZTz9w I have not had the chance to try anything other then their soup. However,  the soup hear is addicting.  At least their spicy beef nuddle soup is. I always get my soup to go and find they give you a lot of it. Sadly, the portions you get, really are over priced at it nearly $9.00 tub-to-go. That's one reason for the rating I have chosen to give it. 

Now the people are friendly here, the place is clean and food does not take that long. At least thw soup does not. Your on you own guessing how long it will take to get othet foods.

So far I lije this place and will return.
