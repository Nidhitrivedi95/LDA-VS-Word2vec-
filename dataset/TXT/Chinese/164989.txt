uxSL4FHWiO-fr2iae_d3Bw TOO PRICEY.   WHATS THE POINT?
$52 for 2 for lunch.  No liquor.  What's up with that?
Why would anyone go here?  Oh yeah.  So that you can say you dined at PF Changs?  Get over it and save your money.  Sure the food was edible but so is food at Panda Express.  Not impressed.  Too much money and not even a buzz.  Booo!!!
