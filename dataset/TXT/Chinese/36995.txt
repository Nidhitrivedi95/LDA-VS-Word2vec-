AMM3qOH9DUQzJHm9Q3vHag I could regale you with a list of every dish available but it is a buffet so you know what to expect before you walk in. 
It specializes in Asian cuisine so the majority of dishes have a distinctly oriental flavor.
They do have some non-Asian dishes including mashed potatoes, pizza, French fries and barbecued chicken. They also have some steak pieces and spicy ribs as well.
If you are hungry for sushi you will be able to fill yourself up with standard sushi fare. They also have seaweed salad and edamame.
The meal is less than $10 for dinner unless you want to add a soft drink which is $2 more.
The most common entree is chicken which is prepared in at least twelve different ways.
They have some interesting desserts as well as ice cream so you will not leave here hungry.
There is seating for lots of people as well as an additional room that will seat a whole bunch more.
This is not a place to take your sweetheart on a first date. Also not a place to impress the boss. Great for large groups if you are paying for everyone. Great for hungry people and people who enjoy stuffing themselves to the gills and then feeling bad because they couldn't control their greed.
Red Wok will not appeal to everyone and once in a while it may not agree with you, but it is great value for money.
