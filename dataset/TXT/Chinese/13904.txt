3_0yDfLPIc5_TzaDbST3_g I am here with my parents who only like Chinese food, we have been looking for Chinese food in Highland, Scotland, and this is the best among 3 restaurants attended. The food was good and authentic, service was good. The most impressive thing was we arrived when they were closing up, and they let us in and welcomed us! Thank you for helping me out, I would know what to do with my dad if you didn't let me in!
