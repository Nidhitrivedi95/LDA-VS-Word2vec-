6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag Mom came into town and this was right around the corner, so I suggested we try it as we were both starving. My mom doesn't make it out to Vegas to visit very often, but she already has plans to bring her husband and friends next time she comes to take them to China Mama.
The food was delicious. We started with chilled cucumbers which were soaked in garlic at the suggestion of our server because I told her how hungry we were and she said she could get them out fast. We continued to eat chicken chow mein on hand pulled noodles, honey walnut shrimp, gyoza, and steamed juicy pork buns. Everything was perfect.
The server Misty was extremely helpful and patient with both of us hungry customers. She made suggestions and the entire experience a lot more pleasant for us. I am definitely going back.
