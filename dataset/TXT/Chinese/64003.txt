e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg Let me be the first person to write an honest review. I'm sure everyone has high hopes for this restaurant in particular, as the first winner of MasterChef Canada and a Michelin star restaurant owner are the faces of this new place. The decor is great and the service was excellent. The food however... I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone I know. 

I am asian and all my guests were as well. We were looking forward to all the dishes we ordered. The presentation of every dish was nicely done but I wish I could say the same for the flavour... Of all of them. The beef tongue tasted like dry ham, the lobster chow mein was boring and the beef tartare was mediocre. My yolk was over cooked. 

The mains were the most disappointing. The steak bernaise was good. Not the best I've ever had but it was the only thing we actually liked. The fried chicken was just fried chicken. The duck was so upsetting. Lee's Peking duck is a much better approach. The bao was a good idea to be different. The last time I've had bao instead of flour wraps was in houston but even then, houston was much better. The skin was not crispy and if they say they are "trying something new" they FAILED. The duck was cut as thick as the steak was. For $68 you could walk up a block in Chinatown and get the real deal for more than half the price AND it comes with the lettuce wraps. I normally like fusion asian food if it's done right but this restaurant failed. We didn't even order dessert because we were so let down. The bill was $310 for 4 people and in the heart of chinatown I could've went to Xam Yu or Sangs and fed 3 families easily with much more flavor.
