LnYkQ2Hjm-klqYJVgZ1cEQ Great restaurant hidden in the 5th St. Arcade. I didn't realize it has been downtown for 10 years now. But, that sounds about right. 
No matter what I get from their menu, it is constantly good, & I have tried pretty much everything outside the sushi. 
Today, I tried something new - their shrimp & broccoli. They had to make it fresh since it wasn't on their regular daily set-up. But, it was quick & right. (I requested no carrots.)
Highly recommend to anyone who wants a quick bite downtown at lunchtime.
