UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ If Yelp had a option of giving no stars I would for this place. My boss and I came here to give this place a try. And we shouldn't have gone in.

We were greeted when we came in and we ordered our food and things just went wrong from there. 

The "Thai" basil with ground chicken was so sweet to the point where I could feel my stomach disagreeing with me. Then came the string beans, also too sweet. And both dishes were covered with onions. It seemed like that was the only other vegetable they had.

And when it came down to the cold noodle salad, yam woosen, which I have had many times before, it was a complete disappointment. Once again sweet, and the meat in the dish seemed old.

I should have stuck with the Chinese food, when ordering here but, I won't be back. I do not recommend this place. Waste of money.
