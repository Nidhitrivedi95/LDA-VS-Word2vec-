JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA Horrible. Wasn't greeted or acknowledged for the longest time till we decided to speak up and tell them we're ready. One of the worst Chinese restaurant experiences and I've been eating out in NYC and San Diego. Save your money and don't come here! They moved to a new location so they can do the big tour group business. We went there at 10:30am and was restricted to maybe 5 things on the menu. All their woks and cooking utensils were all being used for them to cook up food for the bus tours. Ridiculous. If we wanted anything outside of the maybe 5 items available it would be a 20 minute wait! Just shitty! We left without paying an extra dime cause thee people sure didn't deserve it! Ten people hustling and bustling and no one gave us an ounce of attention! Shitty Vegas service!! Not exactly cheap either! We ordered one sweet soybean drink and one salty one and two meat with veggie bun and it came out to $11! Total ripoff!
