eh9e2wfsXNRa4BgVSXUu7g It's definitely a Hong Kong style Bakery & Cafe...  You'll get that unpleasant vision if you're not used to the somewhat uncleaned walls/surroundings.  I grew up in this environment literally so doesn't bother me and the other HK regulars as you go to this self-serve style Cafe.

The Bakery side looks pretty fresh as there's constant patrons coming in and out for both the Bakery and the Cafe.  I observed that the Pastry/Baked Buns were still coming out this early afternoon and looking pretty enticing.  You can even do your own Plastic SEALING of your items after you put into the bag as they have the Sealer right next to the register while the ladies are busy making Milk Teas.

The Cafe is also self-serve as you try to get a Menu somewhere and go to the counter to make the order, although the Prepared Food does get served to your table but it's still not considered waitservice.  Around 25 Daily Special items on the Menu, all are under $5.00 makes this a pure HK Cafe you leave with a Fiver easily.  Don't even need to tip as you pay first at the register, rather than after your meal.

Preserved Vegetable & Pork w/Rice Vermicelli($3.50) is a small bowl but it was filled to the top that would satisfy the normal person.  It comes with your choice of Hot Coffee or Milk Tea.  I didn't like the Milk Tea at all...  Maybe change it to Lemon Tea or Honey Lemon(Add $0.20) next time.
