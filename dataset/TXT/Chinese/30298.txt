98NaJ8FWzPuoymHfj6IIeA Came to Ming's Café wanting something quick and cheap. I ordered the plain wonton soup, and my friend ordered the peanut butter French toast. The wonton soup was very mediocre; you can tell that the ingredients used weren't fresh. There were very little shrimps in the wontons, and all the wontons were very salty. But again, what did I expect from a "quick and cheap" café. The peanut butter French toast that my friend ordered was okay, the toast was friend and it was drenched in kind of oily liquid. Overall, nothing special, and I should mention that there are better HK style cafes that offer better food for the same price point.
