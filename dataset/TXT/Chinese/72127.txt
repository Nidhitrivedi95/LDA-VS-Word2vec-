FexomhlA5G7ipOEH3pqFkA First of all if you consider this to be Asian food you don't know what Asian food is... It is clearly an extremely Americanized Chinese restaurant with things like "Buddha rolls" on the menu and several versions of General Tao chicken / kung Pao chicken. 

That being said the interior is splendid and it is above average Americanized Chinese food that I do not mind having once in a while. I had the crispy chicken, yes it did cost more than 5$ but it was much better then the filth you will get at the food court. 

Will I go back? Probably it was a good experience and I liked the food but I don't kind myself that I am having exotic Asia cuisine and it is a big chain in the USA
