bbr4F3c0KHU8ugn8YgEtKA The sad demise of a wonderful restaurant. Today we went to Green Bamboo for lunch. It's been a year since we went there last. We were a regular at this place. The place is no longer what it used to be. It is not Vietnamese cuisine anymore, it is just plain Chinese Casserole Rice. The casseroles that we ordered were Pork Belly and Duck. The appetizers crispy quail and tempura shrimp were nice. The casseroles were bland and the accompanying stew which we paid a $2 add on fee was like mushroom and beef water. 

The owner is still the same wonderful and bubbly lady. I'm unsure about her decision and the circumstances under which she made this decision. I wish her luck, but I feel badly that we now miss out on the old Green Bamboo, which was awesome.
