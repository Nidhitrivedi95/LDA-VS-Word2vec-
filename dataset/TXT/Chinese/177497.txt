wYrkCpUlxhb89nnNGUX4AA Food here is so good! We ordered the corn, shumai, brussel sprouts, tofu, Thai chicken wings, crab fried rice, and a few skewers (eggplant, asparagus with bacon, pork sausage, and chicken thighs.) Everything was delicious and service was great. My top two were the brussel sprouts and tofu, my husband liked the wings and the shumai. Would definitely return!
