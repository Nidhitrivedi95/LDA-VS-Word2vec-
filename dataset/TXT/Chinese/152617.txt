T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw The one star is for our server Joshua but Erin the female manager is a scammer and a thief.  She scammed us into ordering paid items that would have prompted free meals. After the server brought part of it out, she reneged on the deal and expected us to pay for the items that were brought out. When I can cancelled the order she then stole my points off my card as if I received the free meal. This is the short version of what happened but the basics. I believe she just didn't want my kind to get the free meals and it was apparent by her choice of words and temperament. Her tone was also loud enough to try to embarrass us in front of the other diners to make it seem as though it's just typical of us. Her skills are limited to a failing fast food chain.
