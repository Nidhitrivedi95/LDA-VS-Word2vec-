I wanted to order soda but they said they don't carry soda/juice. Some people doesn't like to drink boba tea with their meal. They like to drink it as a dessert or just a snack. 

Second, I am a bit disappointed that they only have large servings for dumplings. They should at least offer smaller servings so that people who doesn't have that much big of an appetite can try other dumplings too. I would rather get 4 pcs of 5 different dumplings than 1 order of a 14 pc dumpling. 

The atmosphere is great, very nice servers, and clean environment. I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars only because they just opened a few week ago and they're still trying out the waters otherwise, I would have given them 2 stars. I think they can use a lot of improvements with their menu.
