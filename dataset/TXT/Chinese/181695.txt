xEIqG7Rq8ydAT9LxCVBOOg I've been to 3 different Red Bowl's and I've decided this is my go-to place for a quick, consistent Asian dish.  Each location seems to do a great job with creating specials like Bento boxes for $11, 3 piece rolls for $3, and half price sushi after 8pm.  I like a good sushi deal and that fits the bill for me.  Service is hit and miss depending on the location but this one in particular seemed to be just fine even though they seemed a bit understaffed.  I've noticed that places that require their waiters or waitresses to bus their own tables seem to have slower service.  Hmmm.....

In short, Red Bowl is a solid option for a quick bite when you are trying to avoid drive through fast food, etc.
