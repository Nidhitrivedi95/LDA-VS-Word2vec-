XqPMOwrJ0xjphyNQYcoPLg Amazing restaurant: family owned (always the same people working), delicious, fast service and extremely cheap!

This is one of those hole-in-the-wall gems in Toronto that you must try especially if you're vegetarian and loves Chinese food. They have a variety of dishes ranging from hot and sour soup to curry marinated "chicken" to mock "duck". I would highly recommend getting the chicken in iron plate. It's one of the most flavourful mock meat I've ever had!

Not to mention their portion is huge!! They also have some mock meat in a freezer that you could buy to take home as well.
