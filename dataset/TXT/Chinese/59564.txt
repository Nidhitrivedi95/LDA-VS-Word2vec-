Dk_fUGiqg2L2cWsDL8klZw Dragon Way seems surprisingly little known given its location and long establishment. It shouldn't be! Perhaps this is because it is overshadowed by the ever popular music venue Henry's Cellar Bar below it.

I've been to Rainbow Arch several times now and each time it seems to get better and better. It's a dim sum specialist so while there... try some dim sum! You'll find some more creative and unusual varities. The alternative menu is decent too.

The general aesthetic of place isn't incredible but not terrible either. It had a sort of old-school Chinese restaurant feel. Sometimes the tablecloth and menus don't seem that new either.

I've heard that the staff are not always the most friendly but every time I've been in I've always found them to be helpful and perfectly amiable.

Also keep in mind that Raindbow Arch closes late, around 3am, making it one of the few decent late night restaraunts in Edinburgh.

A really great dim sum restaurant in the heart of Edinburgh,
