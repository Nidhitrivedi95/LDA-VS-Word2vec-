HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA The food here is amazing there selection is not big, but what they do have to offer is great. I had the chicken bowl it was so yummy and their fat choy burger yum! I wish they had a location in L.A. I would probably sleep there and eat everything lol! The restaurant is inside the Eureka casino it would be great if they had a door to block the smell of the smoke cause smelling smoke when you're eating is gross. Can't wait to go back.. block the smoke smell please !
