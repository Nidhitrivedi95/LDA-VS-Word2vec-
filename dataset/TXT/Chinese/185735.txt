Y1WIH4jstH846oWcDnoZLw I come here quite often as it's the only Chinese place near my house. The food is really good. I enjoy the food and the soups. The lunch menu is pretty affordable, and you get a lot of food for the amount you pay. I do think the dinner prices and other items are too expensive,as you pretty much get the same amount of food as the lunch but they charge a lot more.
