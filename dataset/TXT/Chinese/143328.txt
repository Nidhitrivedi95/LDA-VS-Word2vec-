rntKF4Dm9JIJoSNi5XqRsQ Thanks to all the amazing Yelp reviews, I went and tried this place out. Went there for an early lunch on a Sunday and was promptly seated. Service was fast and friendly. We ordered the soup dumplings, spicy wontons, and pork and leek dumplings. All were very tasty, although they put peanut butter in their spicy wontons which I wasn't a great fan of, but still good.  I do prefer the soup dumplings at Ding Tai Fung better, but overall Northern Dumpling Kitchen is amazing value and quality. We will be returning customers. Definitely go!
