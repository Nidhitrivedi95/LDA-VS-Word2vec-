First off we sat ourselves....then waited for a long time to be waited on even though there was only one other family in the place. The dishware was stained, cracked and so worn and used that the enamel was wearing thin. The tea pot the brought was cracked and the water so hot the handle nearly burnt my hand.  Now...onto the food....bland doesn't even describe it properly. My husband ordered shrimp with rice....the shrimp were boiled and thrown into bland yellow rice with shriveled peas. The mixed vegetable dish I had had lumps of cornstarch that hadn't cooked properly. Half my daughter's noodles were raw and crunchy in her dish. My other daughter lucked out with the fried turnip dish which was actually passable. We had to ask for the bill and not once were we asked if we needed any thing else. Boo. Terrible place. Stay away.
