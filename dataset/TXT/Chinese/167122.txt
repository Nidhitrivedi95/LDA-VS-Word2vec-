So a good friend recommended this place and instead of going to the same ol' Jade that has eye candy male servers for women and no room at the bar for a solo guy, I opted to come here.  Boy did I make the right move. 

I walked in and instantly got greeted by a few staff.  The place was 40% full at 8:30 on Saturday.  Of course I was a little hesitant to continue my experience but thought let me just try some place new and see what my friend keeps raving about.  

I sat at the bar and instead of the conventional pencil and paper to pick my sushi, they gave me an actual 5 page menu.  They offer more then sushi, they actually have a different area for hibachi.   I ordered the seaweed salad, super spicy tuna, and the whitetail sushimi.   I hate seaweed but my girlfriend always tells me to eat it since it's so healthy for you.   Let me tell you the portion was perfect, and the taste....  Awesome!   Not fishy, it was actually a great taste. 

The whitetail blew me away.  A nice big piece that was a little hard to handle with my chopsticks, but the taste was mind blowing!   Is this what real sushi taste like?   Have we been dubbed by too much aioli sauce and American Mayo flavor at these other sushi restaurants?   The super tuna roll was awesome great.  I wasn't expected fried panco bread crumbs on top but I'll exclude it next time.  

The verdict; my go-to sushi place in Ballantyne and South Charlotte.  The ambience is great to take my girlfriend, the staff were super friendly, and the food was perfect.   The only thing that stands out is that I asked for a kettle one and water and she skipped the water.  Hey, these guys are not bartenders, they are incredible Sushi makers.   I'll order Saki next time.  

Thanks guys, you  gained a new regular client.
