The food was excellent. Ordered a Black Pepper Beef and it tasted awesome even with the steamed rice. The House Special Fried Rice and the Singapore Noodles was really good on the tastebuds. The food came fresh, warm and in less than 20 minutes.

The lady serving was very friendly, offered suggestions and had a very good service mindset.
