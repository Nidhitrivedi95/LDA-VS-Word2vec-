q-3Q3t3RS4qiW51fDIEvyQ I gave this place 2 stars only because the food is good for the most part. BUT, it is never hot or even lukewarm which makes me scared to eat it. The owner is super rude. Never greets you, just acts angry at you for coming. He acts like we are trying to rip him off. Because of him and the dangerously cool food, I won't be back. Also, just can't give money to a rude owner, he shouldn't be in business
