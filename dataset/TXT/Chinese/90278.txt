ieMz5kx4JFm0g0bmPzCC-A I picked up a carry out order last night as my first visit to this restaurant. The meal was a  combo menu item of Szechuan shrimp and chicken. I got home and discovered that the meal must have been taken from a steam-table like in a buffet. The food was tired looking, the vegetables over cooked and mostly colorless. The shrimp were over cooked and gray in color. There was a runny liquid which was supposed to be the sauce. The chicken was breaded. The breading was greasy. The spring roll or whatever it was, was way over cooked and greasy. There are lots of Chinese restaurants, I would look elsewhere the next time I get the urge.
