2FWFAqM-jqKUU8WqHSp-LQ I tried Asian One right after they opened and found their Kung Pao chicken to be rather disgusting. Reading the review of the hibachi steak, I figured I'd give it one more go for lunch.

I ordered hibachi chicken for carryout, and waited and watched while they prepared it and seemed to prepare a bunch of other items too, which must have been for other carryout orders since the other 5 people dining in were eating.

Asian One has a completely open kitchen, which I sure hope doesn't bite them someday. I had a few concerns while watching them. Most notably someone grabbed a raw chicken breast from a bucket to put in the skillet, and then without washing their hands grabbed some raw vegetables and the tongs to cook with the chicken. No clue if this is a major hazard or not, but it's probably something I'd do at home and I figured everything going into that skillet was cooked within an inch of its life. Still, I'd think they might treat raw chicken like the nuclear biohazardous waste Food TV seems to think it is, in a totally open kitchen. (In all fairness, I'm sure none of us wants to see what happens in the CLOSED kitchens.)

Brought the food home, and meh - it was okay. It was Tintin-like (the Uptown restaurant, for those who don't know it) in quality and taste, even including the weird creamy sauce I have gotten before at Tintin. I hate that mushrooms are pre-chopped to very small pieces in the vegetable mix so it's impossible to remove them. It was a $10 lunch, which is on the high side for what you get.

Asian One is okay, but it's just not to my liking. My husband wants to try it so I'm sure we'll be back at some point, but really only for him.
