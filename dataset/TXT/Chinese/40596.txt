B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA Pretty good spot but not everything on the menu is good. I haven't tried everything but based on what I have tried, here's what I do/don't recommend:

Get: beef & broccoli, orange chicken, general chicken, chicken wings, ma po tofu

Don't get: sesame chicken, eggplant tofu, dumplings
