gDQlaDRAjsCx2p_p6oJLjw This is the first and most definitely the last time we are ordering from this place. We ordered from grubhub so we thought that our order would be pretty clear. We both got the general tso's combo meal that was supposed to come with your choice of rice and soup. After an exceedingly long amount of time (close to an hour and a half) we got our food and low and behold they got our order wrong! No soup. Just subpar, overly-greasy egg rolls with one measly piece of shrimp! Where the heck is my wonton soup?! Awfully ticked....
