ky5L-EfUwU9chSPcIeXM5w I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews here. ): lol

I've never eaten in the store so I can only speak on delivery.

I always have consistently good food! Buut I'm also a person of habit. I get the same things everytime I'm here: general's chicken, combination fried rice, crab rangoons, hot and sour soup and thai tea boba. 

Food always gets to me in a timely manner within 20-30min. I like china a go go, it's convenient and I never run into any rude or unfriendly employees. (:
