vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I've eaten here a few times. First time I went it was horrible. We ended up walking out. But I gave it another try. The food is really good and the prices are very reasonable. Dim sum here is as good as it gets in Vegas. One of the few Chinese restaurants I'll go to in Vegas.
