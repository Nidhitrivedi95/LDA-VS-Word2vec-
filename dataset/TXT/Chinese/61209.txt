dqeUvrlMxTAk0VL2n1ukaw We tried Asian Star for the first time the other day... pickup!  For most part I was delighted!  Very nice on the phone; quick delivery; tasty food; ample portions!  I loved the egg drop soup and the chicken lo mein; I was a bit disappointed with the sweet & sour chicken though... just a matter of preference though (I like the batter to have some crunch, and I felt more veggies would have been nice)!  I will definitely order from them again though, and I definitely recommend them!!!  God Bless!
