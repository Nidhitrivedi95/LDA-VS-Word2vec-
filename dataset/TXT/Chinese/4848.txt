_xt4ZyvtgY8Xu_O6SpSB5A My friends, I am a regular at this joint. This is the safe bet, the "I'm hungry, what do you want? I don't know, let's go here" place, the "I've been on vacation for a while, I'm craving something" place,... okay I'll stop.

Anyways, this place is just fantastic for the value, the deliciousness, the friendliness and the convenience. 

Pros:
- service is always good: multilingual (Tagalog, Cantonese/Mandarin, English); the waitresses are always very friendly, polite and fast
- food is always GOOD - it's not mind-blowing mind you, but it's such a consistent "hit", that it's GOOD. 
- prices: cheap and very reasonable for what you get

Cons: 
- decor: they recently renovated this place, and it's cute because they're Chinese and Chinese restaurants are never known for their fantastic interior decoration. This is true for Chi's as well, even post-renovation. Things are a bit eclectic and out of place, but A for effort!
- it gets busy! But customer turn-over is fast, so you won't have to wait long for seats; and if you're comfortable with it, you can always "dap toy" meaning that you join strangers at a larger table

Overall, my favourite Chinese noodle/rice restaurant in Mississauga!
