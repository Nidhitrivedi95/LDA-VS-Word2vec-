RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw The best congee place I've tried. We come here with large groups because of the shareable dishes and you want a bit of everything here. The seafood congee, Peking duck, spicy fried calamari, Chinese broccoli are all must haves. Expect to wait a bit to be seated because it does get very busy. Also, the service isn't the best. However, your food comes quickly and the food itself plus the prices are unbeatable.
