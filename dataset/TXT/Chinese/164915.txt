uxSL4FHWiO-fr2iae_d3Bw 3.5 stars.  I do like PF Changs, it's just that it is a chain restaurant and usually you don't get unforgettable with that.  I love the atmosphere and decor and we always get good service. 

We ordered as a group and just passed the plates around to share.  Appetizers: crab wontons, lettuce wraps, ribs.  Out of all of these I say lettuce wraps all the way!  Main Entrees:  honey chicken, sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, Pepper beef, beef and broccoli, honey crisply shrimp, noodles, fried rice.   I would say all were yummy but I didn't care much for the sesame chicken.  They honey crispy shrimp was wonderful. 

Overall we will always go to PF Changs since the family likes it.  It's good chain food type of Chinese.
