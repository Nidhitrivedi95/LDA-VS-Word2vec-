My wife and I ordered about two months ago and weren't really impressed.  It was quite so so.  We ordered from them a week ago for pick up and it was horrible.  Wife ordered the chicken and broccoli.   Her meal actually looked good but the taste was very bland.  I ordered the pineapple chicken. My meal was simply horrible.  My ENTIRE carry out container was full of sauce and there might have been six small pcs of chicken in there.  Thankfully I got to scrounge my wife's leftovers.  We will not be going back to this place.  Also, pay with credit card so they pay their taxes.
