TvHC_I01Ilvd5_fFi4sqIg Very very delicious buns and cakes here! My family and I have been visiting this bakery over 10 years now and we keep coming back for more! 

They take custom orders for cakes with little to no extra charge! My family's favourite is the mango cake with chestnut filling. They usually only do either mango or chestnut, but they will do mangle and chestnut if requested for only a few bucks more! The sponge itself is not too sweet and very soft (not too firm). 

Also, I recommend buying their gift certificates if you plan on going often. The more you buy, the greater the discount (up to 50% off!). However, these certificates cannot be combined with their 40% off after 5 sale. 

I highly recommend visiting this bakery if you have never before!
