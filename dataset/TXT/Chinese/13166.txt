2UaMR7lOJ3IcXizaDpv7KA Been going here for over 12 years.  Been getting hit and miss food for the last few years.  Tonight though was the worst.  Ordered Tom Ka Gai, Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and a tall beer to share with my son.  We both love Thai food and were hungry.  When the waitress brought the Tom Ka Gai, I noticed it only had coconut base, chicken, and mushrooms.  We we tasted it, it was awful, seriously awful flavorless swill.  I asked the waitress where the golanga root, chilies, etc where and she replied that this is how they always do it.  Um, sorry but after eating here, I know that it is most certainly NOT how they do it, or at least USED to do it.  She took it back to the kitchen and returned with a portion of equally awful soup less the two bowls we had dumped out from the first round,  Seriously?  I told her it was still bad and to cancel the other food that we would pay for the beer.  The chef was yelling in the kitchen about our cancellation, but I will not pay for inedible food and the was really bad.  So, tonight was the last straw.  I will not be back.  I am sad since it used to be pretty darn good.
