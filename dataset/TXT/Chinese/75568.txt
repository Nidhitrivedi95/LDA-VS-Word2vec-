fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA This is the best dimsum restaurant in Ontario, in particular for xiao long bao.

I have been to the upscale tokyo location of Nanxiang Mantou Dian (the restaurant which is infamous for the creation of the xialongboa dumpling). I have eaten the chef's special selection including sharks fin, abalone, truffle, crab ovaries etc. The most luxurious of xialongbao dumplings.. and I can say that the xialongbao in Ding Tai Fung are comparable in terms of taste. The ingredients are different, but the taste is of equal quality.

They are like little explosions of meaty goodness going off in your mouth. Go eat them now, you won't be disappointed.
