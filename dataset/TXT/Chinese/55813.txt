cxVp-a28Cp7lavjaPMvK5w I have been to Social House twice but the first time I only had beer so I figured i'd wait for food to happen before I judged. I have a lot of positives and a few critiques about the dinner I had there last night. I went with 3 other girls. The staff was super friendly and our waitress was really helpful and nice! She told us that they specialize in small plates. So, to say that we ordered an insane amount of food would be an understatement. I believe we ordered about 5 apps and 3 entrees to share. All of the food was fantastic!! Some of the highlights would be the chee chee brussel sprouts and the scallop pad thai. The aloha poke roll was also a big hit with everyone. I really have zero complaints about any of the food or the staff. 

Now onto a few issues. While our waitress was great, i wasn't expecting some of the portions of the food to be so large because of being told it was small plates. Not generally an issue, unless you have no ability to take leftovers home and have to waste delicious, precious food!  That criticism is minor and really, who cares if the food is good? The one issue I had with the meal  what the timing. Yes, i want my food out hot, fresh and fast. But, everything came out practically at once and it made the meal pretty hectic. With this crowd... the older we get, the more anxious we get and i was pretty shocked no one needed a paper bag. I'll definitely be returning to Social House and now I am equipped with the knowledge to make the meal worth 5 stars!
