R-9gUTN8BJIDqGgzXEmq3Q I love eating here and have for many years.  They are receptive to leaving items out of a dish and are quite friendly.  A definite favorite place.  I frequently order Singapore Noodles, Subgum Lo Mein, and Cold Sesame Noodle.  YUM!  Best in town!  
One reviewer compares it to Chiang Jiang's crap, LOL.
