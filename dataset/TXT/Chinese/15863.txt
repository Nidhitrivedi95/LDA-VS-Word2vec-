3snG6gdJH_IQzU1ryHL0Sw Went here because we needed to be able to park in a disabled spot. Huge car park with perfect entrance for disabled people.

The staff were very very nice.

The buffet was the best Chinese buffet that I've ever had. It was such a wide choice and desert was good I loved their ice cream machine!

Great atmosphere and would defiantly go again!
