a5--WEPUdH7smreNuqj4aQ This place must be kidding...

The hubby & I decided to try it out after coming across their add in the paper that boasted about they're "Hundreds of Items"...not! We got there and the place didn't even smell right. It looked like an old run down Hometown Buffet. Against my better judgment, I went to get a plate. There were tons of empty trays and theyre food looked very questionable. The chicken-on-a-stick looked "off", kinda stringy looking if that makes sense. The employees looked as if they were working against their will...weird. Not to mention they collect all the used dishes etc in an old cracked storage tote on a rolling cart.  When my hubby came back to the table with his food we looked at eachother for a moment and agreed we couldnt even take a bite. We both decided to take a trip to the restroom before we left, big mistake. It smelled like a porta-potty before we even walked down the hallway...and don't get me started on the actual bathroom. We ended up leaving without even touching our food or drink and wouldnt go back if they paid me. Contemplated contacting the health department, yes, it was that bad.
