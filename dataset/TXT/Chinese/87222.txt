hsgRNkXFMCqzO7nPRB3yJQ A very small HK style cafe located in a plaza that looks quite dingy.

Come before 11:30 am and you can get the breakfast prices! My mom and I came for breakfast and for 5.99 i got a scramble egg sandwich, a satay beef vermicelli noodle soup and hk milk tea. They have a lot of morning specials and for that price you can't go wrong!

Service is quick and efficient (once you order the food will come in 10 minutes). Staff is also very friendly (a bunch of middle age asian ladies who seem to enjoy what they're doing). It can get busy as you get closer to lunch time because they also have set lunch menus as well. Also been here for afternoon tea. Prices are a little big higher than breakfast but items are almost (if not the same) as the breakfast menu. HK style toast here was also very good and for 3.99 you get that plus a hk milk tea. 

A hidden gem and a local favourite if you're craving for some HK style cafe and not want to go  far up markham for the chain HK style cafes.
