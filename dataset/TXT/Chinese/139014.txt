qSzICKCd041EdjjGNgMYrQ Newly opened Crown Jewel Fine Dining has replaced the former Sam Woo Seafood.  A dim sum and Chinese food restaurant,   There is still some renovation work required on the premises, but they are open for business now.  Tried their dim sum which was competent...we liked that every dish came out very hot.  They have early bird pricing before 11 am.  A nice successor to Sam Woo Seafood which was one of our previous favorites in the area.  We will return to sample more of their dishes.
