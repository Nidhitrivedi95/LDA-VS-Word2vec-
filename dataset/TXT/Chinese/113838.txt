mRubgo8WfjraJkE5Bvbf6w My hubby and I decided to try a new Asian restaurant and we ran into this gem and we love it! The prices are good for the portion they serve you and it tastes soooo amazing! They also offer gluten free foods if you're interested in a similar restaurant. Will come back always!
