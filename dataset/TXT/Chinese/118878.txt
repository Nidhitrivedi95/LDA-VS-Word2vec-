NPiVx-WKsuOEl1v0eWdxYg We were heading to our usual spot on Spadina, Kom Jug Yuen (been eating there for 20 years and liking it!) when we spotted the crowd in Sichuan Landscape.  Many were young, but almost all were Asian, so we figured and hoped the food would be good.  Well...the hot and sour soup arrived after we had been served our two main dishes; they were spicy hot and so, the soup was bland in comparison.  It was not tasty at all, compared to some hot and sour soups I have had (such as at Kom Jug Yuen!), but it was very hot (heat)!  So hot that several days later part of the gum inside my mouth was still trying to heal from the burn.  Both my husband and I found small rocks in the soup (pebbles);  happily we did not bite down hard on them!!   The waitress tried to tell us they were part of the mushrooms, but they were clearly rock!  The mapo doufu was nice and spicy but I did not notice any pork in it;  my husband said he saw some though.  The shanghai noodle dish we had did not look like the enticing photo in the menu;  it was tasty though..didn't have much other than noodles in it (lots of onion and a couple of shrimp).   The waitress did not charge us for the soup but we could have broken a tooth; I broke one once on some Indian snacks and it cost me $800 in dental work.  The chairs were dirty.  The prices are too high for the food value we got;  the chair seats should be replaced.  Won't eat there again;  glad I don't have to visit the dentist!  Back to Kom Jug Yuen!!  It's not fancy but it's always good, and the prices are realistic.
