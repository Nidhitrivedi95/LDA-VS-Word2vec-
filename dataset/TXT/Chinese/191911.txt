yWwIUmeenyAO7nwc7U0U5A Came to this place with family cause they had a promotion for all steamed rolls $2.99
Honestly their congee is nothing special when compared to like other congee places and pricy I think for the portion size, we got 2 steamed rolls and I did not like it at all....the steamed rolls is like all broken up and the ingredients is so minimal, I still like my steam rolls at dim sum places

Btw this place is tinyyyy
