czzDEma3urPeWdNcItOyPw I'm dating a Chinese dude, and we eat at some of the country's finest and most delicious Asian restaurants.  I feel pretty qualified to pass judgements on Chinese restaurants, especially with my main man by my side.  :)  That being said, I have definitely had better.  Now, a friend took me out to lunch here, so I'm not going to complain.  However, my honest feedback is that the lunch buffet is of pretty low quality ingredients and low to medium temperatures.  If you want your food hot, I'd such a later time of day perhaps.  I felt compelled to stick to the sushi after two failed plates full of fried, slightly cold food.  The sushi is a-ok.  :)  Hey, there aren't alot of options in East Mesa, so the price for even just the sushi makes it pretty darn affordable!
