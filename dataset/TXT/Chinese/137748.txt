QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw For the dinner mini hot pot, you can choose your own soup with meat.
There are also other food items to order that you can add it up to your hot pot (seafood!).
The restaurant is very comfy, and you get your own mini pot, instead of having to share a big pot with the whole table.
Staff are friendly, and service is fast.
Nice place to enjoy a nice dinner during the cold weather!
