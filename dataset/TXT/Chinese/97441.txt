JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw This was our first visit. They could use some more staff but service was friendly and fast considering they were overwhelmed. It's set up similar to Monta with a bar where you can watch the cooks as well as a few tables. We had the poke belly soup with hand pulled noodles which was fantastic. The broth was really flavorful and the pork very tender. We also had the potstickers which were tasty and the presentation was beautiful. Cucumber salad was good but the dressing was a little heavy for my taste. The poem and cabbage dumplings were tender and nicely seasoned. But the best dish was the Dan Dan Noodles with fermented soy beans and just the right amount of heat. So good! We will definitely return!
