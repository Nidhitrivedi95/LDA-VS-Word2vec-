jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw My husband & I were here a little while ago, it was early in the morning, probably about 9ish. We were craving roast duck & dim sum. When we arrived we were greeted and seated,  there were just a few people working we were offered several types of appetizers, we only accepted the dim sum, after about 10 minutes we asked for menus because they didn't hand them to us, a lady took our order; we ordered half a roast duck & steamed rice, as we waited the little carts kept rolling, and rolling, we ate our dim sum and waited for the duck, 45 minutes later we began to feel anxious, we didn't receive a " it'll be here soon" or " we apologize for the wait" NOTHING.. I say let's wait until the hour, we'll ask what's going on, so we did! After that one lady came near and asked if we were ready to place our order?! We said we already did and showed her the copy of the order & she said oh we're not serving duck at this time... ?!?! We were very upset, the lady who took the order in the first place should have said that to begin with, there was no communication between the employees, they didn't even apologize instead they handed us a check for the drinks and the dim sum. I can say after service like that I will not return to this place.
