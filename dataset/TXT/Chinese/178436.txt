x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg The decor here is nice
relatively good service
parking lot is horrible
always full house, make reservations or prepare to wait
the food is good, the soup dumplings have a nice thin wrapper with good amount of soup and meat. the fried bun that you dip in sweet condensed milk is nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, the shanghai noodles have a really nice texture.
