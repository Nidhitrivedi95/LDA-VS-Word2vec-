1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! Food is delicious and the prices are even better. We always get the salt and pepper chicken wings. Always good and always tastes the same. I also a noodle dish when I'm there, usually the special shrimp soup with vegetables. The steamed fish is also a must-try. Order promptly though because it does take about 15-20 mins to steam the fish. Other things I've tried: roti with curry sauce, dark meat hainan chicken, beef noodle soup, garlic ong choy, and a few other dishes I can't recall the name of right now but all very good. You can eat a lot here without breaking the bank.
