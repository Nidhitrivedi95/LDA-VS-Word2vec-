cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg My boyfriend and I order take out from George at least 3 times a month.  Their calamari is so yum.  I've gotten multiple dishes from here and they've all just been wonderful.  The best by far is the Spinach Fried Rice.  Don't forget to join George for New Years Eve dinner!  It's the place to be!  When my relatives come out here for the holidays, we always go to George and Sons!
