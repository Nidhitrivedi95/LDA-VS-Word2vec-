kjx0Zq21nF9aAK9wpGkmng Came in late September.
-There were a ton of mosquitoes inside (they keep  the door open cause theres no AC). They were biting several people including my party. The owner tried to kill a few but there were too many

-it's hot inside. No AC. What's worse is that they don't even give water (see next comment)

-they DONT GIVE WATER?!?!? This is the 1st time I've been to a place that doesn't give water. Is that even legal?? For this very reason, I will never eat there again. 

-food takes a long line time to come out. 

These guys are really keeping costs to a minimum... no AC, no water, insufficient staff in the kitchen? I'm ok with low costs if the prices are low, but these prices are pretty similar to what you'd pay in Chinatown (except that comes with luxuries like water). Wouldn't exactly call it "cheap" as some other reviews did. Sure, cheap compared to sushi, but it's dumplings we are talking about. 

Cash only
