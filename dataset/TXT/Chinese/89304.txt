If you go during the day, early morning at around 8am, you will see dim sum ladies pushing around carts with dim sum on it. They do that til around afternoon time. It's actually pretty satisfying where you can see what's being served and you can actually choose which dish you want!

There are no specials whatsoever, unlike most other restaurants where before 10am, its all one price or they don't count "tea cost". As soon as they put the food onto the table, they will mark your card according to how much the dim sum cost.

Food isn't the best or some dishes just barely hitting the average mark. Prices isn't the cheapest either, so when your taking into consideration the worth of food with the prices, certain items don't do so well. 

Tea cost is approximately $0.80 per person on weekdays. And don't even think about service, they give none. It's not a fancy place, its just a 24hr open restaurant that serves food. 

I would only come back if I'm in the area and my dim sum craving is kicking in at odd times.
