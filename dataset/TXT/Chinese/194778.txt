zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ My favorite noodle bar. Never disappoints!

Noodles are arranged on the menu in order from the most to least broth. Starts with the house noodle, the momofuku ramen. Then there are usually 5 more noodles, including a seasonal one. One is the Ginger Scallion Noodle, vegetarian, which is noteworthy for ramen where all broths are usually made with meat! This one is the last one, as it has no broth, but delicious all the same. Slightly oily at the bottom,  but the cucumber and pickled cabbage keep the dish refreshing. Another noteworthy ramen is the Extremely Spicy. They aren't kidding around here. Servers always warn that it cannot be returned to the kitchen.  I've seen people sweat and cry over this one. Served with a small glass of soy milk (the delicious asian kind), its totally worth it if you can handle the spice. 

Must try: Pork Belly Steamed Bao. Best bao in the city. Pork cooked to perfection, bao so delicate and tasty. Saucy and refreshing. (Other bao option is shiitake mushroom, good, but it ain't no pork belly bao)

A good selection of other small items available too, always worth trying!

You can order slushy (and non) drinks or beers/wine with your meal, which I find clashy with the noodles in the best way possible! 

Long row tables for sharing,  high top seating as well. Sometimes can be full but you can wait in the Shangri hotel lobby without being bothered. 

I highly recommend!
