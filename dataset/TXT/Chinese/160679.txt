uBCRRQJ4ukFaE_UyY6T1uQ Love it. Went to the China Grill in Miami and those two visits were in my top ten dinners of all time. A visit here is also in the top 10. 

Always creative and with good sized portions. Try the coconut ice cream for dessert. amazing what they can do with sugar! for dinner..eat ANYTHING. trust me. I think i've had the whole menu already. I really like their meats... the tenderloin with ? sauce was excellent. ask if they substitute it with rib eye? they did this once in miami (ran out of tenderloin) and it was even better! the one flaw..the drink size was really small for the price! i ordered a simple mango mojito (sp) and it came with about 4 oz of liquor. LOL needless to say, i only ordered one drink...i was afraid how small the next one would be. in vegas, best to order a beer..at least you know what you're going to get for the money ;)

also, the bathroom are incredible... BUT one question... how often do they clean that chain curtain going into and out of the bathroom??

many people don't wash their hands and EVERYONE HAS to touch that chain curtain to come in and out of the bathrooms... to avoid touching it... i used my shoulder! LOL i looked funny but i just couldn't see touching it on the way out! 

Enjoy!
