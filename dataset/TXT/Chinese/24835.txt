The don bowls are a good size, and prices range from $8-$15. There's a myriad of appetizers for the veggie and meat lovers alike, and if you're not into don rice for the day they've got good selection of udons to tie you over as well. Slightly rice-heavy on the don bowls, but the rice was flavourful and satisfying, and end up being an overall great portion size. The udon wasn't bad either - average, nothing to write home about, but no complaints. The skewers are single orders, so the price felt a bit steep, but each one was thoughtfully cooked and plated which gave some extra points. Next time I'll be focusing on the don and calling it a day - I feel it's their main selling point and works well on its own.
