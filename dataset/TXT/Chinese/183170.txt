XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw I feel like I found hidden treasure. The lady up front was so friendly. Everything was fresh and delicious. We ordered an absurd amount of dumplings to fill our dumpling craving and it was met and some. I'm sad I didn't know this placed existed before!

The boiled lamb dumplings are great and I'm a huge lamb fan. The crystal (stone) dumplings were so tasty! The beef soup dumplings and leek dumplings were also delicious. 

It took a bit of time to get everything but they make everything fresh to order and knowing that I would wait as long as it takes not to get a frozen garbage dumpling. I wish I could give them more stars!
