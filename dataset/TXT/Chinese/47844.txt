c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ Look, this is your typical cheap steak and egg deal in Vegas. It stops running at (I think) 8am so if you've been out all night drinking this is the place to hit before you continue on your binge. The steak was great for the price, the eggs were fine, and the beer with breakfast is such a wonderful Vegas treat. 

Yes, you may have to wait in line, but that's what gambling is for. They'll call your name when your table is ready. The decore is dreary and some of the seats have tears in them. Take a guess how little I care. 

If you go in knowing what to expect you won't be disappointed.
