6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ After one of my close friends introduced me to this restaurant, I mentioned to him that we should go and try it; and that was exactly what we did.

Went in on a friday evening and was seated quickly.  I was expecting the interior to have more of a japanese vibe, since the establishment was for a japanese themed cuisine.  Interior resembled similar to a normal chinese restaurant.

We ordered a large array of dishes.  Dishes I would recommend are the katsu don, mussel skewer, chicken karage, and chicken don.  These dishes were above average. A friendly suggestion for the establishment though:
Rice to protein/veggies ratio skewed towards the rice proportion for the "don" suffix dishes. I finished all my pork katsu and still had a quater bowl of rice remaining.

Dishes to avoid would include the scallop skewer and omu rice.  The omu chicken rice simply speaking was ketchup fried rice with a few pieces of chicken laid ontop with a scrambled egg covered in mayo and more ketchup.  Scallop was alright... heavy seasoned and lack of a scallop taste. I could've mistakened it for white cod.

Overall, not bad for a quick bite with your buds.

Note: check in at the store to receive one scoop of free matcha ice cream.  

Enjoy.
