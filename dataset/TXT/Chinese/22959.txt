6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ For a hangover, I love Asian food, some noodles or fried rice, mmmm. This served well but not the best. I ordered the shrimp fried rice and my friend had the chicken rice. The rice was not really fried (personal preference) as I would like have liked it. 

The service was good, kitchen was kind of slow given the restaurant was not busy at all. There were a few lunch specials even on Saturday! 

We also had an Irish coffee which was really good. The decor and ambiance is really neat.
