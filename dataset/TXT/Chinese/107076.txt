L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA Hidden in a strip mall is the Cafe Noodle, good, cheap, fast, late night-friendly fare. There are two menus, one less expensive than the other (and there is also a paper takeout menu). Being cheap bastards, we always order from the smaller menu. We had 4 entrees for $24: kung pao chicken, beef with green onions, orange chicken, and salt-and-pepper pork chops were all fine and served with hot tea and white rice. The portions are ample for the price.

Some menu items just don't translate well into English, you'll find many dishes with names like "beef with pickled pig intestines." We skip those.

Asians will get somewhat better service than whites here, but I've seen worse.
