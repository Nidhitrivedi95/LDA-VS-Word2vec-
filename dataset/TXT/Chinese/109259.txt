lmfyEVKm3CDGWg18LeRhgA Awful!  Worst dining experience I have had in a long time.  I wish I could give negative stars.
-I wanted to look at a menu but the waiter/front of house guy kept pushing the buffet. So we reluctantly gave it a try - I wish we had just left the restaurant. 
-food was mediocre at best once you got past the fact that it was dry cold and tasteless 
-the ambiance was dreary and the incense was nauseating.
-there is also no place to change a diaper  in addition to the fact that the bathroom was not stocked with toilet paper or paper towels and the floors were grimy and sticky GROSS
-when it came time to pay I WAS CHARGED $100- no joke!!!!   When I brought it to his attention he acted like I was the one inconveniencing HIM!  Then, after completely screwing my finances for the day he had the nerve to get on to me about my card declining when he tried to charge it for the correct $9 amount.  Fully embarrassed and infuriated I had to ask my friend to cover me.

I will NEVER return to this establishment. There are so many other better Thai restaurants in the area I don't even know how or why these people are still in business! DO NOT go here!
