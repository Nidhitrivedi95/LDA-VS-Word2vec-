GkY6UWWn0Fz2ehcuBp66pg Took a bunch of meat peeps to join me, since dim sum isn't usually something I can have, and absolutely no one was disappointed. People who expect meat are going to be let down. That's vegetarianism. Tofu will never be beef. But for vegetarian food (and especially dim sum) this place is great and one of the best I've had.
