gnqHyA6gY2-m9S-FKt6Xqw Cravings is one of those restaurants that you would just find reasons to go back to. This place is really for what it offers inexpensive. There is no real service, and I don't seem to mind that one little bit. You order at the counter, and for your order you are given a card with a number on it. And a few minutes later, your food/number is called out which you can take back from the counter to your table. Oh yeah, you are expected to bus your own plates once you are done eating. 

Now the food: they have a wide range of Chinese and adapted Chinese cuisines from Malaysia, India and Indonesia. Their menu is super long but surprisingly this doesn't seem to effect the consistency of the food made. Unfortunately, my food recommendations might not work for you as I am vegetarian. But anyway, Green bean or vegetables stir fry in Hunan sauce seem to my usual picks. Jakarta fried rice with tofu is also something that I really like. They have some soup and Chinese tea for free, which you can ask the owner about. 

The owner is real friendly and always indulges in the occasional chat if he happens to be unoccupied. I did take a star out though, because sometimes the tables are left dirty. Because of the absence or regular cleaning staff, the tables are left dirty sometimes by inconsiderate customers. Be warned, the tables are packed if you go during the rush hours. 

All in all, you have to love cravings!
