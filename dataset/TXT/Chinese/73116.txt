Fif1uzIU95ttv6kbtRg0ZA Hot & Sour soup is a favorite of ours and since the old Eddie Chan's closed and sold the name we have searched.  Good China makes a nice one, plus their luncheon menu is well priced, the portions are more than ample and the food is tasty.  The only negative we found were the egg rolls which were very good but soaked up oil.  A much hotter frying oil would crisp them up and rate them up there with the Hot & Sour Soup.  Overall, good, inexpensive lunch with a pleasant atmosphere and nice people.  Try it, we will again.
