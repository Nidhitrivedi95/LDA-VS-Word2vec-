aeROhG8M_G-W5L6XhD3TXA This restaurant was a pleasant surprise. The menu is well illustrated, and lets you find most of your favourite dishes quickly. The dishes were prepared and delivered fresh and hot. The various dumplings are larger than normal, and the cuttlefish was tender. 
Between the two of us, we ordered an ambitious 8 plates. Six would have been fine, since we had to bring an overlooked dish home. We did ask to have it removed from the bill, but they delivered it "to go" anyways. 
This place is expensive. Just shy of $50, and to drink, we had tea (at $1 per person). Did I mention there were only the two of us?
Make sure to read the fine print in the pricing of each dish. $7 per order of shrimp roll seems a bit steep, as good as it is.
