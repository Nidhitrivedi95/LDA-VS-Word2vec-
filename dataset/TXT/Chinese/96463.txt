jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow Great layout of food. Incredible variety. Very clean. Quality of food was great. Staff was welcoming and service was good. Wasn't your typical Chinese buffet in terms of quality. They have put a lot of effort and energy into keeping the food looking and tasting good as well as the layout and design of the building. Would definitely return.
