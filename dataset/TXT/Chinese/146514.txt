s5fGo1Nieiy6M-fhk_Ywnw cheap chinese food here, large portions, there dumplings here are very good. 10 for like 5$ or something. good deal. There chicken cashew was okay, F/R is good. everything else was good, but nothing else stuck out that amazed me. There sesame chicken was edible and taste good, but they could do better.
