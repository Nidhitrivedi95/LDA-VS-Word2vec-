kj1KQgC-mCRV4vYZlWitzg Whenever I don't want to cook and Boyfriend doesn't want a burger or Mexican food, we end up at Panda. Not my favorite thing in the world, but it's a break from cooking!

The store is very clean and the staff is very friendly. 

But the real reason this location gets 4 stars is because they're one of the very few locations that still makes my favorite: Eggplant Tofu. While they don't always have it cooked and ready to go, they make it for me when I ask and I love them for it!

So, if you're an eggplant tofu lover and are watching it disappear from Pandas with dismay, head over to this location and ask for it!
