FMtluZEVTYvHN4bIZi734w It's a pretty new place and I pass by all the time, so I wanted to give it a shot. 7:15pm on a Friday night, no customers at all. That was alright, I wasn't going to let that tell me anything. 
The lady with very poor English asked me noodle or hot pot, so I chose the noodle menu (the name of the place IS lovin' noodle after all). There were very little selections. I would say maybe around 10 noodle selections. Options were not very impressive either. My two friends ended up ordering the same thing because they didn't want anything spicy and well, there wasn't much of a choice left after that.
The food took quite some time to come out. My noodle was only warm, not hot, so the fresh bean sprouts wouldn't even cook itself in the soup. The soup base was a spicy and sour flavour, but couldnt really taste the spice. It was sour, but also incredibly salty. I wasn't full or satisfied at all after finishing. Almost 8 o'clock, we get the bill to pay and finally two other people walk in (there were no other customers the entire time we were eating). So sad.
My stomach was acting up all night long and so did my friend's. I wouldn't give this place a second chance.
