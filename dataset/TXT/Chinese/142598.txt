rkVTKhUDO-VtrIu8esB75g This was straight up grossest ramen I've ever had. I got smelt like something out of a barn the pork tasted like it went bad and they served up anyways. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. i couldn't eat it I had to throw it away

The price was kind of high for low quality noodles but the guy at the counter was pretty chill shout out to him though 
 
Don't eat here smh
