They have everything, from popcorn chicken to salted chicken to Taiwanese sausages to even bubble tea!!!! And everything is super delicious--and cheap! I'm usually able to get a full meal for less than $10 here, usually even less than $8! If you crave authentic Taiwanese cuisine for a low price, you absolutely CANNOT miss this spot.
