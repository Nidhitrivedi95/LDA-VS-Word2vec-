jenDHueIvOhpB-0ivdiRoQ Just like the other reviewers have mentioned, while the food is pretty good, the service and flexibility is non-existent.

I ordered the shrimp and scallop garlic sauce. I don't really like rice and prefer Lo Mein noodles. When I asked for a substitution, I thought the server had seen a ghost. She quickly said. No...they can't do that. I asked not even with an upcharge? No. can't do it.

Wow. I was stunned. I probably should have just left but I took the dish as is. Their motto should be "You get what you get but you don't pitch a fit." Really? A minor substitution like that? The place was fairly empty and it reminded me that again, I need to read Yelp before I go.

Two stars for the food quality.
