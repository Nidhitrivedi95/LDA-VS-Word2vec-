_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Was really excited about discovering this place on Yelp because we were craving Asian food in Vegas. The hostess greeted us in Chinese, and about 75% or so of the customers were Chinese (and not even American Chinese I think) so I assumed it would be an authentic experience. My boyfriend ordered the Sichuan style beef noodle soup and I ordered a mapo tofu which came with a bowl of Jasmine rice. The noodles came fast since I guess more people order noodle dishes than rice dishes. I had to wait extra 15 minutes or so for mine to come. The noodle soup was actually pretty good; it did tasted like braised meat-based soup I've had in China but maybe the flavor was a bit too intense and salty than what I've had in the past. Still pretty good though; the beef pieces in the soup were too cube-y and thus not very tender. The noodles were good quality but not sure if it was hand-pulled there or they just bought good quality ones that were frozen. The mapo tofu was kind of sweet and Americanized - probably closer to the kind I would get in Japan or Korea rather than in Sichuan. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again. Tofu was also very firm and not silky. Unless you're dying to eat not so authentic but not exactly P.F. Chang style Chinese food, I'd skip this place.
