OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Since I'm originally from the Bay Area, I can be a bit picky about dim sum but I'm generally happy to very happy whenever I go to Chang's. The service and selection are good and things are usually fresh and tasty. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because I did get vegetables once that were way overcooked. Thinking about it now, I should have returned them and I'm sure they would have gotten me perfectly cooked ones but I had guests and didn't want to make a fuss. My bad. I still go back and have never had any complaints in the three times since.
