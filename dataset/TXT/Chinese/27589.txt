8cjXEmuqgCbIRudb2D52qw Very disappointed! It was Christmas day we needed to wait 2 hours for an appetizer the meals arrived before the appetizer and we Finished to eat still waiting 30 Minutes more only for dumpling shrimp , then the waiter come and ask if everything is ok and we said no because we still waiting for the appetizer and he is totally forgot about it and start blaming us that the restaurant if full and what do we want from him...bad treatment not responsible instead of apologize to us start to defend himself so we call the manager and he apologized and gave us to pay half price.
