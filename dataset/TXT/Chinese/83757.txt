HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ Went here at 8pm on a Tuesday night.  The food was good and the service was quick and friendly.

Items tried:
1) Pork & vegetable dumplings.  Got them fried vs steamed.  They were great and dipping sauce was delicious.
2) Fire Island Roll w/o the aoili on top.  This was fantastic!  Will definitely order again.
3) Teriyaki beef entree.  Beef was a little dry but overall flavor was great.  Just added some soy sauce and all was well.
