i_pI9XnOgJ93cq85Ot06OQ I recently had the opportunity to dine here while I was staying at the Palms. As my friend and I entered the establishment we were not greeted at all but there were three hostesses standing behind the podium they just looked at us blankly. We smiled and nodded and we asked if they were open. (It was dinner time) one of them said "yes" and proceeded to take us to a table.  The server brought us drinks which was fine and then our waiter seemed a bit disturbed.  We proceeded to talk and order our food which was also fine. The waiter didn't seem to pay attention to us once the food came.  Though there was a brief moment he just stood beside out table.  Additionally I witnessed him take a piece of fruit from the bar and eat it.  Then a loud conversation between the manager and one of the blank hostesses took place at the bar. It was about shift changes and didn't really seem appropriate for a restaurant.   Overall, the food was fine but the staff needs better training.
