(Yes, there's no partition, all massages happen in one big room.) The staff wears professional looking white uniforms.  At the waiting area, pictures of therapists lined the wall, and customers are requested to change into slippers.  

The girl at the reception area was very nice too, spent time listening to my husband describing his ailment and recommended a therapist for him.  My husband gets a tuina (masseurs are mostly Chinese with a couple of Caucasians) and I got a Thai massage.  Curiously, all the Thai masseuses come from Japan.  I heard them chatting in native Japanese while I changed into my Thai clothes before the massage.  Is Thai massage that popular in Japan that they have an oversupply of masseuses?  Why didn't they import Thai masseuses to do the job for less? Why aren't the Japanese doing shiatsu?  Wish I know the answers! 

Unfortunately, this place fails at what counts the most: the quality of the massage.  No, it's not bad, the therapists didn't talk on the phone and didn't hurt me.  But the experience was a big meh.  I didn't walk out feeling more relaxed or lighter on my feet, let alone sleep deeper that night or walking up refreshed the next day (which happens with a good massage).  Despite intake form and reminder, the masseuse did not do extra work on problematic parts. My husband was not happy with his tuina either.   At $85 (for the "better" tuina master) and $70 for my Thai, it's not expensive but I didn't feel it was money well spent either. 

Too bad, so wish to like this place.
