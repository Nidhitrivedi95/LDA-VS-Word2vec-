td-NOo-k4xhfVmO5X92uAg in fairness we didnt try the noodles, but the chicken and broc was decent- def not the worst ive ever had but no where near the best. the portions were kinda small
the shrimp with lobster sauce was ok but same scenario there. (3 shrimp, small amount of rice, one cheese wanton...)
the soups were pretty bad... 
also of my pieces of chicken had a bone in it or something... and there wasnt enough chicken....

overall, i wouldnt go back but its def not the worst....
