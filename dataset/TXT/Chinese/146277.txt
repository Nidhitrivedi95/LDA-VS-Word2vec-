S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A My short trips to Phoenix always include a meal (or 2) here. Noodles are fresh and made at the restaurant. There are lots of options to choose from and a handful of various noodle sizes to try. My favorites are the minced pork with noodles and the niu rou mien (beef noodle soup). This place is definitely worth a try! Service is always quick too.
