zVZ-OBo-DaaIO89Wiepo-g I have dined both in the restaurant as well as in the take out section in the mall.   For the take out section, I like how quickly the food is ready and the space to eat it in.  It's nice when you want something quick but aren't interested in battling the crowds in the food court.  The food is pretty good and they give you a lot for the price.  Inside the restaurant is quite nice and the food is decent.  I can't say it's the best food I have ever had, but it's not bad either.
