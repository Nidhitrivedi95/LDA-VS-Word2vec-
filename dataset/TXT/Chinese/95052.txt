jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg Love Love Love this place! Get the roast duck, some sweet and sour pork, and the honey walnut shrimp. They prepare them the old fashioned way, with love and taste in mind! Always professional, responds with sir and ma'am, never hovered over the table, always checked us at appropriate times. We brought the whole family, from my dad ( a senior) to my son ( a 1yr old).  They were extremely welcoming even if we did come in late, they didnt try to hurry us out because of closing time. We were the last ones to leave, but they still acted as if we were spending a million dollars in the restaurant. Come here if you want to be served like a king!
