c2l80imPWR8V6gIEM02XPg I used to order delivery from this location about 2 years ago. Their dishes were flavorful and large - especially the lo mein.  I stopped ordering because we moved to a different area.  Now that I moved back I was excited that I could have them deliver again and on top of that able to order online.  

I selected the family meal for two, and submitted the payment online.  15 minutes later I get a call from the restaurant indicating that "they" did the order wrong and I have to pay again as it wasn't right? so I had to place my order again..  After confirming that I wouldn't be double charged I reluctantly gave them my information again and confirmed my order....... 5 minutes later...I see two different amount charges on my bank account.

After several attempts at calling the restaurant back (kept getting a busy signal)  I asked that they ensure my money was refunded.  They stated they would call back for the refund confirmation.

In the meantime, my ordered was delivered.  I was SOOOO disappointed.  There was absolutely NO FLAVOR in any of the items ordered.  

Egg Flower soup - was watered down
Beef with Broccoli - soggy and seemed to have been out for a while, then reheated
White Rice - hard to chew
Chicken Fried Rice - no flavor/seasoning
Sesame Chicken - my boyfriend had it.. it didn't tempt me enough to eat

I would say the only good thing that came out of that meal were the 4 egg rolls they included in the order.

Oh.. and in regards to my refund for the double charge.  I ended up having to go to the restaurant in order to ask for my refund.  As I never received a call back that night..

Buyers Beware!
