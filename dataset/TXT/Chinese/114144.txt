mtUscPpaEpOpdBWDGXuNcA Servers were nice and fast to remove a plate and fill a drink.   Paid $9 for lunch which was kind of high but atleast the food was good.  Sushi kinda basic rolls but where fresh.    Wonton soup broth was kinda bland like out of a can.   Not bad for lunch.    Gonna have to give dinner a shot.
