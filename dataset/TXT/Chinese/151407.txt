szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A Food taste great. Ordered at once please. If you try to order to go when you are done eating. Prepare to wait another half hour or more. Under staff but place is packed. Staff are friendly but the wait for getting a check or to go box. I suggest you help yourself and wait by the door. Dishes are delicious tho.
