X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Was really excited to finally give this club a try but was extremely disappointed! First of all, it didn't seem like they were enforcing the dress code... some of the outfits that people were wearing were not something that I thought they would allow in. Second, it was really really crowded. The dance floor itself is quite small, but I kind of expected that. Third (& most importantly), the Dj sucked ! We came here on 11/9/17 & the Dj was all over the place with his music choices. He would play something good (for about 30 secs) and then switch it up to something completely different, it was so annoying! The music is what really ruined the experience for us. Definitely will not be returning or recommending this club.
