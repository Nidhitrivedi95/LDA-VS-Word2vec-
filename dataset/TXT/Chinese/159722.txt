U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ Decent Vietnamese restaurant for a place where Asian food is not widely available. The spring rolls were interesting because the pork inside had been barbecued which isn't usually normal for spring rolls you can find at any other Vietnamese restaurant. The rice wrapper for the rolls were extremely chewy and thick, I wasn't a fan and just ended up eating the filling. I ordered the bun bo hue (spicy beef and pork noodle soup). The taste was good, I asked for medium spice and didn't find it spicy at all. The meat was pretty chewy and unappetizing, but the noodles and veggies that came with it were pretty good. Service was pretty good but the orders came out super slow compared to most pho restaurants I've been too. Overall a good option for people who know what real Vietnamese taste like.
