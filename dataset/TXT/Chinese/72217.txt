ffi1TJTShRnGh6rjuwdtsQ serviceable dim sum spot with elegant, banquet hall-esque decor.  popped in on a sunday shortly after noontime, and it was quite busy, but we only waited about 10 minutes to get seating.  the waitstaff were friendly and attentive.

bliss operates on dim sum orders rather than carts, and i prefer the latter because it's more fun and significantly reduces wait times for food - it took roughly half an hour after ordering for our food to get to our table.  our party ordered our usual favourites, like siu mai, har gow, beef spareribs, snow pea leaves, squid tentacles, congee, shrimp spring rolls, beef brisket noodle soup, and egg tarts.  everything ranged from good to great, except for the noodle soup, whose broth i thought was lacking in flavour.

prices were on the higher side, but that's forgivable since the food was enjoyable.  i would easily recommend this place to anyone, but i do think there are better dim sum restaurants in mississauga
