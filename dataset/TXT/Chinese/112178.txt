mevOvXMnlTLbSl4w8fcG2A This is by far the best Chinese food place we have been able to find in the Vaughan area, and we've been trying. 

We've been to the location on Yonge St many times and have always been pleased with the taste,quality and consistency of the food. When we moved to Vaughan we were looking for the same quality and found this location. 

Time and again we try other places, but nothing has come close to compare to Choice of the Orient.
