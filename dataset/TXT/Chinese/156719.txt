TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ Came here with some family because they wanted chinese food.  We ordered the dinner specal and there was a ton of food and it was really good.  They have a veggie soup that was really good.  There egg rolls were hot and fresh but a little oily but still really tasty.  We got sweet and sour chicken and something else and a beef dish and they were all really tasty.
