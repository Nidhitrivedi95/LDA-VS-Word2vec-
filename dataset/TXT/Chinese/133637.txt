pYR9KSNrJMEx8PIjx8rccw UPDATE:  This place closed down about a year ago.  Sadness. Another mom and pop Chinese buffet goes by the wayside of stretching themselves too thin.


I resisted going here for the past several years that I've lived in Sun Prairie b/c of all the other mediocre Chinese food buffet restaurants I've eaten at that left me a bit disappointed.

Their selection is less in numbers of dishes than other places around the Dane County area; however, in terms of quality and freshness, it's rather good. Since other reviewers did not go into significant detail about the offerings, I'll mention my first time experience recently on a Sunday (where there were about three other tables of diners):

- peanut butter chicken
- mongolian beef
- chow mein
- a few sushi rolls (x2 varieties)
- crab rangoons (better than average)
- spring rolls (eggrolls, more aptly)
- popcorn shrimp
- two types of soups - your basic hot and sour or egg drop (these were just OK)
- chicken skewers (these were excellent even though I didn't expect them to be based on appearance)
- seafood stir fry w/ veggies
- fish fillets
- dessert options looked like a few types of cakes and fruit, pudding, and jello.

I like the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. And this place was clean.  It's tucked away in a strip mall by Walmart, so points against it for location.  But you can't beat the price, $7-8 for a buffet meal!  Of course, afterwards, I had to nap off the food coma ...
