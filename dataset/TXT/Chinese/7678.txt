0VjHFdczi6Nln_nn8bucJQ Good vietnamese food considering it's in Nevada. 

The house special fried rice is good. Not greasy nor oily, seasoning is just rice. 

Pho is good. The broth has less msg, and you don't get thirsty after.

M9 (noodle with bbq porks, spring rolls, vegetables, served with fish sauce) is yummy. The pork is very flavorful and egg rolls too. 

Will return whenever I'm traveling through Nevada.

FYI: very nice, attentive and friendly service too!
