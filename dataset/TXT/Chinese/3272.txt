_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA i dream about this noodle place, but not especially for the noodles. They have the most amazing shrimp fried rice that I have ever encountered. Seriously-AAAAAmazing! Its kind of hard to pick a noodle dish because the descriptions are vague and the servers are very "authentic".  I've been there at least a half dozen times and the shr fr rice is the most amazing dish every time, as well as the hot and sour soup. Those are the best in my book.
