cEFnJrDaz7BLO0xOCJlF6A I eat here every couple of months, when I'm in the mood to stuff my face with as much food as possible for under $12 including tax and tip (2pm special). Coming here is like playing the lottery. Will you win or will you lose? Is the food today going to be good or is it going to be crap? 

Whenever you go, there'll be at least a few dishes which aren't totally gross. There are some that, even just by the look of them, you know are going to be totally gross. Do not take the hard boiled eggs! They are ALWAYS hard and gross. Ditto the red bean tong sui.

4.5* to the separate bakery section at the other door. 90c pork buns FTW!
