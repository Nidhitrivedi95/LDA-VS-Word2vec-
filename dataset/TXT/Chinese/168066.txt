VKNwgZGroTNHcPqgRtmcpA This was my first time going here and it will be the last.   Neither of the dishes ordered had any flavor.  The vegetables in the sesame chicken didn't have any life or flavor in them.  Normally great or even decent service can save a place but not there!  Not once did our server stop by the table to see how our food was.  The manager picked up our plates about 10 minutes and said the server would bring the check.  We sat there for 25minutes after that before the server came over to ask if we wanted desert and finally brought the check after we said no.  I hope he was just new and trying to find his groove but I will not return to find out.
