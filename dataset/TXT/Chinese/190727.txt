Yo_cFLv1Kf92LP1JSwjDmw When I tried this branch soon after it opened, the food did not taste like their Scarborough branches tried a couple of times, but always ended up with feeling unfulfilled. So we ended up ditching this branch and heading to Scarborough (45 minutes away). However, over the last few months the food quality seems to have gotten better. It seems much on par with the Scarborough branch.
