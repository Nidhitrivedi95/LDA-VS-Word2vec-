HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA I absolutely loved this place! My husband and I went to Vegas this past weekend with some friends and before leaving sin city we wanted to have some good yet cheap food and this was perfect! It's located in a small casino and when we first walked in, we got a bit scared, it was such a small place! But the food did not disappoint. 

We ordered the pork belly bao, soft shell crab bao, peking duck bao, wonton soup, chicken and waffles, eggs benedict with pork belly, and a pancakes and sausage breakfast. For 5 of us the bill came out to be $75 including tip! Oh and we ordered coffee too. 

Everything was delicious! The only thing that was just "ok" were the pancakes and waffles. 

We can't wait to come back!
