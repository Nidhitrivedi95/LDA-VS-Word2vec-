alWRFbDdU3_F1c2C4nG2dw I'm not sure where others were eating, but I am enjoying the food at Mandarin House FAR better than Wong's. Wong's was very salty and oily. This food was delicious, with flavor but not overly salty. We had the House Special Wonton Soup- packed with wontons, shrimp (tons of them), pork and chicken. It was so good! We also ordered the chicken Chow Mein, which my boyfriend agreed was much better now, and the Moo Sho Chicken. It was all so good and our delivery came fast (Wong's never delivered so this is great!). We'll be ordering from here much more now. It's no longer the "because it's close" option, but also because it's good.
