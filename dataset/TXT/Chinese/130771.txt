pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Food was average. The waiter did not seem to care about food sensitivities or preferences, he refused to give us a menu and assured us we would spend 50 dollars each. He brought us food according to what we preferred, but food was on par with chain restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory. Don't hoard the menu dudebro! Bill came and it ended up being 150 a person. Triple what he had told us it would be. 6 people and 1100 dollars for an average meal is not what I want to experience in Las Vegas. I'm fine with spending money, but it needs to be worth it and I need to know in advance so I can budget accordingly.

Ambiance was nice, service was attentive... But hey, we were the cash cow of the night, if he had ignored us, our complaint to the manager would have been legitimate enough to get a discount. This restaurant will live on forever in my memory as a regret of wasted money that keep me up at night. Like that time I thought it would be a good idea to sign up for marathons I never ran, or that time I bought my ex boyfriend a gold necklace the year I found out he cheated on me. 

Never again!! Stay away, unless someone else is footing the bill!
