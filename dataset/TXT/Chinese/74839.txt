Fu5rL-dPs-VNW0k315xMbw Honestly, the much popular Ice-Quake Sweet & Sour Pork is not even worth it, especially at $11.99. The ice is supposed to make it more crispy and it did, but also made it much more chewy and hard which I didn't like. 

Also ordered the baby mustard veggie with garlic and Singapore fried rice. They were both alright. The portions were fairly big. This restaurant serves a complimentary beef/veggie soup at the very beginning and red bean soup dessert. Most Chinese places don't do this. Food is pretty expensive here though. I really can't justify paying around $9 for a plate of veggies.

Overall, I guess this is an alright restaurant if you don't mind paying a bit more. I probably won't be coming back anytime soon.
