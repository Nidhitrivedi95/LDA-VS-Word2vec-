You can get in and out of here fairly quickly and the the final product is extremely consistent even though you are choosing your own sauces and ingredients to customize your own bowl. The unlimited soup is always hot; however, my only complaint is that the brown rice sometimes clumps together and is hard, as if it was overcooked and has been sitting in the serving container for too long. I like how many of the sauces are more water based than oil and syrup.  Also, the staff is outgoing and friendly every single time. 

My only complaint is how they make you pay 50 cents if you want to take home your leftovers after just one trip through the buffet line. I also wish that they offered eggs to be fried with your bowl.
