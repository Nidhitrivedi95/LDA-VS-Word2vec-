xftWto4IdilizsGdE07AQw Yummmo!!!!  This place is the only Korean style Chinese restaurant that I know of in Chandler since Sun Chinese restaurant closed.   This place is tastier and has a lot better service too. My family nick named it the Pecking Gourmet of AZ after the one in Garden Grove. 
Their Kim Chee is pretty good. They offered us the raw onions with the brown pates but we passed. They don't serve daikon on the side. 
We ordered the  , ,  , and the .  The sweet and sour beef ( ) was perfect. We really liked the light batter and the perfectly fried beef. The multi seafood dish (  ) was okay. Not as many varieties of seafood  I'd like to see jelly fish but we're not anywhere near the ocean. The sauce was good, just was disappointed to see the Asian fish cake instead of the real thing. As far as the fried shrimp dish, I like my shrimp not breaded but the sauce was on point and the breading was not too heavy. Last, the classic   which my family lovingly refer to as "axel grease noodle" was a classic. 
We will definitely frequent this joint.
P. S. They do have a separate American-Chinese menu if that's what you're craving.
