1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w Thought we would try this place for lunch today but it didn't work out .. Me n the co workers work 5 min away and wanted to have a nice lunch on Friday . The place was not that busy and unfortunately we had to get all our lunches to go . So unfortunately PF Changs can't be on our list of places to go for lunch .
