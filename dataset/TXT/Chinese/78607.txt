GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog I am surprised by all of the so-so reviews of this place. We were starving and slightly hung over from our big NYE night so the Michalada was the perfect way to start the meal off. 

The tomato juice concoction was excellent and very unique to what I am used to. 

Our server was great and offered some very good suggestions. We started with the tinga and carnitas tacos. Both were fantastic. We ordered a dim sum sampler and each piece was a bite of heaven. 

The fried rice was probably my least favorite dish, and I was very underwhelmed, especially with all the hype of it being a 'not to be missed' dish. Not bad, just nothing special. 

The empanadas were great. I am picky about mole, but it was great. 

The dan dan mian noodle dish was so-so. I probably would reorder it again, but again nothing bad, just not very memorable. The server said it was very spicy (and I love spicy) but I didn't get much heat at all. 

Overall, good dining experience. Next time I will probably stick with the tacos and dim sum and maybe some ceviche.
