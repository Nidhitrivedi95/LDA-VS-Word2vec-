2d9RbgRtHJyTRzY99GBNOQ A good friend of mine recommended me this place so i thought I would give it a try. I went during lunch time and I'm not really surprised that the place was Packed! Due to the fact that the location of the specific restaurant was conveniently located at the heart of downtown Toronto. Too bad the food & service didn't live up to my friend's hype. I had to wait 10 minutes to get a table. Anyways, the decor is not bad, not good. It was average. One thing that is good is that they have tainted windows, so the "creepers" from outside of the restaurant won't peek through and make funny faces and so on. 

The food was OKAY, the food that I ordered was: Spicy Chili Chicken on rice, Crispy Spring Roll and a can of Coca-Cola. The Crispy Spring roll is really oily, that it gave me a headache after eating it. The Spicy Chili Chicken on rice was good and I enjoyed it. It was really spicy for my taste (this is coming from a guy from a Indian background) and a can of Coca-Cola, not really much to talk about. The service is really bad! I nearly waited 25 minutes to get my order and the servers NEVER refills your glass. Even after you had the oily Spring roll. I had to ask them to refill my water and it even takes them 2 minutes to get to my table and refill my water. They never come around and ask you how is the food and so on. 

At the end my bill came up to $14.70. Which i think is a bit over priced from what I had from the food and service. I just left $17.00 and left without ever saying goodbye. Worst customer service experience and overpriced food.

You can get a better deal if you go to other Chinese restaurants!! Save your money and go somewhere else!
