EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ This place is amazing, hand pulled noodles made fresh to order.  We started with the spicy dumplings they were delicious, not too spicy and an order is enough for 2 people. I ordered the Mongolian beef chow mein it was not what I expected, it was way better. The beef was tender and flavorful. My friend ordered the beef brisket noodle, the broth was excellent. Large portions, reasonably priced and friendly staff.  I highly recommend this  restaurant
