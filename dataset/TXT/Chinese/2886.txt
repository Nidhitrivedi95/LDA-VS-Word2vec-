_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Wasn't impressed.  Long line outside, and seeing the number of Asians eating inside, I thought it was a good sign.  But after 30 minutes of waiting in line and watching the servers completely fumbling over each other - they were clearly inexperienced and had no idea what they were doing, I knew we were doomed.  But we had already waited that long so we stayed.  From the line, I watched table after table trying to flag someone down because they wanted to pay.  No one would come to them.  I look over to see where the servers are and all four servers, standing together near the cash register looking completely flustered.  Meanwhile, there is a gigantic line outside, which is continuing to grow, and tables are empty and cleared and no one is coming to address the customers waiting in line.  Finally, after about 40 minutes, the man in front of me started to get annoyed obviously by seeing pretty much half the restaurant clear out and no one being seated so he walks in to the four servers standing around the cash register and says something to them.  Finally, one server comes and takes that man and his friend and seats them at the counter.  Then she goes back to standing there - like deer in headlights.  Good grief. Then it was my turn to flag the girl down and tell her that I am happy to sit at the counter as there are empty chairs.  When I tell her that, then she seats us, finally.   I have no idea how long the others continued to wait outside. 

Once at the counter, we ordered, two noodle soup dishes.  it was pretty uneventful and unflavorful.  Maybe it was what I ordered, or maybe it was because they were so busy that they were rushing and not preparing food properly.  

We ate here because we watched Rock of Ages at the Venetian.   I don't think I would ever come back here again.  For noodles - I much prefer Noodles at Bellagio!
