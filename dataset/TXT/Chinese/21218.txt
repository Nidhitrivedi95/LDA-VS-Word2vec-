68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw Flock is such a gem in our little desert! After leaving Cali (specifically Monterey Park) 3 years ago, I would always crave Hainan Chicken Rice. Every time I drove back home, I would always make a stop at Savoy, a joint in Cali known for their hainan chicken rice. I am happy to say that I no longer need to make that trip! Flock and Fowl tastes just like home! My husband actually prefers Flock over Savoy. I think the only thing that Savoy has an edge over is their spicy sauce.

The food is top notch! I always come here every Friday on my days off, and order 2 hainanese chicken rice each time to-go (1 for the hubby and 1 for myself). When we get a chance to dine in, we will order 2 hainan chicken rices to eat at the restaurant, and 2 to-go. That's how delicious Flock makes their signature dish!

The customer service is also top notch, especially Jenny! I'm always greeted by my name whenever I enter, and it amazes me how every time I'm in there, she greets almost every customer walking into her restaurant by their name. You know your food and service is great when almost every customer entering your shop is a regular. 

See you next Friday, Flock & Fowl :p
