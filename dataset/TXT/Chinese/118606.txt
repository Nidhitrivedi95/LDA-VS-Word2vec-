NMQb_TvWEOGkaZDrNC03wA This is my go to place for Szechuan in the city. Although the one in chinatown is slightly better in my opinion (bigger portions but slightly more expensive) I love the Szechuan Cabbage and lamb on sizzling Iron plate. Great dishes! Other highlights are the green beans with minced pork, and poached fish or poached beef in hot chilli oil. Service is fast as well. A must try if you enjoy Szechuan food!
