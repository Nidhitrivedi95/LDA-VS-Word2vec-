6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag Came here on Saturday night after planning to go to Bosa 1 across the parking lot, but Bosa 1 was closed.  All was ok, as I was planning to go to China Mama at some point and this was a good opportunity.

I found the service to be very friendly and characteristic of a family run restaurant.  Coming here with my spouse and child, we figured trying a few of the smaller appetizer plates that have been well received to be a good plan, to try a 'tasting' menu of the more popular dishes.  We ordered the beef roll, the pork soup dumplings, the scallion pancake, and, hoping to match cold sesame noodles common back east, the noodles in sesame sauce. 

All items were good, but the beef roll was the star of the show - unctuous, flavorful and savory, with a wonderful hoisin sauce/sesame oil aroma.  All other items were very good, but I was a bit disappointed in the sesame noodles, as they were a bit mild and served warm (although eating them the next day cold rectified that).

I highly recommend China Mama - friendly service, good food more reminscent of american coastal chinese cuisine (probably closer to San Francisco style as opposed to NY, but good nonetheless).
