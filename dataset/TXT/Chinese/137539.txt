The food: I had the general tsaos chicken which was pretty good. The egg drop soup was pretty average. I also tried the mongolian beef which was average and so was the szechuan beef nothing was spicy even though it was indicated on the menu. Suprisingly though their pad thai is decent still not at all spicy. So like I said pretty average food but if you're in a hurry decent lunch special with plenty of food. 

The Service: The service was pretty good. Our Ice teas kept getting refilled. It was a little ackward because when we first walked in we couldn't tell who was working there because there were two different tables of employees eating. It took a few minutes for them to finish up what they were saying and seat us. Other then that I would go again if i needed a quick cheap lunch.
