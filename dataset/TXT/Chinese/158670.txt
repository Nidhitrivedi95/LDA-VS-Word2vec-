Tz5a_AzxWx0gtIAlinr1Ww You really can't beat the huge selection of menu items at this buffet and with a price point under $10 it's a great place that we visit on those nights (or even for lunch) where everyone is too drained to make something. Waitstaff has always been very pleasant on each of my visits and I would certainly recommend the place to friends (and have!)
