QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA My friend and I were hungry after shopping next door at the market. It was around lunchtime and noticed that Szechwan had some great prices for a long menu of choices. We went in and were seated right away. Our waitress was very friendly and took great care of us! 

I ordered the Szechwan beef and my friend got a Kung Pao Chicken. The food came out within 10 minutes so I was pleased, although there were only about 6 other customers eating. I found the food to be good, but similar to other Szechwan places I've tried in the past. 

Will definitely come back if I'm in the area shopping at the Asian market.
