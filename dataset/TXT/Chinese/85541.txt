hlDcfzRGfmSmL5LpYcRqKA I live in the area and get lunch delivered to my house from here anytime im in the mood for chinese. Their spicy house chicken is amazing fried goodness with rice noodles and hot red chili's. They have cheap lunch deals and only require $10 to deliver. Is it the best chinese food in phoenix? No. Is it really good, inexpensive, and available? Yes. Good job China Wok, keep it up.
