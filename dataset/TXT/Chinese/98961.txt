Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Moving from San Diego, trying to find good restaurants in the foods that I love can be a challenge but I love how they have dim sum all day . Most places back home have set dim sum times. Prices are reasonable and it's never packed so there's never a waiting food my go to dim sum place!
