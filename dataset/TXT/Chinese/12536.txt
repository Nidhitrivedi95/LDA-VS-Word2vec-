2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w Slim pickins for Chinese food out here in the land of Surprise but this place is fairly priced and has good food.  We just tried their lunch special and it was a great value and no issues with the rice.  On top of good food, the service is always on the mark and very friendly.  

Enjoy!
