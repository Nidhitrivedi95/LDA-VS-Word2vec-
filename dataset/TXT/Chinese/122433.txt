1-the breakfast -ham, bacon, toast and potatoes were good, especially the potatoes. They are not oily/greasy and they have nice crunch. My parents ordered the omelet, and it was huge! they added sausage, bacon, beef, jalapenos, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions and some salsa, it looked really good and it also came with potatoes. No complaints from the folks.  Service can be slow, but just like at Wicked Vicky's I think they underestimate how busy they will be and only have a handful of people on deck taking orders. I can't blame them if I see them hustling so I won't be a "b" word and not tip them, that's just fd up! 

2nd-the bar area. The drinks cannot be beat, a beer with a shot of 1800 silver (my fav tequila) for $5?!? What?! Say it again $5?!!? YUP!!!!! Where else can you get this for $5? If you want to do just drinks, they are a bit on the pricier side (Cadillac margarita for instance was $11, but the bartender was not skimpy on the liquor. Tequila shots are $3 and my grey goose with cranberry was $9.00. They have some couches with tables on the side if you don't want to sit at the bar, but the bartenders are cool, and funny! One of the managers was given a shot by the customer and she took it like champ! lol gotta love that.
