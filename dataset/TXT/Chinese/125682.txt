Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w Let me start off by saying that this used to be one of my favorite places in Charlotte to eat. The food was good, the service was excellent. The last few times, not so much. 
Let's talk about service first:
- The seating took place relatively quickly
- It took us 5 minutes to get our drinks ordered (acceptable)
- It took 10 minutes to get the drinks (bordering on slow)
- It took 15 minutes to get silverware and shell bowls (VERY slow for a buffet restaurant)
- The dishes stacked up and up at the table. I actually looked at my watch to see how long it would be before we say a waitress for our SECTION of 9 tables. It was 15 minutes. They went to one table and it was another 5 minutes before we saw her again.
Now to the food:
The sushi was warm.. the crab legs were cold! Anybody see the problem here? In fact the crab legs I picked up, supposedly hot, were almost still frozen! At least two of the three clusters I got.
The selection for sushi a year or so ago was significantly better. 
I also had the buttered shrimp... okay
The Hot and Sour Soup - No flavor at all. Seemed to be watered down.
The ice cream machine was broken, so that was a bust.
The fried chicken was okay.
The sesame chicken lacked any sesame. The pieces were large not very flavorful.
The clams lacked any flavor, along with the Thai Chicken.
Overall... simply not a good outing.
Needless to say, although this was a restaurant we went to on at least a monthly basis, we will be looking for a new Asian restaurant to frequent.
