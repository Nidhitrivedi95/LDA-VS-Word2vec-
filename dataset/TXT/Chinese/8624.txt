1jNteKQ2JuF6Sk1SI9X23Q Definitely a western approach to Chinese,  would much rather go to a Asian buffet where the food is quality and taste is mediocre but could stuff my face until I get kicked out. 
The food is overpriced and way too salty in my opinion.  The food reminds me of a frozen microwave dinner or something out of a box. 
I will admit that the spring/ egg rolls where very good probably the only thing going for them along with the decor and atmosphere. 
I always recommend trying things once to form your own opinion but don't get your hopes up.  Better off having a blind Jamaican woman make your dinner at least you can blame her visual impairment if the food is saltier then a bag of layz chips.
