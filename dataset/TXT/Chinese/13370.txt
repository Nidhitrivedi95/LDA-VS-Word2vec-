2UFl9gLOQrSGY2sPu6U-kA The last time I was here was 2 years ago, and I remember it being awesome, but the recent reviews made me nervous. After revisiting it, I'm happy to say that it's just as good as I remember. Plentiful fresh meat and an enormous selection of noodles, veggies, seafood, and more. The hot appetizers were great as well. We all couldn't stop eating the fried dough buns. The staff is efficient and the restaurant as a whole is clean and elegant. The only thing I'd complain about is the price, which is at least $25/person, but you are paying for all-you-can-eat meat and we all ate until it hurt, so I guess that's fair enough. 

I really love this restaurant and am still puzzled by the bad reviews. I don't have any other hot pot restaurants where I'm from so maybe I just don't have anything else to compare it to? Who knows, but my family has had great experiences both times we've been here.
