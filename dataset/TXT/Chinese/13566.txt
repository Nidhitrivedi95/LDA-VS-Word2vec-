2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q I think this is the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas. Granted it is inside the Gold Coast, but its great. Many people go here for their hot pots, but I love the Bento boxes. The Lemon chicken is phenomenal. They also have the best steamed rice -- prepared perfectly every time! The orange chicken is also excellent and prepared in a very unique way. The chicken is sliced extremely thin then fried so it curls up and is so tasty. The sauce is just perfect. The staff is always friendly, and the service is great! The portions are very large, even for a single serve bento box.
