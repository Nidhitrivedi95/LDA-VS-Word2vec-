9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw First time here and I am kind of upset about that. First I will say the owner is really nice. The place is very clean with a little clutter in the back but that is probably because of lack of storage. Their menu is professionally done and really stands out.

Now to the important stuff, the food. We ordered two appetizers, Cheese Rangoon and Pepper Calamari. They were both delicious and the Calamari stood out the most because I really liked the chopped up sauteed peppers and onions served on top of it. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and my wife ordered the Beef with Broccoli. The General's chicken was one of the best I have ever had. It was very crispy with great taste. I asked for it to be extra spicy and it could of been spicier but I want complain about that. 

We will definitely be back.
