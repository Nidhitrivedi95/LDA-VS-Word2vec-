KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ Wow. They need to close this place down. Not only was this place pretty much empty the entire time while at dinner, but the food is equally unimpressive not to mention overpriced, and the atmosphere is pretty horrible here. I would have rather had Chinese food from local joint at home, paid them what I paid here at Pearl, and would have had a better experience and given them 2-3 stars.

Unfortunately, every place I have eaten at MGM for dinner has been a 1star. I should add that I did come back one more time to Vegas after writing this review and that visit changed this last statement, but at the time I was here... that statement was true. Pearl gets 1 star!
