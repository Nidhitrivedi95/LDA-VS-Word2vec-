VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg I really enjoyed the pork belly loco moco, but I did not like the macaroni salad. The macaroni salad had little to no taste. Also, a friend of mine ordered the pork belly pancake. Honestly we didn't know what to expect but it was still a let down. It was basically just pork belly in a tortilla. The boba drinks were good tho. I ordered the lychee black teapresso and it was delicious, the fact that I was able to chose the level of sweetness made it better. Also, with the boba drinks they add the right amount of boba unlike the other boba places where the boba basically over powers the drink.
