M-rqZ56wTGSNoIIsBSlhDA More like a 4.5 actually. Among all the HK style cafes I've tried (the genre of restaurant, not others by the same name) I believe this is one of the few that actually give quality food, relatively speaking. I've tried the baked pork chop rice and also their steak. I was impressed with both! The pork chop rice had a good tomato sauce and wasn't dependent on the use of processed cheese to be flavourful. The steak was ACTUALLY cooked to medium. Typically at other HK style cafes, they would ask me how I like my steak and still cook it to well done/ unevenly without fail. This is the only one that actually cooked it to my liking. Gravy that came with it was pretty good too. I also had trouble finding a good milk tea, and I believe they do have it here. Overall, with decent food quality, cheap prices, and very generous portions, this is definitely my go to HK style cafe next to Sugar Sweet Cafe!
