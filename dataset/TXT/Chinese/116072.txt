I had no idea that it was part of the PF Chang group but once thought about it looking at the menu makes sense. The first impression definitely on point thinking fancy or upscale version of Panda. I know they have few PW across the city. The menu is pretty straight forward with your choices. I decided try the Thai Dynamite with Chicken for entree and got four piece spicy tuna roll for starter. The spicy tuna roll honest not something would order again. Maybe ordering sushi in really fast food concept not good idea. The tuna was really dark color not fresh looking at all. To the manager credit I never asked for another order but as soon as different employee dropped it off she was like this one looks better. The color only slightly better but I do appreciate the manager taking initiative. 

TheThai Dynamite with Chicken. It was ok at best. The chicken were nice size pieces of chicken, cooked on point, and the sauce was good. They needed put more sauce on it. Most of the pieces of chicken not even covered in sauce. The lack of sauce killed it for me, The vegetables came with it were fresh and tasty. The amount of rice on the plate was crazy. I do love my rice! 

The service was nothing like the food. It was five star service from the manager taking initiative brought out another spicy tuna roll. I place my order being first timer explaining all my options. Other employees making sure everything was good once got my food and when leaving thanks for coming in.
