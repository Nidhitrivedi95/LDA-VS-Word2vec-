DVfCbJhJUDWRlUfrKzaKOA It was pretty good. Had lunch with a group of four today. Ordered wonton soup, triple BBQ combo, Ying Yang fried rice, and Chinese broccoli. It came super quickly. Every dish came out within the span of maybe 10 minutes. But everything was reasonably portioned, hot and delicious. We finished everything. A lot of MSG though, we were really thirsty later. Kinda pricy, but it's Vegas.
Service was okay. They didn't really check on us. We had to call out and ask for waters and stuff. 
But the most important thing is that we came starving, and left with full bellies.
