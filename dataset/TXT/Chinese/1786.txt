-UPP0Q_kZsuQ2zZ1k7lbyQ I'm never coming back here unless the restaurant changes the policies again. As of today? May 15th 2016 all of the set dinners (usually includes soup, drink & dessert w/ the entree) will only be served until 6pm! What's the point coming here now? I totally live for those! I know it's so the establishment can make more revenue with hopes of people ordering the big dishes but it's a little annoying. When our friends wanted to order anything with pork chop, nothing was available. Ahh.. why is this restaurant even opened? Going to look for other alternatives for fast dinner. Service was good. They were prompt and polite. Our table also got comp Chinese soup.
