qMJCVx6-ZYvZQHlfrZ_cug This is a little gem. Found this by seeing it on Yelp.  The restaurant had been in business for 20 years serving Taiwanese-influenced Chinese dishes. The dishes we had were ask very fresh with the vegetables bring crispy and full of taste.  Great egg drop soup, lovely crab puffs, and a good array of starters. The main course dishes were really very good and served by a friendly and enthusiastic owner and his lovely wife.  The prices and portions were very reasonable.  I recommend the Snow White Chicken, which had a delightful garlic flavor.  The Mu Shu Pork was a winner and I now look forward to trying some of their battered dishes next time.  Be sure to ask then for their home made mustard!
