XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA So much hype about this place, but I wasn't thrilled after my visit. 

First of all, everyone who was waiting in line was congested at the entrance. Is it that difficult to tell people to form a line outside? Many noodle/ramen places do that even when it's raining or snowing. The place aside from the entrance is super congested too. It's a tiny store. Maybe u can spare that huge area for the noodle chef for customers who are actually paying the bills.

Chinese noodles - they are everywhere in Markham. Price is steep for the food, but not steep for an area like downtown Toronto. Food came and I was truly disappointed. I wouldn't believe the noodles are handpulled freshly if i didn't see him doing it live. Meat and broth were decent though, not too salty. 

Something new for downtown Toronto. Maybe my tastebuds were too spoiled because I visited GB soon after my vacation in China. But this store would not survive in Markham where it's full of people used to eating authentic food from their hometown. Not a fan.
