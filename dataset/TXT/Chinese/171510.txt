VYkosZRlRjStOFqIB62orQ Small restaurant that I wouldn't have come in if it wasn't for my friends' choice. Surprisingly this little restaurant is a hidden gem! Apparently it was well known back in China, Beijing and other places. 

I had their individual for one person soup (tea tree mushroom with duck and mandarin peel- good for coughs *i had some for past two days*). Sharing we had ShaXian wonton, ShaXian vermicelli with pork, steamed cabbage dumplings, wok fried spare ribs in wine sauce. 

Their shaxian wontons $3.49 for 16 of them yet they're small like a nickle size (smaller than a quarter) but the meat is sooooo flavorful and tender. Wonton wrap was very silky smooth and the clear soup base was just the right taste. Not too savory and it was really tasty. (I was kind of shocked to be honest).  

The ShaXian vermicelli with pork was sooooo good, light and fluffy but not greasy! Simple dish, stir fired with some egg, some onions and pork slices. For $7.99 I think it is definitely worth it because I like stir fried vermicelli but really afraid to be greasy, heavy and filling with carbs. 

Steamed cabbage dumplings- 4/5* for the taste of the meat, but the dumplings doesn't have juice coming out, yet it isn't dry. But I still prefer the wonton soup more. $4.99 for 8 pieces

I had tea tree mushroom with duck and mandarin orange peel soup. It was traditional style but still too tasty for natural homemade (for sure there's MSG). But so far 2 hrs after dinner I'm not thirsty or having dry mouth. 

I love this place and will definitely come back for more soon.
