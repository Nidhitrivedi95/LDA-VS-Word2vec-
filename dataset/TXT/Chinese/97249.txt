JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw Can I give 6 stars? What's not to like...maybe the wait time. But if you don't have the time and patience to wait, it's your lost. Hand pulled noodles...OM...devine!!! The place is on the small side, that's why wait time during lunch time could be a challenge.
Everyone in the place are super nice and friendly. We'll definitely coming back the next time we're in Vegas.
