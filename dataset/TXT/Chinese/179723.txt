X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg My first time attending this club was during easter weekend. I went on a Friday and got the chance to see Calvin Harris !
That's mainly the reason why I wanted to check it out. 
Yea the drinks are over priced and it's extremely crowded, but it's expected. For one its vegas and everything is expensive and for two, it's going to be super packed when the club has these high end djs at the club and everyone wants to go for the experience. Regardless, I thought the music was great and it was really fun. It was mainly EDM playing all night but I enjoyed it
