vctaNms-o_VDHWCAbldFjQ This was my favourite Northern Chinese Cuisine, until we've made the mistake of going back. I had a pleasant food memory at Sika Deer Chinese Cuisine until our last visit. 

Xiao Lung Bao was over steamed. The wrap did not hold the soup in well. The buns were reheated instead of freshly pan fried. 

As other reviewers had mentioned, the restaurant uses big plates for small portions. Majority of the dishes did not tasted fresh. 

Perhaps it is my luck, perhaps they are getting sloppy. Hopefully they will shake it up! Part of me still hope this appalling experience is a one time deal.
