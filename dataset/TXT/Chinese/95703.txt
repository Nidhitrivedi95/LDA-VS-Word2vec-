JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA Dim sum in Vegas, am I right?  But maybe you're a little spooked by other places that have long waits or lousy reputations on yelp. Well open your mind to a slightly different experience: tawainese breakfast! It's slightly different than dim sum but not so different that you'll be confused. There's XLB, there's bao, there's chinese doughnuts, there's all kinds of spicy nom noms, there's something for everyone! Seriously!

We came here on a Sunday morning, hungry. We left the opposite of hungry. The service was friendly if a little slow to get started. We liked the ample parking and the fact that a Chinese tour group showed up right after we did (they ate their breakfast like champions - truly impressive intake) and that we were the only native English speakers there.  Most importantly we liked the food and appreciated the good advice we got from our server. And the bill was reasonable too. :)

Enjoy life. Regret nothing. Eat at Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli. You'll be the champion when you do.
