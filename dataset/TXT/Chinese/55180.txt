cw0wVQxImxix2GoChgIYNQ dead on...meh, i've experienced better...best part of the evening playing with the food. scared the daughter with crawfish, convinced the son to eat escargot, then attempted to get both kids to kiss a giant shrimp with eyes. the husband says three stars, but honestly i don't think i'd eat at this joint again.
