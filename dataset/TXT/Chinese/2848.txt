_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Was so happy to find this place nestled in the Venetian.  I sat at the bar and was waited on almost immediately. Extensive menu.  Enjoyed the spring roll appetizer, szechuan beef noodle bowl (it was huge!), and warm saki.  Yes, more expensive than one usually spends at a noodle house.  However, quite reasonable for Vegas.  No doubt I'd eat there again on a return visit to the Strip.
