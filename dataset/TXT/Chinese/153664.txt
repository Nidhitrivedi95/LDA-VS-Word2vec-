taXKuFldSoerm9SXrckh_w We love Chinese food and are always looking for new places to try.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  We had the Sweet and Sour delight, Triple Delight, Chicken lettuce wraps, Shrimp fried rice, Lo Mein and Egg Rolls. The egg rolls were nothing special, but everything else was delicious. We did take out so I can't comment on service. Also they don't have Egg Foo Young on the menu, but I asked and they will make it for dine in customers. Definitely going back to dine in.
