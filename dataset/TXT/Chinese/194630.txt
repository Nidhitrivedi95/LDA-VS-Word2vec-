Quick service when I was there, however, there were not too many customers because it was way after lunch time. I had the Hong Kong style fried noodle and it was delicious. We usually order egg drop and hot and sour soups, teriyaki chicken, Mongolian beef, honey walnut prawns, etc. I love their taro boba but their mango is also good. Please note tea is not free and meal is served in styrofoam plates and cups.
