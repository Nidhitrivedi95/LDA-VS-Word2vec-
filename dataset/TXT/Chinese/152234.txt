t_yiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA This is a glorified takeout place. I don't see what's the hype is all about with reviews here. I saw the reviews here in Yelp and tried this place. The food was okay. But the place is not cleanly, lacks any decor and no service what so ever! Their prices does not match the food and service they provide. I feel it's way too expensive for self-service style restaurant.
