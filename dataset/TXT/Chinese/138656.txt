QpOAv584eb-ecG4TLEm95g First my 5 stars are based only on the food I ordered for pick up and the service. When I moved here in November I was curious if I could find a Chinese food place that I loved as much as I did back in California. I am not big on a lot of Chinese food but I love chicken fried rice. This is usually how I rate a good Chinese place. I am a picky eater so I have always ordered mine with no vegetables, rice, chicken, and egg only.
China A Go Go is on my way home from work so I thought I would give them a try. I ordered on-line with the special instructions of no veggies and a pick up time of ASAP as I was leaving work in 5 minute and it is about a 5 minute drive away. I was leery of the online ordering but it worked just fine. I arrived at the place and my order was ready and best of all it was correct, No Veggies!!
The best part of all is it tasted exactly like the chicken fried rice I use to get at my favorite place in California. I am a fan of this place and I see a lot more orders in the future. The price was also reasonable.
