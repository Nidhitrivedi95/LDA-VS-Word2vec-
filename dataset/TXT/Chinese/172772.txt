W8xPHUqL088jdcmNZyH-eA After fasting for 15 hours for my blood work, I was starving!! This place is right across from St. Rose hospital (less than 1 min. drive). Much better option than eating at the cafeteria in the hospital. 
I came in for spicy beef noodle soup (#2) and hot chili won ton. They were delicious!
 The spicy beef noodle soup had two different kinds of beef. I don't know what kind of beef but one kind tasted like the beef in Oxtail soup. Very tender and some fatty. The other kind was very tough and hard (tendon?). It wasn't that spicy. I should've asked extra spicy. 
The chili won ton was also very tasty as the Yelp reviews said. I was so starving I ate them all.
The reviews said their water glasses were dirty so I ordered a bottle of water. To me, water glass looked fine, but just in case.
Waiter guy was very nice and attentive. The lady in the kitchen came out and talked to me which was nice (She is from Tainan. <U+53F0><U+5357>)
I will come back to try more different stuff on the menu!!
