W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ The infiltration of Chicago restaurants has accelerated rapidly in the past year. One of those entrants is Yusho, coming from the talented Chef Matthias Merges.

It would be unfair to compare Yusho Vegas to its Chicago counterpart, so I will go by this meal alone. I always enjoy my local visits to Yusho, not to mention Billy Sunday is one of my favorite bars in the city. 

 It is a large space and was surprisingly empty on our visit.  The decor is bright and stylish, lacking the excessiveness of most Strip places.

What I thought was good: 
- all the sauces that accompanied the dishes, especially the 2x fried chicken. It was great.
- excellent lineup of Japanese whiskey. Very impressed to find that on the Strip.

- tons of sake. Ordered the kikusui funaguchi, always a solid choice 

Just nice: 
-ramen. Wasn't as great as I hoped it would be but I didn't send it back.

-duck. Kinda dry, but saved by the sauce.

A solid place and I'm glad it's on the Strip. Maybe I actually am unconsciously comparing it to its Chicago counterpart, but I expect better trips in the future.  Hopefully Yusho is embraced in Vegas and maybe Billy Sunday can be exported to the Strip. That would be awesome.
