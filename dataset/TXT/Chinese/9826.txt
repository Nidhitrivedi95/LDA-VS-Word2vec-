1uPQTz5XZSWr0ti7kUpaDw I have dreams about these dumplings. I walk by twice a day on my way to and from work and it takes every ounce of strength in my being to not pop in for some shrimp, egg and leek dumplings. I tried making them at home once to satisfy the craving but there's no way any other dumpling could compare.

I highly recommend lamb and coriander, pork and mushroom, leek, shrimp, and egg, leek, shrimp, pork, and egg, curried beef and onion (fried! oh my gosh is it good). They still taste amazing even after you and your friend polish off a total of 8 plates between the two of you. I'm not even ashamed to admit that.

Great for a cheap, quick meal. The place is usually packed but I've never found the service to be particularly slow. The staff is really friendly, and they don't even look at you weirdly when you look them straight in the eye without even opening the menu and order 3 plates of number 22 (leek, shrimp and egg!)
