fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA The steamed dumplings are rather senseless. The fried ones are nice and come on the plate inverted with a lacy coating of fried dumpling starch linking them together which is crunchy and flavorful. 

If you want dipping sauce of any kind not on the table they will supply it, though my requested crushed garlic in soy cause was inexplicably green in color.

The meat dumplings contian little meat an dyou will be hungry soon after.
