eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ I order Ramen Noodle with Chashu Pork.  It was cold and in December, you had to get soupy something to stay warm.  The food was really delicious, the food came out quickly.  The customers sitting at the bar alongside me were very friendly.  The prices were reasonable.  Large Portions.  If you're visiting Wisconsin Dells, Wi, get your food here before you go because there is no good asian place in Wisconsin Dells.  It's an hour to wisconsin dell.  The food was really good.
