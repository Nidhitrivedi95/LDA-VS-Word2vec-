awZx3Y1PAwhCUpt3WGZhKg I hate to share negative reviews but here it comes. I was welcomed into the restaurant, I was seated and given some time to review the menu before ordering. 

When it came to ordering, the lady took my order as she was walking by and it seemed like she barely acknowledged my order. As I am waiting for my food, I am noticing other tables nearby are filling up and their orders being taken. 10-15 minutes pass by, these other tables that settled in after me got their food. I wait for another 15 minutes until I finally get their attention and they say that the food is coming. 

With my patience running thin, I gave it a final 10 minutes and the food still didn't arrive. I let the staff know that the service is unacceptable and everyone got their food before me when I was in my seat with my order finalized before everyone else even sat down. I ended up walking out, never in my life have I ever walked out after committing to my order.

Horrible service, not sure what I did wrong in order to be ignored like this. I don't recommend this place based on this service.
