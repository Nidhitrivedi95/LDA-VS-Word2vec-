yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA if I could give this place 100 stars I would. I've been going here for the past four years. I'm not even from Las Vegas, so for me this place is a must stop in Sin City. Yeah yeah this place is full of Michelin 5-Star places, but oh lordy lord is this place good. I think it's one of the best vietnamese spots in the U.S and I'm comparing it to hubs in LA/Little Saigon/Dallas/Boston and other major vietnamese hubs. I tell everyone I know in the Boston area to come here and they agree that this place rocks.

I will say the one thing I don't enjoy is the service for it is a typical asian restaurant experience - sub par. Also, the spring rolls aren't so great, but everything else from pho, com tam, mi xao don, cha gio and the drinks are worth it!

PS - though this place is open 24/7, they will deny service if they can't handle it. Happened to me during EDC last year. I just left to change some clothes and came back in like 20 mins.
