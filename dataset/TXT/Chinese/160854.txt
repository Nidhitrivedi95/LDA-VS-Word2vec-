UC2dfjZg8mrRh10maovQfw From time to time they like to switch up the dim sum menu to add some new dim sum dishes. I tried the abalone puff pastry which was recently added and contained pieces of diced pork, mushrooms and a slice of abalone on top with a sprinkle of bonito flakes. I like that the fried foods here are not super oily and the dishes don't take long to come out after you order. I will definitely come back again for more dim sum!
