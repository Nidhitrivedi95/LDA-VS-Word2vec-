fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA I really wanted to like this place based on the other reviews but this place is overrated. I have 4 items the xiao long bao, that was okay, I've had better at various joints in NYC. The scallion pancakes were really good, crispy, flavorful not too oily. The egg roll things were pretty bland and the friend squid was chewy and flavorless. Local restaurants from Rochester NY does their squid so much better. When they say fried squid it is literally squid, batter, frier. I don't think they even bother putting salt and pepper on it. Maybe I ordered the wrong stuff. If there is a next time, I'll have to try some of the other dumplings that folks have reviewed here on yelp. For the prices they charged, I expected more. Also service was a bit terse, 1 waitress was super friendly and helpful, the other 3 dropping off food didn't say a word and just put it on the table and walked away....
