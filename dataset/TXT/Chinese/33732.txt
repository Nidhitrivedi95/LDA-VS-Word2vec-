Bad service - we came on a weekend night at around 6pm which is early for Asian dinners, and they were out of certain dishes already! How on earth? 

There were no other people in the restaurant except for us.

The food we had ordered was dry, not flavourful and though cheap, you definitely get what you paid for: bad food.
