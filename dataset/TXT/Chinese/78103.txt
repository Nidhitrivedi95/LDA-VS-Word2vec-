giF_C_zJEdggBLG03nQTKQ We had dinner here and the food was AMAZING. My husband doesn't normally like Chinese food but he particular enjoyed the Mapo Tofu with Beef. Oh, he likes the decor, too. 

This restaurant used to be House of Egg Roll in Chandler but the owners closed that location early this year. When my friends told me that the same owners re-opened it in Mesa, I was excited but didn't expect it to be any different. But they managed to kick it up a notch at the new location with a more extensive menu that showcases a lot of unique dishes. It definitely highlights a Chinese regional cuisine that is steeped in Chinese culture and history.
