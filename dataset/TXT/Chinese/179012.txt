x8_vFLAheiN5sfZEE9YPew I always order combo C7 which consisted of fried rice, chicken wings, general Tao chicken and veggies or just spicy chicken wings with a side of wonton soup. It's located in a busy plaza with Longos and the doctors office being the hub locations. It's typical Chinese food, nothing fancy. I normally do take out and the preparation time and service is always dead on. I've been to this location over 20 times now. It's not super amazing but it's also not bad either. Worth an order or sit down if you live in the area.
