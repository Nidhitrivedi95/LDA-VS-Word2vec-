Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!

We ordered take out for New Years Eve at 4:30pm.  I specified that we will PICK UP at 6pm.  We went to pick up and they said there was no order under our phone number or name.  Kept asking and asking for them to check. After being yelled at "What are you doing here?" 5 times... They finally realized it was under the DELIVERY system not the PICK UP system. They said it was being delivered.  So we went home and waited. Kept calling every half hour- we got hung up on many times... They kept telling us it was being delivered and will be there in 20 minutes.  At 8:30pm after 4 hours being ordered- we gave up.  Called them again to complain and we told them we'll cancel the order.  Hardly any apologies or regrets...

Granted it was NEW YEARS EVE, I understand things can get crazy... but you figure it's Congee Queen and they have experience with this. STILL- NO EXCUSES! 

We ordered from KEUNGs and the food was ready for pick up in 30 minutes.  No trouble, no mess up. Easy.  Our poor kids were hungry and we finally ate at 9:30pm. 

I've banned CONGEE QUEEN from my list of GO TO restaurants in Markham. I used to come here all the time... NEVER AGAIN. Goodbye Queen of CRAPPY service.
