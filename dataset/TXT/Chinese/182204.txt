xgZMO4BHn1TCn7hZ62SaiA I've been ordering stuff from them since I moved here from San Francisco, CA.  Their Egg fu Young is unbeatable. I kept going back for more. They are fairly priced and the disposable containers the food came in, are sturdy.  You can tell they their hearts into packing your order. :) Your order comes with fortune cookies and lots of sauces. If you order in the early evening, service is speedy.  One time it was like 10 min and I live in the west outskirt of uptown
