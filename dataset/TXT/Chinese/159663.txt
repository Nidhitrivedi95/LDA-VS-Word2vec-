U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ I've had the house pho a couple times, a vegetarian curry dish, and the papaya salad appetizer.  All were excellent.  Considering the price range, this place is legit.  It's not at all fancy, but the ambience and service are good for a place that is surprisingly affordable while serving delicious food.  Most entrés fall in the $8-$12 range.  I'm very glad to have it in the neighborhood.  I can't wait to eat here more and try new dishes!
