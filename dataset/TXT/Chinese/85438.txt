hlDcfzRGfmSmL5LpYcRqKA It's good Chinese delivery.  Not the highest quality of food, but you certainly get the value of what you're paying for.  I don't think it's a place I would ever consider dining in at, but when you don't feel like the leaving the house, it's a pizza alternative.

Last night we ordered Moo Goo Gai Pan.  It was average.  All though it was big and loaded with chicken, veggies, and white sauce, it was nothing I had to keep eating after having a little less than half the box.  We also had the Chicken Chow Fun.  It was good, but as much has I like that dish, I think Chow Fun tastes the same no matter where you order it.  Nothing was bad, but it's all standard Chinese Delivery/take out.
