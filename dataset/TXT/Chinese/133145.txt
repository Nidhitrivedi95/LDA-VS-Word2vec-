puPY7gVy7RCz8bK1zkzdoQ Best Chinese food I've ever had. The service is over the top. Food comes to the table fast and cooked to perfection. Best experience at a restaurant ever. The type of small business you want in your community. I will be a customer for the rest of my life. Oh I almost forgot. The crab puffs are insane. It's the one thing my wife and I can't share. Mmmm
