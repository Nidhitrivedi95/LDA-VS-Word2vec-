QKCu3cKjMAOOZI7tEfv0zg Had the lunch special: Shrimp with brocolli.

PROS
Food tastes good, salted just right for me. Wife says a little too salty for her.
Fast service.
Decent price.

CONS
Tasteless egg drop soup.
A little cluttered. It's a takeout joint, not a restaurant where they wait on you.
Cheap styrofoam and plastic ware.
