sQFpfRs1Flcw3evCdI2wpA Please be very careful when you eat here and use your credit card. This is one of the restaurants I ate in while visiting Toronto. I'm not sure where the "skimming" occurred but this place is suspect. Credit card charges of over $20,000 appeared on my account about three weeks after my visit there. There might be a credit card scam going on here. BUYERS BEWARE.
