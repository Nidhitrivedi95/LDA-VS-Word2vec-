VVUL1lzBOipXJlOG1wURMg Delicious Hakka restaurant, better than Federicks in my opinion. Love their ginger beef and Manchurian noodles. Their lunch specials are awesome and the portions are very generous!
I usually get take out but will try dining in next time. I'm sure everything on their menu is great.
