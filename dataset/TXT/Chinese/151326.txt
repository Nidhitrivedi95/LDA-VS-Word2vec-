szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A Probably can't count the ###### of times my fam and I have gathered for an overcrowded Sunday yum cha wait, thus dinner makes for a stress-free occasion where we don't have to scream at a cart-pusher like a famished pack of prison inmates. Tonite we just happened to be on the west side of town and checked in. Surprisingly not but four other tables on a Friday nite at 7:30, and most of those tables occupied by at least one Asian patron. Perhaps west siders r later owls.

Hubby and I argued over which fried rice dish to partake, but sad to report his choice of dried scallops and egg whites won out over my 'hahm yue' smelly, i mean salted fish choice. However his first choice is my second so I was content nonetheless. Only once did he succumb while visiting Hong Kong and never again could he stomach the fishiness after being mortified with the pungent aroma that is indeed an acquired taste. 

We couldn't put even the slightest dent in the yummy fried rice as the volume rivaled Camelback mountain! I also went for my usual pan fried noodle dish and enjoyed the chef's choice to use nira as the veggie component instead of the usual choi sum. 

All in all another satisfying home comfort Chinese meal that brings back fond family memories.
