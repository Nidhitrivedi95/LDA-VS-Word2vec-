S6dARuOrrOXd4xSiTHti8g Awesome, authentic Chinese food. Every dish was delicious, had a lot of depth, and very satisfying. The special fish with the "secret" sauce was incredible and delicate in flavor. Shared family style, the price per a person is also insanely reasonable for the quality, for a large group.
