TWkL-VHo6P-WwL8iTvqlYQ If you like PF Chang's, but not the price tag, definitely come here. The mongolian beef is identical, same portion (small), half the price. Spring rolls are tasty too. They also have lettuce wraps, like PF Chang's is known for. Their menu is small and compared to PF Chang's the prices are low, but I think their competition is Tott's Asian Diner right down the street.  Lower prices, bigger menu, same stirfry wok's, spectacular service, clean, super nice owner who remembers your name for years :)
