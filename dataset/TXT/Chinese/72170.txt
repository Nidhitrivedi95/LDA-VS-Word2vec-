fEymsotOKc5V6-z7pZLPrw Don't let them decieve you,  but the chicken balls are ugly, yet yummy all the same.  

Special fried rice was delicious and you could actually see chunks of real meat in it as opposed to some places I've ordered the same dish from.  

Wonton soup was alright,  you had the option to choose chicken or shrimp.  Chose shrimp, not entirely disappointed.  

The general atmosphere is something that of you just eat and go.  Nothing to see here.
