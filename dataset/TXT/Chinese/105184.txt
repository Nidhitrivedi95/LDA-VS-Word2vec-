KV9kL8c3C-ELO_IL4zaHOQ Let me begin by explaining that I *hate* fish soup.

Then let me say that this place has the first fish soup that I've enjoyed. Lacking that really fishy flavor that overpowers the tastebuds, the taste of the broth is instead smooth and rich.

They also serve several light snacks that only run you up to $3.50 a plate. Served in an almost tapas/omakase style, you can get several of these small items (ranging from deep fried fish skin to chicken skewers) to share amongst a group.

For my trip to this establishment, I personally decided to order a curry beef rice just to be different. Surprisingly, this turned out to be quite good! The brisket was tender and not stringy, and there was a perfect amount of fat. The curry itself was slightly spicy but not overpoweringly so, and there were also potatoes! Not enough Chinese places still serve potatoes with their curry.  

FSNH hasn't been open for too long, so it might take some time for everything to fall into place for them, but they've definitely got some tasty grub and nice service. If you want a cheap dinner with lots of variety, try it out! And for a full review with more pictures, check out my food blog, located in my profile. Cheers!
