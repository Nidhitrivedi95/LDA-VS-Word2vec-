Bp7Qj64Qr8jvj3r7WBtmSg horrible customer service. We ordered some food and told them dine in. I don't think they heard me because when I asked to sit down the waiter told me to sit by the window by the door. I was with my fiance. So we sat and waited and when our food was brought to us they had packed it up for take out. We told them it was dine in and the waiter looked at us and said "you know it's going to be more for table service." I felt so insulted and embarrassed. He said it in a way that would be a financial problem for us. I felt like he was trying to rush us out the restaurant even though there were some asian families having dinner in the restaurant. Maybe it was because I am Indian idk. Food was off. The soups were fine but we ordered noodles and they gave us a container of these dry uncooked noodles which we threw out. Maybe a bad day for them?
