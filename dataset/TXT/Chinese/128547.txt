These people where very friendly. Even helped me with my order. I showed up with my daughter and were greeted with a friendly smile. 

Stuff we ordered. Top being the most flavorful. 

Chives Dumpling (Shrimp & Pork)
Shumai (Shrimp & Pork)
Steamed BBQ Pork Bun
Shrimp Dumpling

Wish it was closer but will definitely be back. Smaller Sized Dumpling then what you get in San Franciscos China Town however still very tasty and probably cleaner place too.
