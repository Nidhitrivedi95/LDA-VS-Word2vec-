9gmBTYCBC0uM6uCJdwK2Bw After badminton, we were thinking to go to Tracey Desert and a friend mentioned that a same store is now open at commerce gate.  When you first walk in, you will think you went to the wrong place because it share the same entrance with a hotpot restaurant.  It seem to be inappropriate to have desert there while hotpot smell is all over the restaurant.  The atmosphere is just not right.  Once we sat there we waited for a long period for a waitress to come by to serve us.  Note that it was after 10:30pm and there's not many people in the restaurant.  The service was very slow and once we look at the menu, we realized this is a different restaurant that has the same Chinese name as Tracey Desert.  The registered English name is different.  We order different items off the menu.  I've order a drink with mango coconut and sago.  I waited well over 20mins for the drink.  The drink does not look like the picture in the menu.  I didn't see any diced mango in my drink but only sago, coconut juice and some mango juice mixed together.  I was very disappointed with the drink.  My friends have similar experience while they are there.  My friends (couple) didn't even get their order after 30mins.  The manager compensate by not charging their order.  I don't think I will go back again.  We all thought it was a new branch of Tracey Desert but in fact it is not.
