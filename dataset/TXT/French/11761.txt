4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've always wondered about this place every time I walk by and my friend recommended it, so we went. There is a ton of seating, inside and out. The waitress was very friendly and the food the to die for! The whole lunch menu looked so decadent- it was hard to pick something. The steak is some of the best steak I've ever had with a Marsala and herb butter. I don't care for steak and when I eat it I don't care for butter on it, but ooooh Lordy was it the best! Worth every penny! Fresh and delicious! Also the drinks that were pricey ($15 a piece) had a LOT of alcohol in them so you for your money's worth! Also, if you're a wine lover, there are a ton of choices of all prices!
