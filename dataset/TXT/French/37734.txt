-.5 stars for service, decor, and cash only (boo)

The inside lacks charm and it was far too hot for my bf and me to make use of their lovely garden out back. Also, our waitress was not the friendliest...a little reserved, but to her credit, still attentive.

Now, with the bad stuff out of the way we can focus on the incredible food!
We started with the potatoes with brie, mushrooms, and spinach. WOW. So rich and flavorful!

I had the roasted turkey flatbread for my meal. The turkey could have had a bit more flavor but the bread was delicious as was the cranberry mayo inside. Yum!

My bf got the salmon and raved about it.

Such a great stop for lunch, filling and satisfying!
