La Creperie offers both savory crepes and dessert crepes.  Although the savory crepes are nice once in awhile for me, I mainly like to order the dessert crepes from here.  The Nutella Crepe is my favorite at La Creperie, I wouldn't want to get any other crepe but if I had to choose another, I would order the Banana Foster's Crepe.  Lines get long during peak periods.  I like to come between lunch and dinner times when the lines move faster and the lines are not long at all.  Whatever you do, try the NUTELLA!!!...if you visit La Creperie.
