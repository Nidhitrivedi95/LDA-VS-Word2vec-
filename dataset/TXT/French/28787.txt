eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw What an amazing and pleasant experience!
It was my birthday so my wife reserved ahead... But she made an error to reserve the restaurant at 7:45AM instead of 7:45PM LoL!!! The manager was very kind and offered us a table despite being on busy Friday night!

We ordered the table d'hôte - great varieties of choices Btw! It's a 6 courses meal, soup/ 2 entrées/ sorbet to clean our tongue/ main course/ dessert, coffee or tea.

Lobster soup, shrimp and scallop, foie gras crème brûlée, smoked salmon salad, filer mignon, duck breast are the one we chose from the menu and it was yummmmmy!

We enjoyed every single dishes, everything were very top norch.

Service wise, please ask for Jason! He will take care of you. It's been awhile that I've received such A++ service from waiters. He did an incredible job.

I think their price is just right, not over priced at all. I really got a perfect meal, service and overall experience.

Not only I will go back, I'll also recommend my friends!!!
