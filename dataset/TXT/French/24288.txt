cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg This place, guys. This place. Quite possibly the best food i've ever had, and none of it was things I would usually order. Don't pick for yourself, just ask your server. They KNOW what genius they are serving and will take good care of you. We asked, and ended up getting something that wasn't even on the menu and was prepared table-side; a foie gras and mushroom risotto prepared in a parmesean cheese wheel. It was rich and delicious and enough food for 4 people! (not that we'd have shared....) 

We forgot to make our reservation before travelling to Montreal, so I was sure we wouldn't get in. They said they could fit us in at 11:30 pm. That's REALLY late for dinner, we thought, but when were we going to be in Montreal again? This and Joe Beef (which was closed for construction) were at the top of our list. So- we took the reservation. Just a warning- there are almost not bars on the street that this restaurant is on, so if you arrive early for your reservation planning on bar hopping, you'll be out of luck like we were. We ended up checking in an hour early, and they actually got us in by 10:45. The next hour was truly remarkable, and one of our best experiences in Montreal. 

(My *only* complaint was that the creme brulee was a bit charred, and the top was not warm. It was definitely prepared ahead of time and whoever fired the top was in a hurry. Totally understandable, and a very minor complaint, but at this level of Fantastic it's worth mentioning.)
