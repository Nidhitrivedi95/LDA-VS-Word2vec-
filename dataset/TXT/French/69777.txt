WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w I love breakfast at breakfast and breakfast at lunch. I ate here twice in the week I was visiting Montreal and had breakfast food both times. Delicious crepes, Belgian waffles with strawberries/whipped cream/almonds, potatoes, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. The lunch items I saw look great also. Large menu with so many tempting options. 

We got in without a reservation on weekdays with no issues.
