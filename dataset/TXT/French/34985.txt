HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Group of 9 guys for a bachelor party. Killed everything in site. Except for the fries. I swear it was like 3 potatoes worth of fries. Gotta watch them carb 'nah mean. 

Two Dozen Oysters
Two orders of Bone Marrow and Oxtail
Sauteed mushroom and sauteed spinach on the side

I ordered a Filet Mignon - fries on the side
I wanted it to be medium rare but they gave it to me medium. Should have spoken up louder. Either way I didn't want to be a punk and let a perfectly beautiful cut go to waste. I took it, ate it, and enjoyed it! Very tender and not too dry. 

We couldn't decide on what sauce to go with the steaks so they gave us all 3 in 3 separate pots to share.

After adding their sauces I was glad that it wasn't rare. The sauces dressed a very subtle flavor to compliment the meats natural flavor without over-powering it.

I also tried a bite of my friends lobster from his surf and turf combo. It tasted good but didn't stand on par to the steak.
