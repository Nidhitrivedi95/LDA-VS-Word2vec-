4WBj2ob4tEle1-4AZdB5pQ Great little hidden gem. Brought here by a French colleague for lunch so you know this is truely authentic. Food is awesome. Definitely recommend!

The only issue, not sure if it was just that day with some problem to their fan, the place was filled with smoke and we all stink the rest of the afternoon...
