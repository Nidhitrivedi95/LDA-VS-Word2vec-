10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA The brunch is one of the best, and most affordable in the city. You rarely have to wait for a table and the service is good. That makes Bivy a real gem in the often over-priced, over-hyped Toronto restaurant scene. 

Everything on the brunch menu is great but I would highlight the Croque, The Farcou (original version), the Tartiflette and the french toast. Their potato salad and green salads are always fresh and delicious. I'm told the coffee is excellent ( I'm a tea drinker - their selection is good).

I have sampled the dinner menu much less but the pulled pork sandwich is good - excellent flavour - and the frites are great. 

Excellent value, excellent food and a lovely atmosphere.
