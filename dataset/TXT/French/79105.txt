ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw I have too many good things to say about this place!

I was enticed by their menu of creative dishes and local themes. I was not disappointed. Union is located on the Ossington strip. Upon entering there is a casual bar area, followed by dining seating. The arrangement is intimate, casual, but not cramped. 

I started with a glass of wine. The one I wanted was not served by the bottle but my waiter was quick to check inside and see if there was a bottle open. There was! I appreciated they made the effort to look. There was five of us dining, and we shared the Charcuterie for appetizer. OMG yumminess. It consisted of two meat based spreadable loafs, both made in house. Then an assortment of sauces, and 2 scotch eggs. This was served with home made to-die-for break (my girls who love carbs, go here). For $16 this was a very fair sized appetizer that kept 5 of us happy.

For dinner I had the Tagliatelle.  It was fantastic, with wild mushrooms, hen, and a slightly creamy based sauce. Melt in your mouth fantastic taste. Amongst my friends, one had the cod ( I tried a little piece, it was perfectly creamy and soft), and one the Polenta with a side order of veggies. Can I just say, they provided a very large serving of side for only $6!

For dessert we shared a 'mess', which is a mixture of fresh creme, meringue and berries.

The service at the restaurant was friendly and attentive. Our waiter explained to us all the basic ingredients, such as sauces, bread, noodles are made in house. And they butcher their own meat in house, all sourced from local farms. Wow. I really love knowing where my food comes from.
