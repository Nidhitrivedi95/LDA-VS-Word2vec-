tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Wonderful evening!  The atmosphere,  service, food - all were outstanding.  I had salmon. My date had veal shank.  Everything was superb!  The veggies, mashed potatoes -   wonderful. And, the bread is amazing.  Frankie was our server. Job well done!

I am looking forward to returning for breakfast!
