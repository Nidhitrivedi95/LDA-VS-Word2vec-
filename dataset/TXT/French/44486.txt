ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw This afternoon marked my third visit to George's, and now I am certain that we won't be back.  The food has been consistently good each time, and the service, consistently awful.  Our visit began today with the hostess telling us we would have a few minutes wait.  When she finally led us into the dining room (only about half full), she brought us to a dirty table, then realized it was dirty and walked us back out of the dining room.  Even though there were so many other open tables.  Okay, mistakes happen.  They clear the table and we finally sit down.  The server greets us several minutes later, and we order coffee.  Several minutes later, it arrives.  Warm, not hot.  We order crepes to share.  Many minutes later, the crepes come.  They are good, but covered in what seems to be canned whipped cream (the ridges in the cream kind of give it away.  I could be wrong, but that was our perception).  Server returns, asks if we would like to order anything else.  We do, as well as order more coffee.  Then he clears the main plate, but not our sharing plates or dirty silver.  Coffee takes even longer to arrive this time and is cooler than before.  Second course seems to take eons.  Server never checks on us.  Eggs Benedict is good, not great, and the potatoes that accompany taste like they were made at 11 am and held on a buffet for 3 hours.  Getting the check takes forever, but by now I am not surprised.  George's has atmosphere, and very good (not great, food) but repeatedly absent service has finally turned me off for good.  There are too many other places in Charlotte that really appreciate the business.
