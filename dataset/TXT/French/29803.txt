FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw The Ritz and Toca management have done an excellent job at planning this fresh, innovative new Toronto restaurant. The layout is modern, but not overly trendy. The menu is distinctly Canadian, but not in your face ingredient wise. Service is very "grassroots" but knowledgeable and appears to truly enjoy their work. Servers have a range of knowledge, including expert knowledge regarding their unique cheese room and corresponding selection. The Sommelier had a strong background, but I would recommend a change in his clothing attire. A cheap suit doesn't convey class and management should point this out. That being said, he selected a beautiful wine for the evening and I think the wine list has potential. 

The menu consisted of a divine bone marrow infused crab meat starter. Although not as rich as  I would have thought, it was nicely presented and flavorful. The main was the lamb saddle, which was elegantly presented and full of succulent flavors. Highly recommended. A cheese selection was selected for the final course and really presented a tantalizing treat by the end of the meal. I suggest you have a guided tour through the cheese room prior to tasting.

The restaurant is not stuffy and the dress code could be considered business casual.

Good luck and enjoy Toca!
