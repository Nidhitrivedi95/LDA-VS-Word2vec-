XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Michelin Stars: 3 but I think the last year LV was Michelin rated was 2009. 

Let's start with the positive -- that ambience!

Seriously one of my favorite things about this place was the ambience. It's beautifully decorated inside and that adds to the experience overall. I had a couch seat next to the fireplace with lush purple velvet pillows. Damn I felt fancy. 

Service was good, almost great but not fantastic. The sommelier was a highlight though of the service; no problems there. As far as food, it was beautifully presented but is being out-done by others (Atelier Crenn comes to mind..). Quality of the dishes were magnificent but seemed a bit heavy on items with foie gras and gelatinous textures. A little more variety and balance could serve them well. 

Overall a tremendous experience. If you have the means and the fortitude (that bill was steep once you add the top level wine pairing - even for a 3-star), you should make the effort to go!
