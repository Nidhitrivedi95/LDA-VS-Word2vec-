We took a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas Thanksgiving morning and ended up hungry inside Paris and found Mon Ami Gabi as we were walking out of the hotel. Being dinner time and being hungry a steakhouse sounded perfect so we decided to eat here. At first I was a little put off by the size of the place because this place was GIANT!!! Experience has taught me a big restaurant does not equal good food, but after passing by a few peoples tables my mind was quickly changing. We decided sit outside as the evening was gorgeous. The view we had was AWESOME!!! We sat along the strip with a view of the Bellagio. The Bellagio fountains provided an amazing show that was most enjoyable during our dinner. We were sitting on the inside patio, maybe ten feet from the street, and only heard 1 police car while we were sitting there. It was very quiet considering a heavy flow of traffic going down the Blvd. Just more of the magic of Las Vegas I suppose but we were very comfortable out there.

I had the Filet Mignon with garlic spinach, my fiancee had the steak bordelaise with mashed potatoes. We had escargot as an appetizer, just because we were in Las Vegas. Not having any experience with escargot, I wasnt sure what to expect, certainly the emerald green color was a surprise. They were heavy on the butter and garlic which is always a good thing!!! The texture was similar tender calamari and reminded me of a seafood dish.

My fiancees steak was delicious as was mine. They were cooked to perfection and melted in our mouth. Our only MINOR gripe was the potatoes were a bit bland, no big deal. The rest of the food was so flavorful its probably the only reason we noticed. Our waiter was prompt and courteous as was his assistant. We had a great time Mon Ami Gabi!
