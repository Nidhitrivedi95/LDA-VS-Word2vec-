xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g What a great experience! We made a reservation and our table was ready when we arrived. The view was wonderful overseeing the Bellagio fountains.  The food was excellent and the service superb.  Could not have asked for a better dining experience. This is now one of our top dining spots in Vegas.  The only downside was that we had to pay a $50 per person deposit when the reservation was made.
