Xa8aadsVfrqocGA_rVzsdA Excellent food: fresh, flavorful and mostly local, but a level beneath a "top notch" dining experience.  We started with a seafood platter, and - being from Florida and Maine - we know seafood platters.  It was above average, but not "amazing.". I expect seafood platters to "wow" me.  It had four small but tasty oysters, 8 small and "ok" tasting shrimp, two delicious crab legs, an amazing rosette of smoked salmon (maybe the best I've had), and a somewhat tasty but too small half lobster tail.  This was certainly not in my top platter experiences, but it all tasted very fresh.  Strangely, we asked for a fish knife to cut the salmon and lobster, and were informed they didn't have any.  Instead, we had to use the unwieldy main course knives.  Being in a french province, I would have expected proper utensils.  

For main courses, my wife's bison filet was the winner of the night.  Medium rare, sweet and meaty, it was served over honey roasted baby vegetables.  The other side dish was potato chips served in a crock - strange, but they were out of the osso bucco which formed the other half of the dish.  I ordered the wild boar "ribs", which was like a rack of thick lamb chops - except it was boar...!  The meat was not as tender a I would have liked, but it had a real wild (but tasty) flavor.  I'm glad I tried it, as I don't get wild boar every day. However, it simply wasn't as good a choice as the bison.  The deserts were delicious, and provided a great end to the meal (along with a glass of ice wine).  Polite service and fresh food - overall, an above average dining experience for sure.
