xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Ok ill start this off with the only negative thing that you can say about this restaurant....THE PRICE. It's expensive but you should know that prior to coming. 

Upon exiting the elevator you enter what looks like the kitchen area and it smells amazing. You can see chefs (or people dressed up as chefs) walking around preparing food and other items. The seating area gives you an excellent view of the Caesars Palace front water area and the Bellagio dancing fountains. That back drop makes for an amazing dinning experience. 

We went with a larger group and they were very accommodating. Our serveur (waiter) was very nice to us and explained some of the stuff that was foreign without making us feel dumb. He provided us with a very nice champagne to help us toast a very special occasion. The desserts were over the top good and helped top off a great experience.
