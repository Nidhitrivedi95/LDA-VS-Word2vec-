aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw Finally a great time at  Le Papillon!  We have gone a couple of times before - usually every 4 or 5 months we try this place and I will say that every time we go it gets a little bit better.  But this last visit was by far the best.

We went for lunch on a Friday.  The service started out BRUTALLY slow, but once they took our drink orders it quickly improved.  I enjoyed the French onion soup  followed by the Tourtiere.   The portion was a great size and I left feeling sated.  My guest had the steak and frites.  Guessing by the clean plate, I'd say she enjoyed her meal as well.

I'll be going back more often
