VSPft3RUXDE8HnX6Anvbvg I have been to DNA once and I loved it, but we went treated so I didn't have to worry about the budget.  The wait staff were impeccable and extremely knowledgeable.  If you go you have to be prepared to be a bit adventurous - their specialty is French fusion and offal and so that is what you are going to get, not the place to take a vegetarian.  We had seafood and nut allergies at our table and those were easily accommodated.

Some memorable dishes were pasta-wrapped venison prosciutto things made to look like sushi, roasted duck breast, and a liquid cheesecake that was out of this world.  I, however, declined the head cheese amuse-bouche which was offered.  Too much for me.  

Go if your feeling brave and be prepared to stretch your imagination.  And yes, the decor is absolutely delightful - dress up!
