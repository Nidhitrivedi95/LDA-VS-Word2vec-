rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Great, relaxing brunch!

Food:
I was starving, so I ordered two meals: (1) French toast and (2) eggs, potatoes, and sausage.

All of the food was great, although the potatoes were a little too greasy for me!

The French toast, extremely rich, was just enough for me. I hurt myself eating the eggs, potatoes, and sausage.

I was more impressed with the French toast, since I think I can cook decent eggs, potatoes, and sausage on my own. The four stars is really for the french toast; good stuff!

Sides Notes

Ambiance:
If it's not super hot outside, I recommend you sit outside. The restaurant is situated by the pool; ambiance is impeccable.

Service:
The service was exceptional. Waiter was very patient and knowledgeable. Our waters were constantly refilled. The food came out reasonably quick.

Overall:
If you're looking for a relaxing brunch, I definitely recommend!
