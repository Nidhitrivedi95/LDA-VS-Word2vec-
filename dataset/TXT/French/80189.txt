Ordering is simple, if you get a burger you are handed a small paper with the various toppings offered. You write down your name and check off what toppings you want and then pay for your order. The wait is usually pretty fast (about 5-10 minutes) considering they're always very busy! 

I always eat at the park across the street since seating is tight and the restaurant gets really hot with all the bodies inside. 

The poutine was also good but a little too salty. Seriously, the burgers are all you need to fall in love with Patati Patata. 

The location is also great for a post or pre-drinks snack, with tons of bars within walking distance. Service is friendly. I'm not sure about parking since I always just uber or walk here.
