aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw While staying at the Venetian, no coffee maker in the room meant I had to do a coffee run every morning.  So glad I packed gym clothes!  I put them on every morning and ran downstairs to this bakery which is conveniently located a few steps away from the elevator.  Lots of other runners had the same idea too because there was always a long line and that made me grumpy.  Fortunately, this is a well oiled machine, and the line moved quickly.  Coffee and croissants from this little bakery brought me back to life every morning.  The blueberry croissant was good, but nothing beats a traditional one.  I also lusted after the ham and cheese one but forced myself to pass on it so I would still have an appetite for brunch/lunch.  Their coffee is also very good.  I drink it straight and black, so no way to hide bad brew.  I noticed they sell bags of coffee under their restaurant name, but I wonder who their source is--I'd like to get some directly from the source!
