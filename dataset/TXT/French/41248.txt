kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ This place is expensive. Your potential investment will probably result in sub-par food and management. 
We sat on the patio for brunch and ordered wine which arrived in filthy glasses. When the server changed out the glasses, the new ones arrived, still dirty. The people serving the food wore filthy aprons, a detail which made the cleanliness of the food questionable. Perhaps management might consider laundering aprons. 
The food arrived. In my case, a burger and fries. It was as though the kitchen forgot to season this impoverished burger and over compensated by charring the exterior attempting to mask an anemic, vaguely rotting taste. Needless to say The result was an assault to the palate. A terrible date that went sideways in the most confusing of ways. 
The musical choices choice- top 20  nineties hits Psuedo "hard music" that felt like more a staff statement rather than thoughtfully curated choices. On the other hand, the music was a perfect choice that for the jarring contrast between the lovely interior and terrible management and food. 
Here's the takeaway - at least for me.
1. Expensive 
2. Dirty
3. My food was gross

Don't go.
