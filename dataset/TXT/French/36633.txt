i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw This little gem is a must try!  I had been wanting to go there for quite some time.  I visited one day as I was in the area and it did not disappoint!  Right away you could tell that there were many regulars whom know Carlo the owner and come in for a treat very often.  I came in for lunch and it was moderately busy but they took care of me right away explaining the menu and  offering suggestions.  The owner was floating around and came by to talk to me and find out how everything was.  I had the Chicken Pesto sandwich which was delicious!  If you like authentic Italian, this is your place!  A hidden gem in Chandler!!!!
