pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg I can't remember the details of what we had (was wasted by the end), but we had the Prix Fixe with paired wines each time.

I felt that the value for the money was right on. Everything was made to perfection, and the wine pairings were creative. I especially liked the pear liqueur at the the end. My friend raved about it to the waiter, and was rewarded with a second pouring. That was the end of his sobriety.

The location is unusual, as it's right off the dated gaming floor, in the bowels of the Monte Carlo. BUT, walk in and you will be transported immediately to class and pampering.

I sent other people over there, and they too came away with the same impression: Fantastic experience. Sound value. Would do again.

Of course, there is a dress code....

"Our dress code is resort-evening casual. Jackets and ties are not required for gentlemen, however, jeans, jogging suites, shorts, tennis or sports-type shoes, T-shirts, tank-tops, etc., and any other inappropriately casual clothing is not acceptable. Similarly, ladies are expected to wear modest apparel. We do not set standards, just guidelines. We ask that, by your attire, you show respect for your fellow diners."
