eQ4Oj_kjrjVV0CfDcDWBmg A sweet buzzy little french restaurant with impeccable service and a very interesting menu. The food is excellent but rich, so eat lightly the rest of the day and come hungry!

The baguette is made in house (I think) and is too good. We normally don't fill up on bread first but the texture and taste were irresistible. 

We shared the duck croquettes which were milder tasting than most duck and paired with peaches and a light chive dressing. Then had fish (so can't speak to the meat dishes).  Both were perfectly cooked, one with a mushroom cream sauce and one with a crayfish tomato sauce. I had fun trying one you never see on Canadian menus - the prehistoric looking but sweet tasting John Dory fish. 

The couple beside us shared a substantial charcuterie board which also looked like it would make a great lunch option. 

Dessert was out of the question. But lots of others in this busy restaurant seem to be indulging and enjoying it.

Highly recommended.
