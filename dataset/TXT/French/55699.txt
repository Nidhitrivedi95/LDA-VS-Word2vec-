rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A wow.  had brunch here and at the society cafe, and there was no comparison between the two.  I had the oatmeal, friend had the jardiniere (which came with a really lovely pain au chocolat), and the fiance had the salmon baguette.  every single thing was a hit.  I am in love with the croissants, which remind me of hazy summer morning breakfasts in paris.  orange juice was fresh squeezed.  overall, my favorite brunch place ever.
