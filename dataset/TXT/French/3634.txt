1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g Delux has the whole french bistro dining thing down to a pat from food, decor to service. I'm not sure why I had been putting off a visit to this resto for some time now, most likely I was fearful of competing against the crowds that flock to this place nightly! 

Anyways I'm certainly glad I paid no mind to that recently managing a couple of visits in the past few months. This spot is located on the tail end of Ossington near Queen and carries an industrial chic decor inside with the flourescent bulb fixtures hanging overhead, white cement walls to the awesome alphabet art installation that is situated on one wall. Service is charming, attentive and professional, definitely none of that too cool for school attitude that I was worried about. 

I had the steak frites which was not as really well seasoned but it was tender to say the least-it's a flat iron cut which is not my favourite cut when I have steak in mind. The accompanying fries were knockouts, true bistro frites, crispy on the outside yet soft inside with the slightest trace of nutty peanut oil. On another visit I had the cubano which is truly an awesome sandwich, a tasty menage a trois between home baked bread, cheese and pork. Between expertly grilled bread there's molasses cured pork, ham, gruyere cheese, red onion, grainy mustard and cornichons-an explosion of sweet, sour and savory all in a few bites. 

There must be some good bakers out in the kitchen because the homebaked bread I had to start and the bread in the sandwich was soft, sweet and had a perfect crust. Desserts are good and in-house made here, the cuban coffee creme brulee is a real treat as is the seasonal strawberry rhubarb shortcake. Wine list has some unique ones quite a few from niagara region. 

Delux ranks up there with my favourite bistros in Toronto, it offers good value, great service and well executed food.
