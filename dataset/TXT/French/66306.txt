uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg OK, so the loong line.....first of all don't let that discourage you. If i had to wait 3 hours i would, because this place was AMAZING!!

Our table had the pork belly, Mac & Cheese and Cod fish. Then a delicious dessert to finish off. 

EVERYTHING WAS SOOO GOOD!! Seriously, the Pork belly was the most delicious and tender i have EVER tried. Mac & Cheese??!..BOOOM, amazing..Cod fish...ummm, HELLOOO AWESOME!!

The portions are incredible, and trust me you WILL finish it all. Not because its small but because you don't want to stop eating!

The staff, well our hostess was incredibly cool and funny and very understanding. She made the night even better by just talking with our table and making sure her clients were pleased.

IF YOU ARE IN MONTREAL THIS IS A MUST STOP!!!
