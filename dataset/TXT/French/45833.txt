mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q A continuation of our Vegas vacation included this restaurant.  It was a great relief from Yellowtail in Bellagio (you can read my review on that terrible experience).  But  regardless, L'Atleier is a MUST TRY in Vegas. It's located in the MGM grand and is probably one of the best dining experiences I've had.  My wife LOVED it so that was a great bonus on my part ;-)

The menu includes a 16 course tasting menu, a five course menu or a three course menu. Also on the menu are single entree's if that is more to your liking.  We had the three course menu and that was plenty enough food for us.  If we had bigger appetites and a bigger wallet the 16 course menu would be amazing...if I recall it was $159 per person.

Aside from the ill experienced, young, rude hostess ,the overall experience was amazing. She didn't seem to fit at at that restaurant because everyone else was so professional and she had no clue how to provide good service.  She made us wait til exactly 9:00 PM until we could be seated, how weird is that? 

All parties of two are seated at the bar in which you face an immaculate kitchen with the hustle and bustle of the chefs.  Service was great and every employee knew everything about the food.  A bottle of wine was on the pricey side ranging from $60-infinity but well worth it for the amazing food.  

I would highly recommend this place to anyone and my wife and I will definitely try the actual Joel Robuchon at our next visit.
