Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Before posting my review, I browsed through past reviews to assess whether my experience was an isolated one.   Apparently not.  I generally enjoyed the efficient service, cozy atmosphere (the coloured wires on the light fixtures don't work, sorry) and the food but OMG too salty.  In particular, the risotto was so salty that I could  not finish it.  Too bad....
