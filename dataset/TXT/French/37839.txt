jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA I wanted to like this place. It's Restaurant week in Vegas and I look for new places or hidden gems. What I found were streaky windows, no ambiance and no taste.  Ceasar salad was overdressed and warm. The calamari was overcooked and chewy. Steak and frites were cool not warm and just bland. The salmon was good flavor and temp but the sides a throw away. I poked fun at the dated plating style but that wasn't really bad. The chocolate soufflé was good texture but tasteless. The service asked how the entree was before either of us took a bite then only returned to clear. I debated a 3 rating but when you pay over $50 each for a dinner, I think it should be good- and this wasn't. Go follow DW to their new location at the Grammercy for flavor.
