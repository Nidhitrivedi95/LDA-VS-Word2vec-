Vegas is a place of many many food options, from the casual to the super expensive.  Of course, Le Cirque, is considered high end of the spectrum.  We were not planning to dine there so we were all very very casually dressed, which resulted in us being put in the worst table of the house, by the bar at the front door.  The service was expected for the caliber of restaurant but the food was very much below expectations.  The first course lobster bisque was way way too salty.  The risotto was good but not memorable and the salad was a salad, just made to look pretty.  The short ribs were tender but not fall off the bone.  The halibut was not fresh but frozen, with a wrapping around it that was soggy and not what was intended in terms of texture context between the flesh and the breading.  The salmon was over cooked and dry, tasted like something a beginner cook would make.  The desserts were okay.  The waiter I remember was quite rude about the souffle.  The best part of a souffle is to break it yourself and pour in the cream/good stuff but the waiter did that for me without even asking.  The conversation with the waiter was douchy at best, felt like talking to cartoon character of what a waiter is supposed to be.  Back to the desserts. The lemon bomb's presentation was cool; it came in a bowl that was made out of ice, but the taste was too tart and didn't have a sweet balance to it.  The third dessert I think was chocolate but I don't remember.  Yes, people, unfortunately, this memories of this restaurant are all negative. The money would have been better spent else where I'm afraid.
