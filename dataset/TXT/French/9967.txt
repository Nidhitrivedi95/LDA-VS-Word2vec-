4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have been interested in dining at Mon Ami Gabe for a very long time and found it a perfect opportunity on my hubby's day off. 

The wait list for the patio is a very efficient process and doesn't take long at all. We came at 1030 am on a Sunday.

We were seated in a perfect little spot, staring out towards the Bellagio fountains. The sun was warm and the air was chilly. Just perfect. The service was just awesome. Our servers came to chat us up, and all our requests were tended to quickly.

I got a bacon, egg and cheese crepe. Needed more bacon but it had the most delectable cream sauce.  Hubby had a croissant breakfast sammy to which he added bacon. Now that was a huge, delicious sammy!! The bacon was thick cut and tasty. We also got a side of potatoes which were yummy as well.

Overall, we had a very pleasant experience here and would definitely return..
