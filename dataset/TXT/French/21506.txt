Bc3V5_JEgIDV6ONo2Hcwmg Tasty French cuisine in the middle of HoMa is a definite surprise. For those who live in the neighborhood and like a treat every now and then, Le Valois is a very nice restaurant. The tasteful decor makes the place feel very inviting even when there are few patrons. The wine list is well curated, and the food is always excellent. Though I've usually had excellent service, there has been a time or two when I thought the service wasn't well managed to my liking. But as a whole, the experience is always memorable, and I recommend Le Valois to anyone in the want of fine dining.

As a side note: for those that are vegetarian, there are a few options to choose out of that are just as delicious as any thing else on the menu.
