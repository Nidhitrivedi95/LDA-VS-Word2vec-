P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ My friend and I visited this place around Saint Patrick's Day. We were both extremely impressed with the quality of food and service. Personally, this has been my finest dining experience yet.

We had high expectations for this place because we knew that Guy Savoy was a Michelin star chef. I have to say I was not disappointed at all.

We were greeted by a very friendly staff. They took care of our personal belongings and explained the menu to us in great detail. The service was friendly but professional at the same time. We were seated next to a huge glass window so the view was nice as well.

The food was nothing but amazing. My friend went for the sea bass. The skin was crispy and delicious. The fish still had its scales on but they were very crispy and light. (They almost had the texture of rice Krispies) The fish was flaky and soft and the sauce was sweet and savory. I opted for the special of the day which was a combination of lobster and waygu beef. The lobster was cooked perfectly. The beef was cooked perfectly as well. It was a perfect medium rare, and it melted like butter. Everything was perfectly seasoned and made to perfection. The side dishes and the breads were delicious as well.

I would definitely recommend this place to those looking for a fine dining experience. Yes the prices are high but what can you expect? It's worth every penny.
