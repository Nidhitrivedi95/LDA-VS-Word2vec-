4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had a party of 17 for dinner and the servers were fantastic, and food was great. 

The standout dishes was the bone in rib eye, the filet, roasted bass fish special.  The scallop gratinees and salmon tartare was also fantastic. The only disappointment was the tomahawk pork chop which was dry and not tasty. 

We had one child, and the kids plate was adorable with a good balance of chicken, fries, and veggies.
