SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw If you want to escape the burgers and beer for a night, choose Sardine!  Lovely food expertly prepared.  Complex dishes prepared consistently well.  Also, a good wine list and creative cocktail menu.  A trendy-free zone, also.  So many Madison restaurants are self-consciously trying too hard to be fashionable. At Sardine, the ambience, service and menu are not about being hip, but about being excellent.  Beautiful converted factory space with gorgeous natural wood.
