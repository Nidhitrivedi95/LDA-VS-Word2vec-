It's pretty decent. I guess its not too bad at the Winterlicious lunch  price ($28), but I'd feel a little unhappy if I paid the Winterlicious dinner price (or the full price). I'd say this was my least favorite "icious" meal to date (that being said, I usually am pretty selective with the places where I go for the "icious" meals).

Appetizer: Pâté de Campagne, which is basically pate & bread. I did like the pate in this dish.   The bread was nothing special. My wife ordered the salad which looked (and tasted) very mediocre, so I'd recommend avoiding.

Main: we both ordered the beef cheek. This was probably my favorite course. The beef was cooked well... it was quite juicy. Also, its a fairly generous portion. There wasn't much else on the plate though... a few greens  if I recall correctly. 

Dessert: these  were  a bit of a let down, especially considering that this is a French restaurant. Ordered the "Vacherin aux Grenade", which consists of meringue and pomigranate. It was fairly ordinary tbh. Wife ordered the "Gâteaux aux Amandes" (almond and apple cake), which was pretty good... the cake was moist. I think it would have been better with a bit more ice cream on the side. 

Service is friendly, but I think they were a little understaffed. It was a full house at lunch, maybe because of winterlicious.
