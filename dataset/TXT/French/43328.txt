LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw READ ABOUT WHAT THIS PLACE IS BEFORE GOING.  Yes it is fully staffed by formerly incarcerated adults training for careers in the hospitality industry.  Don't expect picture perfect and polished servers.  But knowing this while going there makes it all the more enjoyable.  

The food was absolutely fantastic.  I got the Horseradish encrusted salmon with cucumbers & cream. Looking forward to going again and trying something else although I'd definitely get that again.

Ambiance of the place was great, small and intimate.  The founder, Brandon Chrostowski, was there, welcomed us immediately and was helping to bus tables and actively coaching everyone during dinner service.  Can't wait to go again!
