4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Nice little French restaurant in Vegas. Ordered the steak and it was good. Nothing I can complain about except that it was really dark inside. I do remember that the bread and butter served here was amazing. If you're looking for a nice little romantic restaurant with some ambience, this is the place to go.
