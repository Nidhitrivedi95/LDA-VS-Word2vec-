eUjDWzbQ6eLZy0uELEOa9Q Perhaps I'm being nice, but there was just nothing wrong with our evening here. It was our Christmas dinner, if you will, prior to the barrage of family things, so we were already in a great mood. Our server, Chris, was very knowledgeable and a whole lot of fun. The food was amazing. Having just come from a quick stop at Soma, we skipped appetisers and went straight to the steak. The rib-eyes (we both ordered them) were perfect and the sides were awesome. I am, I must say, a sucker for beets. I had the sorbet trio for dessert and my wife went with the Brie. Truly delightful. 

What I loved as much as the food was the decor. I love the Distillery District for its architecture and design. The Boiler House does not disappoint at all. The ambience was spectacular and not too loud. The flamenco guitarist was quite good and just made the while atmosphere relaxes. I particularly enjoyed his rendition of 'We Wish You a Merry Christmas.' 

It was by no means an inexpensive evening, but for a special night out, the Boiler House is a great place to choose. Just dress warmly for the walk back to the subway.
