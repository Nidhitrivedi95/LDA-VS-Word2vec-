Like a little Italian bistro in a corner space, this Chinese run restaurant was quite authentic to European cuisine, without making dishes fusion, or Hong Kong style. Definitely won points there!

The space is quite small, with only about 5-6 tables, but the decor was very modern and similar to a cafe in Europe. With an open kitchen and wine for days, this is definitely a nice change of scenery compared to the other restaurants in the plaza. With jazz playing in the background, it creates a comfortable environment and vibe to sit and eat your lunch, and slow down your hectic day. 

With a simple lunch menu, with about 5 pastas and a couple of mains, it is definitely a nice array of choices without being overwhelming. We went for the Italian Sausage Pasta and tthe Beef Stew. Both were quite delicious, with good flavours coming through. Portions were rather small, but I assume that was because it was from the lunch menu. 

Service was quite good, as the restaurant is quite small. With 1-2 servers and 1 chef, everything is done small-scale, but works for them. 

They definitely had some dishes and desserts I may wanna try another time, so I guess I would come back some time! Give it a try!
