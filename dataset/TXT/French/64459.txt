tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg After the 1st experience we had with the hostesses and my review, management reached out and apologized and asked to give them another chance as this is not how their customer service usually is. So we went back today and it was a total 360 degree difference. The food and service was outstanding and we will return the next time we are in the mood for the brioche french toast and monte benedict.  Best eggs benedict around.
