K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q We came here with the intention of having a fancy dinner in Pittsburgh, and the Twisted Frenchman did not disappoint. We had the 8 course tasting menu. We're not big wine drinkers, so we passed on the wine pairings. I had few a cocktails, and my significant other drank a couple of beers.

Coming in, we had heard rave reviews of this place, and it met expectations. So why only 4 stars, I'm grading on a curve. With high expectations going in, the Twisted Frenchman would have needed to be an experience, an event, a truly spectacular extravaganza to warrant 5 stars. It was a fun time for sure, but it did fall short of a 5, but not by much.

With the 8 course meal, you do not know what you will be eating. It is all a surprise which was actually something we liked. Your server asks you if you have any dietary restrictions to ensure what they make for you will not conflict with what you are about to dine on.

Each dish that came out was delicious. Some were better than others, but overall we thought the meal was very good. I think my only concern is that my salmon came out with a piece of hair in it. We sent it back, the remade it and profusely apologized. It was a long piece of black hair and very apparent it was not mine nor my dining partner's. This didn't kill the meal for us, but it was not expected either. No biggie though. 

Service was decent. They were very attentive and catered to us. There were times that lingered where we needed refills, but he caught on that he needed to visit our table a bit more often which he did during the middle and end of the meal once it was addressed.

That said, the Twisted Frenchman did deliver a delicious meal. If you're looking for a high-end date night dinner, you should check out this fun French-fusion restaurant and expect to be here for at least 3 hours.
