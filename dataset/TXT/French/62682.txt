SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I really like this place for lunch or dinner.  The outside bar is awesome.  I call it my special occasion spot...for anniversaries, birthday's etc.  It's different in that you'll see anywhere from corporate execs to professors to those who decided to travel from outside their north Scottsdale suburbs.  I used to live about 2 miles north and now the only thing I regret is not having gone there more frequently.  For lunch, try their iced tea...very refreshing.  Sandwiches and salads are tasty.  Any dinner entree (especially beef) is sure to please.  My out of town friends were surely impressed!
