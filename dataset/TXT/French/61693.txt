sMAgnsqi-eY9LlywVC85Hg Great service super friendly and spoke 4 languages.  The decor is super cute makes you feel at home.  
  The French food was great.  I had the rack of lamb and french onion soup.  The lamb was super tender and served a perfect MR.  The lamb also had a super tasty mustard sauce on it that gave it a nice kick.  The soup was great with a ton of cheese.  Dessert was creme brule with fruit very tasty. 
  Wine list is impressive however had too many $$$$$$ wine and not enough choice on more cost friendly wine (50$-100$) range.  Most bottles were 150+.  Would have liked some by the glass tasting options to try too.
