Decadent, heavy, unapologetic about that. French.

Not a big fan of the paper table cloth though that makes it easy for them to serve bread without a plate right on the paper. I guess that's rustic, old world charm?

The service was 4 1/2 stars. Waiter was very nice and sommelier very helpful.

i had the Confît de Canard: crispy duck leg confît with Lyonnaise potatoes & whole grain mustard sauce. good  4 out of 5 stars.

Braised beef short rib special. 3.75 stars out of 5.

Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard served with toasted baguette 4 stars out of 5

To be honest, French isn't my go-to but I was with some friends who love this place. I wasn't blown over because the food while being good is not a meal I will remember. But I think that's my personal taste.
