3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ My boo and I were about to leave because we waited to be seated for 10 minutes and no one had approached us until finally Danielle a waitress greeted and seated us. Then afterwards she took our order and took care of us. Poor thing was every where doing everything in the kitchen to on the floor. She is amazing and so sweet. 5 stars to Danielle but 4 stars because of the wait
