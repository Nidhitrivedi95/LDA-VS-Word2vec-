Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Had a wonderful meal here celebrating my husband's birthday.  We both had the 7 course tasting menu.  The service was excellent, as our waiter was very knowledgable about the food and the various dishes.  It was a 3 hour dining experience and highly memorable.  The waiters even offered to give the women in the restaruant a wrap to keep them warm in case they're cold.  The bathrooms are very dark with a view of the strip.  Definitely will come back in the future.
