z6ZPIpO_1Rx69k9y2DQ7Bw Friendly service and nice atmosphere.  Those are about the only compliments that I can give this place.  I ordered a Croque Monsieur (warm sandwich) and a side salad, while my wife had the eggs benedict and my son had french toast with blueberries. 

My Croque Monsieur was not a traditional Croque Monsieur - very little sauce, way too much ham, very disappointing.  My wife's eggs benedict had two small eggs that were folded over and they were not poached properly - they were not runny at all.  We paid $5 for one piece of french toast and about 8 blueberries for my son - way overpriced for what we got, and the syrup was closer to corn syrup than anything else.

The only saving grace is that everyone checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything and everyone was friendly. However, they need much more direction for ordering.   I got my sandwich immediately and my wife and son had to wait for 10 minutes or so before receiving their food.  I don't like that the food was served at separate times.  There were also two lines and confusing signs, so ordering wasn't intuitive.  

Also, the Americanized "French" food only seemed to be French in the name, but not in the execution.  Do not go here if you are expecting actual French food.  This place does to French food what Olive Garden did to Italian food, but at least with Olive Garden ordering is not confusing and you get your food at the same time.  

I won't be back.
