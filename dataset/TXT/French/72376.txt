XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q One of two of the best restaurants in Vegas. My BF and I love the 16 course tasting menu. We do not get wine pairing, instead we order a reasonably priced bottle from the list and a cocktail to start, and that's enough. We will never tire of this restaurant. The service is unmatched. The food is the best french food in Las Vegas. And even though it is French, it just seems like super cool food. Nothing beats this place!
