w1BbvLeKBSKBnlALLhPmGg A charming, awesome hotel! Its a bit far from the centre of town, but the area is quaint, quiet, and perfect for foodies as theres loads of good restaurants nearby.
Just be aware that a cab from the airport will set you back quite a bit (going from one end of Edinburgh to the other). But there's a bus that goes to Princes Street almost right from the doorstep.
My room was clean, spacious, quiet. The bed was luxurious, the bathroom decent. Its clearly not extremely modern or the most luxurious rooms, but they're comfortable and welcoming after a long day out.
Would definitely happily stay again!
