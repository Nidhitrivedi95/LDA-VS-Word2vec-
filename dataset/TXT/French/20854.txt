AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Pricey but hey it's Payard located at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  Enough said. Tried only the ham and cheese quiche and hot tea. Good enough...need to try their pastries. The pistachio eclair looks good.

I can only give it 3 stars for now since I've only tried 1 item plus hot tea (which was fine)....and they gave me two tea bags!

Staff was polite.
