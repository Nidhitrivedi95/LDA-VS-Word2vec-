klzCMxmhrHWZeNseS4GKFg A new find for me - and what a find it is.  Great French cuisine - at surprisingly affordable prices.   Just had a very tasty meal: a piece of smoked haddock, topped with a poached egg & wilted spinach, served with a side of beans, broccoli and potato dauphinoise.  It was superb. 

They've also got a selection of more café type desserts (key lime pie, coffee creme brûlée, cheese cake, croissant) and a little coffee corner - which I've yet to explore
