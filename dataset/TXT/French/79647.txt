zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw This can be best described as French/Vietnamese fusion heaven. I've been a customer here for ages. Merci is one of those gems that are underrated. I have sampled everything on the menu and there isn't one thing I've yet to not like. I have eaten at Michelin star rated restaraunts before who haven't put out plates as delicious as the ones Merci puts out. The owners are amazing and the employees always have amazing things to say about how they are treated. The husband/executive chef will come out and greet people during the course of their mean or after which shows he's proud of the delicacies he has created. You can tell family and pride and humbleness are big with him. I could literally go on and on about Merci so I'm going to cut this short. Food is beyond amazing. Atmosphere friendly,cozy and enjoyable. Service is phenomenal. And I love all the high fashion art work here.
