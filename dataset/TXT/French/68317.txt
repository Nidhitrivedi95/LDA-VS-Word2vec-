vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I really like this place. I've been here three times. 

The food is wonderful and so is the service. The menu is pretty straight forward and nothing is too complex or crazy. It's just regular food done really really really well. 

This is one of my top 3 places to eat in Pittsburgh.

Only comment would be that I actually liked their Regent Square location a bit more than the Oakland one. Felt more cozy.
