Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng Le Gourmand is a nice spot for a fresh pastry and cup of coffee. They have a selection of 12 of so pastries, as well as a full compliment of coffee options.

At times the line up gets rather long, yet this tends to move quickly. There is an adequate amount of seating, so not a bad spot for a work meeting or coffee with friends.
