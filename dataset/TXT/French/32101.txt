gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA My first formal dinner with my gf. I received the rec from 'hounds at Chowhound. I must say, eventhough it's a little drive away from the strip, it was the fanciest dinner I've had and well worth it. 
The entrance is VIP style where a "doorman" asks you if you're going to the restaurant or the club (Ghostbar I believe?) via an elevator ride up to the restaurant. We had dinner here in August of '05, and it was a bit empty at the time of arrival (which I didn' mind) - right before sunset, I wanted my gf to see the view of the city. The view of the city from our table was spectacular. 

Appetizer - Pan Seared Diver Scallops. I think it must've been the freshest scallops I've ever had. I normally end up with salty, tough scallops at other places. These were seasoned just right with the mixture of cheese and bacon. The mixture of ingredients didn't make it salty at all, but fused together beautifully with so much flavor. Texturewise, the scallops were firm, not tough, and melted in my mouth. Score!

Entrees - Green Peppercorn Crusted Filet Mignon (myself) and Grilled Prime New York Strip Steak (gf). We both ordered them rare. The steaks were both flavored just right and the portions were quite good for a fancy restaurant like this. We both ended up sharing each others steaks. 

Dessert - Compliments of the chef!! They were home made chocolates and my gf ended up taking all of them. :)

Service - Since walking in, we were treated like royalty. The staff was super attentive, but not overbearing. Anything and everything we needed or wanted came without hesitation.

I believe dinner was around $200 something with tip (no wine). Well worth it. I would suggest a window seat and earlier in the evening during the week for a really romantic dinner. I recently looked on their website and now they have a tasting menu. The next time the gf and I come to Sin City, we will surely be back.
