Have to admit I shuddered when I heard catfish because it can get fishy if not prepared right, but this was so delicate and mild I wish I had more on the plate! The shallot soubise it came with was so good I wanted to lick the plate...The preserved peach with elderflower jelly had the perfect balance between sweet and tart. This was the splurge meal of my visit and did not disappoint. Servers were very knowledgeable and patient about explaining the dishes and answering questions.
