UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw It was the perfect last-minute plan: Post-theatre cocktails at Cluny. 

I was immediately mesmerized by the decor--modern brick walls with Louis XIV-esque mirrors and couches, juxtapozed with the beautifully decorated floor tiles that reminded me of the most ornate Azulejos one would only find in Portugal. I was indeed transported to France, to the Marais, and for a brief moment--I was in heaven.  From an aesthetic point of view, Cluny takes the cake. 

We decided to sit at the bar and order a round of cocktails. I went ahead with the Guillotine ($14) and subsequently discovered that bourbon with an egg-white foam is not my thing. Too bad. The Moulin Vert, however, was great. How can you go wrong with Citadelle Gin, Curacao d'Orange, St. Germain, Muddled Kiwi, and citrus? You can't. 

We also had three small plates: The ginger-chili fried frog's legs ($15), Crisp Frites ($8), and Table Side Wellington County Beef Tartar ($13). It was then that I realized that Cluny is just La Societe but in the distillery district: over-priced French fare with just a little bit better than average food. Good frites though. 

Update: I have been here another  two times since my initial visit for cocktails and some bar snacks, and I found that with the bartenders also playing the role of waiters in the bar area, this just doesn't work; it creates confusion and made for some very bad service at times. Frites are still winning though.
