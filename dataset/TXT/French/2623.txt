0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g My partner and I came here for our anniversary and left disappointed. Other than the oysters (which were spectacular), all the food was fine - not great or memorable in any way. We expected a lot more for the astronomical price, and from a 2 star Michelin restaurant. The service was also not as good as one would expect at a place that nice; at one point my partner had to wait almost twenty minutes for a cocktail. I will say that the ambience was lovely: we were seated outside with a great view of the fountains, which was definitely the best part of the whole experience. Overall, though, we did not enjoy the trip as much as we had hoped for such a special outing, and especially given the price point and accolades. We would not return.
