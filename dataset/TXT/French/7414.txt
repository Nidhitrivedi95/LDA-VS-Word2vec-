4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Best breakfast we had in Vegas. Waitress was great suggested a few items and we loved it all. Crepes, pancakes, best bacon. Started with a build your own Bloody Mary. We waited a few extra minutes to sit outside. Worth it. People watching at its best. We were not rushed even though the line was out the door. Will absolutely make this a stop on each visit.
