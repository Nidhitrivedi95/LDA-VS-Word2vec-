OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA We've been to Honey Cakes a bunch of times. The food was always good to great and the service, while inconsistent was friendly and not bad. Today everything was way off the mark. I ordered scrambled eggs with sausage and fruit, iced tea and for myself their MOZZARELLA and tomato salad. Also a cinnamon roll to share. Cinnamon roll and tea come out right away.  15-20 minutes later, nothing else. There was one other table of diners. I saw the plate of eggs and sausage sitting on the counter under a warming light, fruit and salad nowhere in sight. I asked the girl if I could take the eggs and she could bring the fruit and salad when it was ready. My husband was completely finished and still no fruit or salad. I walked up again to find her starting a salad. It was a bowl of romaine lettuce with a few small pieces of tomato and cheese that clearly was not mozzarella. I asked if it were my salad and she cheerfully nodded. By this time I had given up hope of a positive experience and just asked for what she had made. I did say, "you know that's not mozzarella, right?" And she looked very confused. It's gonna be a while before we go back.
