XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Hands down one of the best meals I have ever eaten in my lifetime.  Kudos, standing ovation to the chef of the century Joel Robuchon.  Please try this restaurant at least once in your lifetime.  It should be anointed as the temple of culinary greatness.  First of all, the room is spectacular...every piece of furniture has this pleasant light purple color and the room is spectacular.  The service is top-notch and starts when you enter the restaurant till you exit the restaurant.  It is run like a well-oiled machine; every server, manager knows their task and does it to clockwork perfection.  In terms of the food...i don't know where to start..first the carts of food are amazing...the most extensive bread cart I have ever experienced in the states (of course 3 star michelin restaurants in paris have this)...over 20 types of different breads to choose from...The butter which is scooped off with a spoon is so soft and fluffy.  I chose the four course tasting menu that was diving..the highlight of the night was the signature lobster dumpling with truffles..the lobster was cooked to perfection and the bite on the lobster was crispy and the flavors were dazzling.  Each dish is a work of art in terms of presentation.  Please save room for Robuchon's signature creamy potato..although they only give you a spoonful..it is one of the richest, smoothest, and creamiest potatoes you will ever have.  This place even has A TEA CART..i got fresh lemon verbena tea leaves cut from a plant that was on the cart!  The dessert cart is amazing...i felt like charlie in the chocolate factory.  Overall a 3-4 hour experience that I want to live over and over again like groundhog's day.  Highly recommended and I would give 10 stars if I were allowed!! Perfection that's all I can say!
