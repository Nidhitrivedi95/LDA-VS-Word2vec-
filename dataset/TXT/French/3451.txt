1idRJwqXxxmgSyQRKag4KQ Let me start by agreeing with everyone about the atmosphere and service! Surprising in a few ways..fine dining in a very residential neighbourhood, staff that were not at all stuffy and quite knowledgeable and tables spaced out enough to work equally well for dates, or get togethers with old/dear friends. 

The charcuterie platter was incredible with foie gras that made us save a piece so that it was the last bite we had of that dish. The pork belly was pretty incredible too. The proscuitto was a little on the dry side but everything else was so good we didn't care. 

The market fish was good and served with polenta. Not incredible, but good. 

The braised beef was very tasty but the best part of that dish was whatever pureed goodness they served the mushrooms and artichokes on top of. That made me want to revert to my nonna's kitchen, grab some bread and mop up every last drop. 

While we were very tempted by the souffle, we are cheese lovers and the french cheese platter was calling to us. We were not disappointed by our choice. Generous portions with a good variety and all quite wonderful. 

Portion sizes are offered..we chose small for the appetizer and large for the entrees. That worked for us. That said, I think we both agreed that we might just go for the large charcuterie platter and cheese next time because they were our favourite parts of the meal..and some pretty amazing Stratus wine too!

Parking is tough so leave enough time to find parking in the neighbourhood if you are driving. 

All in all, we will go back!
