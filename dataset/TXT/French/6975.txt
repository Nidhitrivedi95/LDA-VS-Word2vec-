4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We came here for dinner. I would give them 2-stars, but they gave us a comp cream puff with lit candle in place to celebrate our friend's birthday. So, that was really sweet of them. Also, their service rocked. So no 2-stars, instead 3-stars.

Their food is definitely let's-serve-"french food"-to-these-tourists sort of food. Although, they serve some fresh and warm french baguettes to start. (The comp bread is nicely paired with butter and pickled carrots. Yumsizzles.)

The steak that they're so well-known for are fillets... FILLETS. That means the meat isn't succulent and is rather how do you say.. super dry. Also they're really expensive at $25 or more a pop. My friend got the steak with bernaise sauce ($25).

The french onion soup was passable. I can make better. It was on the salty side. ($9)

The scallops with butternut squash and brussel sprouts were imbalanced, both far too sweet and far too bitter. They were supposed to complement each other, but in my opinion, just didn't work.

The french fries here are ninja-cut crazy fries, more like a hybrid between a chip and a fry. They're thin, messy, and far too crispy. You may like it, but I did not enjoy them since I was expecting french fries. They are paired with each steak course.

All in all, pretty mediocre food for the price tag. I'd head elsewhere. After all Vegas is a mecca of good eats.
