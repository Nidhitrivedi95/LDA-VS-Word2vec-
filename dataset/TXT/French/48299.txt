O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg Decided to come here for Summerlicious '17 and came at 11am for their cafe area. The place was full by 12pm so reservations are recommended if you want a guaranteed seat. We chose a seat that faced the open window so we had a good view of the street outside. 

To start, I ordered the tealicious. It's a non-alcohlic drink of a combination of infused teas. I enjoyed it! A refreshing drink to start the day. 

I ordered the blue crab salad as an appetizer. I can't say that I enjoyed it all that much. I'm usually a fan of seafood, crab being no exception, but the taste of the crab salad just left a weird taste in my mouth. It was definitely 'crabby', if you will, but the combination was too much in my opinion.

For my main, I had the Cerviche rice bowl. It was a mix of mainly rice, tuna, avocado, walnuts, mixed with some type of vinaigrette sauce. The sauce itself seemed a bit strong and left an aftertaste in my mouth. Paired with the salty tuna, it just wasn't a favourable combination for me. 

Lastly, I chose the Gotham cheese plate as a dessert. I love my cheese so this was the best part of the meal. It was drizzled with some syrup and walnuts. Loved it! 

Overall, the atmosphere of sassafraz is great. Nice open windows to help with a hot summer's day and a cafe style feel. The food, however, I didn't love. I can only speak for the dishes i ordered this time around though since it was my first time here. I may come back to try other dishes!
