jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Went for brunch and were greeted by a friendly server and hostess. We started with the escargots that went well with the fresh French bread. Ordered the steak frites which was beyond small even for a lunch portion. Waiter said it should be at least 5oz. I imagine it was no more than 4oz...4 slices of steak?! Thought the flavor was good, but I've never seen a restaurant serve anything that small, not even a filet. I had the mussels. The flavor was good but menu read "served with tomato, parsley, garlic, etc" and they came out in a saffron cream sauce. When the server insists there are tomatoes in the sauce and can't understand that's not the point - the menu doesn't mention CREAM...the description needs to be rewritten. The food tastes fine but the execution and menu need more attention.
