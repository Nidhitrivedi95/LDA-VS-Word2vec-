Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ After yelping this restaurant and seeing several glowing reviews, I decided to commit and gave it a shot.  And how glad I am that I did.  The complimentary popovers, of which they had quite a variety, were very tasty.  I asked for two...:-)  For my main, I ordered the shrimp BLT.  The sandwich was very good.  It was not simply a "shrimp" sandwich.  It's better described as a jumbo prawn, super BLT!  The dressing on the sandwich was very flavorful and the portion substantial.  The bacon component of this BLT was actually crispy prosciutto.  Overall, it was a good dish.  The service was first class and the decor elegant.  I recommend this restaurant for lunch or brunch.
