ChwyMZi_eZlMfL9qpXH_zw It's a bit of a disappointment coming here this morning. The crepes were really that fresh, and I saw the kitchen staff using the microwave. I ordered their crepe normande which is caramelized apples with salted caramel and almonds. But instead I was served mixed fruit with caramel and almonds. I could've and should've asked why my order changed, but I couldn't hassle with it. 

Unfortunately we won't be back.
