rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I have gone to several of these restaurants to include the one around the corner from my job in Rockefeller Center. 
We were seated right away and sat outside by the beautiful pool. The eggs and croissants were marvelous and we even took a few to go back to NY.
The wait staff was fabulous and enjoyed the food, ambiance and the hotel picked up the tab. You can't beat that!!!!
