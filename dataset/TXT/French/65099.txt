TmWz4ZvsNgXj_VMPw6G21w Been twice. First time there was no salt and pretty tasteless food. Lots of fancy sounding dishes.
Second time there was a massive overdose of salt in the starter. Two fish dishes and even the duck were pretty tasteless. Fairly expensive and with a chef who doesn't know how to produce a tasty sauce. two courses and lower price bottle of wine for 3 : £120
Forget it.
