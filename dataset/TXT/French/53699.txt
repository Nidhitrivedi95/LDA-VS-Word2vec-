qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw I have to agree with Jen C that the light show is out of place for this restaurant or maybe the Wynn itself. Seems more fitting for Universal Studios and not the Wynn's first rate persona.

Getting back to Boulud, we had a very good dinner here. Would be nice if they enforced their dress code alittle but non-the-less it was enjoyable.

My wife started out with 6 oysters (3 and 3 East/West) and I had the Steak Tartare. Both were very good.

Our entrees were Duck Conti (nice crispy skin and moist inside) and the Pan-Seared Tuna Steak. Again very good.

Service was also very good and professional.

The 4 is because though the meal was very good, it didn't WOW us and the annoying (to us) light show. Just glad we weren't seated on the patio.
