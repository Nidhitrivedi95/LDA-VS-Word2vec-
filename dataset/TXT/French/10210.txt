4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi, I hyped you up way too much in my head. I almost feel guilty giving you three stars as fellow Yelpers below seemed to have had an amazing experience here. 

First off, our waiter was super rude! I guess since we came as a party of 6 and gratuity was included in the bill maybe he felt he didn't need to provide top notch service to us. Our water was refilled once, he seemed upset having to make two separate trips back for napkins and extra bread and he even gave us the bill before we looked at the dessert menu...in fact, if it wasn't for the service we received, I probably would have bumped it up to 4 stars...

Now onto the meal, I ended up ordering the filet mignon merlot $37, a seafood starter platter $55 which included a lobster, salmon tartare, shrimp cocktail (4) and fresh oysters (4) as well as two orders of escargot. Now the escargot wasn't bad, however it seemed we had more olive oil than actual pesto in it. The filet mignon was cooked almost perfectly but the fries it came with I could've done without. The seafood platter was the winner, the lobster and oysters were very fresh, the shrimp was good but the salmon tartare needed something more. I guess it's hard to compare when I've only had salmon tartare in Portugal. 

For dessert, our table shared a caramel creme brûlée which was amazing. The dessert was 5 star worthy! If you tell them it's your birthday they also bring out a small ice cream dessert. 

Overall, this place wasn't bad. Perhaps I came on an off day. I don't think I'd come back to the same waiter if I dined here again but other than the service, everything else was pretty good!
