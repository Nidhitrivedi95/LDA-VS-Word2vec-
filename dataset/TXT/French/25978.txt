d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q One word.. AMAZING! I got the chicken & waffles and a vanilla latte and was impressed! The chicken & waffles dish comes with two types of chicken a grilled & fried so it was pretty cool to have variety as opposed to just fried like usual. 
We got the pastry dish for the table & each pastry was better then the next! The chocolate croissant just melted in my mouth! Our server was attentive and I was overall happy with my brunch!
