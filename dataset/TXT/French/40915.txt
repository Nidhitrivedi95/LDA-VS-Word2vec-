kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I had cocktails and drinks at the bar tonight and I must say it was an incredible experience. All of the bartenders were so informative about the new menu that they just launched and my drink was never empty. The restaurant has a great ambiance with all the glass walls that open up and the staff was very friendly. Thanks Katie, Katelyn and Ricky! We will definitely be back very soon.
