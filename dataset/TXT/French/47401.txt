O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We gave Morels another chance based on a new general manager contacting us and asking us to come back and try them again. The experience was like night and day. 

We had a full tasting menu with wine which gave us a much broader view of what Morels had to offer. Some of the highlights were the Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartar and the Roasted Branzino. I love quail eggs and paired with the truffle chips the beef just popped with flavor.  The Branzino was cooked perfectly. It was moist and had multiple layers of flavor with the skin intact. Of course the oysters and cheese selection is second to none. Both were great again and I would go back for that alone. 

Our service was much improved and again it felt like a completely different experience than before. I love to see a place take our experiences and reviews seriously. If more restaurants took the lead like the new general manager they would truly start to understand their customers. I did not think a restuarant could change my opinion, but Morel's you have gained a customer back.
