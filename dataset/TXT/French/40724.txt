KbBMhk_G57WQ2M_9srNbCQ Being an avid foodie, I relished the idea of trying a new restaurant. After perusing the reviews I was eagerly anticipating this hidden gem. I can honestly say, gem it is not and hidden it should remain.  

Foodies of the world, run. Run away. The steak is the most overpriced pièce of meat I have ever had the displeasure of buying. It was like chewing grilled fat with nerves and tendons, and that's being polite.

The service is on par with La Belle Province and the fried mashed potatoes actually make McDonald's look like a 5 star paradise.

The vegetables were worthy of the frozen products section from your local grocer.

Overall, save your time, save your money and please encourage à restaurant that actually deserves it.
