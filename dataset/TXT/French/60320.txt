SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I really love Sardine as a special treat to myself. Easily the best bloody mary in town, delicious food, wonderful view, well trained staff. Really the only thing that keeps me from giving a fifth star is the lack of vegan options for my significant other. No matter how much I enjoy a place it cannot become a regular spot if I cannot bring my mate! Please please please I beg of you to add a vegan dish to your brunch menu, and you will get the fifth star! :)  In all seriousness I have not had a single plate of food, drink, or cup of coffee that I have not enjoyed. I don't even mind enduring the pretentious sort of crowd and long waits this place attracts or the hefty price tag. It is all worth it for a well made bloody mary, perfect latte, and oh my how I have dreams about that duck salad.
