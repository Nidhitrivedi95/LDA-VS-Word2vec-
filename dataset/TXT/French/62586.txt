SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Excellent place to dine on a nice evening...huge outdoor dining area on patios under trees and lights. Bar area is also nice for a small meal or if on the road alone (such as I was). 

Food all looked incredible and it took me too long to decide on what I wanted but I finally settled on the scallops and a cheese board. I can't decide which was better but they were both equally delicious. Great and unique flavors, quality ingredients and well prepared! The cheese selection was varied and they were beautifully paired with honey and mustard. The grilled bread was perfection.
