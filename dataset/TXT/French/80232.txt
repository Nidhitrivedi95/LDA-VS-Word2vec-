zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA we were excited to come here as we kept passing it on our strolls, the food was unremarkable, the beer was really good; however, their service was rushed and angry. in this industry (also in such a tiny shop) this makes all the difference. 

the man at the cash register was annoyed and loudly tried to tell me "how service works in North America" all over a misunderstanding. I'm an Asian American born and raised in North America and that comment was a slap in the face. I don't know where he might have thought I was from but does that matter? thumbs down for ignorance and poutine that was mediocre at best. thumbs up for beer and beer only (since it probably made me docile enough to tolerate inexcusable behavior from the staff)
