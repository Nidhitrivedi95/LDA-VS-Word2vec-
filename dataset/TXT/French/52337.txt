PxJXsLv6cad2YJAwj_LfAw I had to wait until the summer crowds died down a bit before being able to fully experience this new hot spot on Mont Royal. I watched how packed the place was all summer long, from the bike lane that passes beside their front door. I finally had the chance to try it out in October, because there was actually a place for me to sit down!

First of all: POPCORN SHRIMP. I ate a small basket, and then I ate the big basket. I was full but I couldn't stop. This place gets a huge thumbs up for having a kitchen open till 2am, because there's nothing worse than hanging out and having a good time somewhere and BAM, you get hungry but the kitchen's already closed. No worries here, in that regard, so we can all relax.

The bar staff are really FAB. They take time to stop, look you in the eye, make thoughtful recommendations for wine choices, and let you sip a little o' this and a little o' that, if you're trying to make up your mind. Supah classy.

What I really enjoy about this place, though, is the mixed crowd. All kinds of age groups, singles and couples, groups of ladies, groups of office mates, young lovahs, old flames, and every other type. I feel like I can be myself. Nobody's pretending. A genuine good time.
