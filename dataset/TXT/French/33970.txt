hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I've just taken a bite of the greatest Apple Tart I've ever experienced. Thanks again Baguette Cafe, the hits keep coming.

The Baguette Cafe was so satisfying, it inspired me to write my first-ever Yelp review.  Two proper Illy Lattes in the morning and perhaps the best soup I've ever had--Roasted Red Pepper + Gouda, for lunch (the freshly made Taboule was wicked as well).  Truly exceptional, homemade food, prepared by the people who do food better than anybody on the planet...the french. (sandwiches, salads, quiche, soups...pastry) (great prices too!). The atmosphere is quite comfy.  Service from owner, Olivier, is authentically friendly. And the food...yeah...it's that good.  Call ahead and find out when the chocolate croissants are leaving the oven...! Only potential downside is location, inside a professional park just off West 215 near Durango.  Once you find it...you'll be back.
