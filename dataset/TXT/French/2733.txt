0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g This is my favorite restaurant. Everything was delicious and service was excellent. I had made a reservation a few days before and managed to get a seat on the patio with a view of the water show. Super romatic date spot. I ordered one of their prix fixe meals and every dish was great. I got the legume, foie gras and roasted pigeon risotto. The cocktails here are good too. We had a show afterwards and our server was able to get our dessert and bill out fast. We each also got 2 muffins for the breakfast for the next day. Overall, great dining and will be back next time I'm in Vegas.
