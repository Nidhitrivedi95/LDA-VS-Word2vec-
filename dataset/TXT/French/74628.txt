xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Had another spectacular meal today at the Tower for lunch. Started with my go-to appetizer: the escargot that's served with puff pastry in a garlic butter sauce. Outstanding! I also ordered two La Reve l'Orange mocktails (think of a melted orange creamsicle). For my entree, I had the Salmon Paillard, and for dessert, their molten chocolate tart. The service is unbeatable here. All staff members are eager to spend time with each guest, answer any questions, and get to know each personally. And as someone who tries to visit the Tower once a month, that goes a very long way with me. The prices are right on par with this caliber of cuisine, and the views of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountain Shows from the Tower isn't something to miss!
