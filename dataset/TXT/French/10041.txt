4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this place! The best filet mignon I've ever had! The food is wonderful and the servers extremely helpful. I have certain food intolerances and the servers are great ensuring you get the food you want while working around the allergies/intolerances. 

I went to Mon Ami's last year just to check it out. I enjoyed it so much we went back to Vegas this year primarily for Mon Ami's!
