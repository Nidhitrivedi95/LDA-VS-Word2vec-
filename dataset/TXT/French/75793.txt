YicI6Q2bPIEHoOD3iA4-XA JAM Cafe is a lovely little cafe. The food is excellent and reasonably priced for the quality. Wine selection was OK; not too many choices or anything too exciting. I started with the Caprese salad with Buffalo Mozzarella; it was a nice light start and the balsamic was top quality. For my main, I had the French equivalent of a Smorgasbord; several meats each more delicious than the last severed in a pot with mashed potatoes. As with most higher end dishes the portions are a little small for someone with a healthy appetite, which just means more room for desert! The Italian donut (4 deep fried "timbits" actually) with raspberry sauce were amazing.

Jam is a great value, serving excellent food in a cozy and casual atmosphere. It's a great place for a date, or a top-notch meal (or both).
