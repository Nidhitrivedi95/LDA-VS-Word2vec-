ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q I have a sick addiction.  It's S&M, but for my taste buds.  Why I constantly subject myself to airport food is unfathomable.  

I should have gone with something simple, which generally is safe at airports, but I opted for the French Dip sandwich.  The main draw of the sandwich is the horseradish mayo - this condiment (if one chooses to categorize it amongst the common ketchups and mustard) is my weak spot.  Much to my dismay, it was slathered with regular mayo.  I returned it and they were nice enough to prepare a new one for me.  Kudos for that.

But the sandwich wasn't even great, despite the horseradish mayo.  Chips were a little stale too.  And it was expensive at like $12-13 bucks.  Y'all can try the other meals they have ... just don't get the French Dip!
