We really enjoyed the goat cheese salad, the steak frites and the chicken breast entrees but the other two things we ordered, the fish soup and the sea bass were lackluster. The fish soup, made with monk fish, was quite fishy tasting although we were assured by our server that it was not. The sea bass was a little dry and wasn't anything special. We enjoyed a bottle of Beaujolais and would recommend L'express for the pleasant french bistro vibe, but there are things on the menu that are better than others.
