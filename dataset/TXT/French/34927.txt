HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Best meal I've had in a long time.

The room is gorgeous!  The patio has insane strip views.  The menu is basic French bistro to the core.  Got a salad with bib lettuce and greens, roquefort and radishes.  Absolutely delicious!  Fresh and crisp veggies, REAL roquefort cheese, not cheap-o blue cheese crumbles, lightly dressed and piled high.  I could eat that salad for days. 

Then the mini-baguettes with smoked-salt butter came.  Omfg.  The baguettes were perfect!  Chewy and warm.  Wow.

I got the salmon with fava beans and morels.  Perfect piece of fish, perfectly cooked, beautifully presented.  I can't say enough good things about this place.

It's expensive, but worth a splurge.
