YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Had lunch at the bar while my husband attended a conference. The chicken sandwich was fantastic. The smoky chipotle taste really worked with the garlic pesto (I wasn't sure if it would). Not cheap so get a restaurant.com gift certificate. My sandwich, served with fries, was $18. My diet Pepsi was $5...lol and it was from a can so no refills! They need to work on the soda situation. The bartender was friendly.
