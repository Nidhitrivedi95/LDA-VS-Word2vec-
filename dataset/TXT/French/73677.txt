xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Food poisoning enough said.  Had to leave our show "O" early because of this food poisoning.  The maitre de was rude, cold and snobbish not even bothering to take our names when we arrived.  Service was wonderful as well as the chocolate souffle, but neither make up for being sick for the next 24 hours
