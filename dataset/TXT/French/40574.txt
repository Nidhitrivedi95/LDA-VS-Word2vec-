KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I've visited a handful of times for special occasions. The food is excellent; the atmosphere is even better! 
Our most recent visit was March 2015 for our anniversary and the maitre de sat us in a perfect, private spot right on the water front. Our waiter was excellent and made excellent recommendations.  There wasn't any good left on any of the plates. I'm glad Vegas has this hidden gem!!
