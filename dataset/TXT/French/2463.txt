0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g This is the best and most expensive meal of my life. You, yes you, stop reading and pick up the phone and make a reservation... NOW. I would again if I wasn't sitting in Richmond right now. This is the only meal in my life where I cannot wait to go back again. Literally, when I am sitting at my job, it's raining outside, I'm miserable, I think back to that night and remember that I was treated like royalty and I smile. Ladies, now is the time to dress. Also, if you like iced tea order some and ask for sweetener even if you are an unsweetened kind of person just to see the layout. I've never seen anything like it because your waiter brings you sugar cubes, simple syrup and agave nectar on platter and puts in at your finger tips for the rest of the night. Food was incredible. My practical husband was concerned that he would be paying hundreds of dollars for one thing on the plate and a swirl of sauce. He and I were both so full we could not finish dessert, which is a sin against humanity. 

This is one of those moments where you will remember it for the rest of your life.
