4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here for a late dinner, and waited forever for patio seating, but it was definitely worth the wait. Sitting at the patio, we were in perfect view of the Bellagio and its Fountain show that came on every 15 min. Sooo picturesque and they had the ac blasting (which was probably a big waste of energy), but I was a a very comfortable temperature throughout the entire dinner, even though it was still in the high 80s at night. 

The baguettes they provide were very good: so warm and fresh and even the butter was super good. We ordered the chicken pate to start off and I didn't know what to expect, but it was really nice. Good texture and taste. I ordered the filet mignon with the merlot butter and I devoured it completely. My sister ordered the Hanger Steak and it was truly delicious as well. As for desserts, we got the creme brulee, which tasted like a normal creme brulee and the apple tart which was kind of weird. Their desserts are good, but nothing to freak out over.

The service was great and it was overall an amazing dinner experience.
