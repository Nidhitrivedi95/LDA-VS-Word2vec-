SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I had lunch here a couple of weeks ago with friends.  Most of the seating is outdoors, which is generally not a problem in AZ, but it was a chilly day so we were glad we had jackets.  We had a 3 month old baby with us, so I requested a table along the perimeter, thinking that if he cried or fussed, it be less intrusive.  I was told no perimeter tables were available, although I observed a number of them that were unoccupied.  We were seated dead center, so I guess they didn't care about my request. Anyway, on to the food.  We all enjoyed our meals, but two weeks later I can't remember what I ate, so I guess it wasn't that memorable.  The restaurant, which is very close to ASU, is very old and appeared to be in need of some updating.  It was a great experience because of the people I was with, but I would not choose to eat at House of Tricks again.
