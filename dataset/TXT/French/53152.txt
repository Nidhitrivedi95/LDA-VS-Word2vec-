QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Montreal's old town is as close to Europe as you can get in North America. However, the food choices in the Old Town are truly terrible, Modavie included. We ordered two glasses of wine, the catch of the day (walleye with vegetables), and the lamb chop (per the recommendation of the waitress). 

The fish and lamb courses were brought before the wine and bread even arrived. The lamb was average, but the root vegetables were badly undercooked. Everything was dry and flavorless. The walleye special was much worse. The fish filet was scrawny, mushy, and flavorless. The vegetables were likewise overcooked, and the only flavor I could taste was the pepper I added. 

According to Yelp, Modavie is the best restaurant in the Old Town, but after my experience, I would take the metro to a less touristy part of town if you want to get a decent meal.
