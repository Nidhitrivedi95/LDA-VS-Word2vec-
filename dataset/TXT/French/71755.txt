xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw Dinner for four at Apricot Tree was awesome.

FOOD:  A-
Not a top notch food place, but very reasonable price for almost top notch food.  Tonight they had a lobster menu with lobster pasta, lobster this and that, and they were all good.  My wife had the salmon pasta and she loved it. Strawberry Napoleon was very good, and good size.  The bread they served before dinner was D+.   They really should look in to finding a better bread.  The bread served before meal sets the tone for rest of the meal and is the first impression. 

SERVICE:  A
Very attentive, without coming around too frequently.

Overall: A-
What is not to like about this place.  Great desert, good food, and good service.  At this price range, I have to say this place is fairly top notch.  Dinner for 4 with deserts, and appetizer came out about $115.    I would come back here again.
