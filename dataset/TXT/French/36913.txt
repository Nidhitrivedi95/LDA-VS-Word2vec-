The croissant was dripping with butter but it wasn't flakey, soft and buttery.  How many French people cook with ginger?  Duck ravioli was overpowered by ginger.  Also, it was a bit undercooked.  The entrees portions were small so overeating won't be a problem.  The seabass and the lamb were well prepared.  The coconut ganache was good.  If they had creme brulee on the menu, it would have been better.  The service was superb.  I think we'd give it another go.
