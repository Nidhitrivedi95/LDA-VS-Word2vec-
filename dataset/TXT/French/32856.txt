H3gLUOAYxnYL6Rzgvq28Jg SO good! Raw bar portions are small though, so don't expect much. But nonetheless amazing. I had a salmon tartare with coriander and avocado and it was so delicious! My friend had a flavorful perfect scallop ceviche served in a small shooter glass. It wasn't too strong or citrusy which I liked. For the main I had a raclette, I'm not sure how to translate it but it's basically melted/grilled cheese with potatoes, cold cuts, and king mushroom. Oh! And some carmelized onions on the side (which were so sweet and tasty) I had some fries which were skinny and thin, served in a small cup. THAT was also good too. They were very potato-y. My friend had a nice Kir to drink. Service was excellent, friendly, and enthusiastic. Prices are slightly pricey, but that's French food for you. Other than that, I really enjoyed my experience there. I would go back to try the other tartares .
