OZC42gnhlJ_auXduDRfMoQ Went there yesterday for lunch, with very low expectations for service based on previous reviews. I have to say that this was not even REMOTELY the case for me. 

I sat on the patio which was absolutely lovely. The service was incredibly prompt, and sensitive to the fact that I had less than an hour for lunch (including transit!). Our waitress was very friendly and split my friend and my check with absolutely no problem.

I had the cold smoked salmon sandwich which had avocado, cucumber and dill. It was delicious, and, I think, a pretty healthy option! The side salad with balsamic vinaigrette that came with the sandwich was equally as delicious. This was all for $7.25-- unbelievable. 

Their happy hour is 3-6, and I will definitely be back to check it out. I'm so excited to have a fun, new, and different option for lunch close to downtown.
