htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Inspire restaurant is a unique little gem in Markham. There's really nothing like it and I appreciate the restaurant for it's Asian Fusion menu as they have some interesting items on the menu. The restaurant itself isn't too big but the atmosphere is nice and cozy. The food itself is another story. I think the dishes are hit and miss. Some dishes are really good and some I could live without. The pricing seems a bit high for the portion size as well so hence the 3 stars.
