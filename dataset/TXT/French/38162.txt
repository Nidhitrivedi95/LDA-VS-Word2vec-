JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Visited LPT on Saturday evening with some friends -- I've been meaning to get here for awhile since I was a fan back when this place was in "Le Oui Oui Cafe" and love that now it has a name that I can still say with a trace of a (bad) French accent, but without the embarassment from feeling like you were saying Wee-Wee...I digress...

Anyway, this place has been lightened up in its reinvention -- still very small and charming but now even cozier. Along with a more robust menu, featuring breakfast all day (winner!), there is a great cocktail menu (anything that features St. Germain AND champagne wins my heart) as well as a very decent wine and beer selection. 

I went with the classic Croque Monsieur after the table shared a cheese plate -- fromage was delish -- it didn't disappoint. All the food in general was delish, filled with the buttery goodness and awesome bread that should be the standard for French bistro plate. I think that my friend's dish of the french equivalent of gnocci was a bit underwhelming (can't recall the name), but other than that, rave reviews all around. 

Finally -- and I can't believe I've buried the lead here -- the dessert crepes were heavenly. Had a dark chocolate, salted caramel, almond creation that was divine. A bite of my friend's nutella & strawberry crepe was also amazing. Definitely save room for dessert. And, after passing fresh out-of-the-oven quiches upon our exit, I will be back soon to try those...if you're in this neighborhood, definitely give this charming place a try!
