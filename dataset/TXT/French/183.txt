-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA The hubby and I decided to try this place for date night.  We are relatively new to town and hit a home run with this restaurant.  When making a reservation online I requested a booth and mentioned that I was pregnant.  We were seated as requested and our server bent over backwards to make sure he was aware of any and all food restrictions I had.  The food was all delicious.  We had the st. Andre cheese (my favorite) and the brisket and biscuits as well as the rib eye.  My hubby indulged in a glass of red and just for fun we split the chocolate dessert.  It was a deconstructed s'more and was melt in your mouth yummy.  The service was spectacular, we were checked on often and never wanted for anything.  The food was worth the price and the ambience was wonderful.  Overall a fantastic date night and we can't wait to return (and try the executive chefs other restaurants).
