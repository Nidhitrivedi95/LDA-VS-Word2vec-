4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Come on yelpers. Dinner here tonight continues a maddening recent trend of flavorless, ill-prepared food from restaurants that had received great reviews in yelp.  If you have no palate, please stop reviewing restaurants. This pseudo French restaurant served dry roast duck passed off as confit, scallops that have been sliced in half and were likewise devoid of flavor and sides that served no purpose other than to confirm the kitchen's poor conception of flavor.
