-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA I am such a fan of this place! Chef Matt Carter has done it again, creating a menu that will delight whomever you bring. 
My first visit - I came in on a Tuesday and ate at the bar. Kevin took great care of me, recommending a drink called the Bambaataa. It was so tasty! I started with the duck confit & foie meatballs and was very glad that I did. They were a great first course. Next, Kevin recommended the the crab bisque. I can honestly say that it is the best I've ever had. Tons of lump crab meat, squash and maple cream on top. He paired me up nicely with a table white which I can't remember the name of (dammit!). That was more than enough for one night. 
I came back a week later and started with the Sazerac cocktail, then ordered the pastrami brisket. It was so wintery and delicious - a really creative dish - you don't see neeps done properly very often.  A gent next to me at the bar was eating the lobster fried rice & kept making yummy noises. I think I gotta try that one soon...
Really can't wait til my next visit - the staff is super knowledgeable, treats everyone like you're special, and are happy to chat.
