teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w Went here on Friday after my graduation from Grand Canyon University and boy what can I say. We did not have to wait long and our waitress was amazing. She was super nice and was always checking up on us. The food was even more amazing. I got the malted berry waffles with a triple berry mimosa because of course I was celebrating completing my bachelor's! I do not live in Phoenix but I know the next time I do, I will be making this my regular spot to dine!
