4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Family voted 4.5, but I think this ranks a 5. Every item we ate was delicious... but I can't be sure we ordered the best thing on the menu since every dish ordered to tables near us also looked delicious. Prices were pricey for home, but seem maybe a smidgen on the value priced side for Vegas.  French onion soup was about $11, but the biggest bowl of soup I have seen with tons of cheese; escargot was about  $16, but so yummy we used up all the bread dipping up the sauce. We also tried the mussels - yum - and the salmon appetizer - also yum - and a roast chicken dish - you guessed it, yum.  We finished off with the creme Brule - so good. Even though I was completely stuffed,  I was still wondering if I should have ordered the cold seafood plate that I saw at another table. Ahhhh.  Yum.  

I almost forgot...  if you have someone picky in your group,  they told us you can order a hamburger even though it isn't on the menu.
