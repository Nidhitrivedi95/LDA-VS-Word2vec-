_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA 'A' for effort but they missed the mark. I ordered the chicken, shrimp, and pork belly steam buns. Too much bread and not enough protein. I also ordered the cheeseburger steam bun. So strange! The party was thin like White Castle but with ZERO flavor. Not even salt. And the cheese was a tiny dollop of cheese sauce. Not at all what I expected. The shrimp rice was not very good at all. The shrimp was not fully cooked and had an aftertaste, possibly from the freezer? The rice was drenched in soy sauce. I couldn't handle all the sodium so I had to stop eating. Lastly I had dessert. The lavender icecream was solid as a rock. It was plated nicely but I thought I was going to break my spoon. We had to leave it at the table because it wasn't thawing. The food plus 2 glasses of wine was $50. I don't see a reason to go back, other than the nice waitstaff.
