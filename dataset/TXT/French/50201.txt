ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw This place is something else. The whole ambiance of this place is nice. It's clean and up to date. But on the other end I purchased their salad which was good but the portion size was ridiculously small. I think I ate it all in 5 bites? My water glass had visible lip marks. Do they not clean their dishes? I mentioned and showed the server and just kinda shrugs and says I'll take it back to get washed. No sort of apology what so ever.
