SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I've eaten at L'Albatros many times -- each time was memorable. Last week we dropped by for a bite with a large group of friends. The endive salad with poached egg and lardons was good as usual. The chicken liver pate with foie gras moussalline was amazing, as always -- a must try. In penance for the pate, I ordered the vegetarian cassoulet. It wasn't nearly as exciting as I had hoped, but then why eat vegetarian at a brasserie? I tasted a friend's coq au vin and it was HEAVENLY. Will order next time (it's the special on Mondays). To finish, the creme brulee was out of this world. 

In the past I have brought my young daughter, who loved it. I have also brought many   friends on a budget. One of the beauties of this place is you can eat very frugally if you go with appetizers and salads. Everything bite is a jewel.
