K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q Party of four on a Tuesday night, and we were very pleasantly surprised. Pittsburgh has a lot of fancy and expensive restaurants, many of which, I feel, don't deliver either a unique experience or good value. The Twisted Frenchman gets it right, beginning with the atmosphere. Good bistro feel, with a laid back but attentive approach to service.

We were presented with the wine list, and our server was obviously an enthusiast...she not only was able to describe the different offerings, we were welcome to try anything on the list before making a final selection. Turns out our initial choice was not as good as our second, so we were able to hone in on a winner.

The menu is varied, and carries such real bistro fare as sturgeon, squab and duck.

The appetizers, cured salmon and fois gras, were a touch over done, however when we brought the salmon to the server's attention, apparently it is a style of cooking you either love or you don't.

The mains, however, were fantastic.

A rack of lamb you could cut with a knife, a ricotta dish that made our toes curl, and steak that was the best we ever tasted. Presentation was simple but attractive, and the service the the right level of care.

We finished off with two desserts shared; the clear winner a frozen chocolate dish that was just right in its tartness.

Dinner for two with a glass of wine each, around $120 not including tip.

Definitely on the "go back" list, if only to see if they can knock it out of the park again with different selections.
