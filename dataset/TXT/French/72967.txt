XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q No doubt a great restaurant, but with the challenge of facing high expectations.Some plates were incredible but felt the service was a little off.   Not what you expect from a restaurant this caliber, as they compensate by making stiff instead of amicable. Specifically serving time was a beat off, and felt that affected the rhythm and marginally the temperatures of some plates but that did't prevent us from having a great dinner. We had the four course menu. It's hard to select since everything is deliciously described and beautifully presented. The Foie had a nice composition, and I enjoyed the truffled langoustine ravioli, although expected a different flavor profile. The cod was perfectly cooked. I specially remember the desserts, the sugar sphere (La sphere)  and the black forest. A lot of small details make the difference: form the bread to the lemon cake. We're on a quest to collect 100 Michelin Stars and this was a great addition to our collection (don't know if worth the 3 stars). A restaurant for a special occasion that needs to be reviewed in a different category. At the end, we think the whole dinning experience: the value, on how it made us feel and the plates worth remembering.
