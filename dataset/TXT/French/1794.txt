0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw I made reservations for dinner 3 weeks before arrival. This review is not on the food which I was eagerly anticipating, but on their service. We arrived in Montreal only to discover that they were closed for vacation. No one called us to let us know, which was very disappointing. Apparently they don't care enough about their customers.
