rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Amazing food, beautiful and serene ambiance! And for an added insider's tip, I'd request to be in Matt's section! He was the BEST server-so accommodating, attentive, and adorable (look good, serve good!) we all know having an awesome waiter makes or breaks your dining experience! And Bouchon's is just that-Ian experience, not just a meal!
