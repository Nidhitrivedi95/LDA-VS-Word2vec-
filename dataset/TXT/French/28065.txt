DZkl5MleRKh0isxj1Y2Abg Chef Doug and his team were absolutely amazing. Was here for dinner this evening and I had the best service!! Yorkville is often known for being a little pretentious but the staff here were incredibly attentive, down to earth, and hospitable. Prob one of the best service I've received at a restaurant in Toronto. Chef Doug was also very personable and I really loved watching him cook in the small amount of space available to him! Would come back here just for the ambiance and service alone. Had a great evening at this little gem. Thanks Chabrol!
