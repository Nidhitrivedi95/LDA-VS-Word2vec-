Their vision still holds true today as opening hours are from 8am to 2am on most days of the week. 
So next time you are out late and hungry, forget about poutine and greasy Chinese food, swing by l'Express! Classic French bistro food doesn't get better than this!

We ordered for starters the bone marrow and octopus salad. Bone marrow was melt in your mouth buttery good. Octopus was very refreshing and well cooked but nothing out of the ordinary.
For mains we had the raviolis - simply outstanding, bursting with flavour from the pork and mushroom filling- and the roasted quail - wow again, cooked to perfection, crispy skin, well seasoned.
For dessert we tired the 'ile flottante' - huge serving of very well whipped meringue topped with an almond brittle. 

All in all, if I lived in the area I'd be going every week!
