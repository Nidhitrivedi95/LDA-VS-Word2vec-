Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng Loved this place. It's probably my new hang out place in Toronto. Loved the food, I had a nonfat vanilla chai latte with a veggie and chevre omelette. The food and drink were delicious. Only downside is that you have to wait at the counter for your food. It'd be nice if they could do like they do in so many places where they give you a number and deliver the food to your table. Apart from that, I thought the staff could have been a little more friendly, but the breakfast with no smile won't prevent me from going back. Overall, I recommend it and will certainly go back and try the wonderful looking baked goods and sandwiches they have to offer!
