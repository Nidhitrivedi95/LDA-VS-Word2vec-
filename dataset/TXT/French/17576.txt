9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ This is a review for their summerlicious 2015 menu for my meal.
Start: The blueberry mint fiz drink was not fizzy and not refreshing as we had expected. The warm bread was nice. The salad appetizer was bland - mixed greens with very little dressing. 
The entree - artichoke and ricotta ravioli was salty and nothing special - about 4 or 5 medium squares, with a few peas, carrot slices and pickled artichoke which tasted weird; the only highlight on the plate were the mushrooms. 
As a dessert lover, this was the most disappointing - the melon was a combination of honeydew melon water with some crushed ice, watermelon and cantaloupe. It was a big disappointment. The cheese plate was ok and the pastry one was ridiculously small and it looked like the dish had been sitting out for a while. The brushed chocolate was dry. 
The service was good. However, it took long to get our entree.
I had heard good things about this restaurant; however, I don't think their food (summerlicious) reflects what I had heard/expected from an Oliver Bonacini restaurant. Also, I don't know why the dinner menu is $45 when they offer the exact same thing as the lunch menu for $28?
