I never imagined that I would taste chicken like this. I didn't even know chicken could taste like this. Chicken was always one of those things that I'd never order at a nice restaurant - I'd always opted for steak or fish, which I can't make as well at home. But this chicken blew me away, and I know my next trip to Pittsburgh will include a trip to Legume for the chicken alone.

The rest of our meal was wonderful as well - chicken livers as appetizers, a fish dish as a main for my partner, and panna cotta and apple crisp as dessert. The apple crisp came with an ice cream that absolutely had to have been made in-house - it was just beautifully done, and all of the ice cream shops that I've been to just can't compare. Overall, I'd describe Legume's flavor profile as delicate and balanced. Everything is seasoned just enough for the natural flavors to shine.

Service is attentive and solid. We were there for a birthday; Legume not only accommodated a dietary restriction but also brought out candles. 

Would recommend 11/10. It's been a while since I've raved about a restaurant, so I'm really glad I found Legume.
