P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ According to those late night charity ads on TV, I could have fed 3,500 poor African people for six weeks with the money we spent at Guy Savoy. Four of us, over $2,400. Great meal. But was it worth it? 

One can't go cheap here. If you skip ordering a bottle of wine, you will find they have a superb and expensive wine-by-the-glass just waiting for you. But that's a good thing. 

The food is superb. So is the service and the ambiance. The bar is for diners only. I like this because it's both snobby and pretentious. Hey, if this meal is costing $1,200 for me and my wife, I want to experience all the superficial, insecurity-driven emotions one gets to experience by not eating with "the little people". I'll be better in my next life.

The only slight negative is the exaggerated French accents of some of the staff (think Pink Panther). 

Hey, it's a super-expensive, great French restaurant. You already know that. My take is that if you are willing to pay the $$$$, you won't be disappointed.
