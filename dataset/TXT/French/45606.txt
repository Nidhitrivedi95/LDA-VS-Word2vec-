mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We made sure we didn't miss eating at Joel Robuchon's this time around while.in Las Vegas. October last year we had to cancel our reservation for his restaurant in Paris owing to exhaustion after getting lost and walking around 5th arrondissement . Food was as expected. Delicious, presented well, right portions and was explained thoughtfully by the wait staff. 6 glorious courses of fine French cuisine.  An added bonus was seating in the counter with a full view of the kitchen and watching the geniuses at L'atelier JR work. I recommend engaging the staff in a conversation , ask about the food , the ingredients  They love that you are interested about something they're passionate about. You do not go this restaurant because of its ratings and acclaim, You go to experience food that is made with lots of pride and love. And oh ! Tip well. They deserve it.
