dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg We had a fun time here last night but unfortunately it was mostly due to our laughing at poor service and awkward observations. The ambiance is intimate and cozy but the service and food leave something to be desired. 

I called weeks ago to make a reservation for two and the voice on the other end of the line was surprised to have me making a reservation so far in advance. I let him know this was a special occasion. When we arrived, our table wasn't quite ready which was totally fine but then we were led to the very center of the restaurant and instructed to have a seat at a table where two people were still sitting and gathering their things. I kid you not; we literally had to watch other patrons get up, try to resist giggling at the awkwardness, and apologize for rushing them. Despite making reservations and explaining the special occasion, we were given the worst table in the house. 

After we sat, our server came by and started to speak to us and then out of nowhere, she stopped mid sentence and walked away to another table. These were just a couple of the bizarre experiences with staff. 

We ordered a martini and negroni and they were quite good. We both chose prix fixe selections: My date had a good soup to start and then duck confit. The duck was tasty but the bed of beans it sat on top of lacked flavor. I had moules to start which were excellent and then the poisson dish. The poisson was the hit of the night for us. It consisted of a perfectly prepared piece of smoked white fish and potatoes with pickled cauliflower. I highly recommend it. The desserts were quite disappointing. I had a lemon tart that was uninspired and my date had an awful almond and chocolate torte. 

It wasn't a cheap meal to say the least and our clothes and hair still wreak of food from the open air kitchen and mediocre ventilation.
