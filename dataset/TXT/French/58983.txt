rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w We had a wonderful anniversary dinner at Le Cirque this past weekend.  The service was attentive but not pushy, very helpful and friendly and provided lots of interesting information about all our dishes and wine pairings.  The restaurant was cozy but spacious enough we didn't feel crowded.  I definitely recommend this for a nice night out.
