kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I have had the opportunity to eat here a few times, mostly for brunch.  I have had some disappointments and some highlights which I will list for you.

My lobster benedict was overcooked to the point of being rubbery, and your hollandaise sauce was overpowered by the amount of vinegar you used to poach your eggs.  The waiter that day was extremely pleasant though, he truly took care of my table as a true professional.

However, another notable experience was when we had a hornet/wasp that landed on my food while others were buzzing around our heads and we requested to be moved from the patio to the inside restaurant.  The waiter seemed disappointed that we were moving - understandably so since I will not get to tip her if I am going to be attended by someone else.  The host was the worst part.  If you have customers with insects flying into their food, I shouldn't have to ask you to be relocated.  This genius decides to ask me if everything was OK in a tone that said "you must be the one causing this disturbance as no one else is having this problem" and proceeds to take several minutes to find another table for us even though the restaurant had several empty spots.

Your food on good days is OK - not excellent.  You really are just an over-glorified bar and late dinner spot for Bay Streeters looking for a place to hang low before trudging back to their homes in Casa Loma and Forest Hill.

Disappointed, disengaged, and disinterested from coming here again.  You don't deserve your place on Bloor Street.
