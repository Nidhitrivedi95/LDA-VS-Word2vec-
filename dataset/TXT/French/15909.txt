6t7U64hS_cBZtVKSP-q5Ww Not very good.

It's in an airport, so I wasn't expecting much and while nothing was disgusting per se, for the prices they're charging I expected much better tasting food!

Pros
-Nice, clean interior / design
-Cleanly laid out menu
-Service is acceptable

Cons
-Hostess was surly (old white woman)
-Very mediocre dim sum/borderline bad
-Special Beef Udon soupbase was flavorless
-High Prices

Upon arrival the hostess wasn't very welcoming. She apathetically waved us in and told us to "sit anywhere." Wow, okay. Airport, breath. 

Luckily, the server was better. He was pleasant and walked us through the menu and answered some questions honestly. 

Shu Mai
-chicken was a bit chewy 
-overall want too bad
-still probably one of the worst Shu Mai I've eaten  (including frozen)

Cha Siu Bao
-on par w/ a combini/7 Eleven 
-flavor was off 
-pass on this

Har Gao
-good compared to everything else here
-very mediocre compared to even L.A.

Special Beef & Dumpling Udon
-melt in your mouth beef
-juicy shrimp dumplings
-soup was flavorless like water

This place doesn't know what it wants to be. Instead of doing one thing (I.e. Dim sum) really well theyre trying to please everyone. This is probably one of the only dim sum restaurants that serves both bacon cheeseburgers and Indian Fusion. Or is it a burger joint that serves dim sum and Asian/Indian Fusion? Either way, just get a sandwich from Fetta or something. Waaaaaayyyyy cheaper and probably a lot more satisfying.
