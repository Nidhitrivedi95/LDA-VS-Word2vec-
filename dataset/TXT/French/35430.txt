htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Delicious place for brunch! Reservations are recommended but not necessary - you may get lucky. We came for a birthday celebration and enjoyed a delicious meal.  With a huge assortment of food to choose from, it was really hard to hone into one choice. Luckily, we all chose something different so we could try many of the brunch dishes. My favourite by far was the salmon burger. The chicken and waffles also looked super yummy and filling. 

Overall a great place with friends and dates!
