H9pG0BNhqID2MTj8KnY3jQ Cute new Japanese restaurant on Bloor west. Creamy shrimp croquettes with homemade tartare were delish - very light, fluffy and flavourful. Cod with miso and braised veg was good but a bit rubbery and not enough liquid in my bowl - hardly any. Garlic bread was meh. 

I will definitely be back to try the other menu items and the poutine!

Cheesecake to go which I have high expectations for!

All in all a nice new addition to the area!
