d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q I was so looking forward to eating here again after the last stellar performance (see prior review), but I am sad to say that my great expectations only led to a greater letdown. 

The food:
Charcuterie board - prosciutto, duck rillettes, pate. While the duck rillettes were interesting, the other items were unimpressive both in quality and flavor. The standouts were the single cornichon and the mustard, both of which I wish there had been more of.

Steak frites - the steak was tough to cut and even tougher to chew. 

Short rib orecchiette - Really good flavor and loved the thin slices of short rib, but the noodles were fairly soggy and mushy in the mouth. 

Linguine du sud - noodles were al dente perfection and so deliciously lemony, but the arugula left a lingering bitterness that deterred you from the next bite. 

Can't remember what it was called, some kind of mushroom pesto pasta - was fine, and apparently not very memorabe


The service:
We were seated right away and greeted immediately. After that, however, with the exception of taking our order and bringing us our check, the waiter did not once stop by our table during the course of our nearly two-hour meal. He was also serving the large group near us, but he literally did not once stop by to ask how our meal was going. 


The ambiance:
Red Hot Chili Peppers and No Doubt - both musical favorites of mine, but maybe not so much during a pricey dinner at a white-table-cloth French restaurant.

The inconsistency in service and food, as evidenced not only by my varied experiences, but also by the all-over-the-board other reviews here, makes it hard to rave about this restaurant to others.
