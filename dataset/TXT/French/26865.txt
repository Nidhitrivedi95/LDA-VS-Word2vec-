Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Stopped in for lunch on a busy Monroe Street Festival Saturday. Since there was a wait for a table, we enjoyed lunch at the bar since we could order from the full menu.  They have a ton of beers on tap. 
We ordered mussels with fries; and a shiitake sandwich on Gluten Free bread. The sandwich came with nicely dressed greens. 
Very very happy with the food. The frites were so yummy with the accompanying two fresh aiolis
Prices were very reasonable and even though it was very busy, it didn't take long for the food.
WILL RETURN for sure.
