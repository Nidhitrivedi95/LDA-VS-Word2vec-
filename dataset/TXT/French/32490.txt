gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Stopped by her for drinks randomly while roaming the city. Definitely has brew-house feel to it which is pretty cool. Didn't try much food outside of the nachos, which were ok, but again my tunnel vision was set on the beer. The blonde belgium pale ale was pretty good and extremely . The blonde tasted like a light version of leffe blond. They also had these beer cocktails which were an interesting twisted on a typical brew house like beer & whiskey, beer & grenadine, and some other odd mixtures.Overall the place is pretty good and the servers were really nice  and were pretty attentive.
