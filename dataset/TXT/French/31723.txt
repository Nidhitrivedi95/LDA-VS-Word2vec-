grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ Great place for gluten free foodies!!! For the savory crepes he uses Chick pea flour!! He seems to know quite a bit regarding being gluten free because his wife is also gluten free.

We ordered the gluten free Pizza and chicken crepes + a Mango peach banana smoothie!

Everything tasted deliciously Fresh and there was  No preservative taste!
