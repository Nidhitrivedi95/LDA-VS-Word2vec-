YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Two stars for quality of food. Bf and I wanted a special dinner on our night in Vegas, but we didn't even get to the main course! We ordered the lobster mac and cheese, foie gras, and truffle onion soup which were all highly rated. I've never turned down mac and cheese, but this was something else! It was watery like they just boiled the noodles and rushed it out before draining the hot water. Truffle onion soup was tasty and well presented, so we thought the noodles were just a fluke. Foie Gras wasn't a taste we've acquired yet, so I want to be fair, it's probably good for those who like it. On to drinks: we ordered the trio sampler... let's just say it brought us back to the days when frat boys were passing out shots to the freshman girls. Poor quality booze, SLOW Service and just bad mac and cheese... how can you mess up mac and cheese?! So we left without ordering any further and looked for a different restaurant for dinner =(
