m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA After hearing from neighbors that they liked this restaurant we decided to go there for breakfast. 

Very nice ambience. 

Then, got water and there was hair stuck to it. Had the Lorraine Omelet - not the french eggs I'm used to. The omelet was overcooked and the bacon very overcooked. Otherwise, tasty. Accompanying potatoes very good. Food was only ok and poor value for the money.
