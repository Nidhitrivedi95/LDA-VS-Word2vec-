kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Since opening I have hosted guests and had dinner at this place numerous times.  The décor and atmosphere are excellent.  The CB also fills a much needed niche in the Biltmore area for more late night dining options.  Courteous and attentive staff...decent food overall and a great wine & spirit selection.  Highlights are the duck orange and shrimp cocktail.  The cheese board with prosciutto with accoutrements was extremely generous...to the point where I actually told the waiter that they would never stay in business giving servings like that.  This restaurant is definitely worth a visit.
