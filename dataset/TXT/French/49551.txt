or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Service was a joke. It truly, absolutely took 11 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge my presence. 

No happy hour menu. 

"Communal bar table" is a great idea but situated that you get bumped in to by staff with no apology. Or at least I didn't.

Food is good but no thanks. Won't return.
