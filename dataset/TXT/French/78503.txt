Z47kPgBvVit8HtyyDiw59g Duo.D is proof that keeping things simple works best. A very straightforward menu, with a broad selection of wines. Can definitely recommend the Saumon Fumé Maison, Confit de Canard, Steak Frites, and Creme Brulée. Looking forward to going back for the rest of the menu. As others have mentioned, great ambiance and service.
