SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Really one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. Tucked off the street on Case's campus-- you would never guess that the surrounding area houses some of the biggest geeks in Ohio.  L'Albatros is modern, sexy, comfortable.  The menu changes regularly, but the extensive wine menu and cheese selection stay.  Bring a date or good friend.
