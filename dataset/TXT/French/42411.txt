lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA I'm always a bit nervous taking a young child into a seemingly formal restaurant, this place took very good care of me and my toddler. We stay at the hotel and eats here everyday, the waiters know exactly where to put us and always show up at the right time to check on whether we need anything. The food is simple and excellent.
