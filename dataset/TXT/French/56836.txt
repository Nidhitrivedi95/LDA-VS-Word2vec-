A group of friends and I visited Bouchon for dessert. Knowing Thomas Keller is associated with the GF Cup4Cup flour, I knew there wouldn't be any problem finding gluten free options. It didn't disappoint! All of the staff were very knowledgeable, and I had the signature GF bouchons with garden mint ice cream. My dish came out on a special non-branded plate indicating to me that they were special plates for food allergy sufferers, so even the non-servers who brought out our food knew what was going on.

Top notch and extremely safe for Celiacs to enjoy some sweets! (If you aren't able to eat at the Bistro itself, the Bouchon Bakeries in the Venetian have giant macarons as a GF option.)
