I first learned of Duc de Lorraine decades ago and it is not as big a deal as it once was. That is due not so much because it has deteriorated (it is aging well) but more due to the fact that many of the goodies it offers are now offered so many other places that the rarity factor is now gone. I can now purchase 20-30% of Duc's offerings at the supermarket or pharmacy.
