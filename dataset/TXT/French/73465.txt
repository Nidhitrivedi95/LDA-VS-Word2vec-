The cocktails we had were expensive but good, and the bartenders were very nice. We had the lamb and the beef wellington. I loved the steak inside the wellington and the accompanying sauce was great, but the crust was weird to me. The lamb was tender and awesome. The highlight was the oxtail, and scallops. So Beefy it was crazy, and it made me want to make it at home! The service was great as well. The souffle was good, i am not a souffle person I guess. Worth going to for a romantic meal, or a proposal dinner.
