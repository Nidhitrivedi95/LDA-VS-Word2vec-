HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ One of the best dining experiences of our life. We cannot say enough good things about this thoroughly enjoyable restaurant, beginning with a fabulous view, service was above great, performed by a polished team of knowledgeable servers.  We ordered lobster salad, duck breast and a light citrusy scallop dish. High marks for Rivea.
