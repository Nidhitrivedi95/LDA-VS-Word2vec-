oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw So I heard about la gourmandine on Yelp! So thanks guys! It's truly a wonderful experience. I felt as if I stepped into a real French Bakery! Everything is fresh and beautiful. The staff were extremely helpful and meticulous. I chose the Marquise, it was chocolate mousse and caramel so can't go wrong there! The chocolate was rich and creamy. I loved the texture of it. The presentation was so gorgeous, I almost didn't want to eat it... almost! Lol the bottom was crunchy and sweet. The fresh whipped cream on top made it! Details, people! Yummy! See pix for more info! Hope you find yourself there sometime soon.
