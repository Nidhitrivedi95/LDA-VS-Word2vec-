d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q My group of about 5 girls had a grazie comp dinner for DB Brasserie so we thought that it would be perfect for us to use it for our first night in Vegas. We told the staff up front about the grazie comp and they were more than willing to accommodate us. 

The grazie dinner was a prefixed 3 course menu for two. This was perfectly fine between the 5 of us since we were going to order more items just in case.

We ordered the calamari, caesar salad, oysters, French onion soup, salmon, and steak.

Everything was superb! My favorites on the menu was everything except the salmon! The calamari was so delicious and the Thai flavors that they incorporated to it were subtle and not overwhelming. The Caesar salad and the oysters tasted so fresh. The French onion soup had a lot of flavor but it was a bit cold so my cousin and another girl had theirs reheated while the other girls and I enjoyed it cold (it was that good we didn't care to have it reheated). 
The steak was cooked perfectly with delicate flavors and seasonings that didn't overpower or overwhelm you.
As for the salmon, it was alright. Not my favorite on the menu, but you have to eat it with the skin.

For dessert we had 3 different types of sorbet and they gave me a little birthday dessert! The sorbet was okay-- a bit tart for my liking but it definitely was a palette cleanser for sure. The birthday dessert was my fav along with 2 other girls! The chocolate and the ice cream combination was divine! Also, the chocolate was very decadent and melt in your mouth. One of the girls noted that the chocolate that they put into this was very rich and not cheap at all and I agreed.

Great experience at DB Brasserie, and a definite must try if you're at the Palazzo/Venetian! The space was very beautiful and elegant as well. Had a bit of a casual feel with a touch of class.
