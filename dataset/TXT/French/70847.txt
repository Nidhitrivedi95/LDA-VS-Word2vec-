xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w Started with Sea Snails, Pan Seared Foie gras, and Mushrooms w soft boiled egg. Phenomenal. Each of them. 

Entrees were flank steak and Coquilles San Jaques. The latter was the best.

Paired everything with a Sancere (do that) and a Bourgogne Pinot Noir (very old world)

Highly recommend what we ate.

Service was wonderful, with waitress explaining food, recommending wine perfectly, and even offering to take our photo for our memories.  We made reservations through Open Table, the day before. Proximity to comedy festival was a plus. 

(I noticed reviews by people who were not able to walk in off the street. Ignore those reviews. Stay classy.)
