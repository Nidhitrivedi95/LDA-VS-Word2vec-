sMAgnsqi-eY9LlywVC85Hg Situated in a townhouse, and decorated in a flowery French motif, we weren't sure of our choice.  We prefer modern and hip, whereas this appeared to be from a bygone era.  We were, as well, the youngest people here (by three decades). With that said, we were more than pleasantly surprised.  The owner (of over 30 years) was on hand to personally serve us.  The menu is classic French, but with a rustic simplicity and slight updating that we truly enjoyed.  We started with the snails in puff pastry to share - which they split in the kitchen without asking; a nice touch of customer service.  The salads, one mixed and one of watercress and endive were fresh, crisp, sizable, and lightly dressed with a cool, light dressing - delicious.  My steak frite was a beautiful piece of richly flavored beef, ensconced in a pepper sauce, with tasty (if not crisp enough) French fries.  We loved every bite!  My wife's rack of lamb, with a touch of mustard and a thin breadcrumb layer on the edge, was spectacular.  For desert, he made a berries bowl for my wife, with just a tad of cream at the bottom - again, great customer service.  Despite the flowery interior and stuffy look, don't hesitate to stop here - it was a dynamite meal!
