_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q I've been to Le Select a handful of times within the last five years or so, more recently yesterday for lunch and I have to say this place is very consistent with quality of food. Their menu is very standard French Bistro, and what they do here, they do well.

Duck Confit with Scalloped Potatoes - This was an amazing dish. The duck was fall of the bone tender and the skin was crisp to perfection. The potatoes were out of this world. The price on this was good too, they knocked this one out of the park.

Mussels with Pulled Pork - We got this to share, and it was pretty good too. The mussels were very fresh. A good dish to get to share.

The decor and ambience of this place is great, very traditional bistro like. The only thing is, the service in my opinion wasn't all that great. Not terrible, but not great. Nevertheless, the food is good enough to keep me coming back.
