cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Call me old fashioned but  this restaurant is not for me. We love going to good restaurants. We  usually find something healthy in a menu, but here there's not one ( maybe the endive salad) menu that's not going to give you high cholesterol or clogged arteries. The place is packed and loud. I guess everybody loves this place. It is highly rated an was part of Eater Montreal. I will give three stars for the service, even its so busy the wait staff were attentive and nice. Actually my husband liked the poutine. The highly talked about "duck in the can" is overrated. Not a fan of it. Anyway, if you want to try this place, just be ready to walk home to walked off all the fat and calories.
