-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Absolutely delicious! LOVED the ambiance - my husband and I sat on the patio and it was perfect. The service was out of this world and the food... oh the food... if this place wasn't on the pricier side (and rightfully so) I would be here every night! My new favorite restaurant. I don't eat meat and was a little concerned about having something to eat - when I let the server know and asked for recommendations, he told me about a leek and potato ravioli special that was one of the best dishes I've ordered. My husband ordered another special, halibut with squash blossoms, and he loved it! We also had their cornbread and guacamole and a salad to start - both of which were insanely good. We can't wait to go back!
