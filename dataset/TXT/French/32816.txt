h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ Love this place!
I was introduced to this cafe by my sister-in-law and I was a bit skeptical at first but everything was delicious.
First of all - it was a bit hard to find. We walked around for about 25 minutes before we found it tucked away at the end of the food court. 
When we got there, the outside is completely different from the inside. Beautiful decor and presentation of the yummy desserts.
We had the following...
1) Blueberry and White chocolate lavender loaf
2) strawberry tart
3) lavender hot chocolate
4)egg and asparagus sandwich
5) pesto zucchini noodles

All of the food was pretty good except the pesto pasta was a bit under seasoned. The desserts and hot chocolate were amazing! I don't like desserts that are too sweet so this was just the right amount! I definitely recommend all of the loafs and sandwiches but salads were definitely lacking flavour.
