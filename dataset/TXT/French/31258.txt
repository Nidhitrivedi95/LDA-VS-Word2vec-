gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw I had the most amazing lunch today. I tried a new restaurant, Vila Algarve. Not only was the food amazingly presented. It tasted even more amazing. Half Chorizo as a starter was served in a flaming dish. It was delicious. I had the Chicken Espetada (12 oz. marinated chicken) served on the skewer; this was the tenders' most flavorful chicken I have ever had! My partner had the Beef Espetada(12 oz. marinated beef) medium rare equally tender and flavorful.
Our server was attentive and very helpful. The décor gave you the feel of being in a Portugal bistro . The owners Luby & Linden are extremely  personal and accommodating. They have a full bar with great prices. Comfortable seating both inside and outside. There is even a stage area. The clean open atmosphere  is very inviting. Prices are very affordable. A great place for a romantic date or a family gathering.
