Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Celebrated my Birthday at Mix in Style as a Mandalay Casino VIP Guest - Lets just say it was everything I expected, decadent, trendy and a first class experience.  The wine selection was first class and I selected a fine french wine that knocked our socks off - pricey but worth it for serious business or a special occasion. Or  - if you just won the powerball, great place to spend some time.
