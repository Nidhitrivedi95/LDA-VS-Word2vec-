K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ Ok. Here's my take on Razz's: if you go with a group and sit at a table you will find the staff great and it's an enjoyable meal at a fine restaurant. In fact, you will find the food is fine dining and the restaurant is a hole in the wall looking place. BUT!!!! The treat about eating here is sitting at the kitchen bar and spending time with Razz, the owner and exec chef. If you're a foodie or just like great inventive dishes. This is not to be missed. Where can you go and sit in the kitchen with a brilliant chef and talk and learn as he creates dishes?
