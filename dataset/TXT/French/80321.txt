zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA Very tiny old-school diner type. Packed when we were there. Poutine seems to be the specialty and it was delicious. Service was friendly and funny. Local crowd was having a great time. Menu also had hamburgers and hotdogs I believe. A few local beers on tap that we tried were in the "okay" range. Great for people watching.
