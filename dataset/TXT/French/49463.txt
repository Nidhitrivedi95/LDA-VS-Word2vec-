or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Ok I will be short but what I have to say is not so sweet. I am astounded that this place is still in business.  We went this last Saturday night and were treated horribly. After an hour of waiting for our food and not having been acknowledged by our waitress. My husband & I got up to leave. (The people next to us had fininshed thier meal and they had been seated 20 minutes after us.) We asked to speak to the Mgr. He did not come, only sent the bill for our food ( that we never had recieved) and said that he would have it wrapped up for us to go. When we stated that we wereonly going to pay for what we had been served the Mgr (then suddenly appeared &)   said that he was going to call the sherrif. I think everyone has expereinced bad service but this place literally takes the cake.
