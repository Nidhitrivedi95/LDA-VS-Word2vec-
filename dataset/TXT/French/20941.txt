AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Extremely over-priced. Americanos were the best thing we got. Smooth and flavorful. 

Ham and cheese croissant $9 - great.

Ham and brie sandwich $14 - could have used some more sauce/spread.

Turkey and cheese sandwich $14 - more flavor than the ham and brie but still not worth the price. 

Pistachio macaroon $2.50 - solid. 

Halve the prices and I'd consider going back.
