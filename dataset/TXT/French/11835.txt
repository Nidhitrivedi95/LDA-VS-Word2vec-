We dropped by for a late lunch on a Sunday and the place was pretty busy.

Our server was super nice and the place is nice inside.

My date tried the cheeseburger with blue cheese and said he liked it. He did note that he thought it was too much blue cheese, he scraped some off. (In all honestly they piled it on there then broiled it)

I ordered the bahn mi sandwich with salad. The sandwich was very tasty, but unfortunately the bread could not hold up to the moisture; I found myself wolfing the thing down because it was falling apart. It was the seasoned pork with pickled carrots and onions with a sriracha sauce. Yum! The salad was disappointing, it had celery in it which I found strange.. and the dressing was nothing to write home about. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you're just hungry and need to eat something; the baguette they drop off is very tasty!
