oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Words can't begin to describe my dinner extravaganza at Europea last night. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was lively. This was easily one of the best meals of my life; truly a magical birthday experience! Make dinner reservations several weeks in advance and arrive hungry.
