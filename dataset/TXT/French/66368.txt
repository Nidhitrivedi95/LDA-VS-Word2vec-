uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Le Robin Square is absolutely phenomenal and definitely one of the rare gems in Montreal. This place is really the best: from amazing service to the delicious food. I have been here twice and is definitely looking to go more in the future. This family-run restaurant has both the homey, cozy ambiance and the expertise of a refined bistro. 

I love their melt-in-your mouth pork belly, the creative mac-and-cheese, and especially the tender beef brisket. Their selective menu really brings out the wonderful uniqueness of each dish, and we have of coursed tried it all (even that home-made hot sauce is a really great bonus as well). Also, don't forget to save some of the tummy for their delicious dessert! I especially love their apple pie and le pouding chômeur. 

All in all, this has been the best restaurant discovery in Montreal. I have recommended this place to my friends and family. I absolutely adore the staff and the dishes, and it is definitely a restaurant worth frequenting.
