jrwRDE-QhvDGHLXaTMSJyA Terra is a gem tucked into a big, LONG shopping center on Pineville-Matthews Road.  Look behind McDonald's as it is small and hard to see.

The chef is from Peru, the wait staff is Argentinian and the menu is eclectic.  And the chef is a very well-known, award-winning fellow from south of the equator.  Yes, tapas, Italian and Spanish all available, along with blends of unusual and delicious ingredients.

Cozy and could be the place to propose or impress a date.  

The wait staff is excellent, friendly and know the menu, so rely on their recommendations.

Wine list is excellent with lots of wine choices from Chile, Argentina, Italy and Spain.  And the prices will not kill you.

We have done both lunch and dinner here and have not had a bad meal or experience.  Serious diners, including food snobs, will be pleasantly surprised with just how good the food.

If you want to practice your Spanish language ability, the wait staff will truly warm to you, along with lots of laughter.  

A very comfortable and delicious place to dine.
