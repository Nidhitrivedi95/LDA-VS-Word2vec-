1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA I've eaten here a couple times. The space is small, and we passed up a visit one weekend day when the line was out the door thinking that there would be nowhere to sit when we got our order. Parking is street only, so you may have to cruise around a little. This establishment seems to attract lots of students from the area colleges. As you walk to the counter, the menu is on the wall to the left. You make your selections, place the order, and then grab a seat. The service has been quick on each visit, and the staff was always pleasant. The choices are for either savory or sweet crepes. We usually each order a savory, and then we share the sweet. That works out and leaves us satisfied. I ordered the Smoked Icelandic Salmon with creme fraiche, and tasted the Breakfast Crepe with the bechamel sauce that my daughter ordered. I would recommend either one. There are other sauce choices that we have never tried. The savory crepes come with a side of greens which I could easily pass up. We finished on our most recent visit with a simple apricot crepe, but we have tried some of the other combinations...all good. We usually just get the savory and sweet at the same time. They offer you the opportunity for delay on the sweet, and we should probably do that because the whipped cream is melting into the crepe by the time we get to it. This is a good place to visit anytime you are in the mood for a quick crepe.
