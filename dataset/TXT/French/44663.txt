mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Having heard many good things about Toque I'd been looking for an excuse to eat there and when I learnt that they were now open for lunch a business lunch was a great opportunity. 

The food was very good, sorry I ate there a few weeks ago can can't remember exactly what I ordered, and nicely presented. The service was terrific, the manager was even able to recharge my BlackBerry while I ate, and the decor is modern yet warm. 

I certainly can't find anything to complain about, yet at the same time I wasn't blown away such that I can give them 5 stars. I was there for lunch and I sometimes wonder if restaurants hold back a little something something from the lunch crowd where the prices are typically not as steep as dinner. 

All in all a very nice experience which I would highly recommend for a business lunch.
