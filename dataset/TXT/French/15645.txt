6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q I always make an effort to stop by La Creperie when I am in Vegas because they have hands down the most delightful crepes on the strip. 

The cobblestone road and cute French ambiance drew me to this crepe stand the moment I spotted it. Not only is the location lovely (and convenient if you are staying at the Paris Hotel & Casino), but the service is quick and the crepes are prepared within a couple of minutes. The portions are also very generous and can easily feed two.

This place is an absolute gem, and I have never had a bad experience eating here!
