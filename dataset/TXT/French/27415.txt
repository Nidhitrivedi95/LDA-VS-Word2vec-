dGnjfY3KyeLg-nBQaT3Xqw This is such a cool place! We were only able to go for breakfast and missed some of the festivities I hear they have at night but it was a wonderful experience. We were able to eat on their outdoor patio and it was so peaceful to be surrounded by trees. The menu was superb and the duck benedict I had was to die for. Staff was super polite with our lack of french and did everything they could to help us have a good meal :)
