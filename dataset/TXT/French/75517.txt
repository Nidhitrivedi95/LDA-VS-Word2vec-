Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng Wish I could say my food made up for the terrible service and cleanliness, but it was mediocre at best. For a place called Le Gourmand, I could laugh at how plain and pricey my salad was. It was far from busy when I visited, and of the four people working behind the counter, none seemed remotely interested in telling me any of the ingredients in their salads when I asked. People have varying allergies and intolerances; either make signs or educate your staff. Terribly messy washrooms, disinterested service, medium salad all at a high price. What a disappointment after some high recommendations.
