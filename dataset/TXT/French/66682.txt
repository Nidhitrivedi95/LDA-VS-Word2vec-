uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Out of this world good. A family owned locally sourced restaurant that's like nothing else. I had the quiche--best I've ever put in my mouth.  I felt like I was in a dream and my fairy godmother told me to eat here. Heaven on earth. And the owner gave my a wonderful hug before I left! Who could ask for more?
