4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I saw the reviews on yelp and had to give this place a try. We made reservations through Open Table since we went on Christmas day during lunch. I had the prime steak sandwich and it came with french onion soup to dip it in. The baguette was soft and the steak was medium to medium rare.  The fries were thin and crispy. Not too salty or oily. However, you really cant go wrong with french fries. My husband got the Roquefort steak with fries. It was good. The only thing we were not a fan of was the tables. They were so close together that i felt i was joining another parties lunch. We had to move tables to get out of the booth. Yes, I understand it was Christmas day and it was packed but they should separate the tables more instead of jam packing us all in the dining room. Even New York restaurants arent that packed. Overall, the food was good and would go back again. 

ps- The hostess that took us to our table needs to smile more. I know you are working on a holiday, but thats not my fault. So smile and pretend you like your job.
