KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I came here for a sunday brunch.  We made a reservation for 1pm but probably didn't need one that late in the day.  Brunch ended at 4pm which is terrific as most other places close an hour or two earlier than that on weekends.

We were seated pretty quickly and the entire restaurant sits out on the lake which is great for a nice meal with a view.  We began with complimentary, fresh bread and some unlimited mimosas.  We then had a lobster croissant and chicken and mushroom crepe for our meals.  Both were very good and surprisingly large in portion size.  I'd say the quality was a little below a strip brunch but quantity was a sticking point as I was thoroughly full after my meal.  Both dishes were good with no complaints.

The service was solid though there were times during the meal where we needed some more water, hot sauce, etc. where we had to track down the waiter to get served.  But they were really good about filling our mimosa glasses and even let us sit and sip after we paid.  Unlimited is truly unlimited at Marche.

Overall Marche is a solid brunch in a uniquely Summerlin area.  I would venture out of my way to come here for a meal and would even come back for a lunch or dinner, expecting a great meal once again.
