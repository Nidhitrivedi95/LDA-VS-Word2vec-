rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I've been to Bardot for the 3rd time 2 weeks ago and I think Bardot has become my favorite lunch/brunch place at one of my favorite hotels(Aria). I feel like most of their items are great -amazing. 

Their egg Benedict is amazing and they really stand out because instead of your regular english muffin, they used croissant as the  base where where they topped it off with the egg and ingredients. If you really wanna go ballin, I would say get the lobster(but they have 4 other choices: PARIS HAM,BEEF BOURGIGNON,SMOKED SALMON, SURF AND TURF) because it's just so damn good. However, I have finally tried their hunter's waffle which is amazing and it's pretty much another version of egg benedict but instead they have it w/ duck confit. The duck is so flavorful, tender, and tasty. 
Some other recommendations would be mussels and frites, chicken french dip, french onion soup(make sure you add the périgord truffle, braised short rib & poached egg for a few extra bucks to really elevate the soup. I won't go into the mussels and frites which is self-explanatory but the chicken french dip is really good. Most of the dishes doesn't look like it comes w/ a lot but a lot of their dishes are really hearty and heavy that when you finished it, you would be full. The bread is so good, the chicken is so flavorful, the "dip" goes so well w/ it, the mushroom bread budding is lovely. The side of salad really helps with this dish considering it's so heavy.

Anyway, Bardot has become one of my favorite lunch/brunch place at a good price and very filling. I would recommend it to anybody who would ask me what to eat at vegas as a must.
