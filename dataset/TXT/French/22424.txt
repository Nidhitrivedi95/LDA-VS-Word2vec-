BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag This place is the worst!  Terrible service and food.  I heard such good things about this place but the food was bland and over priced.  The worst part was that I found a hair in my food!  The waitress said it was probably mine, but my hair is only a quarter inch long.  Avoid at all cost!!!  They think they are an exclusive place, but just a string mall type restaurant with a bad attitude.
