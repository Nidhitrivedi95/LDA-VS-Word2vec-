gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw My husband and I came to Vegas for our anniversary weekend to getaway. To our unfortunate luck we had to get new tires on our jeep which brought us out to Tropicana and Jones Blvd. While waiting, we walked across the street to Vila Algarve to grab a bite to eat. BEST DECISION EVER. We were greeted by the owner Luby, she was extremely nice and thorough in explaining her food and freshness of product. We ordered the paella dish to share which had an AMAZING flavor and the seafood was fresh. The food was so delicious, we took a taxi from our hotel on the strip to come eat here the next day on our anniversary to try out some other dishes. Luby greeted us again with her charming personality. We ordered the freshly made sangria and she was sweet enough to give us a complimentary champagne toast for our anniversary. We ordered the snails and the frog legs (first time ever trying this) for an appetizer and I have never tasted anything so remarkable. Her flavors are so distinct and one of a kind. We shared the seafood platter for 2 and that was also just simply amazing. Ask her for a side of her homemade chili sauce too :) 

Quite frankly, I was trying to find one thing I didn't like about this place or her food but I just wasn't able to! The atmosphere is inviting, the restaurant is clean and the staff and owner is accommodating and friendly, the food is 5 stars and worth every penny. If you are going to spend $25-$50/person on the strip for a buffet or other traditional fare food, it's worth the travel away from the strip to enjoy the taste of authentic cuisine made with pride. We will be back every time we are in Vegas or passing through!
