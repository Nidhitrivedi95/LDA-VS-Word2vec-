COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw My new old find in Vegas. A delightful little French restaurant in the older part of the strip. I took my daughter there for her farewell dinner at the end of the summer holidays and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service and the food. We had the set four course dinner and I struggled to eat everything, what a deal. We started with the fresh vegetable basket and a lovely dip, next my daughter had the soup de hour which was a tomato basil bisque and I had the escargot in a lovely garlic sauce. We both followed with the roast Lamb shank and ended with her having the profiteroles  and me having the sorbet palette. I had a Kronenbourg beer to start the meal and then a lovely Pinot Noir with the meal. The service was out standing and very attentive and all in all a great meal to end a great summer break. I will be back
