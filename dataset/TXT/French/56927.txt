rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This was one of the best dining experiences I've had.

The server was very good. Kind, timely and gave great suggestions.  We had the steak and frites and the Sole.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the fries were flawless.  Crisp, soft, perfectly salted.  I wish there was a fast food place that sold just the fries.

The fish was excellent.  It was tender, flavorful and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Typically, I'm not one to order cooked fish (I prefer raw myself but this was extraordinary).

There was such thought and cohesion in all of the meals that is rare.  

The ambiance of the restaurant was light and conversational.  It felt as if I was casually dining in France.
