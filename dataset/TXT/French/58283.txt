rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A we came to bouchon for lunch and its a bit tucked away inside the venezia.  the waiter demonstrated french inflexibility by giving me a hard time about subbing away my fries and potatoes for salad.  dont worry we did have one order of fries with one of our croque madames already. but two was too much.

everything was good.  warm bread with butter and jam.  mixed green salad, a tad salty.  fried chicken with chunky gravy. it had thick bacon in it with carrots and mushrooms!  the waffles were a bit weird for me because they had salty bits of fried chicken in them.  croque madame was perfect!  their brioche bread makes it one fo the best croque madames ive ever had.  then the salmon eggs benedict with sauteed spinach were also perfect.

the only imperfect part was feeling like i had eaten too much afterwards

this last time i came to bouchon we came for dinner.  i ordered a sauteed salmon with mushroom and beans.  lets just say the best part of my dinner was dessert.  we got bouchon and also the strawberry gateau.  yum!
