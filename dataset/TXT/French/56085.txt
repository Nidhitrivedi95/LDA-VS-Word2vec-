rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Our most recent visit to vegas had us staying at the Venetian and we decided to go to Bouchon for brunch. We had a party of 6-7 and the wait was about 10 minutes which wasn't too bad. 
We were seated and our waitress gave us a run down of the menu and daily specials. She was friendly and came back around to us multiple times during the meal to refill coffees and water. They also gave us French bread before the meal and it is quite good...crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. After looking over the menu, I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict. The food came out after about 10-15 minutes which is pretty standard. On the Benedict, the eggs were poached perfectly and the sauce was nice and creamy; not clumpy at all. Although my entree was great, I tried some of the other food that my friends ordered such as the steak hash which turned out to be pretty bland and on the pricier side.
All in all, the experience here was pretty good. The server was really attentive to our needs and was quick to get us everything. The food was kind of hit or miss especially for the price point but I'd come back here next time I visit.
