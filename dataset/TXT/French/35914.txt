hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I'm not sure how this place is only a 4 on Yelp - it's 5 stars all the way. 

We've been here twice - September 2016, October 2017. Ate at the bar both times, were looked after by Sam both times, had fabulous experiences both times. 

The food is beyond amazing. We never made it to the entrees on either occasion - the craft-your-own seafood platters are simply too good. Razor clams, mussels, turbot ceviche, smoked Arctic char, oysters, lobster, scallops - amazing, just amazing. And when you add perfectly charming service by Sam and his associates - I can't think of a more delightful way to spend an evening. 

We will be back and we will be asking for the bar and for Sam.
