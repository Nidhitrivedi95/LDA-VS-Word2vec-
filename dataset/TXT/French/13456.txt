4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw For our third night in Vegas, we headed to Mon Ami Gabi.  Now I wasn't quite as excited as my friends because we have one at home in Bethesda.  They sat our group in the patio room which had a great view of the Bellagio water show.  It was exceptionally dark though.. so much that we needed to pull out our cell phones to read the menu.  Mood lighting I suppose.  Our waiter was full on with the theme and right off the boat from France.  He might as well have been named Pierre, wore a beret and a little scarf, and had on a black and white striped shirt.  It was really too cute.  I was SUPER disappointed, however, when he told me that the only duck and lamb options were available on a single day of the week... not Saturday.  I considered having Chilean sea bass for a third night in a row, but instead went with the Seared Atlantic Salmon with pommes purée, mushrooms, pearl onions, red wine sauce for $19.95.  It was a great sized portion and they cooked the salmon to perfection (extremely rare).  My friends ordered the brie (which I'm never a fan of) and the mac and cheese for side dishes.  I was not impressed with the mac and cheese and stopped after a small bite.  It tasted like anything I could have made at home.  Nothing special.  My adorable waiter does get extra points for helping me to select a great wine that fit my taste buds.  He also explained the difference between French and South American Sauvignon Blanc.. complete with a map!  Dinner was great and I'd go back.. just in my hometown and go somewhere a little more unique for Vegas next time.
