OZKo0tpRrgYoLw5mzKmX-Q I wish I didn't have to do this but I really didn't find this place that impressive the second time I went. 

My family and I were the only people in there and the service wasn't very good. The music was terrible and too loud, we had trouble hearing eachother. My family and I discussed in passing that it would be great if they changed the playlist in the future. So as we recieved our cheque my dad tried to mention as nicely as possible that it might benefit the business. They were very rude and said with lots of people no one noticed. Well.. we were the only people so we did! 

The food was great, but throughout the night I felt as though the service wasn't up to par. It's sad, but I probably won't return here for a while with so many other places to try!
