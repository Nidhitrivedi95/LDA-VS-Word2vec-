gf46U12A1oIIpq2sNt_PGg We went as a group of four for summerlicious last month. It had never participated before and it was only my list as a must try. The space is romantic and dark, wear your best shoes.

This was the best prix fixe I have ever had. The service was courteous (despite our being the youngest patrons and the only ones drinking the 5 dollar bottles of beer) and well paced. Usually for summerlicious you are rushed out quickly but we spent more than two and a half hours from start to desert. 

The tartar is the house specialty and well worth the distinction. I wasn't sure I could handle a whole plate of raw meat but it was delicious and perfectly seasoned. I started with a duck and foie salad and to finish we shared each of their desert offerings. I usually find this a low point, but all were excellent, despite the unending jokes that the snowball meringues elicited. 

The hostess told us they have a 58 dollar prix fixe on the menu year-round. Worth a splurge if you love french food done right.
