JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Went here for dinner on a nice Saturday night. This place is nothing short of great. Menu items are very reasonably priced, and include a surprising amount of vegetarian options, a rarity at french restaurants. The onion soup is vegetarian and very good. Not many vegan options, but it is possible, again, very rare at a french restaurant. We were told that "95% of the staff is vegetarian, so it's really easy for us to cater to you."

Our service was great, not too much or two little attention to our table.

Great atmosphere, great menu, Le Petit Triangle was perfect for a nice relaxed dinner. I wouldn't recommend it for groups larger than two or maybe four. The cafe, inside and out, is small, and I don't imagine it would cater well it a large group. This is the type of restaurant that is best enjoyed with a good friend or significant other.
