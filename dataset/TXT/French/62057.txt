SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I came for lunch around 12:30 - pretty crowded, but we had reservations. It seems like a popular spot, so I'd suggest you make reservations as well.

It's the kind of spot that feels impressive and upscale - if that's your cup of tea, have at it. For me, the name was more exciting than the experience. Lunch options are very limited to the soup, salad, sandwich variety. Again, not bad if you like that sort of thing.

We were seated about 5min after arriving (outside). The patio was cute, but the trees made for a bit of a challenge - flies and nature and whatnot. I had the Caesar Salad with Salmon - good. 

Depending on my mood and the company, I'd come again.
