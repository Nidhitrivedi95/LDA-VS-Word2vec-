rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We had both dinner and breakfast at the Bouchon.  Both were excellent!   I'm a steak aficionado and rarely find one that I consider deserving of a recommendation.   I did find one here; delicious.   The frits are piled high, too many to eat.  The foie gras is to die for.   Note:  Alcohol is very expensive here so be prepared if you are thirsty for it.  Breakfast?   Yes!    Also excellent AND affordable.    Definitely go there to start your day.
