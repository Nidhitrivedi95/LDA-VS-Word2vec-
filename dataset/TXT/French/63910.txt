T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA This was one of the most expertly prepared meals that I have ever had- drinks were inventive and tasty- however, be aware that this is a limited menu with small, but perfectly prepared, portions- more like tapas. So, if you like large portions, this might not be the best choice for you-however, I was with 2 twenty year old men and they were satisfied with the portions- mostly because the food was so tasty!menu changes regularly- so probably not helpful to describe particular dishes... if you like great food in an energetic atmosphere, this restaurant is a must!
