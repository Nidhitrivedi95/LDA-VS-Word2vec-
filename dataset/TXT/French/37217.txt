IUtjbbqQ6jUSi4t2jjgYRA This week I dropped in for lunch and I noticed that they regularly change the menu. It keeps things fresh.

I didn't find my beloved beet soup on the menu this time around, but I did find 'Duck broth'. Don't let the name disappoint you. It's very tasty and nutritious. Not many places offer wholesome broth. Do people even appreciate broths? 

Other items I tried...

Peameal Bacon Sandwich - cheese, tomato, pesto sauce + homemade bread. No wonder their Panini tastes so good. No yeast added in the making process. It's nice to know what goes in to your food.

and...

Mushroom Omelette - it's no conventional white button mushrooms, they use a combination of yellow foot mushrooms (and something else I can't make out) and goat cheese... beautiful flavour combo if you like goat cheese.

Still a fan! I always love a good surprise.
