xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Nothing particularly wrong with the place, I just didn't overly enjoy my meal here.  I don't mind eating at expensive restaurants, but I hate being nickle and dimed for my food at these places.  I want a meal, not a small piece of meat when I'm paying $200 for 2 people.  The service was excellent, but I just don't see myself going after this experience again.
