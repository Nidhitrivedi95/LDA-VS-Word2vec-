The decor is sophisticated and authentic Picasso paintings surround you while you dine. My husband and I even walked around the restaurant a bit to take in some of the artwork. Beautiful pieces! Also, when the Bellagio fountains come on, the room becomes truly magical and inviting.

The service is superior, as what you would expect when dining at a AAA diamond rated restaurant. Our waiter and his team were very prompt, accommodating and pleasant. 

The food was delicious. My husband and I opted for the the standard tasting menu, which is 4 courses and $115 per person. We both chose the poached oysters with black caviar for our first course, which was simply divine. The sauce that the oysters had were a tasty accompaniment. For the second course, we both ordered foie gras. It was served over a toasted, jam topped bread. OH MY GOODNESS. I love all foie gras, but the cold spreadable kind is by far my favorite. I devoured every bit of it. For my main course, I ordered the wagyu beef. It was tender, juicy and flavorful. Dessert we decided on the hazelnut cake and the poached pear. Hazelnut cake was good, but the poached pear was fantastic. It was light, not too sweet and was a great ending to our evening. For cocktails, I highly recommend the Blueberry Pomegranate fizz vodka. Superb! 

When we were leaving, we were gifted a box of banana bread for the following morning. What a nice touch!

Overall... 5 stars, highly recommend for a memorable night out with your special someone.
