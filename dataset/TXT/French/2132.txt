0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Yes, a great place with fresh & first class food ingredients, prepared in a creative and thoughtful way.  The ambiance is fantastic (admitting to not being a great fan of Picasso, although I do enjoy the Picasso museum in Paris....I guess I am conflicted with Picasso), the food is awesome ... perfectly and "artfully" prepared and provided with great and thoughtful service. Again a convenient and worthwhile place to enjoy a meal when on the strip or staying at the big B.  ... or not. 

Yes, as one review said, if you insult (made a joke ?) the Sommelier,  will ignore you. Surprise, Surprise, Surprise.  Another tip for the Sommelier insulter: don't attempt to remove one of the Picasso's from the wall .... they do maintain security measures.
