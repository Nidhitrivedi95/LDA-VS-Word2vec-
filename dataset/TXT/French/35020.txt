HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw We went here for my birthday dinner, We ordered the oxtail jam and bone marrow for an app. I had never had it before so i tried it twice and i did not care for it. The ox tail jam was very good. We complained about our wilted parsley on top of the jam and the waitress immediately brought it to the cooks attention and she brought out fresh parsley and chervil ha ha i wouldn't have known but my honey said it was a different plant. So i ordered the duck for $36 it was very good but over done and tiny it was half a duck breast. My bf had the mussels and fries that was so good the broth with the chorizo was the best.It was way too much food for him to eat. We got a comped desert for the wilted parsley, that we took home and was told it would take 20 min for the ice cream that goes with it we opted not to wait. Dinner was $120 for an app two entrees and one drink. a bit excessive for what we got i think.
