_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q I had a delicious brunch with my SO at Le Select to celebrate an anniversary today. I am a big fan of brunch foods, and have been meaning to try out Le Select for quite a while now.

Reservations:
I visited their website to check ot their brunch menu, and realized that I could make a reservation online. Score! It wad a super smooth an easy process, and I had no difficulty getting the time I wanted.

Fresh impressions:
On arrival, we made ourselves known and were shown to our table in short order. I love the little bistro tables and tinned ceiling effect, and the floor tiles. It is not suuuuper fancy or pretentious, but elegant and has quite a warm ambience. The servers were sufficiently quick and friendly.

The food:
I always judge a brunch menu by their eggs benedict, and this one did not disappoint. The crusty croissant beneath shaved ham and two perfectly poached, runny eggs was the ideal in richness and portion. The side of mushrooms and asparagus were a nice interlude, but nothing exceptional. I'm less of a fan of English muffins Itendency to be dry), and usually this dish delivers too many carbs for my liking. The single croissant was a brilliant take, in my opinion.
My SO had the madame-style brisket sandwich with french kimchi, and also enjoyed his meal. I really liked the bbq-y sauce used, and would have been content with either dishes.
We both had fresh OJ, and the SO avers that they used oranges from California.

For two dishes and juices, our bill came to $45+tip.

I'd like to return for dinner, so Le Select remains on my to-try list.

Overall, an enjoyable experience that I'd recommend to others!
