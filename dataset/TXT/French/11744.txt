4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Oh la la love this place! As a local, I go down to the strip only for specific places and this is one of them! Located at the Paris Hotel on the strip, the cafe resides partially inside the hotel and has an open patio that shares the views of the Bellagio fountains to enjoy.

The brunch menu is the best, since I am particular to breakfast foods all day long! But today, my boyfriend and I went here tonight for our Valentine's Dinner since we worked on Tuesday the 14th. He always orders steak everywhere so he gives it a 8.5 on the scale of 1-10. But I had the Fish of the Day with Swordfish with some citrusy dressing, corn and some greens which was tasty and cooked to perfection! 

We had a reservation and was promptly seated. Also, the staff was excellent and made sure to remedy the forgotten dessert. The server and helper were considerate and valued us as a customer!

So if you are looking for a French American fusion of delicious food with perhaps a Mimosa too and excellent ambience, this is the place for you!
