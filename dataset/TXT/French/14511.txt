5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g Pinot is one of my favorite restaurants in Sin City, and I've eaten at quite a few of the higher end places in town.  It's certainly not the most expensive of the bunch, but in terms of price/performance it blows any other place I've tried at the Venetian (including Bouchon), or at the Wynn or Bellagio.  

Pinot is located on the Venetian's restaurant row near the meeting rooms, and is somewhere on the spectrum between a Bistro and formal French restaurant.  The interior is warm and inviting, with an old world "Le Grand Salon" feel to it, sporting leather booths with white table cloths surrounded by antique mirrors and wood paneling.  The atmosphere is more cozy than formal, so you can show up in denim and a sport coat and not feel out of place.

The food has never disappointed, and I usually do one of their prix fixe dinners with the wine pairings (although they do have a comprehensive wine list if you want to fly solo).  They also generally have foie gras (which we can no longer get in LA) on the menu in some form or another, so often I'll order that as an appetizer with another entree if I'm not in the mood for a multi-course gastronomic adventure.  

The service here has always been top notch, no complaints. Very professional and never intrusive.

Note that the dining room closes between lunch and dinner, but they offer an "Intermission Menu" in the bar from 3pm to 5:30pm.

Ah Pinot, I miss you.  I may wander from time to time, but I'll always come back. I've been away for longer than I'd like, but I'm very much looking forward to our next evening together.

Recommended.
