4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went to Mon Ami Gabi last Thursday during a trip to Las Vegas, and I have to say I was blown away, once again!
The food and daily specials never cease to amaze me, along with a superb selection of wines, both by the glass and the bottle. And do yourself a favor and try the chocolate mousse!!!!! You will absolutely melt as you are eating this amazing dessert!
Mon Ami Gabi is always on my list any time I go to Vegas, and it will be on my list again when I return in October!
