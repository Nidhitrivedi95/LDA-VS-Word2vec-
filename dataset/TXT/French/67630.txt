UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Went for their Winterlicious dinner tonight and enjoyed it. I recommend the Chicken Terrine to start, the braised beef cheeks or BBQ salmon for the entree, and anything from their dessert menu. The desserts are marvelous!! Try the profiteroles if you are a dark chocolate fan or prefer a rich, decadent end to the night. The lavendar macarons are also a good bet. It is as beautiful on the palate as it is plated.

Avoid the Alsatian Choucroute. The dinner menu tonight was slightly different from what is advertised on their online menu (it is neither a sandwich, nor does it come with fries) the pork belly was dry, and the shank and sausage wasn't anything to rave about.
