h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ I will say that this place is pretty.  And with the amount of confused faces ordering from a new place, staff answer queries quickly, so the line moves well.

For a food court lunch, a little on the pricey side, but flavours in the quiche were light and lovely, albeit fridge-cold.  Arugula salad with pine nuts and grilled zucchini was a perfect side to a patio lunch.  The Thyme Lemonade was...good.
