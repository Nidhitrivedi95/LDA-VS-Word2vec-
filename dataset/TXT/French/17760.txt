9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ The service was bad, the atmosphere was chaotic, lighting is a bit off, there was no vibe, my seat was awkward, was not what I expected from a restaurant at this level. 

Came here last year, had foies gras, lobster bisque for appetizer. Rabbit and forgot the other dish for main. Rabbit was salty, there was nothing special about any of the dishes we had, nor do I think they tasted good (except foie gras I always love foie gras). Needless to say, we did not venture to have any dessert. 

Was not worth $300~ without drink for such a mediocre experience.
