-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Best chicken dish I've ever had! The scallion reduction/sauce with some root veggies very well rounded and I had to stop myself from over eating. The chicken meatball appetizer...I could've eaten as an entree...yummy yummy! Our server was great. But...I would have to say...the time between dishes was long. Perhaps it's because we sat on the patio, but we at times felt forgotten. That said, I would definitely go back.
