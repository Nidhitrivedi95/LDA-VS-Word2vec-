The meal was perfectly suited for a cold fall evening: the bread was served with a cooked head of garlic, the cauliflower soup was delicious, the duck confit was marvelous and the chicken was delicious served with fall vegetables. We wandered in by accident and will definitely return next time we are in Toronto.
