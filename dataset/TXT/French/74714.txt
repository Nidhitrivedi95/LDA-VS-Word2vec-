xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This place gets 5 stars, mostly for its classy & romantic ambiance! 
My husband brought me here for my 25th birthday and I was really impressed by the view from the restaurant (you can see the Bellagio water shows like every 15 minutes or so) and the service.  
I ordered char-broiled steak with red wine sauce, which I liked, and my hubby ordered the Wellington beef (like pastry/pot pie filled with soft, tender beef), which I thought tasted even better than my dish. 
They served a complimentary hors d'oeuvre before our meal (a cheesy bread and flan with duck meat) and bread.  The bread would have tasted better if it was warmer, but oh well. After our meal, the waiter even brought me a chocolate mousse dessert for my birthday! (my husband had told him); it was a nice surprise. :) 
I definitely recommend this place for a significant other's birthday or any other special occasion!
