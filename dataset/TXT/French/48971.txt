OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Hadn't been here in a long time, and the first thing I noticed was a much smaller menu. This made me happy. I like to see places doing a handful of things really well rather than trying to show me how much their walk-in can hold. Besides, the core stuff is still here, like the namesake tartines, fresh salads, handful of fish and meat entrees, and lovely appetizers. I had one of their razor-thin wheat crust pizzas and a perfect summer melon salad. The husband had a duck confit tartine with a mussel appetizer. We split a very affordable bottle of French white. A warm, languid evening on the patio. Exactly what I wanted.
