YBWG4INShu3tvinpD2fPOQ This little gem on St. Denis is a serious winner for brunch.
I was looking for a new Sunday brunch place, as one of my favorite places unfortunately closed down, so I decided to give Sa-Fran a try. The atmosphere is great, interior décor is very cool, service is excellent and so is food.
My review is 5 stars.
