D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g The Yorkville location will have new owners very soon; not to fear, the wonderful original owner is training the new owners on her famous crepe recipe and technique. 

I am relieved that she plans to keep her Limonana beverage business.  The minty, lemony drink is a fave of mine now whether served hot or cold.  I hope the new owners will still carry it.
