COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw I love this place so much just come in for the first time ... Everything i ate was so good .. I'm French from Paris & I'm so picky about the food, but chef Oseil Gonzalez here jaw dropped me I wasn't expecting this quality.
They are doing an amazing foie gras au torchon ... I will recommend this place to everybody.
Anywhere on Las Vegas strip will charge you twice the price of this place.
Any way go there try .. Trust me it's the best ! Voila ..
