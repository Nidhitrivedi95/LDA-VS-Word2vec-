aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA I live within 10 minutes of Bistro 185, and drive back and forth past it all the time.  I stopped in a week or so ago for Happy Hour and am I glad that I did.   The Happy Hour menu didn't disappoint.   I ordered the cold Asian Peanut Noodles and the Panko breaded shrimp, at $5 each.   The noodles arrived just a little bit pasty, but as they warmed to room temperature, they became more saucy and even more tasty.  The noodles are full of fresh veggies and the portion is fairly generous.  The shrimp arrive, hot, crunchy and very tasty.   I also ordered that day's special drink ($5), which was a pear margarita.  It was very good, except I prefer a sugar rim and it arrived with a salted rim (my fault).  I will definitely return for Happy Hour and also can't wait to try the lunch and dinner menu
