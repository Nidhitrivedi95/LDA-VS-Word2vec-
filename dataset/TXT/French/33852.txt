Can you please make it possible to leave 10 stars instead of just 5? THIS PLACE IS OFF THE HOOK!!!!!!!!! The owner is so amazing and friendly and the food is just plain ridiculous. SO FREAKING GOOD!!!! I had an iced coffee and a croissant sandwich with a spinach omelette and turkey inside. Delicious. My kid had a strawberry muffin with almond powder. SO MOIST AND AMAZING!!!! GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO NOW!!!!! It is in a weird location but its worth any amount of time to find it. So good. Go!
