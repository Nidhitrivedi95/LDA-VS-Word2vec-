cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I made a reservation and was told only bar seats were still available. Yet when I got to the restaurant a lot of tables were open. Sitting at the bar was uncomfortable. The waiters and barstaff are working, splashing water and ice around (sometimes it lands on you). Sometimes they forget and let out a swear and it just makes for a feeling like you're seated in the back of a kitchen. Highly unpleasant seating, would not recommend accepting anything less than a table out front. As the evening heats up waitstaff are constantly bumping you as they pass by, no matter how much you scooch in. 

This place could have redeemed itself on the basis of good food. Alas. They are of the unfortunate school of restaurants who think more food = better. NO. More of mediocre food is just a lot of mediocre food. The PDC cut, for example, was raw in the middle and hard to saw through. You would think something named "PDC cut" would fall off the bone and be cooked all the way through. Alas. 

The blood sausage tort was more of an enormous pizza with blood sausage chunks on top. It was very delicious, but the presentation was lacking, the portion much too enormous. The PDC house beer was a limp-wristed sparkling water rather than a beer. 

I don't know, I wouldn't waste your time and money on this place when there are so many others to choose from. I was very disappointed with this restaurant.
