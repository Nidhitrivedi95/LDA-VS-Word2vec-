rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I have stayed at the venetian several times and have never passed by when this place was open, but today it was and we had breakfast there and I am so glad it was open. The restaurant is beautiful it's nice and open, the service is great and the food is the best. My husband had the omelette of the day which had a nice spicy bacon in it. I ordered the quiche du jour which was just spinach but this was the absolute best quiche I have ever had. And it came with some nice greens on the side. I also had a Bellini which was good and we grabbed some macarons after which are huge and a good solid macaron, the caramel and coffee are my favorites, after eating them I immediately found myself googling how close the bouchon is in Beverly Hills so I can send my husband to get me more of those two on his way home from work one day.  The best part is the prices are not completely outrageous, so if you're looking for a great breakfast experience, this is the place.
