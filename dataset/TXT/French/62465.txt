SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Such a special place. if you've never been and you would like to try something neat and different, with a quaint feel..this is it, the food is excellent as well.  It is an old has that has been repurposed into a lovely restaurant and extra seating outside.   I especially love sitting outside when the weather is nice.  

There is just such a nice feel about this place, it is different than any other restaurant you will have been to.  I had the filet and it was really good.   I would say it is more for maybe a special occasion or a romantic type evening although I also have been with a group of people for a work event and that worked out too.  I just really like this place!!
