_cssId9VUaKqhMGxC4-5CQ Stumbled on this resto by walking by and wss intrigued by what I saw. What a find! This is a terrific little place. Nice setting, with warm and airy feel. With its high ceilings and comfortable layout the environment is a 'cosy business'. They serve their meals with Fresh ingredients with great service. My friend had the salmon tartare and i had the 'fish of the day' both were well presented and were delicious. Will definitely be back.
