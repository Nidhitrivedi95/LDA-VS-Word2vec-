JEXasd9XUHFbt_fIdmdK8g Everything I hate in the "new" Toronto!
Home hipster-pseudo-cool but in fact arrogant.
Ambitious but amateur cuisine (it starts from the appetizer that evokes a poor mustard dip)
Surrealist prizes ($ 13 for a bad "Aligot" in a saucer that would make any Auvergnat cry _of despair_)
We ask for bread to try to mop up the sauce (made of rare ingredients of course); We were brought you two slices of white bread toasted and buttered (and that's extra).
And then the dessert ... an Easter egg with three truffles inside !! Really?!
$ 300 for two with the cheapest wine.
In fact a restaurant for "Nouveaux Riches" who do not know French Cuisine and get easily mystified.
RUN AWAY!!
