The owner is a nice guy who made a point to say hello to some guests who I was with this morning who frequent much more than I do.  The place was packed at 2 PM on a saturday I can't imagine it being comfortable on a Sunday or Saturday AM.  The wait staff in general is off and I'm really not sure why.  I mean sure they are busy, but in these types of non-franchise "bohemian" joints usually the 20 somethings are exceptionally nice.  Oh, well maybe this is part of the authentic Frecnch experience.  You do feel the need to eat quickly because of  the other customers eyeing you up for the precious few seats available.  Outside of the venue and service the crepes are the best I've ever had in Pittsburgh and if the service and venue was better this  could easily be four or maybe even five stars.  I had the smoked salmon with creme fraiche' and it was perfect.  It had great quality ingredients and was truly delicious.  A friend had the ham and cheese which was also excellent and another had  just a  traditional crepe with maple syrup.  This was also a smashing success.  I think the owner needs to share with his young staff some of the hospitality he showed my friends, but I'm guessing they don't feel this is necessary since they seem to be at capacity already.
