xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q The crepes live up to the reviews. It was so good! I ordered the Lil Bird with a jalapeño kick and wow. I would definitely go again and try out their other savory crepes. I love the way they are packaged for easy eating. The flavours and ingredients are fresh and they with really well together! 

I read the reviews and tried the freshly squeezed sugar cane juice with mint. The juice was fresh and light and the mint added an interesting (but good) dimension to the drink. I did feel like I got leaf bits in my teeth so that was a minor inconvenience. 

The service was great and the staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. It was my first time there and it definitely won't be my last. The place did get pretty packed around lunch time so if your looking for a spot to sit then you might be out of luck. 

The place was quaint and tidy but difficult to find since it was hidden behind condos. I'm glad I found it and I can't wait to try more!
