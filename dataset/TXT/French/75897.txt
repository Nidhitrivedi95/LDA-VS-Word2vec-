ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA Le Chalet est génial! If you don't speak French, that means it's awesome...and it is.  Crêpes, Fondue and ambiance.  Le Chalet has it all.  I have had the Fondue, and both savoury and desert crêpes.  All were wonderful.
If you're looking for a bit of the French Alps on a "stay in Phoenix" budget then put Le Chalet on the top of your list.
