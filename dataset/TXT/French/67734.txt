I ordered the Shore Lunch and seriously had no idea that it would be a platter of deep fry. Also, balsamic vinegar came in a spray bottle that was impossible to use from all the grease smear on it. Server was sarcastic and insincere. Did not bring us additional bread even though we requested it and basically went MIA after we paid the bill. I would not recommend. Very poor and subpar service and food.
