The steak was a little tough, my French onion soup was like salty water (where's the onion???), the fries were slightly stale, my Caesar salad was drenched with dressing... but the bread was hot and fresh! Not sure if it was an off night, but either way, our server was quick and made the transaction between 8 girls painless. The patio area where you can view the Bellagio fountains is a nice touch.
