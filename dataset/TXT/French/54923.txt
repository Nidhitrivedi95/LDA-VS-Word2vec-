rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We were really excited to eat at Bouchon, never having eaten at a Thomas Keller restaurant before. The decor is very French Bistro, down to the plants and brass railings. We ordered the appetizer, which was braised pork cheeks with a pearl barley risotto kind of thing. The cheeks were luke warm and the barley had a little too much acidity. When we commented to the server the the cheeks were just luke warm, he commented that "we don't really serve anything hot here."  HUH? Does Thomas Keller know that? The bread was good, I ordered roast chicken because Keller said that was the reason he opened the first Bouchon in the first place. To find a good roast chicken after work. The skin was crispy and it was cooked well, but it was a little bland. Truthfully, Costco's roast chicken has better flavor and is a sixth the price. The server seemed kind of distracted and a little out of sorts. The highlight of the whole meal was watching how good our server assistant was. He was everywhere at once and did a great job. I actually went and tipped him seperately because of his obvious work ethic. Wish he would have been our server.
