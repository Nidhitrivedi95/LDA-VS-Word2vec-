We ordered:
Mussels with lardon - the broth was buttery and delicious!
Trio of meats: Boar, Horse, Venison -melt in your mouth meats accompanied by risotto oh baby!
Foie Gras - like solidified butter amazing
Horse Tartare - fantastic and smooth i would get this again
Homemadei Ice Cream - SOOOOO GOOOOD

Even the espresso I ordered after my meal was one of the best I have ever had and I have had the best made by Nonna :)

This is a must go if you haven't been or haven't tried French cuisine like me.  The flavours were rich and creamy but not overly powering.  I see why my sister tells me French cuisine is her favourite.
