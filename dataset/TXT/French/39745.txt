K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q The Twisted Frenchman is a top notch restaurant by any standards from NYC to Hong Kong --- it just happens to be located in Pittsburgh, PA. From the Foie Gras and Aged Beef Tar Tar, the appetizers are truly delectable with each component of the plate wonderfully interconnecting with the flavors of the others to provide a mesmerizing work of culinary art. This holds true for the entrees which are not to be outdone. I recommend the aged strip steak which is dry aged for sixty days and pairs wonderfully with crispy brussel sprouts, shoestring onion garnish, a delicious French purée, and aromatic truffle butter that makes your mouth water before even consuming it. The dessert finishes the meal with a BANG as the chocolate two ways provides the most amazing chocolate brownie expertly crafted from pure dark chocolate to go along with a diaphanous chocolate mousse which is prepared at the table by the executive chef who creates a creme brûlée crust using liquid nitrogen. As he does, there is a cool smoke that flows from the bowl and provides a gastronomical experience that feels like a magic show. This place will blow your mind. I've been three times now, and it still boggles mine every time.
