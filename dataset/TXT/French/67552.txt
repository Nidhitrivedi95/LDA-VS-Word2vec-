Know that if you are here to enjoy the cute restaurant (and the fresh breads), then read no further. But if you want to get good value for what you pay for in terms of the food, you will likely be disappointed, as I was. Even on looking at the menu, it didn't seem too exciting, but if they can execute well, then by all means...but that wasn't really the case. The fries were pretty good, but it practically overflowed on my plate, so needless to say I didn't want any more half way through. The food wasn't terrible, but for the price they charged and the expectations set from the pretty décor, I was disappointed.
