rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w My date took me here right before the concert.. the manager placed us at a 10'clock angle from the dancing water scene--a fabulous view from where I sitted, but the course didn't impress me much it might be the coffee that subdue my appetite. Anyhow the manager came to our table with numerous jokes was precisely attentive and defin deserves credit for that, therefore I give it a four star just for his diplomacy and effort.
