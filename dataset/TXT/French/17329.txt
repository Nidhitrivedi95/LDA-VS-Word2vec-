9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw First time back since they re-opened.   Service was great as always, but the food is still coming along.  Will send direct feedback to the owners.  VERY busy night, the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed.  The timing of our food was good but others after us had to wait longer.  Still working out some of the kinks I think.  They will get there.  Nice wine list, love to be able to still BYO.  Beautiful setting, the patio is lovely!  Bar is very nice as well.  Lots more capacity than the original location.  We were in the room that was carpeted, I actually love the original wood floors in other parts of the building.  Harder to be an intimate setting when tables so close together and conversations easily carry.   Pastry chef hit a home run!!  Highlight of the meal!
