rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I am open to having foods served at different temperatures. Sort of, I mean really it just depends and I could go on about it longer than you would like to read, I am sure some reader (hello out there) is thanking me for not. 
When I was a kid, I used to eat peas frozen and maybe I still do sometimes. Lest you think I'm truly starting to rave on about the delights of eating foods at out-of-their-element temperatures on the page of a restaurant famed for being part of the same world-famous and muchly raved about and fawned upon French Laundry, I will continue.

Perhaps it is a great testament to the melt-iness and deliciousity of their croissants that my reluctantly ordered crescent of flour and butter was served cold (as in, it is so incredibly tasty, it should be served cold?), as compared to dining companion's whose pain au chocolat was slightly toasty and warm. What's with this croissant disparity? If the calories, time, and money are to be spared, so shall the energy to heat the damned thing. 

Whatever else was in the eggs (steak I believe and some very, very good fromage) was quite tasty making for an acceptable breakfast that left me wanting. Perhaps that is the secret to their pastry sales.
