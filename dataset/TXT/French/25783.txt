Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Holy crap... The view is amazing from here. This is the place to checkout when in Las Vegas. As the waiter/guide was saying, if you want to treat your date right this is the place to do it. The wine cellar is amazing with over 4000 bottles (just a quarter of the hotel's wine count), the hand-blown glass bubbles _do_ give you the impression of champagne bubbles and the upper dining area secludes you from the rest of the bourgeoisie diners.

If you can fork over the dough, reserve the chef's table and make him work for his money.
