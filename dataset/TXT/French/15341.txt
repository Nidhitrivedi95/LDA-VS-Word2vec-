6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q I've never been a huge fan of crepes, but we stopped by because we wanted to avoid eating at another buffet disaster. My wife ordered the one with spinach and I had the one with sausage, marinara sauce, and a ton of cheese. Like someone else had mentioned, too much cheesy goodness for my taste. I felt like I had eaten enough cheese from an entire large pizza. The stomach can only handle so much coagulated cow's milk.

If it's busy with a line, be prepared for a wait until you receive your food since they are individually made fresh. It felt like I waited close to over half an hour waiting for my food. And at $9 a pop, they aren't exactly the best bargains, but pretty decent to hit the spot if you're craving it. Next time I'll have to try their dessert versions.
