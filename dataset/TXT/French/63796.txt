T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ I had been to this restaurant once before, but wanted come back to try the cote de boeuf for two. Valentine's Day was the perfect day to try this meal for two. 

Luckily we made reservations because the restaurant was packed by 7! We ordered the French onion soup and the daily special appetizer to start. Both were just okay, nothing too special. The main event was the cote de boeuf and this did not disappoint! The ribeye steak is served with a side of fries, ratatouille and mixed greens on a wooden chopping board (perfect for pictures :P). The steak was the highlight but the fries were also on point! They were like McDonalds fries but less salty and greasy. The steak itself was seasoned and prepared just right. I am not sure if it was the piece that we got, but the parts around the bone were just a little bit on the chewy side and a good 10% of the steak was pure fat. I am taking away half a star for that, and taking away another half a star because the service got pretty slow when we were looking to get our bill. Regardless, both of us left full and happy! I would come back again to try the rack of lamb and dessert another time!
