BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I love this restaurant! I love their mussel appetizer that is available at happy hour for $5! The broth is absolutely amazing and it can be sopped up with the big piece of grilled bread that comes with it. While your waiting for your food, they bring this awesome bread that is served warm  in a paper bag with a very fresh and flavorful tomato sauce to spread on it. I ususally go with my parents and we can easily go through three bags of their bread!  However, we've learned that it is worth it to save room for the main courses. The squid ink linguine and the pasta with bolognese are definitely my favorite pasta dishes and I always have a hard time deciding between the two. They also have a pretty good selection of seafood which changes daily. This is one of my favorite local restaurants to go to.
