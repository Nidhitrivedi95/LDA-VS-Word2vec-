SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I rarely write a review, but have to this time.  We have found the atmosphere and food to be excellent and this is one of our preferred restaurants.  This time we did not know there was an ASU game until we got close and could see there were no reasonable parking options anywhere - they neglected to mention the ASU game when I called for reservations. 

Knowing they have a small lot in back we tried there, but it was, of course, full.  I double parked, went in and told the hostess our problem.  She apologized and found the Manager, Ryan Brown, who spent the next fifteen minutes or so looking for a spot for us and finally moving his own personal vehicle so we could use his.  He also provided us with a complimentary appetizer for our trouble.

This is the kind of response that went above and beyond what I had hoped for and is why we will continue to return.
