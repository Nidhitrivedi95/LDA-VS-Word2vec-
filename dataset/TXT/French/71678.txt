XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w While in Phoenix Airport I stopped into grab a quick bite...was more than pleasantly surprised how good the food was. 

I had the Grilled Chicken Paillard and it was awesome!  The service was good as well...our waitress was very attentive. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who's looking for good food as well as drinks. 

It has a cool French vibe as well. 

Enjoy... Bon Appetite!
