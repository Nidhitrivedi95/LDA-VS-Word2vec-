AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw My cousin and I stayed at Caesers over Memorial Day weekend.  We frequented the Payard Patisserie.  Here is a overview of our experience: 

Breakfast Nosh:  My cousin waiting in line at the crepe/ice cream counter... this line was ginormous.  Luckily, not too long she realized that there is a seperate counter for coffee, water, etc.  She bought her water, her coffee and amerged from the crowds quite quickly to the table I was stitting at.  She immediately directed me to the coffee counter where I got my own water, coffee and a nice cup of fruit.  The fruit was kinda pricey ($8) but it was delicious, fresh and most of it was cut up into smaller pieces, so you do get your money's worth of the fruit, because it's packed in there. 

After Dinner Dessert:  After a splendid dinner at RAO's Italian Bistro, we decided to pass on dessert and swing over to our good ole pal, Payard.  After 3 glasses of wine into the evening, we ended up buying a berry napoleon, six macaroons (assorted flavors), and two white chocolate covered strawberries.  Prior to going back to our room to have our "cousin dessert and wine (yes, we stopped off at the gift shop for a bottle of wine) slumber party.  Here's how that went down: 

 - Berry Napoleon:  To die for.  Flaky.  Not to sweet. You could still taste the berries and it is not overpowered by the creme.  Delish!  Definitely our fave of the night. 

 - Macaroons:  Okay, these are the flavors i remember:  Pistaschio, Strawberry, Lemon, Raspberry.... and 2 more i forgot.  Delish.  Soft, with a hint of yummy flavor.  You want to keep eating just to enjoy the flavors. 

 - White Chocolate Strawberry:  This was your standard chocolate strawberry.  If you crave it... get it.  But it wasn't something you couldn't get elsewhere.  

Day we were leaving Vegas:  My cousin wanted to buy some macaroons for her dad.  They ran out of all the smaller bags.  So they were telling her she would have to buy the box.  The box is not cheap. She ended up not getting it.  

Overall thumbs up.  I'd definitely go here again and recommend it to anyone who is strolling by....
