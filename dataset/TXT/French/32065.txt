gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Hubby and I went to the bar at Alize before seeing Joe Walsh.  The bartender was very friendly, and it was a warm, fun experience.  It is definitely a splurge, but well worth it.  Also, I really appreciated the kind service from the staff running the podium downstairs--not snobby at all.  Can't wait to return.
