4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great brunch place with a perfect location central on the strip - nice plus is the patio outside which is constantly packed.  We had made reservations (which is normally for inside as the patio is first come first serve) - there was availability on the patio but we decided to go inside since it was a bit chilly.  I had the eggs benedict special (had bacon on top of a thinly sliced baguette) and hashbrowns - very yummy and I'm a picky hashbrown person as they need to be crisp (but not burned) and buttery which they were.  Mom had the blueberry waffles which were nice and fluffly and came with blueberry syrup.  Bro had a turkey egg white omlette which he said was pretty darn good.  Definitely want to come back and try this place for dinner!!
