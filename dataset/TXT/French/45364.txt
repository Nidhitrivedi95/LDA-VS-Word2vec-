mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q one of the most amazing meals i have ever enjoyed.  i took my boyfriend to vegas for his birthday and set up L'Atelier as his birthday dinner.  From start to finish, the service and all our dishes were absolutely amazing.  We started our meal with the baby kushi oysters poached in french butter and the lobster gelee in a cream leak soup, which both were amazing.  order the big eye tuna in tomato infused olive oil.  it is a really wonderful dish.  then we had the roasted rack of lamb which was so tender and juicy and we also ordered the gnocchi which were so tender and well prepared.  also the braised pork belly-- wow.  that has to be one of the best dishes I have ever tasted in my entire life.  order it and you will not be sorry.  the sweetbreads, which i stayed away from because i just cant do it...  but my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed them and he said the dish was amazing.  please do yourself a favor and order the green chartreuse souffle with pistachio ice cream for dessert.  It is to die for.  I think if a restaurant can pull of a great souffle... they know what they're doing.  and no doubt, the chefs on the line here at L'Atelier, know exactly what they're doing.  Also as a treat, they surpised the birthday boy with a tray of 6 different tarts that were all absolutely delicious.  At L'Atelier, you will have a great experience and you will be thinking about the dishes you had here for weeks even months to come.  I ate there in March and I still think about the dishes I enjoyed there.  The tab came out to be around $500 for all the dishes and mind you, lots of wine.  Yes, a bit steep.  But for a great memorable meal, I dont mind dropping the cash for.
