SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ I took a small group of 12 here today on New Years Eve for an early breakfast. It gets better...5 were little children.  They put together 4 tables for us and waited on us so patiently.  Even when a glass if water got knocked over, they were right there ready to clean it all up. The service was awesome.  Wesley was our server and he really was great at recommending menu choices and catering to our every request from butter to hot sauce.  He definitely earned his tip!
So for all the other yelpers that had bad service...they didn't have the pleasure of our server.

Let's talk about the food...read the reviews and was excited as I love foodie places.  I am not the organic loving farm to table, egg needs to have been laid today kind of foodie but I appreciated the story and concept that they offer.  The presentation was beautiful for the steak and eggs, crepes and the quiche which always sells out was spinach and blackberries. The corned beef hash and eggs was plentiful and packed with flavor.  The little girls ordered bacon and eggs which came with croissant too.  The bacon was so thick and yummy...don't know how they managed to get it crispy.  They were like pieces of pork steak!
Coffee was strong and hot. I have 0 complaints.  

Thank you for having us at your restaurant for breakfast...we will be back !
