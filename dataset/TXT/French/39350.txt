jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Today was my first time eating off of the brunch menu and it was fantastic. I had the eggs Florentine and they were great. I think I like that even better than the dinner menu, which although very good, could use a little facelift and maybe offer a few more options. If you're in the area, this is a must try!
