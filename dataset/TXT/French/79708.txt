zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw Finally a French restaurant full of charm and absolutely fresh quality food. I tried the scallops in the garlic sauce and it was everything I would have hoped for. I did regret not getting the mussels with fries, but that simply means I will have to go back very soon. Having a chance to speak French with the chef made the experience even more special. It's so rare to enjoy exquisite food and discuss every detail with the actual chef. I didn't make it to dessert and that was a great shame. These deserts looked sinfully delicious.
