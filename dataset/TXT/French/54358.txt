rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw As always, Michael Mina restaurants provide the perfect setting for a great meal. The seared foie gras served on top of beluga lentils was a nice start to our meal. Perfectly seared, buttery and delicious. We also tried the duck wings a l'orange which were ok, but didn't cause much of an impression on me. The salmon entree was served also with beluga lentils. Nice and crispy on the outside, however mine was slightly overcooked. Nonetheless the flavors were on point. The wine list, including by the glass, was as expected excellent with lots of French options. Dessert was the baba au rhum which was not a traditional cake, it was more like a loaf of bread, with lots of rum and light chantilly cream.
