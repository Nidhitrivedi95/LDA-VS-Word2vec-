dU7SLTS6_HWo1YPHZ4DmOw A second review because I have since eaten at L'Avenue several more times, including for brunch. 

I still absolutely love the place. Outstanding service and food, and a lovely setting. They do French classics extremely well but also a very good Western brunch on weekends. The wine list is constantly changing and Otta, the owner, knows it inside and out. Restaurant seats about 40 inside, 10 outside.
