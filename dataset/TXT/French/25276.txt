Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Excellent food and just as stellar service.  This place was wonderful.
Started off with the Spicy Crab Salad and Seared Duck Foie Gras (both must haves).. and then for the main courses, went with Maine Lobster "Au Curry" and Filet Mignon Rossini.  The lobster was tasty but that filet mignon was taken to a new level being paired with the foie gras.  It just melts in your mouth.. like butter.  
We were there for a special occasion and our waiter was super attentive and helpful.  Nice Hawaiian guy so maybe we had a connection there.  On top of it all, he even asked the chef to sign our menu!
