B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA We went for lunch on a weekday and having been a big Tapino fan I was a little disappointed by the limited menu.   My husband had the croque monsieur and I had the duck rillete both of which were really good and well priced but when we looked at all 3 of their menus I couldn't find anything that shouted wow I really want to go back and try this.   The staff were great, the food and atmosphere were good but I think I was expecting a more tapino-esque menu.  I know the owner/chef is very talented and  is starting over in this new location, I hope he does well.  The restaurant is small so I would recommend reservations.
