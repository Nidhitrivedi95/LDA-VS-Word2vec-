We were looking for a nice dinner in Montreal and spent quite a while looking for someplace more 'upscale' in the downtown area. The menu here looked interesting - Italian,  seafood, a French flare - so we tried it out. No lines, no waiting, BYOW - all good. 

I hadn't tried this place before so didn't know what the mussels were like but really wanted to try them. I think I made the right call by getting the mussels as an appetizer instead of an entry. They were absolutely delicious and they give you plenty, but just personally would prefer a meat/pasta dish as an entree. 

I got the veal marsala as an entree. The sauce was yummy but the meat was a little tough. I won't hold that against them. I would definitely recommend Restaurant l'Academie to anyone looking for a reasonably priced upscale dinner and enjoys mussels.
