YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g LAS VEGAS RESTAURANT WEEK!!!

$20.00 3 course lunch!!!

I wanted to hit a bunch of places for LVRW, but i could only make it to this one plus dinner at Del Friscos. I read some previous reviews that this place used to be alot more high end, and made some changes to make this more of a tapas place with a bar. It definitely looked more price friendly and $20 for 3 courses was a steal!

I started off with a nice caesar salad, complete with a tiny anchovie and yummy fontina and brioche croutons http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=i2U5iJLxkTWXSHQAdivVNA

The shortrib sandwich was next http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=LcQPsvafLFyw9GLqWZMl9Q.
It was almost like a bahn mi. Bread was yum and shortrib was tasty. I enjoyed it better when i put some of the coleslaw into the sammie. 

Lastly was some tasty sorbets for dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=rWJOt4nICtNbUqEqtZaIIQ

We also added an order of the Cuban Panini. I wished we had ordered the tuna tacos instead. The panini i think would have tasted better with some bacon in it. hahaha. The bread was a little too heavy. HOWEVER the FRIES were amazing!!! I think they were twice fried in duck fat or something, cuz i seriously started to break out after i ate some. But it was yummy!
