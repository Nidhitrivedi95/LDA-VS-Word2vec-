rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I was expecting a lot more from Thomas Keller.  While my meal here was definitely enjoyable, it was a far, far, cry from transcendental.  I avoid chicken dishes like the plague, except at French restaurants, and the Poulet Roti was fine, but just fine.  Nothing really popped out: the chicken was just fresh enough, the flavor was just inspired enough, and the presentation was just interesting enough.  Eh.

Service was great, however, and so were the oysters.  But the meal was too expensive to warrant these positive impressions...
