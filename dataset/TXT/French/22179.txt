BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I came here for lunch and really enjoyed dishes made from local fresh ingredients. Service was friendly and I really liked the way the server presented lemon plate when I asked a slice of lemon for my water. 

For appetizer, I ordered tuna tartare - avocado, crème fraîche, jalapeño pesto, sesame crisp.  Tuna was fresh and went well with avocado paste. Great appetizer to share, I thought it would be nice to have before start drinking (tuna and avocado help)

I ordered pasta bolognese - beef, pork, veal, tomato ragú for my lunch. I asked them to boil pasta al dente and they actually delivered pasta al dente. Sauce was very meaty, I became full a half way through my lunch. Very flavorful sauce indeed.

My friend ordered seafood salad - crab salad, marinated squid, shrimp, orange vinaigrette, after I saw the salad and I smelled nice squid, I secretly wished I was the one ordered the salad. I had a bite of squid and it was so tender and flavorful, would have enjoyed eating the whole salad myself. Perhaps next time I will order this salad for me.

For desert, I ordered tiramisu. I knew I was going to do exercise a lot that weekend, I truly enjoyed my tiramisu guilt free. Love the texture of mascarpone cheese and coffee flavor.  Did you know tiramisu has a meaning "pick me up" and "cheer me up"?  No wonder why I am always happy after eating tiramisu.... Must be the chocolate/cocoa.  And YES, their tiramisu was soooooo gooooood.
