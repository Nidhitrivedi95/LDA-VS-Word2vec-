When being seated all chairs are pulled out for each dinner party member and napkin placed on lap, silverware was clean, complimentary bread was always hot and served with room temperature butter, also provided cleansing palette treat before first course, meal was fantastic, liked the nice touch of keeping the food covered until everybody received there meal.
