The atmosphere was trendy, but not pretentious. The decor was cool...The crowd was business yuppy-ish when we went in for lunch yesterday.

Let's talk about some other things... I ordered the seared white tuna entree... which was not in fact, seared but rather well done. It was accompanied by toasted sesame seeds, pomegranite seeds, orange and many unidentifiable Canadian veggies...something I was told was similar to spinach and a rhubarb-like item, as well.

Our server was slow and unable to translate some of the items on the menu...but I feel she meant well.

Many items on the table had an antique feel, but not in a good way. The glasses were the same I grew up with in the 80's -- quite ugly actually. The steak knife had a wooden handle and looked as if it quite possibly held bacteria for as long as the glass had been around. The bowl the soup was served in was somewhat french onion-ish -- beige with a brown half. 

There were some ACTUAL antiques which were cool... like a type writer by the entrance. 

I'd give this place another chance, but considering what I describe above, the prices are a bit over the mark...
