YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Came here for a friend's 30th bday where his wife arranged a pre fixed menu. For $90 a head we had a 3 course meal, 2 options for 2 course. A risotto in the middle...DRUMROLL -- all you can drink booze.

The salads and apps were great. The cheesey risotto was nailed. The braised pork melted in my mouth. The service was pretty friendly ,but did botch bringing out the food at the same time and missed some other slam dunks  -- but overall it was really nice.

Private area, all you can drink booze -- which when they technically cut us off after our tank of a booze hound drank half a fifth of Cognac.But we did some major  The food was good and my experience was only for a price fix 3 course dinner, but overall I only felt it was a deal ONLY because we kept the mixed drinks coming.
