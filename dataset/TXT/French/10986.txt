4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was still so full from lunch, the only thing I could handle ordering was the sea scallops gratinees.  Which ended up being one of, if not the absolute, best thing I have ever eaten in my life.  They are so delicious!  

They sat me directly adjacent to, within arms-reach of, one of the wine carts which--hah, if they had known me at all--is a big mistake!  Luckily I was in a martini mood, and the one I tried (with blue-cheese stuffed olives, I forget the name now) was great.  

The restaurant was gorgeous, and I didn't really notice the Bellagio fountains from our seat between the inside area and patio, but it was a beautiful day either way. All of the staff were so friendly and happy, which only made the experience all the more inviting and pleasant.
