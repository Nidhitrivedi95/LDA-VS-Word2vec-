FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Holder has a great air to the restaurant. It's very open and large but still, conceded a douillet feeling.  The menu is expansive and offers a great deal of variety. Our server was very welcoming & accommodating to our needs--my friend has a gluten allergy. The beef cheeks a la bourguignon were excellent and prepared as though I were in a hole-in-the-wall in France. Everything was seasoned in a manner that lent to flavor, without overpowering the foods. Holder's finest quality remains that their food stands alone- no theatrics were implied, just purely & sublimely prepared dishes.  I started with the tartare which was also fresh & clean. The only issue my guests and I came across were the drinks. We ordered several drinks, mostly wine. However, all the cocktails that were ordered seemed to be poorly made. The cosmo had the color and overpowering flavor of cranberry & the sidecar was too bitter-- too much citrus, perhaps. I will order beer and wine the next time I come! I typically order creme brulee when it is available. If you eat here, you must order theirs! The custard was loaded with actual vanilla bean speckles. However, it is hard to choose because all their other desserts blew our entire table away. I will visit again on my next trip to the area.
