QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Not mind-blowing in that it is just not as intimate a place like Bocata a few blocks west, but very good French-style cuisine in a rocking place.  Guitarist/singer was rocking out in a romantic sort of way.  Our table had Caesar salads, endive winter salad, and I had foie gras to start.  The foie gras was truly awesome.  

Entrees were mussels, duck confit, and braised lamb.   All very good.  Desserts were fondant chocolate, tarte tantin, and tiramisu.  All were very tasty and I'd go back, especially with a group or with well behaved kids.  Not quite the right place for an intimate evening, but a great place for a fun and delicious evening.
