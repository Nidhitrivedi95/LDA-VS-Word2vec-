HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw The team took me to Comme Ca for lunch this past Friday and we had a great time.  When we arrived, we were walked to the back of the restaurant, where we can see the outside of the strip.  It was quite a nice view.  Our server was very attentive.  My ice tea was not very icy so she immediately switched it out with one that had more ice.  

Onto the food.

The bread sticks (on the house) were warm and tasty.

The duck confit cinnamon roll was shared and it was very delicious.  I really enjoyed this started.  The creme anglaise and raspberry compote worked so well with the duck confit infused cinnamon roll.  This is something that I will order again next time.  DELICIOUS.  Though majority of the table didn't enjoy it as much.  If you are adventurous, do try!  The sauce was so delicious that I started dipping the bread sticks to eat the sauce.

For my lunch item, I chose the house smoked salmon croissant.  I ate half of my croissant sandwich and I was stuffed.  I took it home and ate it for breakfast this morning. It was still delicious.

I am a fan of Comme Ca, and will come back to enjoy it with my fiance.
