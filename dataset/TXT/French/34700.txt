HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw I needed a place that could seat 12 for a birthday dinner.  Because I'm a slacker and didn't make reservations sooner than later, my options were limited.  So what I'm trying to say is this place was not my 1st choice.  But the menu looked good and Cosmopolitan was convenient for us.  

I had the french onion soup - very tasty, a tad on the sweet side and a TON of cheese, which isn't always a good thing.  I also had the tomato tart.  Bites with the goat cheese were good, but it was a little dry.  Amongst the rest of the group, it was mostly the hand cut pasta, bass and trout.  Didn't hear any major raves or complaints.  4 ditched out on dinner (thanks a lot, probably could have gone somewhere else!) so for the 7 of us - dinner ($166.00) + two bottles of wine ($88.00) + tax ($20.57) and auto gratuity ($45.72) our bill was $320.29.

Our waitress was nice, not overly friendly though.  The rest of the staff were attentive, but cold.  Maybe that's a "fancy" restaurant thing that we're not used to, but it was a little awkward for me.  Smile bro!

All and all it was ok, but wouldn't go again merely b/c of all the other options.
