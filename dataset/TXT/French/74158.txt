xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The view is spectacular! I was pretty toasted when I was here, but that didn't change the fact that my food was delicious. I had the chicken breast which is usually a great dish to fall into easily in a place filled with new and innovative foods, but I think it was better than the dishes that my friends ordered. The champagne was sparkling and it was a wonderful place to celebrate my friend's birthday. I will definitely go to this restaurant again with my friends when I live the crazy life in Vegas!
