A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g The macarons are homemade! I couldn't even find them homemade in Paris! They're delicious as well, so I highly recommend those. They give 15% military discount which is generous. Everyone is very nice in this little store, I recommend this place to anyone looking for a great bakery.
