BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I've had dinner a few times in the past year or so, and every meal has been really good and the bar area is really a must for a drink.
Today I stopped by for breakfast and while I only had a side of two poached eggs and toast, they were really good. 
Great service, unique atmosphere and really good food. Even my simple breakfast today was way above average. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!
