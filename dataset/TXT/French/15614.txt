6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Delicious crepes with the cutest decor! But BEWARE!!!! It is hard to find this place if you have never been or have seen it before. It took my family and I 2 hours to find this place..... the food was worth it though. If you are looking for a place to find "fast" food then this is not where to go. As it is hard to find and a very long line.
