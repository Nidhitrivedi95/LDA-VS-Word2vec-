xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w The food is incredible and delicious. The FOOD is amazing. Yeah, it's a small restaurant and the wait can be a little long, because the demand for the food at this restaurant is high. Why wouldn't it be? It's delicious. Trust me. It's worth the wait. Appreciate the small restaurants, they care more about the quality of the food. No, but really, it's fantastic.
