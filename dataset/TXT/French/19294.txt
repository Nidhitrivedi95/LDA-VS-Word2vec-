aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Well, it's Bouchon.  Do I really need to say more?

My girlfriends and I had brunch in the morning at Bouchon, and knew of the bakery.  It was a must on the way out, on our way home from Vegas.

We had chocolate croissant, brioche, sticky bun and cheese danish already as part of our breakfast pastry plate while in the restuarant, but I wanted to get some macaroons.

I got the variety pack - I've completedly devoured the strawberry one, and parts of the chocolate and pistachio so far.  OH MY GOODNESS!  So good.  

Next time while in Vegas, if I don't have the good fortune of heading to Bouchon for some brunch and only want a pastry or two, with some coffee, I'm definitely heading here!
