4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We went here for dinner and opted to seat inside (the weather outside was an excruciating 112), turned out be an excellent choice. We were pleasantly surprised on how generous the servings were. For starters we had the escargots, we enjoyed it, although we never had escargots cooked that way before. We also both ordered steak frites which we both enjoyed. And the fries, the best we've had by far. So thin and crispy. We had tarte tatin for dessert, it was delicious but a little too sweet and by that time we hardly had room in our tummies anyway. Their mojito was also pretty good, strong and very minty. Our server was very nice, attentive, generous with the bread. Ambiance was also nice, cozy and romantic, depending where you sit. We will come back here and recommend to friends for sure.
