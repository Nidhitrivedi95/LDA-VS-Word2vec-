My sister and her hubs wanted to try this place since they're fans of Hubert Keller from his stint on Top Chef Masters, so we booked a late dinner on our Vegas trip a few weeks ago. Although the restaurant closes at 10:30PM, they assured us that was simply the deadline to put in your food order - which was nice since we arrived at 9:45PM and didn't want to feel rushed.  

We ordered almost everything that was stamped Keller's favorite on the menu (yes, I have no problem being a tourist) and he did not steer us wrong:
--White Onion Soup: They kindly split this into shot glasses for our party so we could share without any of the awkwardness - nice touch and we LOVED it!  Creamy, pitch-perfect onion flavor to get your tastebuds going.  I wanted a boat load more.
--Grilled Octopus: Tender octopus with good Spanish flavors.
--Angus sliders: Tasty bites - you can't go wrong with caramelized onions and bacon.
--Fleur Burger - I don't know what we were thinking ordering the sliders AND the house specialty burger (#burgermonsters) - but this was phenomenal.  I wanted to order it with the foie gras and truffles ($35 extra), but my table mates objected to my gluttonously wanting to buy a $70 burger.  Boo hoo - and fair enough - 'cause when it came, the burger was so utterly delicious and rich (due to the juicy wagyu beef and meaty abalone mushroom on top) that it was satisfying and decadent without the add-ons.  
--Lomo Saltado - The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare with a good sear and subtle glaze - but not a particular show stopper.  Strangely enough, we all loved the Peruvian fried rice that came as the side, which we hadn't paid much attention to when ordering.   
--Dessert: Orange Souffle - Nothing out of the ordinary but a very well executed classic french soufflé with a cream sauce that pleasantly finished off the meal. 

The decor is a bit wonky - feeling mall-ish with exposed brick and a giant painting of a blonde big boobed woman in a negligee with her head cut off overlooks the dining room (what is up with that) - but the food is the star here and really hit the spot!
