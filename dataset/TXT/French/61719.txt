sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Global is an unexpected treasure in the heart of Pineville.  The food, service, and atmosphere were all top notch. I had chilled corn soup, sea bass and chocolate panna cotta. My husband had the a heirloom tomato salad and the sea bass. Each dish was perfection. Will definitely be back.
