gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA This was our second time. Used the travelzoo voucher for a prix fix. The portion size is super small. Small portion of lobster bisque, a couple of slices of rib eye steak and desert ( which we declined) and had a small assortment I cheese instead. The food was good but the portion size was so small it was not worth it.
