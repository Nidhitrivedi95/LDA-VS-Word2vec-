ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug This place was ridiculous! We came here on a Saturday for brunch and we waited an hour or so for lunch! Everything on the menu is pretty self explanatory I mean eggs, crepes, fruit plates how difficult can these things be right? Well, I guess it was difficult. It took a long time for our food to get to us and when our food did finally get to us it took a long time to get the check. Our waiter kept trying to make small talk with us to help with the waiting but he didn't do a good job because he made us even more upset that we were waiting for so long. 

The duck crepe was good but I definitely would not wait an hour for it!
