rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A A pleasant Sunday mid-AM breakfast with my favorite (only) daughter = fabulous. Every good thing others have posted about food, service and ambiance was true. The outdoor patio seating was perfect. We may have just been fortunate but there was no wait for a table. Will definitely look to return next time I'm in town.
