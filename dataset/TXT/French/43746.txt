m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA When my husband and I were looking for a nice place to have mimosas and breakfast we stopped in and asked if they did in fact have mimosas... they did we stayed and ordered mimosas and a crepe... upon enjoying the patio and lovely convo.. the owner was rude and not friendly at all.... service was not good, others were asked if they wanted more ice tea... which my husband had and never got a refill!! We left and did not leave a tip as the service and owner attitude was horrible!! As we left the owner flipped my husband the bird!! Totally unacceptable!!
