ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I was with a party of 4, everyone else had breakfast. They said that their breakfast was good. There's no way you can mess up breakfast. I had lunch the turkey croissant with avocado. That was good, great taste. Ambient was casual. Noise level. Not bad. Do i recommend this place. Yes/no. Yes for this turkey croissant and for the breakfast (which doesn't have much options) no because like i said. Not to much options. But go for it and give it a taste.
