REbr-5VuKm9yGFWstjuceg I have always had a good experience at Jimmy Johns.  This was the first time at this location.  We were greeted when we walked in which was nice.  After our sandwiches were prepared I asked for napkins and was told they are at the end of the counter.  I looked at the end of the counter and realized they were on the inside counter. I had to reach over the counter to get napkins.  She was so busy doing nothing that she couldn't hand me napkins.  My fiancee and I sat down and noticed a guy walking in who was about ready to start his shift giving the middle finger on both hands to the employees inside.  Also, the employees were so loud we couldn't hear our conversation. They were also swearing in their conversations.  I will never visit this location again.  No proffessionalism. I strongly suggest if you have kids, go to another location.
