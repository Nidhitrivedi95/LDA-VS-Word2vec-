mVZoin0a8uTZgLsgJ9iNDQ The Grain Store sits on the first floor of a building on the colourfully curved Victoria Street. Inside, it is tastefully decorated in a rustic style and the ambience is intimate and romantic. The menu aims to showcase Scottish produce (local wherever possible) and it does this superbly, everything is freshly prepared and served up to you simply and stylishly. The menu changes regularly, when I was last there I had mackerel done three ways (smoked, pickled and cured with capers and lemon) - a classically Scottish dish with a twist, done very very well. 

The staff are knowledgeable, professional and friendly - the wine that was recommended went well with my meal and the price of the bottle wasn't too much of a shock.

The Grain Store represents all that is good with Scottish cuisine today and obviously this comes at a price, but it is a price worth paying.
