Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Food was not too bad. Could have been a little warmer. The service was what earns this place a 1 star review. I wont write an essay since ill be echoing the bad reviews on here, just please avoid this place. The staff is lost, confused, rude, incompetent and the waiter with the curled up mustache is a pissy little person and was giving us attitude after we were overcharged because of their mistake. Definition of a tourist trap.
