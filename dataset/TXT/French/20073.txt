aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Bouchon Bakery is always a win in my book. I've tried the one in Yountville, and regretted not buying more cookies to take home, so I went to the one at the Venetian to stock up. First, we found the small location underneath the elevators, and they were closing and didn't have much left. They referred us to the location near the clock tower, and after stopping for directions twice and walking in circles for 30 minutes, we finally found it. They were also about to close, but they had enough goodies left to satisfy my needs. 

I purchased a blueberry muffin (gone the next morning), a Better Nutter (I think that's what it's called - that one made it back to Colorado with me), an oatmeal cookie, and a chocolate chip cookie (also made it back to Colorado), and two Oh-Ohs (gone within minutes). It was all amazing. Now I'm fat, but it was well worth it. Now I have done the proper research to prepare me to make every single one of the recipes in the cookbook.
