_eHg2Euw1012ClZWzZ-TXQ Wow! I am not sure my words or pictures will do this restaurant justice. Being a one star Michelin restaurant I walked in with very high expectations. From the minute I arrived until I left, my expectations were completely exceeded. Talk about attention to detail. I walked in they greeted be by my name. And walked me to my table(I was rolling solo). They then offered a glass of champagne and being that I was celebrating a big milestone in my career I was going all out. I chose the sparkling Rose from Germany. After my drink order was situated they brought a few small bites to showcase what I had to look forward to. From that little teaser I knew I had some amazing food to look forward to. Again being that I was celebrating a big milestone I chose the 7 course with wine pairing. For each course they would bring out the wine and explain why this wine will pair with what I was about to eat...very spot on. With everycourse it just kept getting better. Each course was a beautiful piece of art packed with immense flavor and the wine truly paired amazingly with each offering. the seven course is definitely a lot of food so if you are not super hungry I would recommend going with fewer courses. I can truly say I felt I definitely got my monies worth(be advised with a Michelin one star, also comes prices to accompany this great and deserving achievement)
