They have a great variety of beers on tap from all over, though it's always great to see locals being thrown in that mix!  The bartender seemed to be pretty knowledgeable about the different beers and if you're not as informed about your micro-brews, he seemed to be a great source of info!  If you don't see anything that wets your appetite out of a tap, their extensive beer cooler is bound to cure your thirst.  Though I didn't go this route, they had an intriguing idea of flavored infused vodkas.  

To go with their abundance of brews, their menu had something for everyone as well.  The fish tacos were real tasty, but a little to wet.  Though I hate using it as an excuse, I was able to look past this since there were a huge group ordering just after us.  I was happy that they didn't go away from the authenticity of the tortilla.   

All and all, I will definitely be a repeat offender here and wouldn't send anyone anywhere else before facing the shopping crowds!
