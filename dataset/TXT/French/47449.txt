O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Wonderful brunch either sitting in their well decorated interior or on the patio overlooking the hustle bustle of the strip. 

Prices were reasonable for Vegas and service was very good. 

Food was very good and no one had any complaints. I ordered the salmon and locks and portions were great and everything was fresh. 

Another thing to note is their bloody mary cart. Pretty crucial after a long night at the tables.
