i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Used Yelp to find this place since I was in the mood for a REAL sandwich..not from a chain. I ordered the Salami and Asiago cheese. Wowow!! Very good and LOVED the Asiago cheese. All sandwiches come with mustard, lettuce, tomato, onions and vinaigrette. Really good flavor. I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. Also picked up lasagna for dinner and will review that later. I'll be back! .
