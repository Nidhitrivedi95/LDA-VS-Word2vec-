gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Went here for Restaurant Week 2012. The atmosphere is very nice and since they are located at the top of the Palms hotel you get an awesome view of the strip (very romantic). 

 I ordered from the Restaurant Week tasting menu. I had the the beef tenderloin with jumbo shrimps (delicious) with the chilled potato and leek vichyssoise for the appetizer (rich, yet refreshing) and chocolate coeur a la creme with orange cream for dessert (very rich). 

We also ordered their escargots du burgogne and crab cake.  The escargots was drenched in butter and garlic, as it should be. Very tasty, rich, and tender. The crab cake although a little pricey ($18 for one cake) is well worth it. It barely had any filler and was practically all crab meat, plus it was light as air. 

Service was fantastic and the servers were very attentive to our needs. Be prepared to spend a couple hours for dinner. This place isn't slow, it's just a place where the food comes out at a pace where it should be savored and enjoyed.
