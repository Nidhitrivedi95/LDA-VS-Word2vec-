4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi was the place we selected for brunch on Easter Sunday.

I absolutely must say thank you to the hostess who held our table for us when we called to say we would be late due to the valet being full. I had no clue that valet could be full but apparently, that's a thing that can happen. Anyway, we were fifteen minutes late and they still held our table for us. That's pretty darned awesome!

Our table was at the window line looking out onto the Bellagio fountains. It was a holiday and so there was a large show every thirty minutes and minor shows every fifteen. So we were able to watch eight different water shows during our two hour brunch. Yes, we are the grazers that drink and eat slowly and enjoy our time. I'd say I'm sorry but it would be untrue.

Our only issue with Mon Ami Gabi, the food was forgettable. I cannot for the life of me remember what I had. I think I had French Toast but I could be wrong about that. Regardless, at those prices I'd like to at least remember what I had (outside of the coffee and mimosas).

Anyway, overall this place was great for a mid morning spent watching people, water shows, and enjoying our friends and their company.
