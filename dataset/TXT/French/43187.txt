Alex was the most expensive bet we placed in Las Vegas, and we definitely ate the jackpot.  It was just course after course of brilliant, gorgeous food pared with exquisite wines. Just when I believed I couldn't eat another morsel - the spectacular dessert finish arrived beginning with a palate cleansing ice cream I would eat from a pint and ending with a package of brightly colored macaroons to eat later - the methadone to ween us off this edible heaven and back to the garbage that is everything else.

I deeply believe if you do not walk away from Alex having had an unforgettable experience - barring some freakish mishap - the problem is unfortunately you (or your dinner companion).
