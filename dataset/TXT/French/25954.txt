d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q I bumping up one star. Changes have been made but still we are not there. I;m glad they got rid of the previous chef but they need to try a little harder. Last night dinner was ok but nothing like I would expect from DB. 
Cheese plate - excellent (of course)
Blue cheese wedge - embarrassing, under dressed and scarce
eggplant & hummus - good

Seafood Pasta with bottarga - ok but where is the bottarga? When pointed to the waiter he said that was in there somewhere. I'm sure it was but in microscopical quantity. Also not very well presented, with sliced shrimp, no passion on putting together.

Potato lyonnaise. embarrassing

Souffle grand marnier  - highlight of the meal, only item that should have DB name on it

madeleines - not good at all. Used to be the best thing on the menu, last night they were small, sad looking, wrinkly. no.

Please go back to do whatever you were doing as soon as you open. thank you!
