HiMb8cwGsnFVwYxt1h0RCg I ordered the goat cheese Eggs Benedict and it was by far the most amazing brunch ever! Goat cheese, caramalized onions, pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce on a toasted English muffin... Absolutely unforgettable! AND it came with bacon, ham, sausage, baguette, and herb potatoes with the largest most fresh fruit "cup" and coffee! Also a great balcony to eat on that overlooks le Parc de Fontaine. Go here!!!
