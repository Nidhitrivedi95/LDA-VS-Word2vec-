htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I had made a reservation for two for 6pm and realized restaurant opens for dinner just then. It was a bit weird to have to wait outside to go into restaurant given we had arrived and expected to be seated at 6pm. Seating is limited here and service was slow. 

However, food was delicious. The taco appetizer was a great recommendation by the server. We had the udon carbonara and chicken and waffles as entrees which were very nicely plated and tasty. 

Overall, food was great but experience could have been better.
