3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw We went here last night for our 5 year wedding anniversary & I can't tell you how disappointing the experience was. About 6-7 years ago Mimi's was a hot spot with excellent French food & great service. Not anymore. The only thing we ordered that I really enjoyed was the peach mimosas. For starters we ordered the deviled eggs. They were definitely pre-made & not fresh. There were 9 total: Supposed to be 3 bacon & chive, 3 "mimosa", and 3 with pickles & capers. They were all bacon & chive. We also ordered a kid's size mac & cheese to share for an appetizer. It was a bowl of overcooked penne with way too much watery "cheese" sauce. There was no bacon or Parmesan crust & it wasn't appealing at all. My husband ordered the fish & chips for his meal. The fries were soggy & the fish mediocre and the plating presentation was sloppy at best. I ordered a French dip sandwich with French soup for my entree. I was expecting a French restaurant to at least get these items right. NOPE. Not even close. The sandwich was not on a baguette & I only got au jus after I asked for it. The bread was a soft untoasted hoagie roll & the meat was cold, unflavorful & tough. So gross. I literally took 2 bites then brought the rest home for my dogs. The French soup was salty & overheated. There was something firm in it that resembled sausage but after poking it with my spoon I deduced that it was a piece of bread or toast. Everything tasted old & reheated. We refused dessert after the train wreck meal we just had. I don't even think they would have gotten dessert right. The service was also complete crap. Our server cared nothing for any of his tables (he only had 3) & spent more time in the kitchen that actually serving. I will never patronize this establishment again & I urge all the Yelpers out there to do the same. It was a total waste of money & we could have gone to a way better restaurant for the cash we spent there.
