SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg While I have never come here for a sit-down meal, I do come in once or twice a week for a coffee or a croissant. The latter is why I give this place five stars. Having been noted by popular Torontonian media as "The Best Croissant in the City", it was necessary that I try this place out. It does not disappoint. Both the cheese and plain croissant are buttery and incredible, and I consider it a treat to be able to grab one of these puppies for breakfast. Highly recommend.
