cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg If I could give 3.5 stars I would, but our experience was not a 4.  The space is tight, but not terrible or a turn-off.  The servers were not the nicest or most helpful of our trip.  The open kitchen is cool but also adds to the already crazy amount of noise in the dinning room.

We started by trying to order wine, but the waitress was not very helpful or interested in making recommendations.  Also, all of the reds were served chilled, which we were not fans of.  The beer selection is OK, but non of the brews are that great.

The single dish that was the best of our trip and bumped up this place's total rating was the onion soup.  The was piping hot, super flavorful with lots of soft onions and huge chunks of bacon.  The broth was the best onion soup broth we have ever had.  The melted cheese and bread chunks were also an added bonus.

After this starter, our hopes were super high.  Unfortunately, two dishes we were interested in ordering, the Happy Pork Chop and the PDC Cut were both out.  It was Friday at 6pm - how are you out?!  My wife settled for the Duck Margret which was a medium (she would have preferred more rare) cooked breast with a wine and mushroom sauce.  She said it was just OK, and after I tasted it I agreed.  Not bad, not good, nothing special.  

My meal was much better.  I had the special: table side risotto, made INSIDE a huge Parmesan wheel, with peas and chunks of bacon.  It was very cheesy and delicious, but made table side also meant it was not tasted or flavored or seasoned as well as it could have been.  It was very good, but could have been better.

After the amazing soup, the rest of the meal and service was a let down.  We expected so much coming in but left disappointed, which is a shame because it wasn't a bad meal but it also wasn't a great meal.
