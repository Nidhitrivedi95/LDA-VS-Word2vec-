xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q OK so this is a designer crepe restaurant! 

I suspect they are more famous for their crepe embraced meals than the desserts.  But we went there for dessert. 

First off the staff were really great!  They explained how it works and were super nice.  It wasn't even annoying when they tried to upsell ;)

We ordered a banana Nutella crepe.   So you can't really go wrong with Nutella,  and the crepe was pretty tasty.... but their crepe was not as soft as other desserts.  Maybe it has to be this way in order to accommodate the eating style which is more sandwich than knife and fork.  But I prefer the soft melt in your mouth kind.

I probably need to go back and try something filling.  It was an interesting idea... 

The place is very small so probably better for takeout unless it's empty.  All in all I would likely go back and recommend it.. but there may be better options out there if you just want a soft dessert crepe! :p
