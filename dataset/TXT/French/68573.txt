vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Truly a spectacular meal. From service to food to atmosphere. Everything was more than we hoped for. Located inside the mandarin oriental hotel, this restaurant has amazing views of the strip. With modern decor and tasteful art, this French inspired restaurant dishes out some delicately flavored dishes that are presented beautifully. 
This once rates Michelin restaurant still keeps up with the service of white glove service and a beautiful pre fox menu that's worth ordering. They do have a la cart but both my husband and I chose to do the $85 5 course vegetarian menu which was more food than we knew what to do with. One of the best deals for the level of food we received. Mine was vegan and gluten free and he chef was able to make changes that didn't feel like it lacked creativity. My favorite course the green curry soup with vegetables which was clean and simple and seasoned to perfection. 
 
Highly recommend! Get a table by the window and this is the perfect date night meal or special anniversary meal. 

Our last course consisted of five desserts per person which we were so thrilled about. Amazing!
