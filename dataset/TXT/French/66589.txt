uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Ranks among my top ten as a phenomenal 'gastro' (to use a much abused term) experiences having dinner in restaurants on vacation. Why you ask? Despite the other tempting caveats like 'locally sourced, seasonal, farm to table' the Robin family brings it to your table because they know only ONE way to do it: avec amour! 
If the food, exuberant staff and pleasant vibe doesn't win you over you're not in the right place for dinner.
Set in a touristy downtown Montreal neighborhood with minimal parking and busy traffic, you might pass the restaurant without even knowing you did. We found Robin Square via yelp, yep, you guessed right. Despite the eclectic interior and slightly cramped seating upstairs our dining experience was excellent! The staff was on point with every nuance. Also nice to find the chef's sister waiting tables and enthusiastically responding to our inquiries regarding their business. 
Great things are ahead for Robin Square, especially if they expand and perhaps attract the Quebecois who may be reticent to venture near the inundated 'Anglais' downtown...if only they knew about the pride and passion that was going into the food just a few blocks away from their usual haunts! Je me souviens!
