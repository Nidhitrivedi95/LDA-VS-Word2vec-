xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Ok I guess I'm on the outs here, but I really wasn't impressed. Sure it looked nice inside and the bathrooms even had a sit down area for u to sit and do makeup. The main thing is the food and service-not the best. First they say we can't take you-not cool, Then someone else goes oh wait we can. Then they take us up elevator-cool. We ask to sit near the fountains overview-didn't happen and they weren't busy at all. I've had 100% better French Onion Soup at a non-French regular old diner joint than here. The French onion soup was creamy like a broc cheese/onion soup and no cheese/bread/or real onion just a thick puree. Secondly, service took forever and after 30 min of waiting for our meals when they weren't even busy at like 2:00pm they told us they were out of steak. So my fiance's mom had to pick something else when she thought we would be getting our meal by then. The blt was good but for the price no way! Only difference was they put avocado on their blt-big whoop and you can get blt's anywhere. I was expecting more exotic French foods. Not overpriced American food and crappy French version of French soup.
