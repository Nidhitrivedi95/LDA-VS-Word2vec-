Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ We had an excellent dinner there the other night.  We went with a bottle of 2009 gevrey chambertin clos prieur domaine roy marc.  It had a great bouquet and opened up nicely in the decanter.

The tag team waiter service was outstanding and made good recommendations.  Vicki went mushroom tart which had a very minimalistic crust and lots of good mushrooms.  A very light starter.  I went the other direction with the piglet risotto which was fantastic.  The mix of flavor and texture with the risotto, pork and foie gras shavings was great.

For mains, vicki had the suckling pig and i had the ocean delivery with the vegetables to share.  Vicki liked her dish but found it a bit tough.  The ocean delivery was a nice portion of halibut and seared foie gras which made for a perfect bite.  The highlight of the veg was the sweet potato carrot puree with chili oil.  Just a small kick from the chili.  

We rested with some cheese that was just the right size and finished our wine.  The cheese was warmer than we were used to but that gave it great mouth feel.  We had a fantastic blue cheese along with a goat and a hard cheese that was a mild gouda/comte.

For dessert vicki had the bud and i had the pur.  Bud was a strawberry rhubarb tart of which there was no sign when we left the table.  The pur was a rectangle of chocolate mouse with a sugar cookie (sable breton) on either side and some vanilla ice cream.  It was excellent.

And just when we thought we were done the waiter brought us apple ice wine with the bill.  It was nice and cold with a sweet but not too sweet flavor that cleansed the palate.

While not the most varied menu, this is a place where any eater will find options though vicki was a little put off by the foie gras on several dishes.

I would also say that you can be casual to dressy here in terms of attire. Yes its hip so i wouldnt go cutoffs and a t shirt but i wouldve felt comfortable in a variety of attire.
