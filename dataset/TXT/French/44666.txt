mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Went here after propossing to my now fiancée and had an incredible experience from start to finish. The oysters are the best we've ever had.  Consider the cheese to start even though it's on the dessert menu. BLT is a must. Duck margret and heart were very well put together and great for sharing. The pink peppercorn canolo and complimentary dessert bites finished the evening off perfectly. A congratulation card from the toqué team was a classy touch. Truly a 5-star restaurant.
