c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA Came here not for the food, but to relax on the terrasse and have a few drinks. 

Service was incredibly slow on a day that wasn't even busy. Cocktails were over sweet with not enough alcohol in them, not to mention overpriced. 

The waitress also brought our bill out with our drinks, and returned every 5 minutes asking if we were ready to pay. Not a place I would return to.
