YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Fleur de Lys is spectacular!  A bit on the pricey side but worth every dollar.  I had the Prime Filet Mignon with a recommend red wine (can't remember the name).  It is by far one of the best places to eat inside of Mandalay Bay.  I ate at China Grill (2 Thumbs down) and Strip Steak (2 Thumbs down) a few nights earlier.  I was hesitant in trying Fleur de Lys as I had 2 bad experiences with the other locations only a few feet away. 

The natural rose décor on the wall is amazing and defiantly worth checking out.
