3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Breakfast is great here but dinner...well that's another story. We had one of the most revolting dinners. Even the salad tasted odd and not fresh. The food was bland and tasteless. The waitress was very nice and service was a bit slow.The only bright spot was my son enjoyed his broccoli cheese soup. Skip dinner and enjoy their breakfast instead.
