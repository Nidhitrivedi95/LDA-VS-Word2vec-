4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Met the familia in Vegas for Xmas reunion and picked this spot for our Xmas dinner. Made a reservation for 9 ppl way in advance (thankfully since they were not taking walk ins till past 10 pm!). 

I never understood why restaurants refuse to sit a group until the whole party arrives. My PIL got a little lost and so we were seated a tad late but at least they didn't give up our table! ^_^

Our server Sarah was excellent and the bussers were great too. Food came out pretty steadily after we ordered. The food came in massive portions and are very well priced! 

I tried:

Fries - most of the mains came with their house cut fries that were more like potato chips! Crispy and quite addictive.
Crab Cakes - Not very good at all, mushy and blah...
Escargot - Very good
Duck Confit - Great flavours but not a confit, the skin was not crispy and fat was not rendered off.
Steak Classique - Steak was a little grizzly, the butter compound was delicious
Steak Bernaise - Steak was tough and chewy, bernaise was OK but a bit broken.
Roast Chicken - very good.
Rib eye - Seasoned very well, cooked to right temperature but grizzly
Salmon - Tad overdone but the spinach was amazing
Cod (Fish of the day) - Very good and cooked well
Scallops - Best dish of the night, even with the sweet butternut squash puree it was good.
Crepe - Good
Creme Brulee - blah...
Profiteroles - meh..

Not so descriptive since I pretty much tried every dish on the table (my family is great like that!!).
