nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ I headed over to the BIltmore to kill some time earlier this week and as I walked by Christopher's I saw a Lavazza coffee umbrella outside. This is one of my new favorite brands of coffee and decided to grab a cup on their outside patio. When I walked in I was a little worried that it would be too stuffy as the host was in a vest and tie and I was in shorts and a t-shirt. 

Fortunately he was very friendly and I enjoyed an entire French press of Lavazza (putting me pretty close to a heart attack with all the caffeine). Great service, free wi-fi and it was only $5 for what was probably 6 cups of coffee!

Thanks guys!
