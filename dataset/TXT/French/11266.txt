4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My gfs and I had brunch here and it was perfection. It was freezing outside, but the heaters on the patio were placed in a way that allowed us to eat comfortably and warmly outside. I ordered the carrot soup and shared a sandwich plate. Everything was seriously so delicious and generous in portions. Even the prices were extremely reasonable which was the biggest surprise of all. Our waiter was so nice and attentive. Since I've shied away from buffets when I go to Vegas, it's been difficult to find places that have decent food and doesn't cost a fortune. This place will be one of my new go-to spots when I'm in Vegas.
