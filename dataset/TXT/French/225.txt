-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Wonderful food and service! What a great find.  I can't believe  we've never been there. This is not one of those new, hot Scottsdale restaurants, but it's been in business for 23 years for a reason! I went with my family of 5 and every one of us loved our dish. The decor is a bit outdated but it was quiet and comfortable which is hard to find these days. 

I had the lamb chops which was cooked perfectly, and I loved the white bean side that it came with. Two of our group had the fish which was also delicious. 

Our waiter, Julianna, was friendly and very knowledgeable. You can tell she loves her job. We left feeling like family and can't wait to go back again.
