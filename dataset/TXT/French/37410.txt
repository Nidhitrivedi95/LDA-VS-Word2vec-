j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q Unbelievably great food!  The Canard a l'Orange (Orange Duck) and the Tarte Tartain were the best I've ever had.  The Filet au Poivre likewise was superb, as were the Scallops au Gratin (Coquille St. Jacques).

A magnificent culinary experience!

Mild quibbles:  they need to train their staff a little better, and they need a bigger wine list.  Overall, however .. . . . this is a great place!
