fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA If I can give a 0 star to this place I would. I got tricked to go here by the fake four star review on Yelp. It's my second day in this excellent city and I was hungry and wanted find a decent place to eat fast. The menu here is extremely simple and I was hoping for something phenomenal because of the simplicity. The free bread was cold. The soup of the day (tomato soup) was alright. The steak was a shame. It comes with a retarded mustard sauce (I asked it to be on the side). The steak is a really bad cut (called streak loin), tasting tough even being cooked rare (let alone the amazing cow juice I was hoping for). There's no seasoning at all without the sauce n I had to add salt n pepper myself. As a meat lover, I think adding any sauce to a nicely cooked steak is a joke. The presentation of the dish is terrible, served on some cheap diner like plate. The meat itself also tastes kinda funny, with some sort of mild odor I couldn't figure out. The fries coming with the steak look even more diner n I didn't even bother tasting them. Because I was hungry n tired n the food was somewhat edible I didn't send it back to the kitchen (I'm also not a super fussy person), but I genuinely felt it was an insult to my stomach at the end of the meal. I expressed my disappointment to the server before paying n she said I should have sent it back. Whatever. I'm never coming back again and advising my fellow steak lovers not wasting your time, appetite, n $ (it's way over priced for what it is). Also, to the restaurant owner: r u really French??! This place is total disrespect to the so labeled "French food".
