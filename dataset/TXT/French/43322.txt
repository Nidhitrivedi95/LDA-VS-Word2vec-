LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw Four of us had a dining experience last night that was nothing less than dazzling. The rabbit pie was devoured by the world's pickiest eater who only stopped when the last morsel was gone. An artichoke appetizer and the salmon were perfect, as was a filet -- actually cooked medium rare as requested. The soup du jour, a chilled tomato/basil garnished with a hard cheese (parmesan? not sure) was creamy and flavorful. But the most surprising dish -- and the one that veered farthest from the industrial French sensibility -- was the tableside burger -- it was so interesting to watch the prep process and to learn the intricacies of the sauce Dianne that accompanied it. And the finished product redefined the concept of hamburger. Our only complaint was that the burger was too large and we were left with the enviable choice of finishing the burger or enjoying a Grand Marnier souffle. A terrible dilemma to be sure! Our server, Kyle, was attentive and responsive to our questions. We were interested in and elicited his personal story and it only strengthened our resolve to leave a generous gratuity (which is another way of talking about the donation to the Leadership Institute). The greatest compliment, though, was from our guests from NYC. Serious foodies, they had dined only a week earlier at the French restaurant at CIA in Hyde Park, NY. Their assessment: the meal at EDWINS knocked the socks off of the CIA. You can't really say anything more.
