xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Oh my god this place is so bomb! So my gf heard about this place from her friend and we decided to try it out today! It's located yonge and Steeles just north of Steeles and wow its the bomb. 

The food here are crepes! Not just your ordinary fruit or ice cream crepes, but savory crepes.  Yep that's right. So these savory crepes are like sandwiches, but crepe style! There's a lot of options for what to eat. Think of like a subway style crepe place just 3 times better! I ordered the p hilly cheese steak crepe and oh man it comes with roast beef, mushrooms, bbq sauce, cheddar cheese, arugula,  mustard,  jalapeños,  and maybe something else. That's all I could remember from the description. But imagine all that nice and piping hot! 

Definitely coming back for more!
