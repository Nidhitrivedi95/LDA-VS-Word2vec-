Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA FOOD REVIEW:

Heidi was our server, she was absolutely the sweetest. LOVE.

We went right when they opened so it was pretty empty. We got to see the sunset.. So beautiful! This place definitely would look better at night though. Sit down around 7:30pm.

Foie Gras, mint ice cream, waygu, and sea bass. The foie gras was amazing (what do those ducks eat?!) and the mint ice cream was a happy melody of all different kinds of mint such as spearmint and wintergreen. We got chocolate syrup and chocolate pearls as toppings. The waygu was delicious, fell apart nicely. The sea bass was light in flavor, really good though.
