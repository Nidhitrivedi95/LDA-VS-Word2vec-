cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Talk about a great dining experience. This place is a MUST VISIT. When looking at the menu one might think "why would I pay 44$ for duck in a can?" or " 39$ for a foie gras burger?"but trust me this place is worth every penny. If you are a visitor, or a local this place can't be beat! Love, love, love this place!
