8BT-nH2aWf6nyIdK797OHA It's Sunday in Toronto.  You want to meet a friend for brunch and chat. And you want a place where you aren't warehoused in and out the door in less than 45 minutes, while screaming your tonsils raw over ear-splitting music.
 
Not a dream. It's Avant Gout, by night a French-cum-Moroccan bistro with delectable menu. And by day - weekends only - it's arguably the most brunch-friendly eatery in the city. The classic Eggs Benny comes done to taste with rich Hollandaise and juicy rounds of peameal bacon served with a tender (no iceberg) salad, or cajun fries.  For sheer indulgence, it's the toothsome popping-fresh blueberry pancakes that melt under a drizzle of maple syrup. All served with brio and élan - and some of the city's best coffee, latte or espresso.
 
Another plus: breaking Toronto's rule of extortionate prices for pleasant food and surroundings, Avant Gout is surprisingly reasonable.  Best of all, you leave with a smile, not a day-long headache.
