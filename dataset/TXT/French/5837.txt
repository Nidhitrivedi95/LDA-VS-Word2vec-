3OCooCzHgsS2xHdN-dNVXg I've been to La Maquette twice and each time I left satisfied and with a smile. The last time we visited, my girlfriend and I ordered the Calamari to start, the Seafood Risotto and Black Angus Striploin as entrees, and the Citrus Cheesecake and Profiterole for dessert. 

From start to end, we enjoyed every bite. It's a thing of ours to try the Calamari wherever we eat and the calamari at La Maquette is so far the best we've had. My gf enjoyed her seafood risotto and the good sized portion she received, even having to ask for a to-go container, since she needed to save room for dessert. I should have taken a cue from her, because I ordered the steak and it was grilled perfectly, with each bite being as flavourful and the last, I finished every last bite. This made eating my profiterole more challenging then it should have been, but once I bit into its chocolate and pastry goodness, my stomach magically made room and I was able to finish it. My gf fell in love with the citrus cheesecake the first time we came here and she made sure to order it again. 

When we arrived, the hostess was quick to seat us on the patio, where there was a Flamenco guitarist playing, the first time we went, there was a pianist playing, they were both great at setting the mood. Our waiter was attentive and funny, even cracking a joke in Spanish with me. I'm surprised by the rating that La Maquette has, but everyone has different experiences. Fortunately, for me, my experience with La Maquette has been a great one.
