mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q The best meal we have ever had in Vegas.  Our waiter was so friendly, well versed on each dish, wine, events.  The food runners knew every dish, described them beautifully to refresh our memory and were just really nice.  We loved the layout of the restaurant so you get the Michelin rated food with a friendlier atmosphere and the most attentive service.

We did the $155 tasting menu and it was amazing.  Foie gras parfait was unique.  I have a new appreciation for heirloom tomatoes and the salad was a work of art.  The king crab was beautiful.  Langostine was perfectly cooked and left me wanting more.  The onion tart was outrageously good.  The salmon was my least favorite as it was a bit salty.  The quail stuffed with foie gras was beyond amazing and the cap steak was excellent.  Having two desserts seem quite decadent but we are on vacation and they were both perfection.  The  generous wine pairings were a perfect accompaniment to the tasting.

I highly recommend L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon!
