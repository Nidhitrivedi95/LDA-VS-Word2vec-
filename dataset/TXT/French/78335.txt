yVNaMEBUslR_7GbFhurJEg Booked H4C to celebrate baby's first birthday with a family brunch.  Because we were a big group (12 people) they offered us a set menu with pastries and coffee for the table plus a choice of five different main courses.  The pastries were brioche and donuts, made fresh on site, with five delicious spreads, homemade Nutella, caramel, cherry, strawberry and orange.  All equally tasty.  For my main, I had the trout gravlax, served with poached egg, avocado and a small salad.  Everything was excellent.  Coffee was very good too and the waiter did a good job keeping everyone's cup full.  The service was the best part, warm and attentive and personal.  They even made baby a little dish of scrambled egg which she devoured.  

It's a beautiful restaurant, in an old post office with high ceilings and feels elegant yet informal.  A real neighbourhood gem, thanks for making our family celebration so great!
