0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g My girlfriend took me to Picasso for my birthday dinner and although it was very pricey, the experience is something that I will never forget. The food, service, and scenery were all amazing. Some of the highlights were the Scottish Salmon with Cauliflower Puree, Veal Chop, Roasted Pigeon, and the Quail Salad. We had seats right in front of the Bellagio Fountains which made the atmosphere extremely relaxing and peaceful. I could not have asked for a better birthday dinner. If you don't mind spending a bit of money for a wonderful experience I would definitely recommend Picasso for any occasion. I can't wait to go back.
