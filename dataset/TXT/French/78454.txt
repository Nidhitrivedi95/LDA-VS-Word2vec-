YwBOJKaBp5Y8GzsTArlq-A YES ! This is just what Verdun needed - a perfect little spot for a beer with your friends and a-mazing food. Try the fish tacos, the burger or their fried seafood plate (calamari,shrimps and mussels). And make sure to sit on the cute & cozy terrace ! Oh, and they have TV screens inside to show the sports games, too !
