hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Extraordinary! Amazing freshly baked pastries,  coffee to die for,  and a great assortment of sandwiches.  The ambiance is inviting and clean,  and you can tell that a lot of love goes into the food. 

I tried the lox croissant which was fresh and delicious,  the croissant was made that morning.  I also couldn't help but take a piece of quiche and cheesecake to go.  The quiche was perfection even later, and the orange blossom cheesecake was soooo amazing I barely have words.  

They have a great outdoor seating area that's quiet and lovely.  Great spot for a quick lunch,  or long brunch.
