EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g Did the tasting menu - $105 for 10 courses and 2 cannapes. So worth the price for the quality of food and exceptional service!

Food is very creative and has a lot of high end ingredients like foie gras, black truffle, uni, and more.

Service is like dining at 3-Michelin star restaurant with water being refilled without asking, table being cleaned each course, staff pulling your chair for you when you leave and come back.

Really recommend this place. Lighting is dim unless you eat at Chef's Table.
