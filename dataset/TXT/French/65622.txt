U2S9n1asjTTI_EvBFBNnAw Great location.  Right on the square for great people watching.  Relatively affordable.  The ONLY place during our trip that featured a happy hour.  That's why we hit it up.  And the happy hour really only entailed a regular size beer for the price of a baby size beer, but whatever.  My husband had pizza; it was ok.  I had a pretty solid bowl of french onion soup.  It was A-OK by me!
