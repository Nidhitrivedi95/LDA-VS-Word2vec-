O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q This is my favorite late night restaurant. The food is delicious and the flavors are highly addicting, especially anything with the truffle yuzu. My favorites include the Nigerian prawn with truffle yuzu, baby octopus, grilled oysters, and rib eye with truffle bone marrow. The service is fantastic and the food keeps me coming back at least every 2-3 weeks. This spot is a must try and is comparable to many restaurants on the Strip.
