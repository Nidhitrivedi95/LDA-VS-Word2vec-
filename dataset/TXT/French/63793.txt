T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ Jules is as close to Paris as you can get in Toronto. It's not fancy but food is outstanding, especially the desserts. Wine list is not extensive but it has great choices. I like to sit at the bar and watch the cooks. Service is friendly and knowledgeable. Busy place so maybe reserve.
