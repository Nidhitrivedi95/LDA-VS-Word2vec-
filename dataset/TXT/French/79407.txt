Zl6csaZ5HBka3SKBphHXrQ I love this place!  I've been here once before for a regular dinner at this small bistro and while the service was slow, the food was excellent.  Yesterday, the place was closed down for a private function... mine!  My wonderful friends booked it for my bridal shower lunch and we had this restaurant all to ourselves.  So much love makes me a bit bias, but I truly have to say that this place does deserve its five stars.

The atmosphere is intimate and warm.  We had very attentive and friendly service.  The menu for the lunch included an appetizer, a main, dessert and coffee or tea.  There were about four choices for each category so there was bound to be something that everyone liked.  I got the pate for appetizer and a 'ploughsman' plate of proscuitto, pate, and salad.  Little did i know that the ploughsman plate was actually very much like the pate appetizer (had the same pate), but since it tasted so good, I didn't mind so much.  I got to sample my mother's spot on and very filling roasted red pepper soup as well.  For dessert, I had the creme brulee which along with the coffee was the perfect end to the meal. 

I would highly recommend MIDI for both regular dining and private functions.  Parking is plentiful on the streets and in the lots surrounding the area.
