AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw A dessert/coffee place across from Beijing Noodle #9, so its a perfect opportunity to neutralize the spicy, savory aftertaste from a bowl of Dan Dan Mian!

I liked how the place has many tempting displays of chocolate-themed desserts, along with a full coffee bar, gelato station, and crepe station.  We wound up getting the S'mores crepe, which had marshmallows, graham cracker crumbs, and chocolate sauce. It was pretty sweet and served hot iff the griddle which helped melt some of the marshmallows.  Overall not bad, though i think JP in Aria has better crepes.  

Would definitely try some of their chocolate desserts next time.
