I just came back for a birthday dinner with my sister, and brother-in-law, and we had a fantastic dining experience. 

We weren't in a rush, so the relaxed pace of service was fitting. Whenever we did need assistance, it came swiftly and attentively. Our server, Arslan, was patient and helpful, attending to all our questions and special requests.

As it was a special occasion, we went for the 3-Course Special: choice of salad, main, dessert and coffee - all for $35! And they were very accommodating with our requests for swapping options.

Everything we ate that night was phenomenal - great ingredients, portions and flavour. The meal started with complimentary amuse bouche of smoked salmon on salsa and basil. Then I had the goat cheese brûlée salad, lamb shank on garlic mash & veggies, and the dark chocolate pecan tart/pie. Others at my table also had the french onion soup, apricot salad, beef brisket, hazelnut meringue cake (tastes like a Ferraro Rocher in cake form), and the (ever flaky, light an delicious) poppyseed cranberry cheesecake/strudel. Everything was top notch. We were fully satisfied and even excited to have leftovers for lunch the next day.

This place continues to be one of our favourites! Highly recommend Apricot Tree.
