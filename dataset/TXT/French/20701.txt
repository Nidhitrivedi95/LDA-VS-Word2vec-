AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I heart macarons!  A friend brought me a bag of 6 of them after a trip to Vegas.  They're tiny but packed with almond flavor.  I'm usually not a fruit flavored person, my favorites were the raspberry and lemon.  The raspberry was pretty and pink with a fresh raspberry jam.  Then the lemon was light and citrusy with a chocolate ganache center.  But don't get me wrong - the dense chocolate was still amazing.

Like everything in Vegas, its pricey, but all their desserts are done beautifully and make great gifts from Vegas.
