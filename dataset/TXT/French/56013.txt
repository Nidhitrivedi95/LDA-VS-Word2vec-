rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Oh man, I really wanted to love this. But after having dined at Ad Hoc and Bouchon in Yountville this place pales in comparison to. The atmosphere was wonderful, and the service was immaculate. However, my food (the Moules au Safran) left something to be desired. I think they were too mustardy for me, which really overwhelmed the flavor of the mussels. Overall I just expected more mind blowing for something priced at $28.50. The bread that accompanied the meal was spectacular and I could've eaten two loaves myself easily. Some of my friends were disappointed in the portions of their dishes, granted they got appetizers and salads. However I agree, for the cost, one appetizer and a salad should provide enough food to make a meal. Everyone else that ordered a true entrée was fairly satisfied with what they purchased.

They also provide a complementary crème brûlée because it was my friends bachelorette party, which was really tasty and very nice of them. I would say, if you don't have a chance to go to another Thomas Keller restaurant, you might as well get a piece of the experience here. However if you try any of his Yountville restaurants, the food here would pale in comparison.
