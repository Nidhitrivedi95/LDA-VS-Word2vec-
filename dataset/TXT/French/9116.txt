-For Hors D'oeuvres, we had the Wild Escargots de Bourgogne.  The roasted snails with garlic-herb butter was so delicious, each escargot melted so softly in my mouth.  Do listen to yelp reviewers and order this!
-We shared the filet mignon (3 of the 3 ounces) and it was delicious.  Although, I do recall that we ordered it to be medium rare, the meat came out nearly well done.  Regardless, the meat was still good.  This gourmet meal was well prepared.  

Improvements:
-I wish we got what we asked for (medium rare filet mignon).  
-The bread was too hard, I had to peel it apart to eat the inside because it was scratching my gums.
-Atmosphere is nice but a little too dark.

Tips:
-Make sure you try the escargot!
-Make a reservation in advance to ensure a table.
