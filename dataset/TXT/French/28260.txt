The service is impeccable and the food is delicious.  This restaurant food reminded me of my honeymoon in France. The restuarant has been open for years and years. That should speak volumes, as there are so many restaurants that don't make it and close.  You can also go to restaurant.com and get purchase a  discount coupon for eating here or you can go to the restaurants web site and get a buy one dinner get one free.  Worth trying out.
