Went there tonight with my family since my mom adores lobster, only to be told after sitting down and ordering a bottle of wine that there were no lobsters left. It was only 8:30 pm! Our waitress seemed apologetic but she didn't offer anything as a consolation to my very visibly upset mother. As it is understandable that issues arise in a restaurant, it is crazy to think that they would not offer anything to make a customer happy! After about an hour, the rest of us had ordered other very good food, our waitress brought a single lobster for my mother. Ah, finally someone sees the value in customer service! She was satisfied.....
Only until the bill came with a charge for the lobster!!!! She did not order the lobster, how is it possible this waitress thought it was ok to charge us?!?! I don't think I have ever had such a terrible example of customer service at a restaurant in Montreal. I don't care how famous Martin Picard is or how good the food really is.... I would never go back and I urge all Yelp readers to not go to a place that sees no value in their customers.
