4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My table ordered the steak with bordelaise sauce. Overall a disappointing experience - the cut of meat was not great, the sauce was too sweet, and the dish tasted bland overall. The restaurant also mixed up two of our dishes, and we ungracefully switched our main dishes so we could get the right sides. 

There are much better restaurants on the strip - spend some more money and try one of those instead. Would not recommend.
