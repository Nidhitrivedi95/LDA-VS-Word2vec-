No complaints about the service, it was very fast.

I ordered the Greek burger. It came with pommes and a cup of ketchup/marinara dipping sauce. I only have two complaints: the meat could have used more seasoning and it was extremely rare. I don't know if they get their beef locally or if they prepare it in a way that makes it okay to be that rare. I'm adding a picture so that everyone can judge for themselves, keep in mind that it's a half eaten burger so it isn't going to look that pretty.
