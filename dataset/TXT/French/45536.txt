mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Our second visit and food was just as good as we can remembered.  The only exception is that we are not allowed to share a tasting menu any more.  I took away half a star for this policy change.  We like to sample a delicious meal and not stuff ourselves.  And as always, the food was exquisite and creative.  We sat at the bar and really enjoyed the busy kitchen show.  We also made some friends as these are mostly foodies who love fine dinning.

As for the other half star, it was for an incident during our last visit.  I was not on yelp then but did contact MGM Management about my concern of what I observed as an undesirable food handling practice but they never acknowledged my email.
