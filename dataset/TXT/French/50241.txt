The ribeye steak special  is probably my favorite option but the seafood is also cooked to perfection; you can't go wrong regardless of choice. Even their most simple recipes are executed in a way that satisfy the most demanding palates. The beer and wine selection is also good, you'll find something you like for sure. The meals are cooked to order so allow yourself enough time. The service is very friendly and the atmosphere is great.  As for the lunch menu, treat yourself to one of the panini sandwiches next time you're thinking of hitting a chain restaurant, instead.
