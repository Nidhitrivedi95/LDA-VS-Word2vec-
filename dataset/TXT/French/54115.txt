QvOyuo7qAsCU-LOo_g-jiw Big decline over the years. Went for Sunday lunch. Place was empty. The waitress wasn't particularly friendly. Didn't check on us very often or refill our water without being told. I got steak and fries. Asked for my steak rare. Whatever I got was at the very least a solid medium. It was also overly salty. Could barely taste the (tough) meat. Fries are good and well seasoned as always though. Very disappointed.
