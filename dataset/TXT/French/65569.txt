This quaint French cafe succeeds in carving out its own serene and peaceful alcove within the tumultuous concrete jungle.

I came here in July with a friend for drinks.  I already had enough caffeine for the day, so I ordered a hot chocolate, and tbh it wasn't that great - I remember it being fairly creamy and not very chocolatey. 

I was just truly impressed with the decor and ambiance of Le Neuf - it was a mini-escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.  We sat on the patio which has a nice view of the "park" that's across the street.

Unfortunately, I didn't try their food, but fortunately, that gives me an excuse to pay Le Neuf another visit.
