mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q So amazing.  I spent three two weeks in France earlier this year and this dinner was a throwback to all of the wonderful food I had across the pond.  The bread dish was fantastic and the French butter - lordy!  All of the courses were inspired, fresh and delicious.  Cocktails were fantastic.  

I want to recognize our server and I'm embarrassed that I can't recall his name.  He served us last Saturday evening at the bar seats and he has a man-bun.  He did something super cool - we ordered our tasting menu items at the start.  The lady seated next to us got a different dessert than I selected and it was GORGEOUS.  I kept ogling it and shortly before dessert, he brought me a menu and said "I believe you still need to select your dessert."  With all that was going on, I'm stunned he noticed and the way he let me re-select was super suave and classy.  
 
On top of that, all of the desserts had dairy so he got a dairy-free dessert from the next door restaurant for Husband. 

It was definitely a spendy meal but it's worth the experience.  I look forward to trying the signature restaurant next door.
