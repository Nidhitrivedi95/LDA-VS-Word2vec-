37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg I came here for their Sunday brunch (with half price bottles of wine), and had an overall excellent experience. 

The food was generally very good, the ingredients were high quality, and the flavours were all unique and delicious. My friend and I both agreed that their fish dishes were significantly more delicious than their meat dishes, and their vegetable dishes were okay, bordering on good.

Their wine list was great, and our waitress was able to make two excellent recommendations. 

I would highly recommend ordering their scallops as an extra; they were fantastic! As well, we ordered three cheeses with our dessert, another modification that I think elevated the meal.  

We paid $250 for 2 people with two bottles of wine, and extras including cheese and scallops. We left feeling very full and spent 3 full hours at the restaurant. In my opinion, the price was quite fair.

I'd recommend it, and I will be going back for dinner to see how it compares.
