vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Nice place, attentive staff, and good attention to detail in the kitchen.

We asked for a tasting menu, with wine pairings, and gave them no other guidance.  The meal they prepared was very appropriate in both the succession of flavors and the portion sizes.  Everything was very well prepared.

The wines were all very nice, but the pairings could have been better.  It seemed like the person who was preparing the food menu and the person who prepared the wine listing didn't actually talk to each other.

I could have lived without the series of employees who came by to socialize with the couple at the table next to ours for most of the meal.  Having to look at someone's ass for an entire course at a time really takes away from the ambiance of a place.

Overall, we were pleased by the meal, and will go back sometime.
