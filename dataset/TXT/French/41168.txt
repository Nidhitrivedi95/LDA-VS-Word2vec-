kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ The restaurant has a great location on the 2nd floor of the Colonade.  It is open and the stained glass ceilin was magnificient!  However, it was a little noisey and I wouldn't describe it as romantic or cozy... it had moe of a "bustling" feeling.  The tile floo is sweet and I can see that the vibe was auhentic french bistro...right down to he napkins! 
FOOD:  I loved the High Society cocktail.  It's expensive, but essentially 2 drinks (as they brought a side carafe of "extra").  The french onion soup was DELCIOUS.  Highly recommended.  My Mum had the salad which she raved about... Entrees-- I had the duck 2 ways, very very good.  Mum had the rainbow trout, also crispy flavorful and good.  We shared the brussel sprout side.  The apples and nuts in the roasted brussel sprouts made it perfect. Dessert-- chocolate lava cake and creme brulee.  Both excellent.
SERVICE: we had a rather reserved server.  She lacked wamth and was not very helpful, but it was acceptable.
