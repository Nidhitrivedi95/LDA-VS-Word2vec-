4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Really great dinner which I wasn't really expecting to be honest.  Had the scallops and my girlfriend had the steak which were both cooked perfectly.  We also had the best server ever and I can't remember his name but he was French and surprised us with great good suggestions and desserts.  I would come back next time I'm in town
