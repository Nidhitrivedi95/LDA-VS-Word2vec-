mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Tasting Menu!

Go for the tasting menu (they will ad hoc a wine pairing if you ask) and go for a seat at the bar overlooking the kitchen/prep area.

unique and flavorful, memorable dining, but relaxed atmosphere.  Exceptional meal and we have had it many times, never disappointed.
