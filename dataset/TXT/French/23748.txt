We were sat immediately by the hostess.  The waiter was very nice and took time with us about recommendations and the specials and was always coming by making sure everything was good and our wine glasses stayed full.

First off we got bread and butter which was baked that day which was very tasty.  We decided to share a few appetizers.  We started with the foie gras cromisque  and duck carpaccio.  The duck had an egg yolk that blended perfect with the taste of duck, herbs and spices. Next we got the show stopper.... The foie gras poutine which was nothing short of spectacular.  All of the flavors combined perfectly.  If I could eat one thing for the rest of my life it would be that.  We also had foie gras tout nu which was also delicious.  

My girlfriend and I thought we were still hungry so we got the gnocchi.  They prepared it table side mixing everything in a large cut out cheese wheel peeling off cheese while they mixed if was great.  We could not even finish this..... We were so stuffed.  Our clothes felt like they got a few sizes tighter and our waist lines a bit bigger we had to get dessert to go.  But a few hours later a pecan pie in bed was a perfect way to finish the night!

Overall of the best meals I've had in my life.   A MUST GO TO in Montreal.  Will 100% be back.
