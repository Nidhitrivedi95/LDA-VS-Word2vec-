pRlO48w4GkWEPEYIH2tHsw We ordered Shrimp and Chicken Fettucine and Dijon Salmon with salad and soup. Pea soup, salmon and regular salad was pretty good. The fettucine was so confusing, the taste was so mixed and the spice overpowered everything. It was not worth it.
 
They have 3 seating areas - the bar, and 2 separate large seating areas. We sat near the kitchen area, it was so dark and not very inviting. Our waitress was slow and was not paying attention at all. We arrived just past 5pm and it was not busy at all. Out table was filled with our started bread, salad, soup in addition to our main dish, she did not offered to put away anything. No iced tea refill offered, we waited forever to catch her attention to get our desert, it was so long that we just asked to wrap our desert to-go. It was not a good first experience at that branch. I hope next time will be better
