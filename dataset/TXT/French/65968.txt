All of the food we had was very good - excellent seasoning & nice presentation. 
I had vegan tomato soup $ vegan stuffed cabbage w/sietan & brown rice. My wife had the mushroom soup & rainbow trout. 
Service was attentive, very courteous & prompt. Wines were good. Their use of golden raisins in the entrees added a great flavor. 
An expensive meal, but quality all the way.
