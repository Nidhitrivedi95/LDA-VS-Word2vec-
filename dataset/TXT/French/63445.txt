t_1myTZfYeEQ07Jr8JEF5Q Please note, you should eat VERY light for about 2 days before heading to the Cabane a sucre PDC so you'll stand a chance at trying all of the foie-gras and maple-slathered deliciousness. 

The 2013 season Sugar Shack menu started out with a dessert tower which included maple cotton candy, some of the best amandines I've ever tasted and jack-maple shots....a great start!

The entrees included a smoked salmon, foie-gras/lardons crepes, foie-gras omelette topped with veal brain, balsamic-maple glazed deep-fried duck legs, arugula and duck heart salad topped with traditional cabane a sucre "oreilles de cris". The mains consisted of a full chicken (head and feet included) stuffed with lobster and foie-gras and a giant ham ...not for the unadventurous palate but cooked in such a way as to be rich, decadent and very appetizing. 

We also opted for the $70 special tourtière option - an exercise in gluttony but delicious!

There were also maple-themed cocktails. We had a few pitchers of maple beer, which was quite good and had a nice maple after-taste. 

The desserts were a very rich cake which was good, but didn't seem very special after all we'd just ingested, and of course, their version of "tire sur la neige". The maple syrup was served on vanilla ice cream and was a definite highlight of the meal!

The atmosphere was crowded and boisterous, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the "doggy-bags" were necessary and much appreciated!
