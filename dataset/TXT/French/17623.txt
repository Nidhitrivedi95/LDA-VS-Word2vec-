9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ I went to this restaurant back in summer 2012 during the Summerlicious event.  My friend always wanted to try this place so we decided to give it a shot during summerlcious.  Before I begin, I must warn everyone that this place is expensive during regular nights, and which is why I came here during their $45 set dinner summerlcious menu.

The setting of this place is beautiful, they have their own little outdoor patio outside with covers to block off the sun and it also has a lot of greens around.  It makes you very relax while giving that very romantic feel. 

For the summerlicious menu, we ordered two set dinner to share and they included:
Peach Gazpacho - Appetizers
Shrimp Brochette - Appetizers

Mediterranean Seabass - Main
Filet Mignon - Main

Poppy Seed Shortcake - Dessert
Ice Cream Sandwich - Dessert

If the menu is still the same this summer, I would recommend choosing the Shrimp Brochette, Filet Mignon and Ice Cream Sandwich.  

The Filet Mignon was made to perfection, the meat melted right in my mouth.  The Ice Cream Sandwich had very strong chocolate taste and surprisingly, it was not too sweet and was perfect for me as I tend to dislike desserts that are too sweet.

If you are having trouble debating which restaurants to try out during this year's summerlicious, I highly recommend you to pay the premium and go to Auberge Du Pommier!
