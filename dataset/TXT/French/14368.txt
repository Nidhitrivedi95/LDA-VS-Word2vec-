5BAdubSKMARs3qYRHGaClA While shopping in Old Montreal we stopped and had lunch here. We shared the chips Maison (house made chips), Tataki De Thon Fume (smoked ahi tuna), and salade. While dining we had a beautiful view of Old City and the St. Lawrence River. Their staff provided excellent service and the drinks and food were great! The weather was also beautiful before the rain settled in. I can't wait to go back.
