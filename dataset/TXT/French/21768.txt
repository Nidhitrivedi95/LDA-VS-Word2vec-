Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA I'm surprised no one has mentioned the selection of infused vodka that is available. The horseradish used in the horseradish vodka is harvested by the owner of the bar and is the perfect accompaniment to a bloody mary. My boyfriend tried the Thai chili vodka in his bloody mary (it was good but it'll make you sweat). There is also a kumquat vodka which is popular in martinis and even bacon vodka (a venturous friend of ours tasted it and said he was quite surprised that it was actually very good) 

The beer selection is wonderful! Too many to choose from? Ask the bartender for a sampler and tell them what you like (fruity, hoppy, lager, wheat) and they'll give you 4 different selections. 

The food is really tasty but I must admit that last time we ate there, my boyfriend and I were both disappointed. He had the brisket (which is smoked with apple wood by the owner) sandwich which he raved about since Blue Dust's grand opening and I chose falafel, which I've had once before. The brisket was chewy and fatty and my falafel is supposed to come with tzatziki sauce which they were out of but our server neglected to tell me, the dish was extremely dry so I boxed it up and took it home then put my own tzatziki on it. 

We're convinced that the quality of the food has suffered since its Grand Opening. Back then, the family that owns/runs Blue Dust were involved with EVERYTHING- they bartended, took orders, cooked in the kitchen, entertained, etc... Now they have hired wait and kitchen staff who aren't as invested in this family business.
