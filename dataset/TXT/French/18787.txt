AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg I had reserved at Bentlye's 3 weeks ago for dinner on October 20th and even said that the reservation was for a birthday.....
My first choice was BLT and when I tried to reserve there they right away informed me they had a private event and cannot guarantee us seats
Bentlye's said nothing when I reserved.
I show up for dinner and i see that they have a private event...they take us to sit in a stodgy room on the right of the reception . They were asking us to sit by the wall in a booth instead if by the windows. I said i would wait for a window seat and was told there was no chance of that due to the private party which had taken over their main dining area. This was very upsetting....considering the reservtions were made weeks in advance with a cell phone number on file and for a birthday...but we were never informed about a private event...needless to say we left and went to Aria for an amazing evening...ver very disspaointed with Bentley's
