...it's either a hit or miss here.  I've been to Mon Ami a few times, and have had a range of experiences, anything ranging from 1 star to 5 stars, it's probably an average of 3.5 stars.

Cons: mediocre steak au poivre, tourist crowds, pesky pagers, small bar with none-existent standing room, poor wine choices, potential rude hostess.
