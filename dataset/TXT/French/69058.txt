The venue itself is superb - beautiful place - great staff and a very welcoming environment.

Service overall was great if perhaps the attention to details lacked a little.

For the food I ordered the pork belly with black pudding, apple sauce and curly kale. The pork belly was fairly tasty - for me it hadnt been cooked at high enough temperature - the fat had not remotely gone crispy/crunchy and was just really pure fat.....sad face!!

The meat was ok - it hadnt been cooked in anything so had gone a little dry. The black pudding was just smears of what i take was black pudding - didnt satisfy my desire at all! Apple sauce ok but lacked that sugar sweetness.

Desert I had a reasonable attempt at an apple crumble, was for me again slightly undercooked.

All in all ok but for the money spent I wont be back!
