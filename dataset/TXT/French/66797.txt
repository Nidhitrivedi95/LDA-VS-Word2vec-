UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q I dislike having to write unfavourable reviews, but my wife & I were quite disappointed with our meals at Le Papillon on a recent Saturday evening.

First the good. Service was excellent in all respects. Maitre D & waiter were friendly, helpful & speedy. The room itself is also very nice.

Unfortunately, all of our food dishes except the French Onion Soup were sub-par.

My wife had the French Onion Soup & while she didn't love it, she did say it was acceptable. I tasted her soup & found it good, although I found the broth to be pretty rich, almost gravy-like. Regardless, the soup did taste pretty good.

I had the escargots for my appetizer & they were served lukewarm. Not being hot enough, ruined the dish for me. As well, the bread served at the table, which I used to sop-up the garlic butter, was not very good. A French restaurant needs to have good bread, not cheap commercial bread served with butter packets!

Four our main dishes, we both settled on crepes. My wife had the St. Laurent, Le Papillion's "signature" crepe. I had the De La Mer.

I did not taste my wife's crepe, but she did not enjoy it.

My seafood crepe was, to be honest, not at all good. The crepe itself was overcooked (as was my wife's). The scallops & shrimp in my crepe were the small, salad-sized ones- tasteless & rubbery. The tarragon sauce was very watery making the dish look soupy once I cut into the crepe & all the watery sauce ran out.

My wife & I both agree that we would never return to this restaurant.
