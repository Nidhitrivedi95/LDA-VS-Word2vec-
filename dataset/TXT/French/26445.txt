D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw This place was sensational in every way. That's all there is to it really...but for the sake of those reading I'll break down my meal a bit.

I was in a group of 4, celebrating a good friend who will be getting married next month. We had a reservation for 6:15, and given that they open at 6 there was no wait.

We started with some delicious and interesting cocktails (the concord grape crush was especially good) while looking over the menu and wine list. Our appetizers were the Lamb sliders and Tuna tartar, and both were excellent.  The burgers were perfectly cooked, a little pink still inside, and the the tuna mixture was perfectly spiced and super flavorful.

With our wine and meal ordered, we didn't wait long for what had become a very anticipated main dish. We were NOT disappointed. My three friends had the Deer steak special, and I went with the roasted Halibut. They went on and on about how good the deer and Polenta were, and I still can't get over just how good my fish was and the squash puree it was placed on.

After all this, we decided to share some desert, sampling all 4 flavors of their AMAZING and homemade sorbets (go with blueberry and raspberry), and their white chocolate Creme Brule. 

The food was amazing, the service impeccable. The place isn't cheap, but it's not insanely expensive either. For everything outlined above (including a bottle of wine with dinner) we were at $100 per person After tax and tip. An average main was about $24 just for comparisons sake.

I WILL be going back!
