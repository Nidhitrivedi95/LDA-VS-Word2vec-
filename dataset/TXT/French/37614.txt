Came with a group of 5 around 6p with a reservation. Very nice atmosphere, great service, awesome food. 
The charcuterie board was probably the most interesting I've had, with pate, duck confit salad, foie gras, salami and a couple more (obviously all delicious). Fried chicken livers were good, pretty much just tasted like fried chicken. I got the roasted pork collar and it was so soft and tender and juicy and flavorful mmmmmmm 
Each of my friends got a different pork dish and they were all delicious as well, I especially like the short rib and pork chop. 
The miso butterscotch pudding was very tasty too. There's only a slight hint of miso, I'm definitely not a fan of mixing sweet and salty but there's just barely a touch of the miso to cut through the sweetness. Very smooth and sweet and the crunchy granola on top gave it some texture. 
Would come again
