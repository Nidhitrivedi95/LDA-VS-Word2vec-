The staff kept trying to take my food right out from under me.  I ordered french toast and had eaten it, but I had also ordered a cheese plate to share and that was slowly getting eaten while we were chatting.  Eventually they still ran off with my plate while I was in the washroom.

The worst part is what happened with the bill.  I gave $40.00 cash for a $30 bill and sat forever while everyone else got their credit cards back to sign.  Where the hell was my change?  When I said something about not getting my stuff back she simply gave me a copy of the receipt.  I guess she thought I just needed it for reimbursement?  Finally, I just showed her the bill and said, I GAVE YOU $40 WHERE IS MY CHANGE.  She looked as me like, oh, you wanted change?  Really?  She was going to take a $10 tip on my $30 bill!  NO!  Of course I still tipped simply because there were other servers that helped, but this was a clear account of someone trying to take advantage.  If I hadn't gone up to her to let her know, very clearly, that I wanted my change, I never would have gotten it. 

The food was good and seemed average priced for the area.  The french toast was good and the coffee was reasonably strong and they did a good job of keeping my cup filled.  The cheeses were good, but I think it was priced a little high for what I received.
