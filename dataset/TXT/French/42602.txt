LISkzAvqDOFZMdxaX9ryjQ The best things about brunch at this place: the lovely patio out back, and the menu - the dishes are all named after world newspapers, which was entertaining for the first few minutes of our visit.

The worst things: the execution and the service. My ham and cheese omelette (Le Parisien) was burnt on the outside, and the principal flavour was salt. The home fries too were horribly over-salted. My wife's baked eggs with hollondaise and smoked salmon (the Financial Times) were only slightly better. And the service? Coffee arrived about 20 minutes after we sat down, and a good five minutes after our food. Getting the staff's attention to ask for water refills was next to impossible -- a situation made worse by the over-salted food. 

The evening menu consists of a half-dozen traditional bistro dishes. I don't think I'll be going back to try them.
