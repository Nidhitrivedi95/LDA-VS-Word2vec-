vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University and my family asked me to choose a local, semi-fancy place to have a dinner gathering. After seeing all of the positive reviews on here I decided to call Legume for a reservation. It was a large group of 13 people and we reserved a private room for the night. This involved filling out a little bit of paperwork and giving credit card information. I made the reservation about 1 month in advance to be safe due to high demand that weekend. Our dinner was absolutely delicious, and the wait staff professional, attentive, kind and knowledgeable about both drinks and the current menu. The menu at Legume changes all the time to keep up with what is in season and fresh. All night my entire family was raving about how delicious their meals and drinks were. Extremely satisfied with my experience and so glad I chose Legume for my special occasion, it was definitely worth the high price tag. Thank you Legume for making my graduation dinner so special!
