A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I love manon! I wish they'd open one up in Henderson somewhere, instead of opening one up right up the street from their other location...Doesn't make much sense... The staff members treat you so good and respectfully, the lasagna and sandwiches are phenomenal and for the desserts, words couldn't even describe!!!
