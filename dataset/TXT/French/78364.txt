YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q We used a Groupon for dinner on 4/18/2012.  There were four of us for dinner.  We were seated immediately, it was early, 6:30, and we had a reservation.  There were about four other tables filled.  We ordered a red wine to start with.  The waiter came back and showed us a bottle and said "this is the only bottle of red wine we have tonight.  The owner had not picked up the wine for the night."  They had two bottles plus a few open bottles that you could buy a glass of wine.  Needless to say we were flabbergasted!  Salads were very good, chicken coq a vin and beef burgeoning were excellent.  I had the duck in a delicious black cherry sauce but a whole half duck was presented.  It was very hard to manage even with a sharp knife.  I visited the ladies room.  Yuck!  Dirty, no supplies.  It made me wonder what the kitchen looked like.  Although the food was good, the attention to details is missing from my viewpoint.  Not sure I would go back.
