rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Went for breakfast while staying at the Aria.  Great food! Generous portions and it was delicious!  However the service was just awful.  It took 10 minutes to get coffee, water wasn't refilled.  When it was time to leave we asked for the check.  It took another full 10 minutes to bring the check!  I had to track down the server just to get the check.  

I've never walked out on a bill in my life, but was tempted to here as the delay nearly made me late for an appointment.
