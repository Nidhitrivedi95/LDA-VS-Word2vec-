4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went with Robin L. so see her reviews for the Cons.  Like her, the waiter / food runner spilled water all over my place setting (pretty much the first thing that happened after we were seated) so everything within an arm's reach of me was wet.  But that aside, considering what I paid and what I got, I was definitely satisfied.  BF and I split the filet mignon with merlot butter reduction.. the steak also came with these crispy little steak fries that I didn't think I would like.. but they went really well with the sauce and the steak.  We also split some side dishes: french green beans and macaroni gratin.  Everything was really good.  Our steak was a little more cooked than what we asked for; we got medium-well instead of medium.  But it was still good.  And of course, the green beens were cooked perfectly and the macaroni gratin was absolutely yummy.  We also ordered a bottle of bordeaux which, unfortunately, the waiter forgot about until after our steaks had arrived.. but no serious damage was done :)

My total share of the bill came to $40 (that's including tip).  Not bad considering I had filet mignon, two sides, and a full glass of wine.  I'd definitely be willing to come back, especially on those trips to vegas when I can't afford to pay $80 at craftsteak ;)
