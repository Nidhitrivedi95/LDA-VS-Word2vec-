Decided to visit Rosallie because of the article I read in Las Vegas Weekly.
We ordered to cups of coffee, "Late". and two pieces of pastry. ($12.25)
We were given a number and was told the coffee would be sent over to our table shortly.
The pastry was delicious.  After waiting at least ten minutes for the coffee, I want back to the check on it and the gal behind the desk told me that she is very busy and our coffee would take another ten to fifteen minutes.
Apparently the owner is an excellent baker but is clueless about running this type of business.
I don't know anyone that wants to wait 20+ minutes for coffee. Not me!
