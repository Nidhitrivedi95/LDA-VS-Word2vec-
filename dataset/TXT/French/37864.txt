jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA had lunch today w friends
coq au vin and gigondas for wine
i eat all around las vegas and this is probably one of the best value i have encountered so far...
check their lunch, happy hour and diner menu...
good for both low budget or more
i will be back soon w friends
very impressed...
andre is the type of chef who cant retire because he loves his craft.....
he owns alizee at the palm tower, one of the best restaurant in las vegas....
no wonder....
