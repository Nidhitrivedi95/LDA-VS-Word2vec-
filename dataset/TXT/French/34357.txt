HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA Creative, fresh ingredients and freshly designed works of culinary art.  The flavors are derived and cherished from the ingredients not added just by salt, sweet or fat.   The presentation and service is perfect with a great wine and cocktail list.  The Prunes and Peaches desert is a must have, delicate desert.  By the way, the pastry chief is an All Canada first place winner for his creations.  Their tea infusions are terrific.   

The interior is elegant but not over done.  The furniture is comfortable, well maintained and the atmosphere is airy and very suitable for a business dinner or a romantic night out.   If you are coupling it get a window seat looking out on to the lovely park that the restaurant circles.  There is a nesting of while geese in the small pond that adds a lovely center piece.   

Considering the resto is in the middle of downtown Montreal it is a peaceful place to enjoy a couple of hours of culinary bliss.   I see that the cost rating is $$$$ but realistically you are not spending much more than if you went to Baton Rouge BUT you are receiving a world class meal in a lovely, peaceful paradise.
