sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ In a nutshell: food was interesting and inventive, but the over the top "theater" felt like an audition for yet another vapid, self-indulgent cable foodie network clone. 
     
I wish I could talk more about the food, which was excellent in itself, but the flavors and techniques that were so painstakenly executed by the staff of sycophantic Jose-worshippers were over-shadowed by the sheer pomp of the whole production. The guy sitting next to us that obviously worked at the hotel was clearly there as filler, which is fine- I am all for educating and rewarding the people that are selling your product, but instructing him not to speak was mistake. His submissive energy killed the convival atmosphere that is typically associated with a unique and intimate dining experience with strangers. I expect he was busy taking mental notes for his required Yelp review. 

Overall, the "Dining Event Experience" felt like we were on the set of an Almodovar film that was being catered by a Food Network reality show. Somewhere between the writing of the script by the obviously talented Jose Andres, one of the Producers (probably the one with the money) lost the plot.

The Paella at Jaleo, the restaurant for normal people, looked amazing. Next time, I will spend $200 at Jaleo and donate the rest to a food charity.
