4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have to say, I was wayyy impressed!

The BF and I arrived in Vegas Saturday morning and the first thing we did was rush our asses to Mon Ami Gabi because he has been raving and ranting about how delish this place is. I was skeptical, but his stomach has good taste, so I went along.

We got there around 10:15am and was told we'd have a 30 minute wait, which meant they couldn't guarantee us the breakfast menu (which ends at 11am). Poo. He really wanted the eggs benedict.

BUT we were seated in about 15 minutes in a cozy little corner of the patio. Our server promptly got our drink orders (coffee for me and mimosas for both). She took our orders and didn't even flinched when the BF asked for smoked salmon in his eggs and I replaced the turkey in my omelette with mushrooms. 

The omelette was AMAZING! They put chives and cilantro on it which gave it an extra kick and made it tastier than I could've possible imagined up myself. Apparently the BF's eggs were so good he polished off his entire plate (what a fatty =P). 

To top it off, the waitress gladly gave me a to go cup of a refill of coffee to send us on our way.

Great food, perfect service.. this place definitely deserves 5 stars!!
