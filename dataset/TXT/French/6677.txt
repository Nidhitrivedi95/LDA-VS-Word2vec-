4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Considering it's not located in Paris but in Hotel Paris, I wasn't sure what to expect going to dinner at this restaurant. The one plus is if you are willing to wait hour for an outdoor table, you will also be able to enjoy the Bellagio water show which is across the strip.

The food was just perfect, had the escargot and a steak friet that were cooked just right. On the wine front, well there is everything any wine snob would enjoy. Since I am not one who like to wait, made reservations for the inside dining room and asked the server if we could move out to the deck for desert. It worked out perfectly as it was slowing down by the time we got to the desert and tables opened up outside.

Service was fenomenal, server very knowledgable and accommodating. I will definitely return to Mon Ami Gabi in the future.
