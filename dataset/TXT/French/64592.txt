Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg My new favorite French cafe in the southwest side! Staff was very friendly and attentive. The decor is quant and beautiful. I especially love the couch in the corner. They have an outdoor area but it does not have shade. The fresh flowers on the table were a lovely touch. I had a breve and lavender shortbread cookies and I had the turkey, apple and Brie sandwich, which was very flavorful. I'll definitely be back here this week! FYI they are closed Sundays.
