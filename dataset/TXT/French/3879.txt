2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Many years ago (1980 to be exact) I lived in southern France in a little village called Siros outside of Pau. I was an 18 year old exchange student living with a basque family of 10. Every day I had crepes! They were waiting when I came home from school around 1 pm.  I fell in love with crepes!  Maggie's crepes had me reveling and time traveling back to those days. . Excellent crepes. Perfect earl grey tea.  Super friendly staff. The savory crepes are made with buckwheat so they are gluten free.  The ingredients were fresh and complimented each other very well.  Love this spot!  Highly recommended! bravo!
