We celebrated our anniversary here and highly recommend this restaurant in the Aliante Hotel and Casino. It has an upscale atmosphere in the dining room and a casual lounge area if desired. We live in Las Vegas and have the pick of the finest restaurants.
But the menu at Bistro 57 has an excellent selection
done to perfection including the presentation of the food. The service is well above average. The waiter, Randy, had the timing between courses timed perfectly. We have dined here frequently, and considered going to a fine Las Vegas "strip" restaurant because it was our anniversary and a special occasion. We have gone to some fine restaurants in five star Las Vegas hotels and although excellent were not any more in first class than our experience at Bistro 57.
