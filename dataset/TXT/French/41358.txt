kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I will never be coming back here!
Went for $1 oyster night, got there no one told us about the difference prices between sitting at the bar to sitting at the regular dinning area, received my bill and for 2 dozen oyster I was charge $78!!!! When I asked about the dollar oyster on my bill the waitress got the manager to come and the friggin dick said exactly " because this always happens, not to say you did this before as many people have; I can charge half of your bill to the $1 oyster deal and also we will be losing money if we gave you the whole bill as we gave you expensive oysters" 
To me, as a customer if you did not tell us nor have the curtousy to mention while we were there you should of sucked it up and gave us the $1 deal!!! Customer service sucks and food was not to good as we also ordered food. 


NEVER GOING BACK!!! WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND FRIENDS HERE!!
