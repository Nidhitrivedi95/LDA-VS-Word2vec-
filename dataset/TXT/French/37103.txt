iQJ0IvKNbOh_6DSkUCv9dQ I came here to celebrate my birthday with a bunch of friends. The restaurant was very inviting and good for big groups.  The only flaw was the food wasn't too great and the portions were very small. A lot of my friends and myself were disappointed with the beet salad appetizer; we wouldn't order it again if we were to revisit the restaurant. It didn't have that wow factor like it does at many other restaurants.  My friend who ordered the Puff pastry filled with seafood in spinach and parsley velouté sauce said it was really good. My other friend who ordered the Smoked salmon with red pepper coulis and avocado mousse said it was just okay. 

Next, let's talk about the entrees.
* Grilled Mahi Mahi, sweet pepper coulis, served with rice and seasonal vegetables.
- My friend who ordered this said it was really good. A+

* Grilled beef steak, scallop potatoes with grilled seasonal vegetables in green pepper cognac sauce
 - My friends who ordered this dish said it was good but the portion was just a little too small

* Pan seared veal loin with wild mushrooms and spinach risotto
 - I ordered this dish and the meat was very tender. This dish was also gluten and lactose free. This was one of the smallest entrees we received at Marcel's. It just came with the veal and a risotto. I would have liked to receive some sort of vegetable on the side. 

* Lamb stew with dried apricots, carrots, turnip and onion served with couscous
- My friend enjoyed this. This was also definitely the biggest portioned dish that we received

* Pearl barley risotto with winter vegetable
- My friend said this was good but the portion was incredibly small

The Desserts:
* Rum cake topped with fresh fruit 
- My friends who ordered this said it was really bad. They didn't like the texture of the dessert and wished they had ordered something else.

* Sorbet with Fresh Fruit:
- The sorbet was really good. However I really wanted a chocolate cake and this was the only lactose and gluten free dessert on the menu. If the owners are looking at this review, please add a chocolate tort to your menu. 

* Lemon pie with crispy meringue and raspberry coulis
- My friend said it was good

* Marcel's famous apple tart with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce
- This looked delicious. I didn't ask my friend what she thought but she ate it all so I'm pretty sure it was good. 

Service: 4 Stars: Our waiter was great!
Food: 2 stars: You need to start strong and finish strong. Marcel's could definitely improve some of the dishes and add vegetables or other sides to make the mains more complete. 

I have to give the restaurant two stars because according to Yelp two stars means you have experienced better.  I honestly would not go back.
