cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Dined here last night. Very busy tight happening place. If you are on a diet, leave it  at home. This is foie grass heaven.   Dishes were very rich and the service was great. Try the poutine, best I had. Appetizers are good portion, perfect for sharing. Expect a wait to get in but it will be worth it.
