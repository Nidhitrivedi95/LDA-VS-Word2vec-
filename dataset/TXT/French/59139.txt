rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w This review is for their dessert

Stopped by a little after 10pm exactly one week ago, as the 3rd stop on our Vegas eating spree! They were already closed, but were kind enough to allow us to join them at the bar for dessert.

We were recommended a tasty glass of Moscato D'Asti to accompany our desserts.

Next thing you know, compliments of the pastry chef: tequila lime sorbet with pink grapefruit, grapefruit gelee, and pop rocks (see my photos). What a delightful and refreshing start to dessert!

This was followed by a platter of pre-dessert treats!

And then, our desserts! OUR JAWS DROPPED at the presentation! We immediately captured images of these gorgeously amazing, elaborate creations!

My vanilla poached strawberries with yuzu cream and crunchy streudel arrived in a sculpted bowl of ice, atop a mountain of crushed ice. Good looking, tasty, well-balanced, and a generous portion!

My partner's glossy sugar sphere was filled with lycee cream and dragon fruit cubes (and maybe something else I'm forgetting?). I've never seen anything like it! OMG SO GOOD! That is, after he reluctantly agreed to crack the sugar sphere. You've got to look at the pic of this one!

As if that weren't enough to make me feel like the most spoiled Princess EVER, I was given a jewelry box with secret compartments concealing truffles!!!

The service was excellent! The staff were attentive, gregarious, generous, and welcoming.
The presentation of the desserts was out of this world!
The desserts and dessert wine were top notch.

We are DEFINITELY coming back to experience a full meal here the next time we're in Vegas!!!!

Merci beaucoup Le Cirque!
