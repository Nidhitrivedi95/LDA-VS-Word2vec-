rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w This is the best food I've had since I moved to the West Coast from the East Coast. This is truly European/French cuisine. It was filled with delights and adventures in flavor. Each dish had so many unique elements that you enjoyed taking your time to savor every bite. We ordered the three course dinner and took our time eating. Though you walk in to a seemingly pretentious environment, we were delighted to find our server was happy to assist us in choosing what to order. He was human, down-to-earth, and fun. He recommended I try fois gras (my first time) and it was as amazing as everything else. Highly recommended and worth every penny and calorie!
