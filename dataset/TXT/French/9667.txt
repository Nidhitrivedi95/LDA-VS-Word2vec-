4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have been here three times now and I keep on coming back. I recommend making a reservation ahead of time if you are planning on going here on a weekend of dinner as all three times there has been a long line and a long wait but thankfully we had a reservation.  I partly come back because they have separate gluten-free menu, which I really appreciate. They even bring you your own plate (so no cross contamination) with several slices of gluten-free bread, butter, and olives. Their dishes are also marked with an allergen marker. ( big group 13 vet attentive). I think the food is pretty tasty and not too expensive for what you get, especially in Vegas. Two of the times I have come here it has been with a group of 13 and a group of 25 and we still had good service.
