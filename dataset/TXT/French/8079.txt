4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Truly authentic, very warm atmosphere and the service and waiters treat you like their friends. For Vegas, this is very refreshing. This isn't a tourist trap in any sense. This is a place where you would be privileged to go no matter what city you live in, including Paris. 

They bring you a baguette, fresh baked and hot in a bag to start. It really and I mean really hits the spot. Their goat cheese appetizer is probably one of the best appetizers in the world. Mix the goat cheese in the tomato sauce and tear off pieces of the baguette to dip and you are in heaven. 

Their steak frites are on point. This is coming from the guy who has le rais de entrecôte in Paris three times in one trip. That place is an institution. 

Make reservations. It is always busy.
