4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great spot to grab brunch.  

Ambiance - 5/5 - Very fancy.  Huge dining areas.  You are on the strip so it depends if you prefer the patio (strip area) or not.

Staff - 5/5 - Friendly. They can get busy at times.

Food - 4/5 - Order the Banana Fosters Waffles.  Ask for extra caramel sauce (I wish I did).  The waffles are light and crispy.  I have never had anything like it.  Really really good.  

I did try the smoked salmon benedict, which was really great as well.


Check out my photos.  Great place.  I think it is slightly overpriced, but it was a great meal.  Didn't order the crepes, but they are HUGE.  If I came back, I would order a crepe.
