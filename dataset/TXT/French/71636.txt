XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Very great place to be airport food! Came here for breakfast and enjoyed every moment of it. It makes me want to fly to Phoenix just for a meal! I had the Zinc Omelette along with some coffee. The omelette was superb! Coffee wasn't bad. The star here was the croissant! I had a bite of my mom's and it was great! Buttery and toasted to perfection. I didn't have any add-ons or substitutions so I can't speak on that aspect but the prices here are a little steep, I think it's worth it though. The staff was very friendly and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Overall, a good spot if you have a little time for breakfast before 10am.
