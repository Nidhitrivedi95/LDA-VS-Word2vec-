O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Meh. Linguine with clams sounded great with Meyer lemon, arugula, parsley, garlic, etc. received a pile of generic noodles with clams that smelled like feet, absolutely NO SAUCE or flavor whatsoever blah, gross. Bread, Meh. Cheese plate, minuscule. Server, blah. Steaks were cooked to perfection, and at the price, should be. The waiter who didn't serve the appetizer/ dinner but took care of the drinks was a welcome smiling face and hopefully received his fair share of tips. Patio was nice, but the lighting at night seemed fluorescent from high above so killed the atmosphere.
