4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami gabi does a consistently good job serving bistro fare in a bistro atmosphere. 

This is Vegas Strip; how many 1000s of plates do they serve a day? I think it would be unfair to compare to your favorite petite Paris boite, no?

That said, we've always had great cocktails, sparkling wine and sandwiches. The creamless celery root soup is delicious. Also like the presentation of the fries. 

Atmopsphere in the inner patio is actually more pleasant than the outside patio, unless you want to gawk at tube tops and frozen drinks. However, I must say, this restaurant is the *only* reason to come to Paris -- the casino and hotel itself seems very downmarket and dowdy (and yes, I have been to Eiffel Tower restaurant).
