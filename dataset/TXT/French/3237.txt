1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA Crepes Parisiennes is nothing short of charming. The brick walls, French music, and sweet smell wafting through the small foyer is enough to make me want to buy a bus pass because the 2 hour parking on Craig Street simply isn't cutting it. 

I think my favorite thing on the menu has got to be their breakfast crepe with béchamel sauce. The crepes are light and delicious, and the béchamel sauce is rich and creamy. I'm pretty sure that if utopia had a national food, it would be this breakfast crepe. 

All of the savory crepes come with perfect little side salads, complete with house vinaigrette and little mandarin orange wedges. Couple that with a cafe au lait and I'm basically in heaven. Oh, and you ought to probably have a sweet crepe while you're there, as well. Why? Because Nutella, that's why.

If you're planning on going, be sure to bring cash and check their hours!
