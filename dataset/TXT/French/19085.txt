ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q I have to say I didn't have a bad experience here during my short layover at PHX. After reading some other reviews, I just wanted to point out that this location is located in an airport. If your expectations are authentic French cuisine or food just like it would be in Paris, please just don't. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't find any 5-star meal at any airport. 

I ordered the omelette plate which came with a HUGE croissant (decent). My food did take a bit long to come out (~5-10min), but I realized it was because they actually made my omelette with fresh ingredients. I love mushrooms and was surprised that they used huge slices of mushrooms instead of sad little cubes of mushrooms I usually find elsewhere. The spinach was fresh as well.

For $8.56 (tax included), I got so much more food than other airport restaurants would give at the same price. If you're worried about having to wait too long after ordering to eat there, just grab a sandwich or salad. They looked pretty filling to me. Overall, this place is great for decent airport food quality and really good for quantity. They don't skimp out on amount of food. Come here if you're looking for something that won't be too disappointing!
