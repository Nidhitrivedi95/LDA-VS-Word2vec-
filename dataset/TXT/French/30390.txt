FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw This is the best bakery and coffeeshop you'll find in Madison, and tastes like a little slice of Paris in the Midwest.  The croissants are excellent, and the coffee is unquestionably worth the price.  If you want a tart--go for the lemon, even if it wouldn't normally be your first pick; it's a perfect balance of sweet and sour, with a delicious pate brisee crust.  The other tarts are beautiful, but not as flavorful.  You'll spend more than you would at any other Madison-area coffeeshop, but it's such a worthwhile treat.  Highly recommended.
