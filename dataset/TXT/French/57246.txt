rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I ate here a couple of years ago, Pre-Yelp days, when I was just a young lad.  I remembered having a really, really good meal, too much wine, staggering back to Casino Royale....

Not as impressed on this visit.  Maybe it was the booth tucked back by the kitchen doors, maybe not enough wine this time.

The room has a really good vibe to it.  The service was good, but a little spotty at times. 

The food?  Well, if you like "frites," this is the place for you.  Moules Frites, Croque Madame with Frites, Trout with Frites, Frites with Frites.  I've never seen so many French fries on a single table!

The mussels were good, nary a single one failed to open, but they didn't blow me away (see:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/plouf-san-francisco#hrid:8kKNPmop16G5ERUFG6kA-Q).  Two of our four ordered them.  Mussels everywhere.

The wife's Croque Madame was very good, but then again, I like a Ham and Cheese Croissandwich from Burger King.

The last of our party had trout, which was marginal according to the reports.

A decent meal, for sure, but next time I am determined to find a dish served sans frites.
