rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My favorite place in Vegas! By far!! it really reminds me of a Brasserie in France and the food is sooooo goooood that makes me dream about it until coming back. The foie gras from Eiffel Tower is good but this one here is AMAZING! Last time I had mussels that were simply perfect and the meringue with red berries that was heaven on earth. I do recommend this restaurant to any person with good taste. Service is good as well.
