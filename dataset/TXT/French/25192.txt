Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Came here for a wedding, but ate off the regular menu.  Amazing view of the strip.  Top floor of the Mandalay Hotel.  The food at the wedding was just cocktails and appetizers, but the appetizers were the same ones on the menu and they were amazing.  

Well drinks from the bar were decent $9 wells and strong, appetizers we got were kabobs, mac n cheese, shortribs.  Kind of on the pricey side but amazing taste.  Its more of a taste type of restaurant so dont come here on an empty belly, but be amazed at the flavor of the food and the best view of the strip.
