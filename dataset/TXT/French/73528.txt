My company held a dinner here in their private room. One pet peeve of the room is the huge column that divides the space, which can create awkward ducking or hitting your head. The private room does not have a great view of the Bellagio fountains, but does have a nice view overall. 

There is a minimum you need to spend to reserve the room, not sure of the price, but price per person (sans vin) came to about $100 each, not including tax, tip and all those other extras that can get tacked on. 

The prix fixe meal started with:

* Blue Cheese Soufflé Pudding w/ Walnut, Pecan, Petite Salade - Interesting. Kind of like Boursin meets Jello. About the size of a small ramekin, it went well with a baguette. Great salad! 

* Tuscan Kale Salad w/ Door County Dried Cherries, Quinoa Croutons, Toasted Pecans - Okay, so technically one could call this gluten free! And the kale salad was a nice counterbalance to provide all the antioxidants one needs when in Vegas. Why do we have to know the cherries are from Door County? I don't know. Where is Door County? Again, I don't know. Very fresh salad, the tang of the cherries provided just the right "bite."

* Sautéed Wild Salmon w/ Quinoa Summer Beans, Tomato, First Pressed Olive Oil - This is what I'm talkin' bout! Perfectly done, beautifully prepared salmon that melted in your mouth. Wild salmon can sometimes have a more "meatier" taste that farm-raised due to the lower fat content, but this was spectacular.

* Eiffel Tower Classic Crème Brûlée - La pièce de résistance! Very large serving for a crème brûlée - could be easily shared, in my opinion. No one could finish theirs. Loved the caramel decor that graced the top. 

All in all, it's a very romantic setting. Taking the elevator up makes you feel...special, for lack of a better word. Would I come again? Mais, oui!
