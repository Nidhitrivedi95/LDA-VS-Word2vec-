0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Beautiful restaurant of course with millions of dollars in Picasso's paintings hanging on the walls. I loved everyone's courteous attention, they however, should train their waiters to be friendlier and more easy going. Their stress level seems high. 
This place has the best oysters I have ever tried -and I try them everywhere I can. I tried them for he first time years ago and although they were prepared differently, they are still the best. The deer medallions are pretty fantastic as well. If the weather is nice and you want to sit out in the patio, make sure you're prepared to wait. They don't reserve those tables. If you sit out in the patio you get a perfect view of the Bellagio Water Show. 
At the end of your meal, the waiter brings out a thick notebook to browse through with pictures of Picasso's work -which is nice to read and chat about over coffee or tea.
