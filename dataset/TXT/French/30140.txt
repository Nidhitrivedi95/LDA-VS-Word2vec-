FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg I LOVE THIS PLACE. Food and service was impeccable. We started with the mixed greens & warm octopus salad. Both were delicious. I needed a redemption meal consisting of moules-frites since the one I had in QC was horrible. Holder definitely more than made up for it. The white wine sauce was flavorful and worthy of bread dipping (lucked out with the last portion of the night). My bf ordered the tilapia and it was full of seasoning and accompanied with a delicious side made of veggies with pine nuts. 

The staff was very attentive, but in a ninja-like fashion. Voila! All of a sudden you have a full glass of water that was just empty and a clean bowl for the 2nd half of your mussel shells. We were driving for quite some time prior to getting to Montreal and just wanted a good meal so we were in our "driving clothes" and sneakers. I don't normally go out to dine anywhere looking like this, but Holder is a classy yet unpretentious establishment so I felt comfortable enough to enjoy my delish meal. I can speak the same for their staff. 

We spent about the same, if not more, on a meal during our travels to Canada and it was def worth every cent & all 5 stars.
