HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA This is one of the best restaurants I have dined at in Montreal

We cam here on a Weekend. We made reservations for a a Saturday night only 1 week in advance. The restaurant was busy, but not too packed. The staff was very nice and helpful.

We ordered the tasting menu. It is a 6 course meal that was wonderful. I do not remember all the details of the courses, but I will try my best to describe

1st course: Ceviche served with heart of palm,lemon and i think there were oranges in there as well. This was my favorite course. Very nice. Not your traditional ceviche, but a nice twist on it which was very tasty and a nice start

2nd course: Snow crab served with razor clam salad, avocado and wasabi cream, and Rice Vinegar Jelly. Very good also... 

3rd course: Homemade potato Gnocchi with Lobster, Leeks, Mushrooms and Coral Emulsion. This was my wife's favorite dish... I also loved it... was a tie between this and the ceviche for me 

4th course: Halibut dish... not sure of what else was in it. 

5th course: Beef Daily Cut, Beets, Spinach, Horseradish and Rosemary. 

6th course: Honey Madeleine.Coconut & Grapefruit, Coconut Mousse, 

The madeleines were fantastic and a must. There were no disappointments. All the served dishes were excellent. Will definitely repeat

It is a little expensive, but definitely worth the extra money. A great place for special occasions
