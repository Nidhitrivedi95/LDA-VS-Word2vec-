hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA This is THE best lunch place in Las Vegas.  I cannot believe how low the prices are.  My husband and I get to go sandwiches from Capriotti's all the time, and it's more expensive than the more gourmet food here.  Don't get me wrong, we LOVE Capriotti's.  I'm just saying that this place has INCREDIBLE value and is absolutely delicious.  The quiche was great....flaky crust and perfectly baked.  I wish it were open more often!
