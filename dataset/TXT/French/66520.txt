uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Fabulous food. A small location, but they make up for it! We loved everything we had, a creamy jalapeño onion soup, Caesar salad, small pizza, Mac and cheese with ham, and pork belly. 4 of us ate family style and couldn't finish our food. The complexities of the flavors are impressive and each bite was perfect. Everything they serve is made in house and from scratch. 

Not only is the food impressive, but I was blown away by their hospitality! Since they can't seat too many at a time one of the members of the Robin family came outside and explained the menu, told us about their restaurant (family owned and operated), and made us feel welcomed and wanted. It made it worth waiting for a table! She also offered us a beverage to enjoy while we waited.

We were lucky to get there toward the end of their evening, or we likely wouldn't have gotten a table in a reasonable amount of time. All told we waited about 20 minutes for a table, and it was well worth the wait!
