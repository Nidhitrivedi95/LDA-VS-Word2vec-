Selection of vodka + pickapepper, louisiana green wasabi hot sauce, some other good one i'd never tried, worchestershire, too kinds of mix, straight tomato and some other premixed (with anchovies!) very good, asparagus, celery, red and green jalapenos, olives, horseradish, pickled ginger, salami sticks (no thanx for me but you might like!), tomatos etc.  Only missing: green beans, lemon (for a small squeeze on top) and cocktail shrimp.  Outdoor dining available but get their early or tip for a table!  give this joint a try. also in Chicago (and perhaps elsewhere).  At Paris Hotel & Casino.
