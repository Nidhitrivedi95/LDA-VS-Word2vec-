4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw After visiting a few times, the verdict is..this restaurant is definitely mon ami!

The first time I went was for brunch. I made a reservation in advance so I was able to request a table on the patio. It was wonderful to dine outside with the sun shining, a front row seat to the Bellagio fountain show, and a great view for people watching. 

Now for the food..they served baguettes as the free bread! They were all warm and toasty in cute paper bags, like something you'd get from a bakery. I ordered the croque monsieur, which was pretty good. What I really enjoyed was the french fries that came on the side. They had an interesting flat shape which made them super crispy on the outside but still soft and chewy on the inside.

The next time I went was for dinner. I had the steak frites which was perfectly cooked and it was a very generous portion for the price of $25.95. The best part was, they let me have multiple sauces on the side at no extra cost. I tried the peppercorn sauce and the caramelized onion, red wine sauce; both were delicious. The baguettes were still free, unlimited, and just as good as I remembered.

The third time I went was for happy hour. I had 2 glasses of sangria, pate, and yes I had me some free baguettes. Then, I ended my very happy two hours with a warm chocolate pudding with salted caramel cream. It was absolutely decadent.

Au Revoir mon ami, until next time!
