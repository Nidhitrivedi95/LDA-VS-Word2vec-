rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A It's official...Bouchon serves my favorite breakfast in North America.

It all started over dinner the previous night.  We had tickets for Le Reve and a reservation at Bouchon.  The host let us know the power was down but should be up quickly.  No problem, we gave an extra 30 minutes.  We sat outside on a gorgeous night and our server let us know it might be a while.  We could order salads and cold items but that was it.  Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time for an alternative fine dining experience on a Friday night.  I made due with a goat cheese salad (that was missing the goat cheese) but my husband decided he didn't want to order anything and would grab a bite on the way to the show.  The restaurant was nearly empty but our server barely paid attention to us.

As we left, my husband spoke with the manager about our experience and we were invited to brunch in the morning.  The manager on duty was told of our experience and we were treated to the most magnificent breakfast I may have ever had.

We each ordered one item off the menu and a champagne cocktail.  Moments later, a basket of pastries to rival Parisian bakeries was bought out.  Yogurt parfaits overflowing with berries followed.  Champagne cocktails kept coming.  We could not have had better service.

We were told when the gluttony was all over that it was all taken care of.

I am a big believer that it's all about how mistakes are handled and this was perfection.

I have warned my husband that when we return, I am ordering EVERYTHING again.  Bravo to Bouchon!
