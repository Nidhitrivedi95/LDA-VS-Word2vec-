gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Definitely my favorite French restaurant, even though I hate the Palms hotel. If princess Belle opened up her own upscale French restaurant, this would be it. I love their artistic presentation, flavorful dishes, french service and dining style and the ambience. The service was really great, very attentive. I enjoyed their non alcoholic specialty drink. It was some sort of berry minty refreshing drink. I will definitely want to come back! Worth it being pricey! We had the veal wellington, salmon trio, escargot and pink champagne cake! All unique and delicious in their own way.
