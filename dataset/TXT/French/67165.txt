USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg The food is inspired.  I would give them a five star on food.

The service and environment were less so for us.

The waiter just seemed unengaged.  Normally you expect very friendly and engaged wait staff at a restaurant where it is easy to spend $60-100 a person.

We went for our anniversary, it was noted on the reservation, we were put in a room close to the door with a very loud group of people.  None of the staff said a word about a special evening.

The place is marked as being dressy and romantic.  A lot of people were there in jeans and polos even on a Saturday night.

The food was wonderful and we will go back for it but I will not put it on my places to go for a special occasion.

Definitely a place for foodies but not somewhere to have a romantic dinner or quiet conversation.
