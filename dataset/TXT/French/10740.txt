4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came here last Saturday (2/27/16) for my dad's birthday. My mom loves this place as she can safely eat here as she has celiacs disease. They offer gluten free bread and will bring out her own butter so there is no cross-contamination. They have a gluten free menu and will  bring out the chef if you want them to.  She had the chicken with a basil sauce on it and she ate every bit and loved it. My dad had steak with amazing fries and my fiance had hanger steak with fries that he absolutely loved! I had trout almondine, which I have had other places but this was by far the best, with the sauce on the side and amazing green beans! to say the least i am a fan. We also had a complimentary dessert of vanilla ice cream in a puff pastry. It was really good! I Would recommend this place ot everyone especially if you have food allergies as well.
