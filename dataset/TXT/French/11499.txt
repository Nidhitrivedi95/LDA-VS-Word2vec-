4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is a great choice for lunch or dinner on the Strip. The service is very good, and it's not as expensive as a lot of other places further up the Strip in the Venetian or Palazzo. In addition, the scene outside is unmatched, and being on the patio across from the Bellagio fountains is a romantic setting. Everything I've had here was well above average, the tomato salad, escargot, steak au poivre were good, but the frites and profiteroles were amazing.
