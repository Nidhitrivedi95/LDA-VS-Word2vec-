Ncvd4l3zo72FUK5kovQhYQ A special birthday and a place that would accommodate all ages (3-71). The Brunch couldn't have been better. The owner reserved a small room for our group complete with Happy Birthday decorations. She was very approachable and made certain that our group was handled efficiently. Being Valentine's Day the restaurant was very busy, but we never felt rushed. We all had different items ranging from "light as air" quiche to chocolate chip pancakes. Everything was great. We have already made plans to return in two weeks.
