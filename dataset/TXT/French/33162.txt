HHvO4MgBFabsmlInou6viQ Been spending weekends walking around the neighbourhood...trying out all the restos in the area. When we first moved here it was a food desert...couldn't even get pizza delivered...the food options are very exciting now.

Le Baratin lives up to its reviews...a charming, intimate spot with great music and service...and the food is delicious!  We specifically came for the tartiflette...had it once before while traveling through France...it was a cold rainy day and we were comforted with this luscious bacon, potato and cheese tart...today's version was a vegetarian version of that...but to be honest this was just as good without the bacon.  Soup was delivered piping hot...everything is fresh and well seasoned.  Definitely worth a visit!
