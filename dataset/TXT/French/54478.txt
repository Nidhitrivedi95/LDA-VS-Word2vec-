rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Bardot was amazing! Atmosphere is inviting, warm, and cozy. Food was great and service was impeccable.
We had several appetizers: the king crab crepe (which was my favorite and very tasty), the Foie Gras Parfait(which was also great), and the French onion soup. Wow, were they great teasers!
For the main course my husband had the sea bass (which he loved and ate every last bite) while I had the lamb chops which was just delicious.
Dessert: rum cake with a smooth cream topping (can't remember the name).

Overall this place was just great! Our server, Nelson, was even better. Very knowledgable about the menu, provided excellent recommendations and was very attentive! Definitely recommend this restaurant for all French food lovers!!!
