rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've dined at Bouchon a handful of times over the years. Half the time it's been pleasant and half the time it's been just "meh." Sometimes the food is good but service is subpar or other times service is excellent and food just doesn't cut it.

I am rating this with my most current experience in mind. We arrived at about 6pm with no reservation. They were kind enough to make a table available for us outside near the pool. The servers were very attentive and our waitress thoroughly went over the specials as well as her menu favorites.  I appreciated the fact that she let us take our time and answered all of our questions. 

What we ordered: 

Deviled Eggs ($5) deliciously simple, can't really go wrong with deviled eggs. Just enough mayo with the egg yolk.

Steak and frites ($37) server was kind enough to help us split this since we were sharing. She indicated that the steak was typically served medium. I wanted medium rare, my dining partner wanted medium well, we compromised and got it medium. Definitely way too well done for my liking and ended up being quite chewy. It also came with fries, regular or truffle, we chose regular and they weren't anything special. 

Pork belly ($41) special of the day. Ridiculously over-priced for what it was. I don't usually talk about food in measurements but this is kind of necessary. The pork belly was a block about a 2x1.5 inches; about half the size of my iPhone. Half of which was all fat. I think I was swindled. Bouchon robbed me of my money and I kinda want it back. Oh well.  What little bit of meat I did eat was good, but not great.

Furthermore, I'm aware that typically they serve bread and butter as well as pistachios before your meal. I actually had to request this after our entrees were served. Slightly annoyed? I sure was! 

I think this place is deserving of 3 stars. Half good and half bad... Right in the middle. I will prob come back, but not for a while.
