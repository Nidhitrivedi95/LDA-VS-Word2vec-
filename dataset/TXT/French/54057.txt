qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q Noticed the raised patio and knew I wanted to check it out. The inside was unexpectedly fancy! I immediately regretted showing up in sportswear after playing two hours of tennis but hey, I needed food and beer. No one seemed to mind except maybe the cute girl on the patio... I probably stunk too. She probably has a boyfriend anyway. 

Bar Begonia, a VERY pleasant surprise, probably my favourite find in the last couple years. We had beef tartare, my buddy had the horse steak, I had the (beef) steak, and we shared a side of fries. I tasted his horse and it was very nice... but seeing as how I am obsessed with beef, the highlight for me was my medium rare, sliced & delicious cut of meat. and you know what... the fries are the best I've ever had. That's a pretty bold statement because I've had a lot of fries, but these were perfect. I would return JUST for them. If you think I'm making this up, try them.

I didn't get a chance to try any cocktails, but our bartender said it's what they are known for. And when I try them out, I'll update this review. Pretty high expectations at this point because of how great everything was. I like the layout inside. Sitting at the bar, you have an attentive bartender right in front of you. Behind him, you see a line of cooks. It looked pretty clean back there, and the cooks appeared extremely focused. Very nice to see! Can't wait to come back.
