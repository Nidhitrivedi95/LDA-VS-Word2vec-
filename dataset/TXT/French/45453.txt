mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q This ranks as one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas. Maybe my favorite period. Friends and I all did the tasting menu. Every course was incredible: The flavors were complex yet subtle and we all wanted to practically lick our plates clean after each course. I remember there was plenty of foie gras which is never a bad thing. The wines were also fantastic-- the sommelier really helped us out and took his time finding bottles that would match up with the wide variety of flavors going on. And then there's the atmosphere, which is really modern, sleek, and cool without feeling too trendy or pretentious. The service was of the caliber of the best restaurants I've been to-- very impressive. I can't believe this is like a "step down" from Robuchon's flagship next door. I honestly have trouble imagining how amazing that must be. Oh, and while this dinner wasn't cheap, it felt worth every penny (I can't say the same for my dinner at Alex the night before).
