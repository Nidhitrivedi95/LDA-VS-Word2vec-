4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Although the food is not out of this world amazing at Mon Ami Gabi on the strip - the location and price more than make up for it. 

It's right opposite the Belaggio fountains and if you're lucky and ask for a table near the windows you can see the show every 15 minutes as you eat which is pretty amazing. 

We had the steaks and fries - which were ok. The steak is a very thin, long cut so it's not the most tasty but it's filling. The fries are slightly odd - they are more like shavings of a potato, or I'm afraid reminded me a bit of old toenails! But again lots of them and fill you up. 

To be honest compared to some of the places in Vegas and the prices you pay if you're looking for a nice atmosphere, central location and a good feed then you cant go wrong with Mon Ami Gabi.
