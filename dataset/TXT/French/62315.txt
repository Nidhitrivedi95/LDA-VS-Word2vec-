SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ My daughter and I had a 7 pm reservation last night. We arrived and were offered a seat at a two top right next to the door. It was very cold so I asked for a different table. The seemingly too bored to care hostess said the only other option was also by a door, despite there being MANY open tables. We sat and were ignored for about 10-12 minutes before a bus boy dropped a basket of icy cold, dry baguette slices on our table and told us the compound butter this evening was "orange poppy seed" (sweet). We waited another 10 minutes without anyone giving us a word or a glance, despite several waitstaff walking by our table several times. We got up and left without anyone saying a word. My daughter realized she left her purse and went back to get it. A waiter was standing near our table and he looked at her questioningly but still not a word. I don't know whether we were ignored because we were two women, or they have bad service generally, or it was just a bad night. We walked over to La Bocca and were welcomed beautifully and served a delicious meal (see review). When next in town, we will revisit La Bocca (a house of treats for us) but not House of Tricks.
