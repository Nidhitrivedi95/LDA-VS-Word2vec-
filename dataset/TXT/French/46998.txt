nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA Wow! The Black Pig is in the trendy Ohio City area and the food was fantastic. We ordered the pork belly and the house made meat sampler. The chicken liver mouse, pork pate, and rabbit tourine were all wonderful! They were accompanied properly with condiments that had a purpose (pickled red onions, homemade grain mustard, etc). Highly recommend the meat sampler!
For entrees, since we came for lunch, two of us ordered their house signature burger, which came with house cut fries. They burgers were good and flavorful, however, one was ordered medium rare and it came out well done, so that was a bummer and the cause to drop it a star. 
The bahn mi sandwich was flavorful and just plain awesome. I got my fries with gruyere cheese and gravy on top and everyone else at the table was envious. I highly recommend getting your fries with the cheese and gravy. Yum. I'm craving them now!
The pork schnitzel was crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. 
Our experience was fantastic. The service was top notch and next time I'm in Cleveland you best believe I'll be stopping at The Black Pig!
