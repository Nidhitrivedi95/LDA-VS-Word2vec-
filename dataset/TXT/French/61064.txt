SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Great fondue and soups. Poor service. Waitstaff non responsive to requests unless you asked multiple times. Took 15 minutes from getting check to processing payment. Waited 10 minutes for waiter to come back to take order after he said he would right back.   In the meantime he cleared off two other tables
