htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Came to this restaurant a few weeks ago. Parking was difficult to find, with the restaurant being on Main St. Markham, but eventually found a spot in a parking lot behind the restaurant. 

This place was packed and the layout is rather cramped with most of the tables being in a row, 2 feet from each other - you could easily hear the table-beside-you's conversation aka not the best place to take a date or nefariously scheme.

I ordered the Udon Carbonara, as it is one of the most talked about dishes on Yelp. It was pretty good, but not life-changing. I'd give it a 7/10. It tastes like normal pasta but with the thick udon noodles in a cream sauce. I guess the texture is unique, but it was only slightly better than the kraft dinner I make at home.

The service was pretty standard as well. 

Overall, this place is pretty overhyped. Still good, but failed to Inspire me.
