ytD9rJ-jcb8zMUCfiYCnFw It is our last day in Montreal and we were looking for one last lunch to close out our wonderful trip. We stumbled to Cafe Cherrier and were happy as soon as we stepped in. It was hustling and bustling with a local crowd including some business lunches. Was really interesting to see and observe. Really nice French food lunch. I had the French onion soup which was excellent and a Duck Confit with frites and salad. The salad was fresh and had a light vinaigrette. The duck was cooked close to perfect. Bread was super tasty and wine was light but flavorful.
