kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Food was a 3 star but I can't forgive our horribly rude server.  She took our money and returned a few minutes later to say that we didn't leave her much money and was wondering what was wrong with her service.  When we asked her to confirm the amount of money we left as a tip, it was less then we know we left.  When asked if we could recount the money we left, she flipped out and said she was not incorrect.  I'm still in shock that this women is employed in the service industry.
