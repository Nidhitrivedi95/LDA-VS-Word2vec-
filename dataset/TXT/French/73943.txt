xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I'm so glad I decided to come to Eiffel Tower on 4/1/12 for my boyfriends birthday! My boyfriend ordered the rack of lamb and I ordered the New york rib eye, OMG both dishes were cooked to perfection. My boyfriend got the dessert plate with Happy Birthday in chocolate on the edge, he loved it!! Jennifer the manager actually came over to our table to see how everything is going..the service was amazing.......Thanks Jennifer!! I can't thank you guys enough for making my boyfriends birthday memorable. This is something we will never forget. We will be back for sure whenver we decided to go back to Vegas!
