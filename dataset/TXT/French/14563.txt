My waitress was pleasant, but inattentive. My mom ordered a caesar salad for herself, so it was a nice surprise when we both got plates. Until we got the check and saw they had charged us for two.

The caesar had a strong flavor, which I like. It was nicely plated with an anchovie sliver, slice of prosciutto, and breadsticks. Overall, delicious.

We ordered a fruits de mer for two. Everything was fresh. I did get a bit of sand in a couple of my oysters. I was willing to overlook it. I was a bit upset about the rolls, however.

I asked that either several rolls be place at our table at once, or that we receive rolls continuously- to balance out our fruits de mer. The waitress assured me they would. And yet all night long I received one roll.

Finally we had dessert. The tarte tatin. Delicious. I ordered and Irish Coffee with it-  inedible. It was pure whiskey. And while I enjoy a strong drink, I did not order whiskey with a splash of coffee- I ordered an Irish Coffee.

This is not a nightclub, you're not doing me a solid by mixing me strong drinks. And while I do enjoy whiskey on its lonesome,  I'd like an Irish Coffee to top off my meal.

Anyway, just as a note they do not 'refill' your glass. If you order a soft drink and ask for more, you will be paying for a second drink. Wouldn't have minded if someone had told me.

This may seem like a harsh review for me, especially since i float those 5 stars out like candy, but it's really because I had high expectations based on the reputation and presentation.

And it would've been nice if my waitress actually paid attention. The bus boys took better care of us than she did.

Next time I'd like to try an entree. You get good value for $ here.
