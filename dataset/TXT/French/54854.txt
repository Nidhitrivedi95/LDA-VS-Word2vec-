rBDGlL3eC4v-2HBZ4cWRVQ Went there with a friend yesterday, first time after the re-opening of the place.

The food was alright, and service was great as before. The interior decor and the ambience were lovely. The food was slightly overpriced for its quality in my opinion, and my rack of lamb was a little too dry.

Also, I can't understand the policy of paying them 2$/piece of cheesecake that my friend made to celebrate a birthday. It seemed totally unnecessary and just absurd. If you do not allow consumption of food that came outside of your restaurant, why add a price tag to it? Is it like an obligatory tax?

I would've given the place 4 stars if not for this incident. What a shame.
