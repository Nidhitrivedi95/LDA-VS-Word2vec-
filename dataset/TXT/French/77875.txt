YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g it's partially my fault for not checking the lunch menu before i came, but i was very disappointed in lunch. i came on a recommendation, and was so excited to have tapas, bouillabaisse, spanish, italian, and french food! so i brought my family here at lunch only to see BORING sandwiches on the menu. we had a cuban and the chicken sandwich. lame. vegas is supposed to be a 24 hour city. i felt sad and embarrassed for bringing them here. the restaurant should at least have a few of their signature dishes, even in smaller portions, on the lunch menu.
