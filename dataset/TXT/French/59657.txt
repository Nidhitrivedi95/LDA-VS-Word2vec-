s1w-XoUJ2wuK9OJ7ivpi3Q Bernard's Bistro IS NOT CLOSED - JUST A NEW NAME - SAME GREAT FOOD AND MENU.Bernard died and it is now called CB's Legacy.  We had a fabulous brunch there Sunday May 22, 2016.  The service was attentive - not too much - lovely presentation of yummy food and the singer very nice to us.  Each of us enjoyed our meal and the Tiramisu was quite good!  We shall return...
