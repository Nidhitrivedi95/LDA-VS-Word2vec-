HcfwrlljJpfLh71znq47zw Surprised by the small amount of reviews?

This place in my opinion is the best of the Michelins in Edinburgh (and yes I have tried them all..) I feel like I could eat the food here every day, there is a lightness of touch in the preparation that really comes through when compared to it's ilk.

Recommending the set lunch, very good value at £27 for 3 courses. Thing about michelin places is the bread is always very good so you can stock up on that as they will never refuse you more (thrift recommendation #1)

Service is attentive but not stuffy even though the room is pretty formal. You can tell everyone involved here is really interested in good food from the lowest water pourer up to the head chef.

If you have the budget come and eat here. I would recommend getting a bottle of wine from a shop and drinking it on the picnic benches at the shore before you go in. The wine list is good but the markup is over 300% in places. Plus the water of leith can be nice on a good day. (Thrifty tip #2 - Edinburgh has no open container law so don't worry about kicking about with a bottle of wine).
