pRlO48w4GkWEPEYIH2tHsw I think the exact location is pretty poor. While it is located in a big shopping center on Rainbow and 215, it is all the way in the back of the center, along with Chili's and Sammy's Woodfired Pizza. I imagine if it were more visible along the street, it'd be more popular.

Anyway, this place is good for all day long breakfast served. I usually get the mixed berry pain perdu and haven't been disappointed. Some servers seem to favor the older patrons.

Not really a place for those looking for a young, hip environment but for a safe bet place with decent food, it's ok.
