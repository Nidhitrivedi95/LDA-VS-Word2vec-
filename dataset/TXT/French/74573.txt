xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Hubby and I came here on a whim for lunch while I was taking a break from a conference I was attending and were completely blown away by the beautiful atmosphere, food and customer. 

We were seated right next to the window so we had a beautiful scenic view of the strip. I ordered the chicken Parmesan with vegetables and potato scallops. It was cooked very well. Hubby ordered lamb burger which was cooked well but not crazy about it. One of the best parts of the menu was the dessert! Creme brûlée was absolutely amazing! We were also given complimentary passion fruit candy and chocolate truffles. 

Our waiter made sure we taken care of and the buss boy also made sure our water glasses were filled.
