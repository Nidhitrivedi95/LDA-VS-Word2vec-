4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Quite pleased with the flavors here at brunch. My omelette with mushrooms had the most delicious, creamy taste! The rosemary-soaked tomatoes were a burst of flavor. My husbands steak was quite thin and ever so slightly overlooked. 
We walked in just before the rush and were seated promptly. Service was attentive and timely. Excellent atmosphere.
