You can sip French wine and watch the characters of Las Vegas stroll on by, catch Bellagio's water fireworks, and on occasion, experience a selection of Vegas's fine street performers. On this last trip, we got to chuckle at the statue man who made women scream and drop their cameras. Lovely.

If it is sunny, make sure you request a table with an umbrella or you will melt.

The first time I went, I remember enjoying the food, but on my second visit, I started to think that perhaps the first trip was influenced by a carafe of Frangria (sangria in French, not literally).

Yes, the food is good, but not incredible. For lunch, I had a butter lettuce & honey crisp apple salad. The menu description exceeded the execution a bit. The salad was smaller than I anticipated, and the presentation made it hard to appreciate all of the elements in a nice bite. Everything came in such a way that you had to spend a good amount of time cutting, and being on a plate complicated the procedure. It was a good salad, just a tad underwhelming. I also had a couple of bites of my husband's steak frites. The steak is super thin, but flavorful and tender. The frites have the thinness of chips. Call me old fashioned, but I like a fat frite. These were more like potato shavings. At $24, I wasn't blown away. However, all of this mattered not quite as much given the location. The service was delightful too.

To keep it simple: I would not go to Mon Ami Gabi to eat inside, but as long as they have a patio, I am sure I will return. Sometimes location wins.
