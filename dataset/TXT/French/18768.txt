I didn't even know this place existed until I was brought up to the 27th floor of the 201 College St.  The views of the restaurant give a great view of the city. Make sure to go during lunch as the prices are a bit more tolerable than the 4-$ dinners. 

I had the steak sandwich with Parmesan fries. It was cooked to perfection and had great flavor. 

I would recommend bringing people new to charlotte here atleast once.
