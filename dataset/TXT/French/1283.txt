_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ We went for my husband's birthday. They have free valet parking which is nice. I loved my fish soup which was just as good as the ones I had in Provence. I also like the sea bass (branzino) and thought the portions of the mains were very generous so go lightly on bread. My husband ordered a dungeon crab ravioli topped with uni and the venison which were delicious. We went with the coconut cream pie for dessert which was good and fresh, I personally do not really like coconut desserts but I recommend it for those who do. The execution of the food was perfect. The atmosphere is conservative but very comfortable. The service has been impeccable. I have a nice view if the city from here. Of course it is a higher price point. I would not say it's a must try but it is a pleasant and tasty experience.
