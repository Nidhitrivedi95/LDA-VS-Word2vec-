The food was quite good.  The cream of celery soup (a special) was really excellent, and I enjoyed the bacon-wrapped goat cheese as well.  By the time the entrees came, we'd all eaten too much, so I barely touched my veal but what I did have was prepared extremely well.  The rabbit got high praise from the husband.  

The wine list was a pleasant surprise, as there were many reasonably-priced quality wines, and we were able to taste before ordering a bottle.  

The big issue is the ambiance and the service.  It does not appear that any redecorating was done since the spot was the Sonoma Grille, and I don't think Sonoma Grill was ever redecorated since it opened 15 or so years ago.  It looks, frankly, like exactly what it is, which is a restaurant attached to a mid-priced chain hotel.  As to the service, our server was working very hard and was extremely nice, but she was waiting on tables in all different parts of the (very large) restaurant and was overwhelmed.  

Finally, the restaurant was pretty much dead on a Friday night, and they were turning away a few people super early, like at 10pm. The food is the most important thing, so I'm hopeful that Le Lyonnais can work out these other aspects of the experience.
