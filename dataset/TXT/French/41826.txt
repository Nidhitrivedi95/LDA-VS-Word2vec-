KRgTdfs4oVFUcATMfAoR4A Excellent dinner last night.  The food was very well executed.  The service was incredibly discreet leaving plenty of room for leisurely conversation.   The whole evening was very well paced.  The  table d'hote option is very nice ($10).  Nice selection of wines.  Though they have English menus, you may want to research the menu on-line before hand because the French descriptions are better.  Not to worry though, you won't be disappointed with the food.
