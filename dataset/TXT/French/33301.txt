hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA This was my fourth time visiting this place. I loved it here. Food was great as well as the service. Today I stood in line (me being the only person in line) and had no one help or take my order. The two workers literally stood there and ignored me. It took one of the workers 10-15 mins to make eye contact with me and he didn't even take my order! Or even have the decency to tell me someone will come to take my order. Worst of all he was not dressed professionally at all! Green hat and green clothes? I've never given a bad review before and hate to do so. I just got off a 12 hour shift from the hospital. All I wanted was something to eat. I guess I won't come here anymore.
