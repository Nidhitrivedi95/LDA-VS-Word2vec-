28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ Walking down St. Denis is an experience within itself.  You might get swept up in the romance that is Montreal and innocently assume that all restaurants on the street are going to be delicious and serve quality cuisine.  This is not always true.  Sure, the atmosphere helps, and the cafe diners on the front patio appear to be enjoying themselves.  But, once you taste the food being served, you may not be sold.

They serve fresh squeezed juice, so everyone at the table ordered it.  Not realizing that we just spent almost $20 on juice even before ordering food.  The fabulous looking bread and pastry counter is not filled with items made in house, but made elsewhere.  Instead I was served a decent croissant, but nothing worth mentioning.

The worst part of the meal were the buckwheat crepes.  We had buckwheat crepes a few days before at a different restaurant across the street and loved them.  So, we thought that experience could be continued at Brioche Lyonnaise.  We were mistaken.  The room temperature, floppy sponge crepes given to us were not fresh and had barely any fillings.  Nor were they served with a side of anything appetizing to try to make up for their mistakes.  The chicken inside of the chicken pesto crepe was cold and dry, and barely any cheese to soften the blow.   I simply could not eat the dish, and everyone else that the table felt the same about their dishes.  

The worst part is that the brunch for three people was $70 CAD.  It was a tragedy!
