SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg Very nice decor, very trendy layout. Great atmosphere. What I didn't like was out seating area, it was too close to the bar way to much traffic for my liking.

    Anyway let's get to the food. We started with the salmon tartar.... Best tar tar I have ever tried. Nice balance between the fresh salmon, coriander , citrus and green onion it was fantastic!

I had the Burger and potatoes aligot, and my gf had the New York strip and the potatoes aligot. Let me just say the potatoes were incredible... The right balance of cream, cheddar, chive... Amazing. My hamburger was also very good. The meat was cooked nicely and the condiments on the burger were slightly elevated... Honestly for a burger it was great!
 
My gf raved about her steak. She said it was better then a Moishes steak. It was tender and well seasoned accompanied by a ratatouille, pepper sauce au jus and bone marrow.

All in all it was a pleasant experience. Would definitely come back!
