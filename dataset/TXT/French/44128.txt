MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Being able to make reservations is a huge win in my books, especially for Sunday brunches. For whatever reason, toronto seems to lack restaurants that allows a reservation system. Very welcoming greeting followed by very informative instructions on how to go about the all you can eat brunch. 

Great selection of foods, all disappearing quickly and replenished as quick as it goes! Highlight for me has to be the oysters and the eggs Benedict, but that doesn't mean the rest were bad. Could not find any food that tasted bad. Servers were on point with the removal of the plates and constant replenishing of cutlery and water. Very impressed with the quality of the food.
