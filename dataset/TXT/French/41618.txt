kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg Preface: I am an industry Professional and Lifetime member. I find myself uncomfortable and unable to relax at most restaurants because I am always en guarde (pardon my attempt at french)

upon entering Frank's Kitchen without a reservation I was greeting immediately by the owner, "table for two please, got room?" I was ushered to a kitchen-side table.
Our coats were checked at the table by the server, tap water with cucumber was offered and received with no talk of bottled this or that. a few moments later "May I interest you in a cocktail or glass of wine?" I was browsing the bottle list and let our server know "we'll start you with some bread then". I when I thought I had chosen I asked for a taste, chose a different bottle, SUD Primitivo Di Manduria for $60.

The wine arrived and was presented properly and tastefully. we were told about a special and chose our single shared appetizer and separate Mains.

They Split the appetizer for us and it was a beautiful minage of light flavours with a gorgonzola undertone. 

the Mains came up as my dining partner went to the ladies, so Kalashes (spelling?) were supplied and applied to keep the food warm, when she returned our food was immediately freed and explained, and answers were given to our questions. 

The mains were expertly cooked. divinely plated and voraciously eaten.

after a polite mourning period a sweet desert course was verbally offered. we asked for a cheese board and were supplied with a colourful and diverse selection along with a dark chocolate desert. The cheeses were magnificent and the desert thought stopping.

I ordered a half glass to finish my desert with, I got a Montelpulciano/Sangeovese Blend.

This was the Best Dinner I've yet had in my life.

 I will return as soon as I am able.
