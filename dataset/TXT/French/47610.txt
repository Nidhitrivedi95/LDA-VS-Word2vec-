O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Went for dinner on a Saturday night.  
The service was excellent - friendly, professional and prompt.  
The cocktails were excellent and at $10/drink about average price.
The short rib was amazingly tender and deliciously flavored.
The haddock was cooked perfectly and also delicious.

Highly recommend the Las Vegas branch of Morels.
