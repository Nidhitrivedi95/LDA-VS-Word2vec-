Came from Waterloo, Ont. to celebrate our 40th anniversary, and as they'd say of a 3-Star in the Michelin Guide, it's the reason to Journey there!
Beef Tartare was the best I've ever had, my spouse's swordfish perfectly cooked, and the mushroom ravioli with pine nuts tender and delicious. I found it reasonably and surprisingly affordable for the quality and ambiance!
