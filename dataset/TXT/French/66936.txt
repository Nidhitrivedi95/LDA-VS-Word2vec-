USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Great food and service. Went hear to celebrate our met-iversary  (1st time we met). Service was the best I have had in a long time. The waiter, Rich, explained everything. I liked that he said the prices of the specials and additions without having to inquire. We ordered the lobster hush puppies. They were good and the jalopenos  were very spicy... Great flavor. I ordered the lobster and grouper. Lobster was delicious and buttery. The grouper was okay not heavily seasoned but the rice like( I think to risotto ) was yummy in the sauce. My fiancé got the filet done medium. It was cooked to order and he enjoyed it. The food came out nice and hot.  And everything timed perfectly. We also each got the Caesar salad ... Well worth the $3 each additional. He did order a martini ... He liked it but the name I can't remember but it was citrus and champagne like. For dessert we tried the beignets  ... Yummy and the accompanying coffee gelato was impressive!! Definitely recommend this place. It's nice, intimate and worthy of any special occasion (including just because).
