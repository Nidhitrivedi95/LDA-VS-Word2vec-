HOWEVER... 

They introduced zucchini soup into my life and I am officially obsessed. Not sure why I never thought of the dish, seeing as how I cook with it often and absolutely love it. Now I'm hooked on it like it's crack. 

The duck confit was delicious too, not "too ducky" which I find is usually the case. I'm more of a chicken/beef type, but I wanted to try something I wouldn't make at home... I was beyond happy!

Their lunch time menu/table d'hote is great and definitely affordable. I hear their salads are a knockout, they looked delicious and came loaded with yummy toppings! Unlike your typical plate of boxed lettuce with a simple vinaigrette charged at $20. So I'm going to have to give that a try next time I go there, that's for sure! You should too.
