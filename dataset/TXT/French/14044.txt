58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw My fiance and I made Le Cartet our first grub stop after we arrived in Montreal, starving from our long drive from New York.  The line was literally out the door, with pedestrians struggling to make their way through because hungry folks in line were blocking the wide sidewalk.  Well, despite our hunger, we figured a long line is a good sign, so we waited about 20-30 minutes to get in.

We were directed by a friendly staff into the loooooong restaurant.  The long dining tables, which I would unhesitatingly put into my own dining room, were very fitting given the restaurant's length.  Me like!  So we started off with 2 cappucinos.  I ordered the bowl after being informed of the size of the cup, and my fiance ordered the cup.  Yes, I eat like a fat person and it's quite embarrassing when my male partner's portions are smaller than my own.  Anywho, the cappucinos were creamy, frothy and smooth ... a great start to our brunch!

I decided to go with the Brunch de L'Atlantique and my fiance went with Brunch des Cantons.  I love salmon so this was the perfect dish for me.  It featured a potato and salmon cake, smoked salmon over bagel and eggs with salmon, sided with salad and fruits.  My fiance's didn't appeal to me too much because I was so absorbed with my salmony meal, but his dish was by far more savory, with sausages, eggs and ham.  Both dishes came with a glass of orange juice, which really filled us up.  I left nothing but crumbs on my plate and left with a happy tummy.  Definitely worth the wait!
