c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA Boris Bistro is fun, and it really is bistroesque. They have  a wonderful patio to sit outdoors during the summer months.  I've found also during the summer exclusively they offer a table d'hôte service during lunch.  If it is a nice day out, I'd make a reservation.

I'm a repeat customer for lunch.  My favorite dish is the salmon tartar.  You get two distinct variations with some baguette.  I've also tried the duck risotto which is extremely tasty as well.

It's a bit slow, so don't go if you are in a hurry.    Even though it is a bit sluggish, the food is delicious and the service is friendly.

Lunch will run about $20 per person.
