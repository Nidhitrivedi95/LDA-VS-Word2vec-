0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I begin my Yelp career (this is my first review) with the best restaurant I've ever been to: Picasso at the Bellagio in Vegas.  I was there over two years ago, but the vivid memory is easy to draw from.  Hence, a ten minute stream of conciousness should suffice for an accurate review.

Picasso beat out both French Laundry and Aqua (unofficially numbers two and three) for the top spot on my all-time list.

While everything about my experience was arguably perfect, what stood out was the service and the wine pairing.  I've never seen six courses wedded to fine wines as amazingly as at Picasso.  Each dish was strengthened by a pairing with perfect balance.  The wine complemented the food, and vice versa.  (I'll spare the details as it was a long time ago; I could attempt to reconstruct but that wouldn't effectively tell the story).  This wine pairing is truly unreal; you'd be doing a disservice to yourself by passing it up.  I looked them up just now, and this all makes since; Picasso employs one of the few Master Sommeliers on earth, Robert Smith.  (Currently there are 158 with the title).  Cheers to you Robert.  And our server was incredible.  Very knowledgable, friendly, and without the slightest tinge of arrogance.  I thought our server could be running a fortune 500; he was professional, witty, and very knowledgable.

All this before even mentioning the roughly $65 mm worth of original Picassos overlooking the dining room tables.  I'm curious as to what their insurance policy looks like; I could have easily flung a chunk of Foie Gras at Picasso's "Self Portrait" and caused them quite a stir.  Good thing I've graduated from that type of high-chair behavior :-)
