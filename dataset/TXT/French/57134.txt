rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place is kind of hard to get to. We wandered around for a while before we found it. Nevertheless I was desperate to try it, even though I heard it wasn't as good as the one on the wine country.

We came for brunch, and as all girlie brunches start, we began with bellinis. Good sparkling wine with peach puree. It was brunch, but my like minded ladies wanted to try the oysters here and they were the quality kind, not too oversized and lacking that fishy flavor.

Then between us we ordered the croque madame, french toast, and the piece de la resistance... chicken and waffles! Can you believe Bouchon has a version of chicken and waffles? I blinked twice in disbelief looking at this menu item. 

Everything was not bad, and the service was impeccable. The runny egg on the croque madame was cooked to perfection, neither being too runny or too over cooked. The french toast came in a mini tower much to our surprise. We split it delightfully and the chicken and waffles, while not being fried chicken was roasted to a great savory moistness mixed with the sweet syrup and spongy waffle was a great 

Also sitting outside on the patio right by the pool was fabulous, except for the fact that only older people sunbathe outside during brunch time... *shudder*
