cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Why doesn't this exist in NYC?  Someone please stuff half a duck into a can filled with duck fat and simmer it for 27 minutes... pretty please?

We came here for a birthday dinner and wound up having a birthday adventure. As with all of my five-star rated restaurants, this place blew me away with the food and atmosphere.  Although there are aspects that I can nit-pick (e.g. unmarked bathrooms and some absent-minded waiters at times), I must tip my hat to the exquisite and delicious meals.

Here's what to order:
* Foie Gras Cromesquis - this is Foie Gras melted inside a fried ball of awesome.  It's like hot sex in your mouth in a very good way (not that there's a bad way).

* Tarragon Bison Tongue - some people may say "ewwww tongue", but you will not be disappointed if you order this. The meat just melts in your mouth and the tongue flavor is lightly masked by a delicate sauce.  I could have probably had 3 of these and that would have been good enough as a meal for me.

* Duck in a Can - I thought this was just for the novelty of having a duck in a can being opened and poured onto your plate, but no... it's much more than that. It's everything delicious and unhealthy that you'd gladlly die for multiple times.  The amount of oil and fat in this is ridiculous - you can see it giving you a heart attack before you even take the first bite, but alas, you will bite into heaven and close your eyes in pleasure.  Included in your half duck is foie gras - the whole chunk of it.  Everything about this was amazing - including the bread dipping and stomach holding afterwards. There's too much rich, dense amazingness in this meal to be kept all to yourself, so please share.

Everything about the meal was fantastic. I ate here on Saturday night and I'm still full. In fact, this may be the straw that broke the back of my metabolism. it's probably all downhill from here...
