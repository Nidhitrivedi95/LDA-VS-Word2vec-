gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA We came here on a date night and ordered their 7 course tasting menu. It is a typical french restaurant so if you have things planned at a certain time, you should give a good 3 hours at this place , especially if you are trying the tasting. 

The view is breath taking. They have one side facing the Strip where you can see the busy traffic and another side facing mostly residential areas, calm and nice with lights scattered all over just like the stars in the sky. 

Our server is very knowledgeable, he explains every course, ingredients, way of cooking as well as the origin and special points of the wine, Each course has a different bottle of wine paired. 

Both me and my boyfriend's favorite is Seared Ahi Tuna. It is half raw in the inside and nicely seared all around. Amazing! 

The only little complain I had is that after 11pm, ghost bar starts to play really loud music and we can hear it in the restaurant. I think it gets louder at some point that the glass windows are shaking which breaks the romantic,intimate mood of the restaurant. 

But overall, I have a great impression of this restaurant and we will certainly return.
