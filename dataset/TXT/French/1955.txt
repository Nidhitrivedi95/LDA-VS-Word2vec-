0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw I got a reservation here prior to a concert at the new Corona Theater, and may I just say I totally love this area of rue Notre-Dame now, there's so many cool places.  We actually couldn't get into Joe Beef, so we tried it out.  

It's pretty cramped and I don't like the menu set-up on the walls, however, the staff are super knowledgeable and they'll get you going in the right direction no matter what.  

I was a big fan of the lobster salad starter and the oyster selection.  Everything on the menu looks delicious.  Our server was a bit quirky, but he grew on me so I can't complain.  

Note- they don't have a fully stocked bar.
