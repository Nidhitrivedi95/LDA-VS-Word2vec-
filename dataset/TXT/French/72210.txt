XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A I found this restaurant overpriced and just trying to be something that it is not. My boyfriend and I decided to try a new place and wanted to go for a semi-formal nice dinner. We went at 8:30 on a Saturday night and the place was packed- at first a good sign. They sat us in this little alcove area and the chairs were very uncomfortable patio furniture. The menu offered a nice selection and we started with appetizers and cocktails. 

My cocktail, the cucumber Tom Collins, was quite watered down and I don't think my boyfriend enjoyed his Manhattan either. I ordered a mushroom ravioli starter with pine nuts and arugula- the best dish of the night. It was extremely fresh and delicious despite the fact that the dish was covered in oil. For my main course, I ordered the scallops. The dish was swimming in a few cm of butter. The portion was a nice size, but the quality was not great and everything was washed in the butter. My boyfriend ordered a nice bottle of French wine but it was extremely overpriced and not very good. We ended with dessert- I got the fruit with basil and coconut sorbet. The fruit wasn't as ripe as I would have liked but the sorbet was good.

While the food overall was ok, the place seemed overpriced. It was trying to be a classy, chic French restaurant when in fact it was just a mediocre meal in a quite loud environment. In the future, I think we'll stick to the old port for nice French meals. We definitely will not be coming back here.
