m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q Hmm interesting crowd. Extremely loud which is not a bad thing but it's definitely not like the other speakeasies I've been to I to city. No wine list. Only one red and white available. A few beers on tap québécois but it would be nice to see more craft beers. The cocktail list is impressive.  Will have to see how the drinks are before I make a final decision! As other people have pointed out, very French when it comes to the barkeep and staff.



Adding a bit more. Bartenders do a juggling act. Pretty amazing.
