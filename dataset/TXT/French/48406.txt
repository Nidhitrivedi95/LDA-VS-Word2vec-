OBr_LF6vOD23wP17YNtOag FANTASTIC food, atmosphere, wine, staff, everything.

Very psyched to find a fine dining restaurant in my hood that is pretty affordable. You can get two course dinner for ten pounds from monday to thursday, there is a pre-theatre menu, a two or three course lunch menu and the regular dinner menu is amazing.

We had the scallops starter and the black pudding/haggis starter-  fabulous, both of them, with beautiful presentation.  For entrees we had the halibut/scallop/languistine with a fantastic lobsters butter and the rack of lamb- PERFECTLY cooked, followed by sticky toffee pudding and a beautiful mix of fruit. 

The restaurant has beautiful artwork, an run by a husband and wife. i hugely recommend it to both locals and visitors. 
a rare find.
