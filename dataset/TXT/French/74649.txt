xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Food was very good, not exceptional, but very good.  The service was exceptional.  You definitely want a table with the view of the bellagio fountains, and while I was just there with my husband, there were lots of groups which seemed to be having fun. This place is quite expensive so just be aware. My husband and I are in our 20s but came to Vegas prepared to spend money! We spent close to $350 though (with a bottle of wine) and unless you are really holding back, I don't think a couple could get out of there for much less. It's Vegas so everything is relative.  Worth doing once for sure :)
