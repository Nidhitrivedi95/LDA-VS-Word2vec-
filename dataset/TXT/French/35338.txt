Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ An inconspicuous door along a white wall, the bold crest in black and white placed overhead, little would you know that behind that wall and through those foggy windows would be a dining experience as exquisite as this. It's thanks to the "Monacle" feature on the app that I found this gem!

Seemingly always at capacity, it boasts a classical fine dining atmosphere. The multi-page drink menu gives you plenty of libations to choose from. The menu is diverse and each dish's explanation is mouth watering. 

We had: 

+ Oysters (3 ways: original, watermelon cucumber, and what seemed to be the French Onion Soup version)
+ Pork Risotto
+ Veggies
+ Salmon
+ Veal
+ and an amazing cream and fruit dessert that exploded with flavor!

Everything was delicious, the staff was friendly and I can't wait to come back on my next visit to Montreal!
