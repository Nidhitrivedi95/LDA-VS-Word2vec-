What more can i say?!....... Well, let me start with the wonderful smell of mulled wine and cinnamon that hits you as soon as you walk in then to see the most spectacular entrance with a dazzling chandelier! The chrsitmas decorations thay have up are nothing but lovely and warming. We opted for cofffee, unfortunatley the Club Room was too busy but we got seats no problem on in The Georgian Tea Room on the 1st floor. We  ordered a latte and coffee, and recieved 2 little tasty mince pies free! Total spend £6!!
 Service was fantastic and to top it all off they had the snow machine on outside! Now my favourite place :)
