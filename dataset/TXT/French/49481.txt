or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Great food and classy feel.  Walked in not knowing it would be a $200 meal for 2 but rolled with it.  Stands outs were the charcuterie and cheeses.  Good wine by the glass selection and a scallop dish that was seriously one of the best I have had in a very long time.  Good eats at elevated prices but with great quality.  Not bad for a Monday, but even better for a romantic Friday.
