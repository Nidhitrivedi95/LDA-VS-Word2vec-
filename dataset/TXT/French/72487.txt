XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Yep. It's that good.

We did the 5 and 6 course tasting menu and bought a $50 decent bottle of sparkling wine. Total bill $577.

Bread cart, bacon mustard seed bread, yes. Saffron brioche, yes! Cheese brioche, yes! We pretty much asked for one of everything,  and our waitress was totally willing to comply and made us a basket for the table. The butter comes off this huge block of butter and it's amazing.

Amuse bouche, split pea gaspacho (french word forgotten) with smoked duck, pistachios and mint marshmallows.  Delicious.

Cold appetizer,  artichoke with fois gras. The perfection of the textures of these two foods together is something to write home about. Because it was textural bliss.

Hot appetizer,  asparagus soup with fresh ricotta tortelini. The tortelini were melt in your mouth, fantastic. 

Main course, beef cheeks. So good. Best part? The whipped potatoes. Literally 4/5 butter 1/5 potato but somehow that just made them better, allowed me to feel like I was eating the butter from the bread cart guilt free.

Dessert, chartreuse sorbet palette cleansing and refreshing. 

The dessert cart! Yes! Tiramisu,  so perfectly arranged and delicuous. Again, pretty much asked for one of everything. My favorites?  White chocolate filled with blueberry, Red velvet baby cupcakes and ladybug chocolates (they were so cute)

I think it was worth it, wish I could afford to eat like this more often. The servers were so nice and patient and not terribly snooty.
