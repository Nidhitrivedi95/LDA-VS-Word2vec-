XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q The Langoustine Ravioli was the best dish of the whole meal! It is to die for! I thought the suckling pig dish was a joke! The bread & dessert trays were wonderful. The pear dessert was divine . The service was excellent! My husband hated his fish entree but loved his appetizers . Alinea in Chicago has everything over this restaurant .
