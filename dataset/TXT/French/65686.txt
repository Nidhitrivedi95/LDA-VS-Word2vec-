U50YoWOEmagNix2sbD-yMg What a nice place to come eat at!  It just reminded me of back home, Dallas, Texas.  The only thing that got me by surprise was that they offer Baked Beans for breakfast.  

Note:  In Texas, we eat Baked Beans for lunch or dinner usually with BBQ.  

So, what the heck!  Why not!?  I tried them with my Bacon && Eggs...they sure were good!  :)  Every time I come visit Montreal...this would be one of the places I'll come back to visit.
