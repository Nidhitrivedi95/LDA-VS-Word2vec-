lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ If someone is viewing my profile they are going to think I'm heavy on the five stars today.  The truth is, we had an opportunity to visit Vegas and planned our trip around food and shopping.  I know I know, we're weird.

Anyways, Alex was our final fine dining experience for our trip.  It came after some heavy hitters (Bouchon andJoel Robouchon) and we had some high expectations.  Buried at the back end of the Wynn, it was a little difficult to find, much to my sore, high heel wearing feet's disappointment.

Once their wonderful staff opened the doors for us, all disappointment vanished.  Our cocktails were fabulous, the bartender was a delight and the hostess was adorable.  I felt like a princess descending the wide staircase into the restaurant as they led us to our fantastic, corner table.

The tasting menu did not disappoint, and, as white truffles went in season this week, we got to add in an additional dish of white truffles on noodles cooked in butter and yumminess.  It was my honey's 30th birthday and I am so glad we spent it at Alex.  

Their food was delicious, every single course they brought out left me wanting more.  They accommodated my shellfish allergy with grace and didn't skimp on the substitutes as other places have in the past.  Their staff was delightful and we enjoyed the entire Alex experience.  Next time we're in Vegas, you can bet we'll eat here again.  

They casually surpassed most of the previous best fine dining experiences I have had.
