XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Wow, wow, wow. This restaurant made me fall in love with Montreal as being one of top cities for good food.

To be honest, dinner was great, but I can't really recall what I had. What I do remember is the French Toast Dessert afterward! I polished off every bite and fought my colleague off from stealing from my plate. I don't care if I gained 10 pounds that evening, every bite was worth it.
