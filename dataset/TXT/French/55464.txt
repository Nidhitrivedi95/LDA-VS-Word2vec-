rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My second time at this restaurant and it was a great experience!
Such great wait people Kayla and Jose! 
   The dinner started with warm pistacios  and house made epi bread.
Simple, but such a nice way to start. We ordered the Lyonaisse salad
which is frise ( sp?), poached egg, lardons and vinagarette, my husband had
The steak and frites, and I had the Bouchon steak! Very tasty. The waitress
made some great suggestions to the meal as both dinners came with 
fries. She suggested to substitute a different dish. Glad we did because
the fries were very generous. Ended the meal with crepe brûlée .
One of the best creme brulee with vanilla beans. 
    I wanted to bring the leftover bread back to the hotel and Jose
gave us 3 loaves!
     Memorable meal. I highly recommend Bouchon!
