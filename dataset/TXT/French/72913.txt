XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q This is one of the most expensive meals I've had to date. I can't say it was worth it. Yes it's a dining experience and yes I love being pampered. However my expectation and what I received were 2 different things. The amuse Bouche was delicious, however everything else was average. I ordered the butter fish which came with whipped potatoes. Neither were extraordinary, Roy's butterfish is much better. The bread cart is amazing, probably the highlight of the meal. I also had the lettuce soup, it was good, a novelty but not worth the additional $30+ on the bill. The petit desserts were tasty....nothing life changing or superior to a good bakery.....the chocolate we received was delicious......however I can not justify the price.....I've had Michelin rated restraunts before. This just did not meet or surpass my expectations.
