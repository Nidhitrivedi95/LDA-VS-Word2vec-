Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Great little spot. When the cocktail bar my friends and I had planned on going to was way too busy we opted for Nuit Social instead. Loved the ambiance and the food selection was great. The big draw is the cocktails though. Had the best whisky sour of my life! And their original cocktails were also good. Staff was also attentive and friendly.
