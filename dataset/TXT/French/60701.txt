SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I remember hearing about the line-ups a long time ago and I have been here three times. 

To be honest, yes, the food is not bad at all but definitely it leaves me wondering that maybe us Torontonians are sadly lacking good brunch places because I would NOT wait 25 minutes for a brunch here. 

Yes, this is much better than Cora's, Sunset Grill and any other standard issue greasy spoons, of course Bonjour Brioche does not even compare and it is another completely --and better animal. 

And yes, it does have a certain European appeal, but I really don't think is all that to be five stars or four. 

Due to the service that is so-so, which from my experience in France, I have to say that they got that down pat. Not rude, just not overly friendly either. 

Would I come back, yes. Yes, I would but I do not think it is all, the pastries although better than many places in Toronto are still not as good as I have tasted elsewhere since there are a few better places in town, perhaps not at this price point, but it shows. 

Also I would still recommend La Palette as a somewhat more French experience than Bonjour Brioche.
