KRgTdfs4oVFUcATMfAoR4A What can I say about Vertige that hasn't already been said?  We came here on the last night of our trip to have some authentic French cuisine.  The atmosphere was romantic in that we were dining in a dimly-lit room with relaxing, ambient music, but I also saw groups having dinner (double-dates, birthday parties, etc.).  The dress code was fairly casual.  We ordered a bottle of wine, Les Deux Anges, which was absolutely perfect and our accommodating waitress would not let our glasses be empty for a second.

We began our meal with an amuse-bouche of salmon tartare which was delicious, as was the bread that accompanied it.  I had scallops with grilled vegetables for my main course.  Excellent.  I also had a bite of Mike's duck which I can attest to being "un-FUC-ing believable."

While Montreal really is a great city for dining (as well as shopping, as I found), Vertige was easily the best restaurant we tried, in my opinion, and I would urge anyone visiting MTL to go there.
