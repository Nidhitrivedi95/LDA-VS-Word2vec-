XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Fantastique!

I have been planning to go to Robuchon for a long time but never went.  Last night before seeing MGM's Crazy Horse Paris before it closes, I decided to make it a grand evening of food and entertainment.

The meal.  I selected the 6 course meal.  For an amuse-bouche, they brought a bowl of avocado foam with grapefruit and apple.  Smoke was coming out from the sides of the bowl from a couple of pieces of dry ice concealed in the lower section.  The bowl was sitting on a plate that had apples all over it.  The smoking bowl and the apple plate went with the restaurant's fall theme.  It was very pleasing to the eye and to the palate.

Before the first course, the server came with the bread cart.  I chose a bacon bread and a basil roll.  He took them away to be warmed and while they were being warmed, he pulled a nice curl of butter from the large bell shaped mound of butter.  On this curl, he spooned some coarse sea salt.  Perfect!

The first course was spiced lobster in a cold cauliflower soup with botargo shavings.  This was excellent.  The lobster and the cauliflower made a good combination.

Second course was a pumpkin velouté with foie gras, ginger foam, and toasted seeds.  The pumpkin velouté was poured into the foam from a separate container by the server.  There were also small cubes of pumpkin for texture in the velouté.  Very tasty pumpkin flavor with the lovely ginger to add an extra layer of flavor.  The foie gras was superb!

For the third course, I went back to lobster.  I got the spiny lobster served with yucca root in a green curry with fresh coriander.  Another winner.  Very good.

For the fourth course, I chose a special that wasn't on the menu.  They had lamb chops and lamb loin.  It was very flavorful.  With this course, they brought some pommes purée and a finger bowl with a slice of lemon and one rose petal.  After all, you have to clean your fingers after picking up the lamb chop to finish the meat from the bone.

The 5th course was the cheese course.  By now, I was feeling full and I knew there were more good things to come.  I chose three cheeses--some bleu, a French hard cheese similar to manchego, and a soft sheep's milk cheese.  All three were good, but the bleu was outstanding!

With the cheese course, you were brought a raisin roll.  It really adds to the cheese flavors.

For the last course, dessert, I ordered the pistachio mousse glazed with chocolate ganache and raspberry gelée.  Heavenly, rich, dark chocolate!!

Last, the mignardises trolley was wheeled to the table. Wow.  Such a choice.  I took three, a dark chocolate demi-macaron, a vanilla macaron, and a small tartlet with raspberry and cream.  What a delightful way to end a meal and now I was very full.

Service was exemplary!  There wasn't one staff member who wasn't polite and who didn't have a smile.  The whole package--the food, the fall theme with the flowers of reds and oranges, the plates with apples and pumpkins, the service and the general ambience of this quiet, elegant restaurant--makes for a fine dining experience.  I'd love to go back and try the 14 course menu but I'm afraid I couldn't eat that much. 

Thanks to my Yelp friends who encouraged me to go here and gave me pointers, especially Rod and Marcus!
