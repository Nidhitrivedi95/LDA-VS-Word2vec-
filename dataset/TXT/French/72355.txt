XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q My husband and I are planning to dine here on our one year anniversary.  So far we've only made reservations, however it was very simple to make them online.  I suggest reserving your spot on the MGM website versus on OpenTable.

I definitely want to take advantage of the limo ride and mansion tour prior to our meal.  Very excited!
