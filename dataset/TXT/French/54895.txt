rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I'm sad to report that Bouchon didn't amaze me...at all.  I was so excited to eat brunch here because of all the hype (and I can't afford French Laundry).  But, I was pretty much disappointed in everything we ordered!  The special of the day - eggs cooked with steak, over a puff-pastry -  was bland.  The puff pastry had a nice crunch but there was too much puff and not enough of the substantial part of the dish.  Both the open-face tuna sandwich and the frites it came with were overly salty.  Also, the bread the sandwich came with was too hard...maybe even stale.  

Maybe we should have ordered the chicken and waffles.  I dunno.  Overall, meh.
