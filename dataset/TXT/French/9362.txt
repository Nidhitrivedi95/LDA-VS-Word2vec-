4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place was great for breakfast. I had corned beef hash, my father in law had crepes and wife had the 3 eggs with potatoes and sausage, my mother in law had the kale salad. All plates were great. The food of the people around us looked great also. Can't go wrong with any choices here. Service was good and the outdoor seating with the belaggio view was priceless. I can't wait to come back to Vegas and try it again.
