4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw So I'm going to start by saying the food was good when we got it. The one star is due to my servers blatant disregard for my table. I came here on 5/8/17 for lunch with my two kids. It's not overly nice or somewhere I would think they would be unwelcome. We were sat very promptly and then our server didn't show up for at least ten minutes while two tables around us were sat and had their different servers show up. Mind you, I'm sitting with a 7 and 2 year old. I don't expect special treatment but I do expect the server to have a brain and realize when kids are at a table that maybe put the kids food in first and keep their drinks coming. The server ignored us, finally took our order and then every table around us who was sat AFTER us all got their food. I stopped a manager and they apologized but did nothing to correct the situation. The server then continued to ignore us some more. My husband served through college and always makes me give them the benefit of the doubt, but this particular day was not overly busy and he literally avoided us every time he came that way. I'm glad I only ordered a sandwich and didn't give them anymore of my money. Good food but horrid service. Apparently the managers are good with their staff ignoring people as nobody ever checked on us again. I will not be back.
