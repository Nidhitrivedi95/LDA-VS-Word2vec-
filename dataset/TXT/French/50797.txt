oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q This restaurant is not for foodies. It is a twelve year old's idea of fine dining.  The Intricate, precious and altogether pointless presentation failed to distract us from the blandness of the food.   The hip, well coiffed (seemingly all male) staff were polite, and gamely did their best to soldier through the descriptions of the gimmicks that accompanied delivery of each subsequent taste-free course.  The meal was as proportionately overpriced as it was underwhelming.  Do yourself a favor and just go to the pizza place next door for a slice instead, which is what we did afterwards since we barely ate anything there.  We are perplexed by the enthusiasm this place garnered in other reviews - this experience undermined our confidence in Yelp.
