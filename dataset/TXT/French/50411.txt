ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Cute atmosphere and nice drink selection. Food was overpriced and subpar. The sweet potatoe fries were soggy ans the special dressing watery. The scallop and fish dish I had had the worst lobster sauce I've ever tasted. Burger and fries nothing special. Was very disappointed in the food. I'd only recommend going here for strictly drinks.
