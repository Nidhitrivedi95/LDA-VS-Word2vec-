in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ I was being treated to a Mother's day dinner by my younger Sis, along with my older Sis.  Vincents was the perfect place to go. 

The lobster bisque = 10 stars!! It was soo amazing! Rich, sinful, oohhh.... 
Tomato and cheese salad also, very wonderful. The olive oil was the best I have ever tasted.  
I had the lamb shank, and it was cooked perfectly, the potatoes were good, but the sauce threw me a little, I don't know how or why, but it was like the same smell as spaghetti-Os sauce!! haha! I know it obviously was not, but that is how my brain registered it.  
My older Sis had the duck with bacon lentils, she was in heaven. 
My younger Sis had the Pizza/Tarte with bacon, thyme and onions, it was very very very good.  I would go back for that and the bisque and the salad.  

The deserts were good, not great, but a nice sweet way to end our meal.  I liked the peach tart.

The service was some of the best as well, honestly, they made our meal more enjoyable.
