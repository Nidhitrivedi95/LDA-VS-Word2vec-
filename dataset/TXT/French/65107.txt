TP_tH4z4nm8oYUk_at0fMg I have been going to different sushi shops but this is the one that may not make me go to this chain anymore. Sushi variety is very bad. I was there at 6pm and only four choices were left. I chose 3 boxes and bring it home. In simple words, the sushi and maki were falling apart. They were not tight and poorly filled.
