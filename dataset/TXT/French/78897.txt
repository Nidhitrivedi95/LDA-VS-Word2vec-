ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Food here is the definition of marginal.  It's not great, and I don't know why there are so many bad restaurants in Vegas!  We have been here a few times because of the convenience factor when we stay at the Paris, but it's really not worth coming to.

The eggs are not fluffy at all, flavorless, and seem old.  My boyfriend and his family all enjoy ordering steak and eggs here, but I don't think they're too picky about their meat.  They always bring a basket of bread to go with all the orders - which is probably the only good part of the meal.

I've ordered a chocolate croissant twice here now, and it's been different both times.  Most recently it was better, but oddly the croissant was not what you'd expect of a restaurant inside the Paris hotel.  It was not crispy, flaky, or buttery.  The chocolate inside was decent, but it was a little overwhelming.  Even though I'm a chocolate lover - I ended up leaving more than half the chocolate on the plate.  It spilled out everywhere, and overpowered the (not so great) croissant.

Would not recommend, or return!
