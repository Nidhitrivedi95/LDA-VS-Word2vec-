tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I revisited this french restaurant again last night, taking my boyfriend for his first visit.  It was a very pleasant and delicious experience.  Our waitress was not only accommodating but was very knowledgeable about each dish.  The salad with goat cheese was awesome and they made something that used to be on their menu that is no longer for me as a special extra!  We own 2 restaurants and are very picky about service, food, quality, ambience & prices.  It was worth every single penny and we will definitely be back.  Thanks for a great date night!
