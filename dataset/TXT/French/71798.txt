XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw Hello cheese, wine and Pittsburgh foodies: I had the opportunity to eat here last night and it exceeded my expectations! Perfectly designed menu including pronunciations of French cuisine, I ordered the salmon dish and my fiancé ordered the rabbit--which he never had before. Both were fantastic and we couldn't stop raving about it the remainder of the night. Reasonably priced with a great atmosphere, I encourage everyone to try this out!
