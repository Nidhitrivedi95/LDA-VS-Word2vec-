O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q If you are in Vegas, Morels is the only restaurant with consistently great service and food. They kept my tummy happy this trip! The service has been phenomenal. I have been jet lagged and a bit "blah" during my business trip. Everyone I have encountered has been outstanding. When I travel, I try to go to different places. I tried several restaurants during my stay. Mostly I have been disappointed by the degradation of service and/or food at these 3-5 star establishments. Morels has been my go-to for a pick me up meal. Tonight is my last night and I felt tired and sad from leaving my family. I was treated to an empathetic staff and a wonderful steak. Little things go a long way. Will keep this as my regular place when I am in town. Much appreciated!
