SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Food was outstanding.  Took my wife and daughter here while visiting our daughter at Oberlin college. Wait staff was friendly attentive and knowledgeable.  They picked up on my wife and daughters glutton allergy immediately and brought them glutton free bread. Setting was intimate and cozy.  Tender hanger steak with béarnaise.  They also have the mother of all cheese boards.  Ended w three of us ordering deserts and kona coffee. Left a good feeling w us days later.
