mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q The seasonal tasting menu is not that worth to order, next time we will try the other set menu for more optional choice.
The pre-theater menu is very worth it, you can get 2 appetizer and 1 meat, not bad if you want to have a try.

The service is friendly, you can still feel relax and enjoy the fine dining experience.
