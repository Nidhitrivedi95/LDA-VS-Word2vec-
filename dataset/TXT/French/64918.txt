TI8BCPSStuOgnqBHyTtG9Q Nearing the end of my 7 day stay at this hotel and I have nothing but praises for this establishment. I am here on business and have been working some very odd hours. Each morning when I go down for my cab, I see the same friendly staff. Every time I enter through the main lobby, I am greeted by a friendly face and it was only the evening I came home at 2am that I did not see anyone. This night I ordered room service and wow was I surprised. The food was very good and just right after a hard day of wrenching.

The breakfast on the club level is delicious and I honestly think I've eaten smoked salmon every morning. This isn't due to a lack of variety, but rather because it is not common back home and is so fresh. 

The room is quite nice with very modern amenities and architecture. I love the hidden lighting and full size bath. The bed is super comfortable and I've used it quite well over the past few days.

I know where I'll be staying next time...
