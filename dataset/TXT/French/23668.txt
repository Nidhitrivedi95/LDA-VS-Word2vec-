cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg This is a very late review from last summer, but......OUTSTANDING!!! Our server was very knowledgeable and energetic.  We probably ordered more than we should have. The food was all very balanced and creative. The waiter was helpful in pairing wines for each course. Mostly, it was FUN!! The lack of pretension and great people watching turned my wife and mine's "let's see what it's all about" dinner into a luxurious date nite. It was a highlight to a great Montreal trip.
