dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ My wife and I went to Lake Las Vegas for Shakespeare and it ended up becomming a romantic dinner for two next to the lake. My wife went scouting for where to have dinner after MacBeth was finished and she found a restaurant.com coupon for Bernard's Bistro and we ended up having a wonderful time!! We both had a steak and the hostess/manager, Kelly, was completely amazing!!! She made the dinner way more romantic by guaranteeing us the booth in the corner outside and she checked with us a few times to make sure we were doing all right. The atmosphere was amazing and the food was great too!! We will definitely be repeat customers.
