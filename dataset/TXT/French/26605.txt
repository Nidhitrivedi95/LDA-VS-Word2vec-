Arrived at the place and I highly suggest you get the crepe to go. The waiter looked clueless and worked slowly. However, I won't be eating this place based on service. Got a crepe with cheese and tomato. Crepe was a good mix of chewy and crispy. Cheese oozed out and tasted delicious with the crepe. Would definitely revisit for the food but I will not be sitting down for my food as it delays the food's arrival!
