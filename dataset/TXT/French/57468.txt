rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Special of the Day... Chicken and Waffles... I just recently discovered the concept of Southern Chicken and Waffles not too long ago...so I figured I would try it Vegas style.  I thought it was fairly good.  I wasn't in heaven but it was good.  I didn't really try the sauce that went with it though.  It was probably the most expensive dish on the brunch menu ($25).  Friends had the steamed mussels with pomme frites which was good as well.  Would I come back?  Maybe not.. I would rather explore other restaurants.
