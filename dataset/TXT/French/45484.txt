mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q After reading the high volume of 5 star experiences here I was really looking forward to my dinner here. I rarely eat dinners this expensive. And because I was trying a restaurant that is owned by the "Chef of the Century" I had no doubt it was going to be good. Well, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. Me and my friend ordered the seasonal tasting menu ($155 before tax and tip). Honestly, the meal was, for the most part, forgettable. The bread that they served us was not warm and was a bit too hard for my taste. The butter that came along with it only tasted good towards the end of the meal after it had become soft enough to spread. In other words, it was hard and cold when it was first served to us. 

As far as the food itself, I expected small portions. But very few dishes had flavor. The only two dishes that were good were the white fish and the lamb shoulder. 

My recommendation (and something I wish I did while I was here) is to order items off the regular menu before you get stuck with a big bill and food you may or may not care for. 

Other than that, the service and the experience of the place were great. If I ever come back here again I'm going to have to try the burger and foie gras sliders because everyone else around us was raving about them.
