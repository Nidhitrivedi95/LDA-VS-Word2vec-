Great experience. Overall, I loved it. I first went a few weeks ago, the atmosphere is exquisite and an excellent interior design. My partner and I ended up being one of few couples in the restaurant as we decided to have a late dinner. To our pleasant surprise, there was a live (exceptional) pianist playing while we sat in a cozy booth over a glass of wine. The staff made us feel like we were regulars, very warm despite it being my first time. Had one of the best flank steaks in Toronto and a fantastic array of cheese. I couldn't have felt like I had a more romantic, delicious, and excellent Saturday date night. 5 stars. Can't wait to go back.
