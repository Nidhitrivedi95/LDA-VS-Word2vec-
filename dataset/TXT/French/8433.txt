4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went here with my husband and some co-workers on a work trip. We were lucky to get a table right in the middle of the patio facing the fountains at sundown.  Perfect! The food was great (he had the steak Bearnaise and I had ahi tuna) and the company even better.  
Our server was strange.  He had a weird attitude from the moment we sat down.  :(
While the food was good, I ordered a cosmo along with the ladies I work with and it was made with a lemon vodka for sure.  It also had lemon pieces in it from being squeezed, which made it lemony and not a cosmo.  He tried to argue with me about it but whatever, I just got a plain vodka and cranberry up.  Much better.
I'd definitely go back for the view, but not for the service.
