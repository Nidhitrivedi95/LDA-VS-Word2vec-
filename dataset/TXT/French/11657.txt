4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw During our stay there last week my wife and I ate here twice.  I ate here last year and loved it.  I had a great breakfast. That is why this is a three star as opposed to a two star.  My service was great and loved eating on the patio.  Our first venture here was to eat breakfast but we missed it so we did lunch it was highly highly underwhelming the food was bland but since I had a great breakfast last year we went the next day and had breakfast.  We both had omelets and both were flavorless.  We would have been happy to have breakfast there each day but our two experiences left us not wanting to waste money. The ambience and the service are excellent but not the food.  I am not sure if last year was a fluke or this year but either way not good
