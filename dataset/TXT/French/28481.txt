EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g A complete dining experience, not just eating at a restaurant.

I can honestly say that the service is completely impeccable. Every single moment is completely on point. After nearly every sip of water, a server was there within 10 seconds to fill my glass. As a big water drinker at meals, I loved the attention to service. 

The food is also beautiful and precise. Clearly plated with tweezers, the presentation is lovely. Some flavours are new and exciting, while others are familiar and comforting. All around, food was delicious. As someone who has food allergies, I always feel slighted. On my visit, I didn't feel like I missed it at all because everything was so good.

The reservation format has now changed, which is appreciated because it used to be impossible to get a reso! Looking forward to my next dining experience.
