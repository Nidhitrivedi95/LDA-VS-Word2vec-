As my husband and his friend build their cars in our garage, i go to Honey Cakes Cafe to get us all breakfast to-go. Even though we looked at the menu online, we neglected to read that breakfast ends at 11:30am. By the time i got to Honey Cakes it was 11:39am and the cashier let me know that breakfast is over. But she checked with the cook anyway to see if he would make my order (which consisted of a little bit of everything), and he said yes!! SCORE! Its not their fault i left the house late and ignored breakfast hours. 

I ordered pancakes, red velvet pancakes, 3 egg omlete with bacon tomatoes spinach & jack cheese, 2 sides of home fries, side of sausage and a latte. $38 - not a problem for me cuz the food is EXCELLENT!!! 

I tipped $10 for great customer service. The cashier and cook made my day
