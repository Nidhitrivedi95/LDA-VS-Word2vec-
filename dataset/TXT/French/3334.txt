It's also not usually very crowded here, which makes it the more appealing sibling to its Shadyside location.  Don't forget that it's cash only!  Although sometimes the service can be curt, I have generally found it to be pleasant as long as you follow the protocol (order at the counter, have cash readily on hand, etc).  Also, there is a giant tank of self-serve water and cups at the right side of the counter, which is always a nice touch.

The interior is modern and clean cut, with exposed brick and small wooden tables.

Although their coffee is not the best, I personally think it beats out Starbucks' coffee by a wide margin.  And their espresso-based drinks are very decent.  Definitely the best you will find anywhere on Craig St, that's for sure!
