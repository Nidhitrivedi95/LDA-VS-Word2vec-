4YPytg3JVO-vlzx4tBFHbA Great lil French place in Yorkville, a little on the fancy side so it would be great when you feel like special night out. Overall very nice. We were there on a warm night early this fall so even the patio was quite busy (mostly men in business suits coming from work). Inside is very cozy and has an old world feel, great lighting and decore. 

We started with a seafood appetizer, a lil medley of different things to try and although foo foo, all was delicious. Service is of course impeccable and the wine list extensive. I had a delicious steak as did my friend and it was cooked perfectly. I only wish I had room for dessert as I'm sure it would have been excellent. 

It was quite busy but still nice. Our table was a bit small and you definitely bump elbows with those around you if you sit at the lil 2-top tables along the wall but it was still comfortble.And of course if you are into it, it is a celebrity spotting location from what I've heard. We didn't see anyone that night but its a favorite and I understand why, I don't think that anyone there would have paid much attention, just didn't have that feel. Overall highly recommended. :)
