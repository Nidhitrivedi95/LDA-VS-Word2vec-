EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ Horrible horrible horrible, ordered a Blueberry Blast Martini which was good however so many wasps flying around and one dive bombed into my drink. The waitress just scooped it out and gave me back the drink. Waitress was miserable if she tried to smile I am sure her face would have broken in half. Food was comparable to a hospital. If you want to go for drinks it's great. However food and service leaves much to be desired. Given the amount of wasps flying around they really like the place!
