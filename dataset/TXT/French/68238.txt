vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I have heard so many good things about this restaurant at its new Oakland location. We had been to Regent Square and we were looking forward to the new improved and larger restaurant. The food was good- very good, but for the price point, I was somehow disappointed-(we paid $100 for two, getting only 2entrees , 2 wines by the glass, no apps, no salads, no soups, no sides or desserts or coffee).

The entrees- I got the swordfish, which was excellent, with a wonderful savory sauce.  The look of the serving dish was weird- a bowl with a blue rim that looked like a soup bowl that came from a cafeteria. The gentleman sitting 12 inches away had the same swordfish served in a slightly larger, more  elegant white dish. I didn't think this was a good sign, but it did remind me of the old Regent Square style of dishes. My husband got the steak and liked it but wished it was warmer, or the plate hotter. This was probably the biggest infraction of all. Perhaps we should have said something about it at the time, but the opportunity did not arise.

The atmosphere and decor are lovely. Elegant lighting, iron decorative sconces, carved tables, and multiple rooms. This place has a European feel, and a huge improvement over the tiny digs of the RS version. The noise was not a factor but there were distractions. Maybe it was the location of our table ( close proximity to kitchen door and Bar entrance) and the way I felt squeezed in with all the senior citizens and possibly because it was my 56th birthday, I am now relegated to the not cool section of the trendy restaurants. We had made a reservation and the restaurant was not particularly crowded. What a difference a patron's experience can be with a different set of circumstances!
I really was looking forward to the experience but I can't say for sure when I will return.
