4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw A breathtaking view at the top of the Eiffel + dinner at Mon Ami Gabi after = romantic date! 

And that is exactly what my hubby and I did one weekend in Vegas! He took me up to the top of the tower and saw the whole city of Las Vegas! The view was aaaaamazing! 

We dined in for dinner late Sunday night and there was numerous of vacant seats indoor. It was freezing outside and there were more patrons seated outdoor than indoor! Well, thank goodness for those warm heat lamps! We chose to sit outdoors on the patio next to one of those heat lamps! The location of this restaurant is great because it sits right in front of Bellagio's water show. It was nice to see what water dance every 15 minutes. :)

Okay, so the dinner. We ordered smoked salmon with cream cheese as an appetizer and for our entrees I ordered their giant scallops and my hubby ordered a steak. The smoked salmon was super delish and very fresh. I can honestly say this is probably one of my favorite appetizers. My scallops were just as good. Very soft and flavorful.  My entree also came with mashed potatoes topped with brussel sprouts. Who would have known that the combination of the two would be very tasty?! My hubby enjoyed his steak though he thinks it tasted mediocre. 

Our server was very generous. I asked for hot water (since it was so cold!) and he made sure my water was warm throughout the night. He even replaced my pot of hot water with a new one! He was very attentive and took good care of us! :) 

This is a place I would recommend for others to try. I would love to come back for brunch one day considering it's high reviews!
