0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Looking fresh to da death on "the strip" and in the mood to be winded and dined? Well then, do you see that small pond shooting water 100 feet in the air? Walk that way...

Once you walk into the jaw dropping Bellagio, Picasso's not too far away. As soon as you walk in you'll be greeted by inspiring and regal artwork, that could probably make your jaw completely fall off if you knew its market value. These types of paintings litter the entire dining area, which is truly a reason to visit Picasso alone. It's got to be one of the worlds most expensive art galleries, all wrapped into a wonderful restaurant. 

The beauty of the paintings are complemented by the sexy plating and eternal flavor of their cuisine. We dined a long time ago, but I remember having the pleasure of finishing my girlfriends unfinished plates. What a lucky guy!!!

There's not a whole lot to say about Picasso. I mean, can you describe a true Picasso in enough words to never have the need to witness one? Is the Grand Canyon describable in a short review? NO, is the answer. Witness for yourself, or the experience shall ever be unknown.
