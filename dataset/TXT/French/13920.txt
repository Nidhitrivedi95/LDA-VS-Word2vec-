50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw 3 stars might be a little too critical but I've eaten at Biffs many times and it is never a perfect experience. The food is good, not great. The oysters are a plus but aren't always fully shucked. The blood pudding was great but I don't think that is a regular item. Every time I go the staff seem to disappear for long periods of time.
