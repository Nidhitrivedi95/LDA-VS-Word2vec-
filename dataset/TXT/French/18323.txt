A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g The pastries were delicious but we were disappointed. Thought this was a bakery where we could sit down and have a treat and a cup of coffee. Apparently they don't have a license for eating in yet. They do, however sell coffee and have a counter to sit at "unofficially."  When I asked for milk or cream for the coffee I was given a basket of non-dairy creamer and told that they can't give me milk for my coffee because they don't have a license for that?!? With the price and caliber of the pastries, you'd think one could get some real milk in their coffee.
