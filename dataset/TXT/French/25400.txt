I had some friends in town for the weekend so we decided to go up to The Mix for some drinks and to check the view. We ordered a round from the bar and took a walk around to find a seat. 

We were promptly approached by a well dressed young gentleman by the name of Richard. He was presentable, professional and well spoken . He sold us a bottle of Grey Goose vodka in the VIP section of the balcony with the best view in the house. 

Not long after we were seated the bottle came out with all of the mixers of our choice. The lovely cocktail waitress Amber took care of us and was always on hand to make sure our drinks were topped up and to take photos. 

Richard dropped in and checked on our group periodically throughout the night to talk to us, make us feel welcome and make sure we were taken care of. An example of his fine Hosting skills came into play when one of my girlfriends felt a little cold. Richard went out of his way to get her a blanket to throw over her legs so she was comfortable. 

I can't say enough about the way we were hosted by Richard and actually treated like VIP's. It's subtle differences I noticed that made a big difference in our experience. From creating an atmosphere where we felt like we where special, important and comfortable to genuinely taking an interest in our conversations and catering to our needs, we were all very impressed to say the least 

Words got around about our experience. I now have some more friends coming into town over the next few months and have requested to hit up the Mix for a night out hosted by Richard. We will be back for sure!
