Tuesday's deal is $2 off bottled beer and $4 off 750ml bottled beers. They have a book of beers to choose from. The bar is comfortable to cozy up to or there's tables to socialize at. You take your pick. Lots of food options to tempt your taste buds. I recommend the truffle fries with your beer. Yum! The burgers look to die for too. My opinion... go for a beer... stay for the food.
