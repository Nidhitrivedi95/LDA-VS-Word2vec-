uPa5hrWmHm0n1l4MSyVMGQ First day!  Grand opening!  Hooray!

No kinks to iron out.  Just like Alo, service was amazing. Excellent, personable staff. Incomparable for a casual restaurant.  

We tried 3 appetizers: hamachi, tartare with fries, and clams.  We had 3 drinks.  They were all good.  

Keep in mind, this isn't upstairs.  It's definitely way more accessible to the masses. Prices are very reasonable for a casual night out.  Also, they take no reservations!  First come, first served. 

I want to say we really appreciated the fact that Chef Kriss made his rounds and personally greeted his patrons.  He thanked us for coming on this first day.  We didn't feel like customers, we felt like guests.  It was that added touch of humble gratitude that makes me a true, dedicated fan.

We will definitely be back to try the mains!
