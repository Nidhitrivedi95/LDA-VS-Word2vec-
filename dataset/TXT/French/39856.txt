K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ Uncertain whether to give 3 or 5 stars.   This is a dated restaurant with dated decor and dated menu but they did all of it very well. Razz is the chef owner and along with his glamorous wife and lovely daughter they provided a terrific evening. The food is sauce heavy. Every dish was sauced to the extreme and while all delicious it's surprising to find this menu in 2016.  Razz is clearly talented under the toque but still cooking from his days at the Sheraton.  If you live old school charm and cooking then I highly recommend. If you desire a more nuanced, protein sensitive approach then I would pass. As he has been thriving for 22 years clearly there are plenty who appreciate his approach.
