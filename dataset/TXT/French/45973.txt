mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q 4 1/2 stars.  One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas (and NYC).  Delicious, innovative dishes made all the better by friendly, attentive service, a fun, relaxed ambience, and the bonus of being able to watch the fascinatingly painstaking food prep process.  Highlights include the decadent braised pork belly and pommes purée, and the refreshingly light Les Légumes (Mediterranean vegetables layered with Buffalo Mozzarella).  The only disappointment for us was the dessert course---a tart assortment which didn't live up to the perfection that preceded it.

Can't wait till my next visit!
