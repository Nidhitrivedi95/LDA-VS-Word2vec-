4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had the beef burgundy - 5 stars. My guests joked when I ordered decaf coffee after dinner, but when they tasted it they agreed it was very good. Some of our group went for  a breakfast meeting two days later and the coffee was not nearly as good. I am not sure what happened. Very good service.
