cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I have yet to be disappointed by any of the dishes I have tried at this fine restaurant. Martin Picard knows his meats and loves to experiment with his foods in a way that is sure to delight your taste buds - provided you eat pork, duck and other game meats. Just be sure to call and reserve ahead of time.
