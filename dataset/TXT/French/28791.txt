eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw On my vacation in Montreal I wanted to try a classic French restaurant. 
The hotel recommended Bonaparte and made the reservations.

The decor is classical and pleasant.
The service was warm and attentive.

We had the tasting menu and I was pleased that it was priced under $100 per person. I was not amazed or blown away by the food but everything was good. I would go back as it's reasonably priced, the food was good and the service was excellent.
