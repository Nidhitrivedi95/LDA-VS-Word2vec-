iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg Great food, wonderful flavors and the perfect place to splurge on a special date for two.  Pricey but worth it.

I saw Wayne's tip about the coupon at http://www.restaurant.com/le-sans-souci-french-restaurant-cave-creek-french-pid=36877 and bought one too.  Seated nearly immediately in a restaurant that was just over half full.
We heeded fellow Yelpers' advice and got Escargo, Ceasar salad, brochette and duck l'orange for our dinner selection.  Portions were on par or larger with great flavors that were wonderful.  Ms. D is a Francophile and was very impressed which made me happy.

Dessert was Creme Brulee for her and Chocolate Mousse for I with great coffee.  Desserts were far too big for us as was the after dinner drink.  My Grand Marnier must have been a double!

Excellent food, proper service and a great selection lends this an easy 5 star review
