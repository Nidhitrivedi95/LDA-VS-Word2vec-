What I find most atrocious however, is the terrible business savvy and customer service of the management at Chez Vous. The Euro trash that run this joke of a restaurant are rude and inconsiderate. Today, while waiting for a table I was accosted not once, but twice by the owners, asking why I was using the restroom. I don't think they knew that I was waiting for a table, but even if I wasn't, I could have been a potential customer, or someone ordering to go and popping in the restroom before placing an order at the counter. 

Either way, it's not good business sense to treat any one in your establishment as if they were garbage. The first time was bad enough when the owner asked if he could "help me" as I was walking into the restroom and making a snarky comment that I just come into his restaurant to use the restroom. What really tipped me over the edge was that his wife was actually waiting for me when I came out, and asked me as well if she could "help me". I informed her that I was indeed waiting for a table, intending to dine, and not just "randomly entering restaurants to use the facilities."

At that point, the owners "helped me" immensely by making me realize that Chez Vous is not a restaurant that I will patronize again.
