hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Such a cute find in the Southwest area. This cafe is buried in a group of business buildings, but still easy to find. I got here around 11:30 on a weekday and there was no line. Once it hit 12pm, the lunch rush hit and the line was almost out the door! I had the pesto sandwich which was really good! The baguette was so light and was perfect for the sandwich.
