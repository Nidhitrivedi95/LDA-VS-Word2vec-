D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw We took a couple of work associates here for a business dinner, and given that it had great reviews, we thought we were in for a treat. The cocktails were underwhelming, my shrimp cocktail was exceptional and the beet salad was apparently great... I ordered the beef bavette medium rare and the outside of it was really well done, the interior was pink. It wasn't bad, but not great either. The moment that made this a "never go there again" experience when they asked us to leave after paying so someone else could have our table, and there were other tables open. It had been fairly pleasant up to that point but the way that the restaurant staff handled it felt pretty crappy. They told us, "You can go to another bar, down the street..." Excuse me, what? Yeah, you'd be better off with any one of the other amazing restaurants in this area.
