h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ Would not recommend the Saturday brunch to anyone - recommend only for tea/coffee and treats. 
Went for brunch last Saturday afternoon... what a let down! The venue itself is very small, but nicely decorated and very rustic. Service was lacking and food took a long time to be served. When food arrived it was mediocre and we had to send some dishes back as they were missing ingredients... not a good first impression. For a restaurant that can only seat a maximum of twenty or so people, I find it hard to fathom how these mistakes are made! Servers brought over a complimentary tiramisu to make up for our experience. Overall, I would definitely not be in a rush back here... there are PLENTY of other cafe/bakeries that deliver impeccable service and quality EVERY time (*cough* NADEGE *cough*).
