xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w On a lonely drive back home to Maryland we decided to Yelp and sniff around downtown Pittsburgh.

Boy did we nail it.

So, in what order? Pomme frites are the best we've ever had ... the steak sandwich (skirt steak) was crazy good.  Mac and cheese was "plus" and the mussels were quite tasty ... even for my first foray into mussels.  Even the baguette was swell.

A very quaint joint with great service and high quality food.
