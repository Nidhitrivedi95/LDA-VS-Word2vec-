0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw If you can't get reservations for Joe Beef (who can?! I tried 6wks before my visit and everything was booked up for the 4days I was in Montreal) then get a reservation here.  Sister restaurant to Joe, you will get the same quality here - it's just more laid back.

I sat at the bar and ordered the lobster spaghetti.  It was creamy and the pasta perfectly al dente and it came with big chunks of lobster still in the shell (they make you work for your food here!).  The portion is big so pace yourself!

For dessert I had a grapefruit meringue thing - it wasn't too sweet (my preference) and had a fresh, slightly tart taste .

I know people are disappointed when they can't get into Joe's so they think coming here is a let down but honestly put this place on your list to try out!

The decor is quaint and the service is exceptional!  I'd definitely come here again.
