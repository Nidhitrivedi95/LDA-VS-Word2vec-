4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came with a group of friends as a celebration dinner. I was a little worried because someone else picked this place and I have Celiac Disease, so if I eat anything with wheat in it I get really sick. After a little bit of research I found that this is one of the top restaurants in Las Vegas for people that need a gluten free meal. I was not disappointed, I was blown away by our experience here! They have a whole gluten free menu! Our server was very knowledgeable about what I could and could not have. I was even able to have gluten free bread! The filet mignon was the best I have EVER tasted (and I used to work at one of Denver's top steakhouses!)! The sauce and seasoning was absolutely savory. I have a hard time getting my meat cooked to the medium-well-plus that I like, not here! My filet was cooked EXACTLY how I love it! They even had several gluten free dessert options! When we were getting to leave our server told me that they also have great gluten free breakfast and lunch options as well. Yes, it was a little on the expensive side, but it is worth it because for the food quality and service we received. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Las Vegas and can't wait to return next time! Thank you Mon Ami Gabbi!!
