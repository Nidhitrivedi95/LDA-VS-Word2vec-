ChwyMZi_eZlMfL9qpXH_zw Stopped here for brunch while in town for a friend's wedding and we were very impressed. Delicious savory buckwheat crepes (gluten free ) and for $5 you can add on fruit, yogurt, potatoes and coffee which was all fantastic. Instead of the home fries we were expecting, they brought out three deep fried mashed potato nuggets of pure delight! Fruit was freshly chopped and not just a pile of melon. Coffee was great as well as the service. We will definitely return.
