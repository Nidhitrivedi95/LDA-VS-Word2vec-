XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w For airport restaurant food, not bad. Was waiting for a flight today so tried this place for lunch. Nice healthy choices as well as the standard burgers and steaks.  Manager and staff seem to be on top of things.  Don't rush the dishwashing; manager knows what I am talking about.  Next time I am in Phoenix and at the airport will try again for a possible upgrade in this review.
