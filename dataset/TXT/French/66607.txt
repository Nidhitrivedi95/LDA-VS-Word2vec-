uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg BEST. EXPERIENCE. EVER.  

[situation] The boyfriend and I were planning a day in Old Port and we wanted to end the day with a nice restaurant. Obviously, I referred to yelp! Le Robin Square has often popped up when I search for restaurants, but it never really appealed too me. It seemed like every other restaurant. This time, after our initial plan fell through, we decided to look into it. And WOW! The reviews were incredible!! But a lot of people said that it's the best food they've ever had and I thought they were clearly exaggerating. Anyways, I've never seen such positive reviews before, so we went! 

[experience] We arrived and had to wait outside, as there was not a lot of space inside. A waitress quickly came over and asked us how many we were and told us we'd have to wait about 30min. 

We waited maybe 10min before a counter seat opened up and we took it. The waitresses that helped us were all so sweet and they told us a little bit about the restaurant's history. 

I got the Mac and Cheese and my boyfriend got the ultimate experience. 

The waitress made sure to tell me to mix my Mac and cheese before eating it, or it'll be too salty. I imagine some customers have complained before, because they didn't stir it. 

[food review] The Mac and cheese was INCREDIBLE!! So creamy, so flavourful, cooked to perfection, just amazing!!! Each bite was a little piece of heaven! The pork belly (with the ultimate experience) was extraordinary! It melts in your mouth!! It's been 2 days and we still occasionally turn to each other and say "remember that Mac and cheese? Omg! So good!!" I was so sad when I reached my last few bites! I wanted it to never end! After we were done, we were extremely full though! Ah, the food was just too spectacular! 

I've had a lot of good food, but this was actually, hands down the best meal I have ever had. The other reviews were not lying after all. I can't wait to go back to try their other dishes!
