KSUpHqi0pu-rpouVs-KVdA My friend and I visited Montréal for a few days and this was the restaurant for our last nice dinner together. We found it online and were surprised that there seemed to be little reviews, but we wanted to try some French cuisine.

The restaurant was a bit of a walk for us form our hotel in the chilly weather, but it was worth it. The atmosphere was romantic and classy all at the same time.

We were greeted with a tasty menu. Having a later reservation, we were the last table to be eating, but the staff made no indication or pressure for us to leave. They were very keen to see that we had a great meal.

The food was amazingly prepared and left us pleasantly full and happy. We were particularly pleased with their vegetable soup and their dessert sampler.

Great Food, Great Wine and Awesome Atmosphere.
