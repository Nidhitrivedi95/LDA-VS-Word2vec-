IE-FSNn9Zx9YFx3nJV4C1A I went here with a colleague during a work meeting--about a five block walk from our hotel. It was a Wednesday night, and the restaurant was reasonably full. I called ahead 15 minutes to make an 8:30pm reservation, and they were nice as can be.

The great thing about this restaurant is their fixed price menu. Even while traveling, I still need to be budget conscious. We were able to get a half bottle of wine, salad, and an entree for about $35. Not bad.

The salad was great, with ripe tomatoes and a great dressing (Mesclun salad, fine herbs, cherry tomatoes and roasted hazelnuts). I had wild mushroom and asparagus canellonis with ricotta, which was phenomenal. And the wine was great.

Ambiance was very good; my colleague and I had a booth and were able to carry on a conversation easily. 

I highly recommend this place for good, unique food, at a reasonable price. Perfect for the business traveler.
