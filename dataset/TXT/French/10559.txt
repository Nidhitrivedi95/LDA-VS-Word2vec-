4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw TL;DR: awesome location, overpriced for mediocre food like most Strip establishments, bad for vegetarians.

Friends and I came here because we wanted some vegetarian options, and mostly because we wanted to watch the Bellagio fountains. Unfortunately, there were basically no vegetarian options. 

Food: All of us had the frisée kale salad; one of my friends and I are vegetarian, so we replaced the bacon with avocado. This seems the way to go b/c when my friend got her salad with bacon, the "bacon" was literally tiny pieces of dry bacon bits. I secretly wondered if they had used Bacon Bits and called it a day. My salad with an egg on top was very good, but small portions for $13. 
Coffee here is absurd - it comes with refills, but costs $4! 
We split the bananas foster crepe which was tasty - it's a large crepe with a good sized scoop of vanilla ice cream inside and a dollop of sauce, around $12. I took a peek at other entrees, which were almost all meat, and they were around $23-25 - a lot given the quality of this place. Free baguette and butter to start, but it tastes like a supermarket baguette.

Atmosphere: you pay for the location. Right across from the bellagio fountains, which you have a great view of if you sit outside. On warm days, patio is the place to go for people watching.

Price: I paid $21 before tax and tip. Pricy for the quality, but average for Las Vegas Strip.
