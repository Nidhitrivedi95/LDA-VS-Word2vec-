Carpaccio was beautiful and delectable. The quail was succulent, on a bed of wild rice. Desserts did not disappoint. Trying the Ile Flottante with caramel is a must. The chocolate tart (made with 70% from Tanzania) was about the best I've ever had. Lemon tart was smooth, balanced in flavor, and topped with a sumptuous dollop of white chocolate ganache. There's something for every budget on the wine list. Old fashioned French brasserie atmosphere and service in Montreal. Try it, you won't regret it.
