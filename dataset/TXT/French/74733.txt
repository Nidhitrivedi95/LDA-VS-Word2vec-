xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Oh my gosh. This place was good. BUT EXPENSIVE. 

I've never paid $18.00 for a 4 ounce cocktail. Golly. It was good but not enough. Service was good although our server could have tried to smile a little more. The bread was endless and being a sucker for bread, I probably ate more than I should have. We both had a salad which was actually a pretty decent size for the price. There was only one vegetarian entree on the menu (the crepe) and it was excellent. 

We had to go see a show and sadly didn't have time to wait for the souffle. We had the chocolate cake which definitely hit the spot. 

Our bill was just over $200 for a cocktail, a glass of wine, two salads, two entrees and one shared dessert. Absolutely worth the splurge. We didn't get to enjoy the view as we sat inside but it was for sure one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas.
