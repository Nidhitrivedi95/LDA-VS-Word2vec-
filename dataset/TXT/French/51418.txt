P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Impeccable service... near flawless food... foie gras with lentils and black truffle was such a nice change from the norm of sweet pairings with foie... downright one of the best traditional french meals one can find in las vegas.  A bit cold atmosphere but exceptional cuisine.
