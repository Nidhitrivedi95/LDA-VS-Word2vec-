klzCMxmhrHWZeNseS4GKFg This small restaurant is a hidden gem! It is the type of restaurant that has very few dishes on it's menu (handwritten, no less!) but all of the dishes are delicious and expertly done. This to me this is the sign of a fine restaurant. Small, romantic, and charming (with a French Cafe verve) it has brought us back to it whenever we visit Edinburgh (so far twice in 5 years) and we will continue to come back because it produces consistently fine food. Make sure to book a table before coming because it fills up quickly. I wish I could transport it back to Los Angeles but that would not be fair to Edinburgh. Bravo and congratulations Edinburgh!
