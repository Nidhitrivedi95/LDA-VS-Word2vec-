78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw I sort of got dragged into going to this restaurant by some co-workers. It looked somewhat "swanky" what with the wood paneled walls and soft lighting The prices were moderate ($8-12 for appetizers and $25-35 for entrees).  Anyway, the service was OK but that was more the fault of the management since the waitress had too many tables but the food, blase. I ordered the flat-bread pizza which was greasy and spongy and my appetizers were just OK (lobster bisque was too creamy and rich and the bruschetta was not crispy nor the toppings very flavorful).  Take my advise and skip Le Provencal.
