SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Best French brunch I've had in years. This despite standing outside in the freezing cold with about fifteen other determined Sunday brunchers waiting for a table. 

Crowded noisy interior, but it's got that magic state where you have a sense of intimacy with your date despite the cramped tables, perhaps because of the charming warm decor? Or maybe it's the lusciousness of the chocolate croissants and other pastries in the beautiful display case. How French pastries can create a sense of intimacy with a date may explain more about my love of food than is discreet, but there it is.

The service can be a bit rushed, but professional. I get the sense the owner has a firm hand on the till(er), and would have it no other way. Or maybe the rest of the week is quiet, so they've really gotta pack 'em in on the weekends? Still worth the wait, provided you're not with hangry company.
