I had the lemon poppy french toast - it's more like a lemon pound cake that's been sliced and then pan fried, it's very sweet so it needs fruit to cut the sweetness. It comes drizzled with lemon curd, too! I also ordered a latte - nice and creamy, none of that sour coffee taste. It was expensive for what it was - $20 plus tip for the french toast, extra side of berries and a latte.
