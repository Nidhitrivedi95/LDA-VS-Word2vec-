rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A OH my gosh the chicken and waffles. Seriously. I have had fried chicken and waffles before, but this roasted chicken was just so. much. better. And the waffle....savory and fluffy and amazing. The smoked salmon rillettes were amazing, as well. And on top of all the fantastic food, the service was impeccable. This will be a must for me every time I'm in Vegas!
