I had the Caesar Salad, Steak Frites, and Chocolate Mousse dessert. Everything tasted good and the others around the table ordering the various other things to choose from all had good things to say as well.

Beyond the prix fixe they do have a standard menu and a large amount of specials (at least 4 appetizer specials alone!). Beer menu had Kronenbourg Lager and Blanc both on tap (keeping true to the french roots) and a handful of other bottles and cans to choose from. 

Most importantly, they have a quaint and mostly enclosed and heated patio out back. So even though it was a bit chillier than typical patio weather would allow for, we were able to enjoy our meal comfortably.

Recommended for family dinners, but also has potential to be a good date spot.
