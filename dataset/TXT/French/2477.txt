0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g This place is fantastic!!!!!  I cannot stress that enough!!  I had a 4 course sampling menu with the wine pairing.  The first course set the bar very high and the rest of the meal did not dissapoint at all.  The first course was a quail salad, it was absolutely delicious, the quail was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and was seasoned to perfection over a bed of some kind of greens (I forget what kind).  The second course was a kobe meatball, it was good but kind of forgetable, the real star was my main course.  It was by far the best lobster I have ever had in my whole life, I don't know but whoever made this is a freaking genius!!  And to top all of it off the view at Picasso is spectacular.  I am making my husband take me here every time we go to Vegas.
