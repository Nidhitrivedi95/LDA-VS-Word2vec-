TI8BCPSStuOgnqBHyTtG9Q Stayed here for one night in sept booking through last min.com it was a secret hotel so we got a discount.
We were able to park for a discounted rate of £8 which isn't bad. We were checked in quickly and the room was nice. I dont know that I would be overly impressed if I paid full price esp as the breakfast was not included and cost £17. It was in a good location though so all in all very good.
