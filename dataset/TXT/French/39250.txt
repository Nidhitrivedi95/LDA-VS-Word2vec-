I had a pulled-pork/avocado sandwich (served cold) and a bottled water to have across the street in the park. It was a pleasant experience - they could improve the product by using bread that doesn't taste like a white/bread chewy dinner roll from Swiss Chalet (you know the type).

Three acceptable but you could do better PATS
