mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog When it comes to good food, hubby and I are always in. Luckily, Montreal is full of both low and high-end amazing food, and so we've lucked out in that department. On a special date night, we decided to finally try Toqué. We'd been hearing great reviews from friends and colleagues, and so we booked our reservation and excitedly made our way to this beautiful restaurant. We both knew that we wanted to have the tasting menu, to allow ourselves ample opportunity to sample as much of the menu as possible. When we do this, we consciously make an effort to pick different items so we can sample each other's plates. Now, I can't tell you about all the awesome food we had, because this review would be super long. But, what I can tell you, is that the venison is to.die.for. It's been a few months since our visit to this restaurant but I still dream about the venison. So flavorful...so tender...so heavenly. I want to go back, and just order 5 plates of the venison....yummm...

Sorry about that.. I had a moment. Back to the review.

Service was impeccable throughout the night and the food came out in a timely manner. Although we were full by the end, we were not stuffed in a sickly kind of way (like when you go to an AYCE sushi place and overdo it), and left feeling happy. Of course, the price is what you would expect - we spent around $300 for 2 tasting menus and a bottle of wine which is reasonable given the quality of the food and service you get. Overall, excellent experience. We will definitely be back (or at least I will...for that venison). If you're looking for a nice date night where you get to dress up (you NEED to dress up here) and enjoy phenomenal food, this is the place for you!
