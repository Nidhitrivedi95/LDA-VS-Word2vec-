XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg New French pastry cafe. They also have crepess and galettes (look it up if you don't know). I tried the cinnamon roll, chocolate croissant, and apple turnover. All were very fresh and amazing. My favorite was the croissant. Coffee was also on point. Would highly recommend. Very reasonable prices, clean and great service.
