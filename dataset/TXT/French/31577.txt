gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g We were luck enough to meet some of the owners and one of the wives- they are all so kind and sweet. The restaurant is really pretty inside, clean lines, light and bright... the staff are so attentive...  and the prices are amazing!! But what you really want to know is how is the food- right!? 

The pastries are out of this world- we had 3 at the table and honestly I can't say one was better than the other- they were all exceptional! Broccoli guac w/ gf chips- my gosh... SO good!!! We took home 2 reg croissants and 2 chocolate- I just finished the choc one and it melted in my mouth. 

We are going back Monday night for their new dinner menu. Too bad you can't give more than 5 stars- you all deserve it!
