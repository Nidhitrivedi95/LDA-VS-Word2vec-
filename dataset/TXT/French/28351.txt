EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g Amazing experience from start to finish.

Staff are as friendly as they come. Ambiance is warm and cozy with just the right amount of  sophistication. 

We had the tasting menu with wine pairing and each course was outstanding. The presentation was elegant and the flavours were adventurous. Each course was an experience but be warned- this is not the place for you if you aren't open-minded, adventurous and don't appreciate a fabulous culinary experience. If you are someone who thinks The Keg is fine dining, bypass Alo and go to your nearest suburban chain restaurant for mozzarella sticks and fajitas. 

Sure, the portions are small but this is not the type of food you eat in excess. It is not meant to be devoured quickly so you can make it to your 9pm movie. It is meant to be savoured and appreciated hence why the courses are spaced out. You won't leave stuffed but that is one thing I loved about it. I was able to enjoy the meal, enjoy the wine and not want to pass out by the end of it. 

Definitely one of the best restaurants in this city. Well worth the cost (not even that pricey for the quality you are getting. $95 per person and an additional $65 for wine pairing) so if you have been debating whether or not to go, do yourself and your taste buds a favour and GET THERE IMMEDIATELY!!! 

Thank you, Alo. You're fabulous.
