uTCOEqjuVAXUOzti5TWj2Q It was my first time checking this place out after dinner with my fiancee. We tried the sweet crepes in the menu. It was actually decently good. The crepe was fluffy and savory. Definitely enjoyed every bite. 

The place was small but very fancy. In the middle back of the room they have a small bar set up that you can help yourself out with the drinks. Their menu however seemed limited and not that much choices to chose from but maybe they'll expand the menu overtime. We only tried the sweet crepes so I still have yet to find out if the other crepes in the menu are any good. Will come back though to give it a try. 

You can however order the crepes plain with no toppings if you so choose to buy your own toppings and make it your own combination on your own time. Based on what I was told it would probably cost between $4 to $5 for a plain crepe but definitely double check with them to be sure. 

The only thing unfortunate about my first visit to this place was it turned out to be one of their busy weekend (Saturday). So, we did waited for quite sometime for one order. 

The employees however were very friendly and nice. 

Check this place out if you happen to be around the area and see for yourself.
