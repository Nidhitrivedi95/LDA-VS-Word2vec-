HcfwrlljJpfLh71znq47zw This is one of the only Michelin Star Restaurant in Edinburgh. It's located off the beaten track (or in other words, down at Leith) and is something quite special to Edinburgh. I quite like getting in a taxi and going down to Leith, it almost feels as if I'm in a different city altogether!

The restaurant is funky, as my mum described it. It's nice, modern and clean, but maybe could do with a touch more excitement. But you don't go to a Michelin Star restaurant for the decor. The food was, as expected, delicious. The best part is there is always a good deal on to eat here, so you can get amazing food for next to nothing!
I had lamb with vegetables in an orange sauce, which was YUMMY and my dad had steak, which he loved. 

It's a brilliant place to come to for a special occasion!
