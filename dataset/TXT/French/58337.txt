rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I have tried to get into their sister restaurant in Napa, The French Laundry, for some time with no luck since reservations are required 60 days out and are handled like a radio contest. So since I was given the opportunity to dine here while staying at the Venetian, I figured this was as close as I was gonna get. Reservations here were much easier - opentabled it the same day.

The restaurant is as beautiful as you would expect and the service is spot on. It is definitely pricey, but that was to be expected. The wine list is original and the menu has a great variety. I had to go for the foie gras and it was one of the best I have had. For my main dish, I wanted to try something adventorous so I opted for the sturgeon. I have never had it before and it sounded great on the menu. Sadly, it wasn't anything special like I was expecting - just an ok piece of fish served fairly plain. I was hoping for something inventive and creative, but it was probably a basic sous-vide with barely any seasoning/sauce. My friend ordered a salmon that was actually very good - perfectly prepared and a tasty sauce to go with. 

It is definitely worth going to, just for the pate even.
