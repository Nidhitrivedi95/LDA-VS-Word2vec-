O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Finally got to take my mom here tonight & she loved it! They have a board of all their specials for the day. We tried their salmon belly ceviche, salmon w/ Uni, octopus, foie gras w/ scallop, soft shell crab, premium seaweed salad, and their steak. We enjoyed all the dishes! The sauces & flavors were on point. Their prices are reasonable for the quality your getting. We will def be back to try their lobster w/ Uni butter & escargot.
