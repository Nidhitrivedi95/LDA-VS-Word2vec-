I was quite pleasantly surprised by the banh mi here!  It was a decently sized portion served with a nice pile of fries for $12.  The pork belly inside practically melted in your mouth and it tasted pretty darn similar to a good Vietnamese banh mi you might find in Los Angeles.  If I came here and only ordered the banh mi I might have given this place five stars.

On the other hand, I was quite disappointed by the Ohio Beef.  It was a 2x2x2 inch cube of short rib and a 2x2x2 inch cube of steak, paired with a few carrots for $22.  Not filling, and not much flavor either.

The pork belly appetizer was a good sized appetizer and delicious as well.  The apple bread pudding dessert was okay, but the texture was more reminiscent of french toast rather than bread pudding, and the tartness of the apple came through a little too much.

We had a reservation for 5:45 pm and we called around then saying we would be about ten minutes late.  The maitre d' told us that this "might be a problem" and went to talk to the manager.  They said it was fine in the end, but really?

I would give this place a shot - order the banh mi, and don't order the ohio beef.  And be on time, I guess.
