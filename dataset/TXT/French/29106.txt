epvLkQNL6MOvk3s6JlTntA Kind of an odd experience eating here.  The menu is extremely limited, and the crepes are made of buckwheat, which is not a good thing.  Some of the ingredients are very good and very high quality, such as local artisan cheeses, while others are very low quality, such as rubbery eggplant and frozen fruit.  Everything was either really, really good or really, really bad.  For the prices they charge, I expect EVERYTHING to be really, really good, so I doubt I'll ever be back.

Service was fantastic, though our server was wearing a shirt cut so low that we could see the little bow on the front of her bra.  It was pretty trashy for the otherwise very nice atmosphere.  The portions are tiny, especially considering the prices.  I had a salad, entree, and dessert and would've left pretty hungry had I skipped the dessert.  

Some of the food is quite enjoyable, and all of it would improve substantially if they used regular crepes instead of the buckwheat.  I really liked what I dub "the world's smallest salad," and I would've enjoyed it even more if the tiny little thing hadn't cost more than a full entree does at many other restaurants in town.  A lot of the food, including the crepes themselves, seem to be made ahead of time and warmed up instead of being made fresh.  I think a lot of dishes are microwaved based on the funky texture and uneven temperature, which was very off putting.  The peach crepe I got for dessert was warm and wonderful around the edges, but by the time I got to the middle of it the peaches were still frozen.  So, bad ingredients + bad microwaving = $7 dessert.  No thanks.

Beer selection is good, but also very overpriced.  Overall, while some of the food was quite delicious, I feel like I didn't get enough of it for how expensive everything was, and some of it was pretty bad.  I think this might be a good place to go just for drinks and dessert or something, but as a dinner destination I wouldn't recommend it.
