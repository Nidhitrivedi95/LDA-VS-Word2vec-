YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g After eating mediocre food for every single meal in Vegas, I was relieved to finally eat something half decent, actually, pretty excellent. I'm giving 5/5 because there was nothing disappointing about anything we ordered. Also, when comparing this place to some of the other 'fancy' places, it is much better.

Fancy Fleur is a sweet place. Portions were on the smaller side, as is standard for a 'fancy' place, but they were not so small that I felt cheated (like at RM Seafood down the hall...)

We ordered lots of things when we went. There were good flavours in all the dishes. The deserts were great and I would go back and just have deserts. The on the spot-made ice cream was a sweet touch. Get this one. Liquid nitrogen seems so in style these days - it is quite showy, and was also part of their other food presentations. 

The lighting was a little bit on the low side, and I found myself squinting a lot and having a hard time seeing the food clearly, but overall the ambiance was very pleasant. 

When you make your reservation for Fleur, you can request a table with curtains that can be closed so you can dine in exclusive privacy. It's cool.
