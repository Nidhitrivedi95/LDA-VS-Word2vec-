KrIaAgB3rkUABidWfC05-w Yvonne T. gave me the heads up about this place and told me the baguettes and quiches are fantastic.  I got both the classic as well as the whole grain baguettes as well as the mushroom quiche.  
I have to say I really liked this place and the woman behind the counter was so helpful.  She took the time to go through everything they offer in each fridge.  She explained to me where the actual bakery is (this place was too small to have their own bakery there) and told me a bit about the business and gave me the names of a few restaurants that they supply baguettes for.  She was very friendly (I wish I could remember her name) and loved that she wasn't pressuring me even though there was another customer behind me.
Immediately I tried both a piece of each baguettes and they were both amazing.  The outside is crispy but the inside is so soft with a bit of saltiness(more so with the whole grain) and sweetness to it.  The price was fantastic too at $2.50 & $3.00 for the classic and whole grain respectively.  The quiche was $5.50 and as soon as I got home I threw that thing into my oven and after 10 minutes, I just demolished this thing.  I don't even know how to explain how this tasted except that it was so yummy.  The texture was really nice with the crispness of the tart shell and softness of the egg.  The flavor was incredible.
The shop: cozy but nice atmoshere.  
Will I come back again?  Of course!  I really like these  baguettes and I wouldn't mind trying more quiches.
