xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My girlfriend and I got engaged on August 27th and I made a reservation at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant to celebrate.  We were greeted warmly at the top of the elevator and the lady asked what we were celebrating.  We told her that we had just gotten engaged a few hours before and she excitedly asked to see my fiancee's ring.  She then walked us over to the front desk and told the lady there about our engagement.  They congratulated us and seated us at a window table.  The view was fantastic!  My fiancee was staring at the fountains and I had a view straight down The Strip.  The wait staff was very friendly and professional.  We ordered champagne and salad to start.  The salad was delicious!  They then brought us bread and a corn dish that we did not catch the name of.  It was a free sampler but quite tasty.  I ordered the slow roasted filet of Atlantic salmon.  My fiancee ordered the baked herb crepes.  Both dishes were amazing!  We both had a few bites of the other's dish.  Now we aren't the types to usually have an expensive meal but since we were celebrating our engagement the price was not an issue for me at all.  I have nothing but good things to say about the experience and we definitely plan on coming back for future celebrations.
