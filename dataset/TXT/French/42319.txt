L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug My first visit was so welcoming that I came back the next day. First off, they have pate chaud! Oh man, it has been so long since I've had one of those. The pastry part was nice and flaky and the inside was flavorful. The almond croissants are also delicious and goes great with a Vietnamese coffee. On my second visit, I tried the bun bo hue. I thought it was okay. The broth was flat and lacked the lemongrass flavor that I love. It was also very spicy, which was nice, but slightly overpowering. Everyone was really nice and friendly. Sounds like they plan on adding a lot more offerings, which I'm pretty excited about. Overall, I'm diggin this cafe. I'll definitely be back.
