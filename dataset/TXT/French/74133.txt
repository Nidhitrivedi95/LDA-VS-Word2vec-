I got invited to the Eiffel Tower Resturant at  the 11th floor of the Paris Hotel for a business function dinner.  The guests are whisked to the restaurant in a glass elevator that takes you to the electric activity of one of the city's top kitchens before being escorted to the dining room, where panoramic views and exquisite cuisine take center stage.  The glittering lights of the Las Vegas Strip appear even more dramatic in the dining room's intimate lighting, and guests are treated to spectacular views of the glorious Bellagio water fountain show across.  Metal framework from the Eiffel Tower dramatically breaks through the restaurant walls and creates a modernized art deco style.
The course of the meal is defintely gonna satisfy you with the very, nice desert list.  Highly recommend an experience you'll remember!
2nd Visit:
Order their Souffls!!! Regardless if the host tells you they take half hour to prepare for those Chocolate, Grand Marnier, Pistachio, Banana, Raspberry or Benedictine Souffls, order it! You'd love it!!! ^^
