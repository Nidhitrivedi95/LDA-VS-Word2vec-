3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA We brought my buddy here for the official dinner of his Bachelor Party - food was amazing!!! Duck confit and escargot were phenomenal - excellent wine pairings and the staff was friendly and attentive and a charming restaurant with ambiance. I will definitely go here again next time I venture up from Boston!!! Merci beacoup!
