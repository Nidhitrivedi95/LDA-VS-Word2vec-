m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q When New Orleanians vacation elsewhere, it's important for us to know the best bars in the city that we're visiting.  There's research and what not...we take our cocktails serious.

Le Lab definitely did not disappoint!!  I was pleasantly shocked that the staff was so friendly, since snobby/rude bartenders are apparently the cool thing at craft cocktail bars in the US right now.  Eddy and Fabien are extremely knowledgeable and love to talk about their craft.  The drink menu was extensive and had a nice selection of summer cocktails....and any place that carries sazerac and can make a top-notch Corpse Reviver #2 wins in my book!!!  They also make their own syrups which are for sale to the public...try the ginger, it's the best!

If you live in Montreal, I'm extremely jealous that you could visit this place on a regular basis.  Go there tout suite!!!
