YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g As a resident of the lovely city of San Francisco, I've always wanted to eat at FDL.  How could you not after having read over and over about how delectable the food is and how romantic the setting is as well.

However, I've never got the chance to experience it.  So I'm planning a trip to Vegas, and yes there are tons of restaurants, and maybe I should have tried one that I can't get to in SF, but I didn't.  As soon as I knew I was going to Vegas, I began deciding on what restaurants I should go to.  FDL made the cut.

As expected, we were not disappointed either.  We opted for the Elegance menu, which consisted of 4 courses.  Each beautifully presented and each were provided with brief but lovely descriptions.  The only downside to our dining experience was our server, who although pleasant and helpful, was a little slow to come around.

I definitely need to get myself to the San Francisco location soon!

P.S.  I forget the name of the drink I was sipping on whilst eating dinner.  _____ Kiss, which consisted of Crown Royal, Amaretto and some other ingredient.  It made for a mouth watering sip of scrumptiousness that's for sure!

P.P.S.  They have a nice lounge area where you can order drink and tapas.
