XNvklghmapxOlCB-wGv_sA The ribs and the service were good.. Unfortunately that was it. Both steaks at the table were under seasoned and bland. The skin on the duck wasn't nearly crispy enough and the appetizer salad was also weak. I care more because each steak dinner was 58 bucks each.. I'll pay for good meat and have come to expect the best in Montreal but this was not even close to good enough at that price.
