AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw My girl really wanted to come here, so we ate lunch.  The gigantic shrimp that came as our starter in our three-course pre fixe $21 meal were huge, meaty, and the butter/garlic/white wine sauce it came in was delectable--perfect to dip the bread in.   The romesco was delish, but I didn't even need it as much as the sauce the shrimp were cooked in.

Both of us had the cornish hen an our entree, which were fabulous, if a little well done.  Skin was crispy, and the polenta cake they came on was heavenly.  You could really taste subtleties in the dish, like the thyme and garlic in the dish.

The desserts were fantastic, and what the chef is known for.  French pastries that were flavorful, delicate, yum...

Oh, and the maitre'd is an absolute gem.  We were saying that this might be the best $20 lunch we've ever had.  Great!
