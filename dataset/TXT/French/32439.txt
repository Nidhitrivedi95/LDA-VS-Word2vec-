gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg We stumbled upon this place because we just didn't know where to eat when we arrived in Montreal.  From the looks of it, it's your typical chain restaurant serving bar food and some pub-like cuisines.

Seems ok for a lunch spot as the locals poured in at noon on a friday.  Prices are a little steep for mediocre food.  Beer of the month was warm, but i think that's how everyone in Canada likes it?
