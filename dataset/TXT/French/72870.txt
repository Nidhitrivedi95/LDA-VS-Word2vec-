XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q The restaurant seemed out of place at MGM.  It would have been better suited at an upscale casino like Aria, Wynn, or Bellagio.  But, we went there anyway.  

The presentations were amazing.  I can see over paying for food combinations, expertise, art, etc.  But, the drinks were also way overpriced.  It was 30-40% more expensive for scotch than getting identical drink at a bar 100 yds away.  Wine list was exceptional.  Many quality half bottle selections.  

It was excellent.  But, not flawless.  They forgot our cheese course after we ordered it!  Food was amazing, but overall, not worth the investment.  Amazing food, just not worth $300 a head before drinks.

I would rather eat 3 times a another premium restaurant.  Disappointed.
