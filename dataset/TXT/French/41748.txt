KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw Neither myself nor my partner had ever been to Montreal before.  I know, I know.

This hotel was a great jumping off place for us to get situated & learn our bearings of the city.  It's right down the block from the Square-Victoria metro stop (& technically you don't even have to go outside to get there!  You can utilize an underground passage.)  It's also close to Vieux-Port & Old Montreal.

The lobby itself included faux fur, sequins, & zebra print.  It was...err, interesting.

No free wifi - $10 for two hours or $15 for a day.  Seemed a bit skimpy in comparison to the image they were presenting otherwise.

The water pressure in the shower was excellent.  Why have I been settling for subpar pressure in our own apartment washroom?
