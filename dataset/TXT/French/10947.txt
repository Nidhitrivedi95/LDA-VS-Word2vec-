4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I really wanted more for a $60 meal.  The restaurant is beautiful but you expect that in the nice hotels in Vegas.  Service was also nice and very attentive.  The mixed drinks were pretty tasty also.

Now to the main purpose of a restaurant...the food.  Blah!  The French Onion Soup had so much cheese and almost no onion.  I don't think I can  express how much cheese....soooo much.  Too much.  For my entree, I had the seared sea scallops with whipped cauliflower and spinach.  The scallops were still raw and cold in the center and although there was a nice sear on them, the outside was cold too.  The cauliflower was more runny than whipped and the spinach was just okay.

I gave up at dessert. Friends who did have dessert said it was good but nothing they couldn't have had somewhere else, cheaper.
