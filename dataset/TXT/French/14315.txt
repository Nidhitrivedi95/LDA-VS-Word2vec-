58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Took friends from out of town here for brunch on thanksgiving weekend.  A 30 minute wait for a table but we managed to kill time browsing in the little shop, lots of local foodie treats on offer.  It's a busy lively spot with high ceilings and lots of light.  Coffee is decent.  I had the brunch Sante which was delicious and very filling.
