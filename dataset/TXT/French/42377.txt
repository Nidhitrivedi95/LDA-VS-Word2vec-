L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug I came here for 2 things: DURIAN macaroons & Spicy beef noodle! Did not disappoint me! Opened about 3 weeks ago, for now they have a limited menu, to me it's not a problem, I prefer QUALITY over quantity! The server told me that they baked their macaroons in house, right now come in a few flavors: Chocolate,coconut, DURIAN, mango passion fruit. Also they bakes a bunch of other French Vietnamese pastry like croissants & pâté chaux. Also have Bánh Mì, buy 2 get 1 free! They encouraged feed backs since they're new, so do tell them if you want them to improve something, but so far, I thing they do a pretty good job! I have a suggestion though, I know they try to attract a variety of customers, they should offer blood cake for the spicy beef noodle to the Asian patrons as an option.
