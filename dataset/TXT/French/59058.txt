rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I LOVE this place.  You're always going to come here knowing what to expect...which is great food.  No tricks or gimmicks just great french food.  We've gone here at least 4 times over the 6 years my husband and I have been together and we live in Northern California.  We usually get the tasting menu and always foie gras and a souffle to end the night.  The service is excellent the decor is whimsical.  This place is a staple in our Vegas trips.
