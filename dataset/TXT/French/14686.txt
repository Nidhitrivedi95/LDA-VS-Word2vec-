5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I've been to this location a couple of times and every time we have been seated out in the atrium (party of 6).  It's super awkward sitting out there. There's no music and it's you with 3 other tables. Maybe that's where they place the bad kids ;-) 

Anyways, the food has been pretty good. I've had the mushroom pizza (awesome), the assorted mushrooms (guess I love mushrooms), the Mac and cheese (yummy in my tummy) and the steak burger (jaw dropping). My favorite has been the steak burger, which my husband and I split.  It was cooked to perfection and had the best flavor. Plus it was only $13 and came with the side. FYI the onion rings are bomb! I haven't tried the chicken yet (which I think is the signature item), so I'll above to try it next time. 

My only drawback to Roosters besides our seating arrangement is that they are sometimes out of items because it's farm to table. When they are out- they are out. Last time I was there they were out of the scalloped potatoes, asparagus and broccoli. I was really craving the potatoes which was a let down.
