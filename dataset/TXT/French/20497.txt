AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Excellent pastries, just okay brunch.

My fiance and I both ordered benedicts for breakfast since the waitress highly recommended it. I wasn't terribly impressed since one egg was pretty much soft boiled and the other was half boiled, half gooey. Fiance had the same deal with his eggs. The hollandaise sauce was perfect though. The fried potatoes were pretty standard, nothing impressive.

For desserts, had the George V, a caramel dessert, and a small baggy of macarons. The mousses were perfectly smooth and creamy, the chocolate dark and decadent. The macarons were good (crisp shell, chewy center, not hollow!), but I must say I liked Jean Philippe's more. The packaging held up well enough so I was able to take them on the plane without much damage to the treats, but they are a bit bulky.

Payard is going to be a must have whenever I'm in Vegas, but next time I'll skip the brunch and buy all the cakes.
