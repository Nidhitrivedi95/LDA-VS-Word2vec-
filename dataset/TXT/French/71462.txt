XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w This place is a great alternative to the options at Sky Harbor. Yeah, the food is pricey. Yeah, it's heavy on the belly. Yeah, it takes awhile for your order to be ready. But in the end, it's worth it. I've had their sandwiches several times, and they're always top-notch. The pork belly is a bit heavy, but if you have someone to split it with then it's just about perfect. And their fries will knock yours socks off... but chances are you have a spare pair in your luggage, so that shouldn't be a problem. 

If you have a bit of time between flights or before you take off, then you'd definitely do well to pay this place a visit. Sky Harbor has gotten some great places to dine in the past year, and this is definitely one worth a visit!!
