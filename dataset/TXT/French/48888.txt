We really were just feet away from people walking through the lobby, yet it still seemed posh.  The pianist was also just a few feet from us, and I felt so classy joining in on the golf clap after he would finish a piece.

Process was easy peasy.  Just checked in at the MLife desk and then walked back to Petrossian.  We explained to the host and server what we'd done and they just asked to make sure we had our MLife cards on us (so they could run a check at the end of your meal and apply the proper comps).

You get three 1.5 oz pours of different vodkas paired with different caviars.  Look at other reviewers' pictures and you'll see the crumbled egg whites and yolks plus onions served with the caviar along with some soft bready things.  (There is also gratis thin toast if you prefer.)  This normally retails for $105/pp.  The wife couldn't resist getting the foie gras ($40).

If you use a comp, please make sure to still tip on the full value!  We did, so whoever's up next, you'll get some good service.  =]  (and no, the server did not remind us to do so; she was fabulous despite running the risk we'd forget)
