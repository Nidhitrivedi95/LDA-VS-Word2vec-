Good selection, some items are just OK, but then there are a few that are amazing, such as the pancetta wrapped gnocchi.  Even the "OK" ones are still quite good though.  Their beer and wine lists are also very good, if a bit limited.  They do have some excellent choices though.  It does end up being a bit pricy, but its tapas and that's generally what you should expect.
