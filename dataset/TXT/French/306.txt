-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA We went there on a Sunday night and it wasn't crowded at all. Very lovely place. We ordered the artisan goat cheese appetizer which was really delicious. He had the duck and I had the chicken. Both were excellent. Our waiter mentioned that the menu changes once in a while so don't become set on eating something a reviewer had because it may not be there anymore. The food looked just as wonderful as it tasted. Presentation here is great. They asked my boyfriend what brought us to the restaurant and he told them it was our anniversary. We ended up being given a complimentary dessert. It was an absolutely delicious chocolate mousse. We were very happy.
