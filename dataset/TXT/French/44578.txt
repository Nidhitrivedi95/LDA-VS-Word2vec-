mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog The 7 course chef's tasting menu was an experience like no other. The chef was obviously a world class artist and one incredible dish seamlessly transitioned into the next. The service was professional and attentive in a way that did not overshadow the beauty of the dishes being served to us. I briefly mentioned my gluten sensitivity and with a quick nod the server said "not at all a problem" and I was taken care of from there without another word. The sommelier was knowledgable and entertaining sharing stories about each glass of wine he paired with our courses. We were absolutely floored by the flavour in each dish. Was it cheap? No. Was it worth every penny to go on a 3 hour journey of the senses? Absolutely.
