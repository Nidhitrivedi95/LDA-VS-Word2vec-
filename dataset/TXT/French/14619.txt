5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Roosters' downstairs bar provides a convenient place to meet after work along with a good atmosphere to catch up with coworkers.

Where Roosters falls short is competitive  pricing on drinks to retain their audience long term.

Finding yourself short of $15 for two beers is excessive to a point where walking a block over to a place where one can obtain a pint for a more moderate $3 outweighs Roosters' location convenience.
