FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw I really love the authenticity of La Baguette. The owners are French, and that makes me happy. I took 10 years of French classes and was happy to know I could understand them when they explained to me what each quiche was made of.

The quiches they have are made from local ingredients. They usually have a pretty good assortment.

I tried the Chocolatine for the first time. It was super good. Anything chocolate here is pretty darn good. I also had the Chocolate Ganache Tart. It was très delicieuse. 

Their bread pudding is another must-have. The caramel sauce on top is heavenly. I'm drooling just thinking about it. I've never had bread pudding before here, but I definitely like this one!

It's cash only, which is a minor inconveniwnce, but there's an ATM in the parking lot, so it works out!
