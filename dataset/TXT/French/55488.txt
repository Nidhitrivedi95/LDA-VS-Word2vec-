rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A If you ever want to have a great breakfast while at Las Vegas, then this is the place to try. 

Fresh baked French baguettes served with softened butter and fresh-made preserves is how they welcome you.

One of he best Salmon Benedict I've ever had.  Please note that is not listed on their menu, but they do prepare.  Just ask!

Their service is just excellent.

Don't be discouraged if the place happened to be packed and don't be afraid of having breakfast at the bar, the service is equally excellent.

After breakfast, go over for dinner for some amazing seafood.
