T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA Finally got here after being on the radar for a couple of years and we were glad we did!  Les 400 Coups offers sophisticated  contemporary French cuisine in a cool laid back environment, California/ Wolfgang Puck Style. It s a place to try the tasting menu, as we did, to get the full range of the talented kitchen. Everything was artfully presented and explained with out any of the usual pretentiousness you may find at other restaurants that put out such a high quality plates.  Each of the 5 courses representing a good chunk of the total menu, were a flavor bomb. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The standout was the tartar of arctic char   ( u like the rhyme) a beautiful combination of citrusy, flowery flavors, and  fish. A 10 on the rating scale. The desserts of which there were four examples were plated like little works of art with all kinds a great colors, textures and flavors. You should try the wine pairing with the tasting menu they have a lot excellent wines and not totally Franco -centric. they really know there wines and are not cheap on the pours which I have come across at other restaurants. While Les 400  Coups is not cheap at about $100
per person all in. You would pay at least twice as much in other restaurants of this quality, but ,the nice thing is you can come in your jeans and tennis shoes or jacket and tie and still be welcomed and a little bit dazzled without the all the hype.
