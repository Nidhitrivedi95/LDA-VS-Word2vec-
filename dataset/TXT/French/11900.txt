4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came to this steak restaurant about 5 years ago and remember it had good steak for a good price. Most steak places at $60. A New York steak is like $33 good price and steak was made to perfection! The french onion soup was not so great. They over cooked the onion so it left a bitter taste. Order the special with was duck liver. Okay had better for the price. And the seafood dish, pretty tasty. Overall, looking for a reasonably price steak, I would recommend this place. Their bread is is complementary and a good baguette.
