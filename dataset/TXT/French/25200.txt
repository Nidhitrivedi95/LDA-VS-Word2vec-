Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Seriously!  I went out of my way to eat here?  My husband and I stayed in Las Vegas for 3 nights when he had a work conference.  We ate at lots of well rated restaurants-  Mon Ami Gabi, Red Square, Nine Fine Irishmen, Fleur, Verandah, and Ri Ra to name some.  Of all the restaurants this one was over the top pretentious FOR NO REASON.

During our mid week October stay we had reservations at several of the above mentioned restaurants.  It was unnecessary as there weren't many people in Las Vegas.  When we arrived at Mix without a reservation we were told they don't accept walk ins.  (Very rudely).  Then we went back to our hotel room in Mandalay Bay and called.  My husband was told that they were booked for the entire night.  I logged onto yelp and booked a table through Opentable.com that was 7 minutes later.  We walked right back.  The same hostess seated us.  Silly!!!!

The waiter was overly chatty and not very attentive to our needs (vegetarian, gluten free).  Even to the point not to tell me there was HAM in one of the breads they bring to the table.  My husband had a steak and asparagus.  I had the gnocchi.  Neither was anything special at all.

The best part of the experience was standing on the bar balcony after dinner.  We would not go back!
