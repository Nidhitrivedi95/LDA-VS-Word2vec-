0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g My significant other and I really wanted to like this place. We were excited to dine here for months since our experience at Olives (comparable fine-dining restaurant in Vegas) was so wonderful!

Our experience at Picasso started off with the utmost attention to detail and enjoyable conversation at the bar while waiting for our table. The bartender was purely delightful and his drinks were truly FANTASTIC! Our first impression at this point was stellar. We soon were sat down at our table. The restaurant itself and ambiance it creates are one-of-a-kind and nothing short of a Michelin rated restaurant.

We were suggested to dine off of their recommended prix fixe menu and we gladly obliged as they informed us some of the items have been on the menu for over 19 years! After the amuse bouche, neither of us were impressed but we were still optimistic for the rest of the courses. Unfortunately, the rest of the courses were mediocre at best, definitely not deserving of a 2 Michelin star rating.  I can't even tell you what I ate, one because it was so dim and I couldn't really see the food but also because nothing left a lasting impression. It is almost sad to admit but I truly believe the best part of the food was their bread & butter.

Overall, to our opinion the food is bland but I think a lot of reviews already speak to that. Such a shame for this beautiful and elegant restaurant to be hindered by the weakest link of its core - the food that it serves.
