4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Food was good, not exceptional. My boyfriend and I ordered their steak plates, the au poivre and the borderlaise both medium cooked. The borderlaise came out more medium-well than medium.  The au poivre was tender, and the sauce was a good combination of peppery and saltiness. Both came with crunch thinly sliced frites. 

The view and ambiance was a, it was raining when we went for lunch so we weren't able to sit on the patio area but the inside had an area which was just right behind the patio with huge windows so we were still able to watch the Bellagio fountain while eating!
