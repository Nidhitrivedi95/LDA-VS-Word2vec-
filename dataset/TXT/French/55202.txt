rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Went with a few friends and had a great meal, great service, and great time.  Wine selection was okay but it's Vegas so the prices are expensive and the selection was alright.  

Hors - D'ouerves were great.  We got the Rillettes aux Deux Saumons and Pâté de Campagne -- both excellent choices.  The salmon spread was the best I have ever had.  The Pate was also great -- awesome spicy grain mustard to compliment the sweetness of the pate.  

For the main course I had the steak frites cooked medium rare.  It came out perfect with a substantial amount of delicious fries.  If you are going to choose between the roasted chicken (which many recommend) I would go with the steak frites -- though, both are great.

Highly recommend making a reservation before you get to Vegas. Enjoy!
