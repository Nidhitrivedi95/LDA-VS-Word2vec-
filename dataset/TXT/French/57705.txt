rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A yes, i'm back!!

and this time i ordered the Moules au Safran. OMG it was DELICIOUS!! the broth was so flavorful with white wine, saffron, mustard, and the sweetness from the Maine bouchot mussels. This dish was served with French fries - YUM! love their fries!

And they do not go stingy with their mussels, i had a good amount of mussels and with the fries that came along with it - the portion was perfect for lunch.
