For the foreigners, Place des arts is like the Lincoln center of Montreal. As for the food, the highlights of the night was the whipped cream and herring eggs as well as their frites. This place serves some of the best fries I've had. The fries were perfectly crispy and perfectly sized, not too thick or thin. The potato au gratin was a bit non- traditional but still decent.  Overall food is good, but probably wouldn't recommend any out of towners to go out of their way for this place.
