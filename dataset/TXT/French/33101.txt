HGDY8ZQkCmZ_d_OR_glSgA We are happy to post a five star review for this restaurant. We did a lot of research before setting our sights on La Gargote; read many reviews and looked at a lot of menus. The ambiance is classic French bistro in Old Montreal. We were greeted by the host, Samy, and seated promptly. The menu is a bit on the small side, but it is obvious that they take care with preparation and presentation. My meal included (by choice) an arugula salad - other choice was a carrot pottage - with an entree of cod. The cod was oven roasted and presented with capers and tomatoes along with a rice timbale and steamed veggies (I'm sorry I didn't take a picture - beautiful to look at). My partner had the filet (7 oz.) with a peppercorn sauce that was accompanied by roasted potatoes and steamed veggies. Meat was perfectly cooked to medium and tender. Desserts chosen were chocolate profiteroles (oh so delicious) and tarte tatin; both made in-house. Yum! Samy was attentive and quite pleasant. His servers paced the meal well and were very nice. There is a full bar and available seating outside, weather permitting. We strongly endorse your consideration of this restaurant.
