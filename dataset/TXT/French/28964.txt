Eoj4-cffvbIQxLTO-C_K0g This place is my absolute fav restaurant. 
What we had:
Food: 5/5 absolutely lovely, light, yet rich. OUR table had the steak, the shrimp ravioli pasta with squash sauce, 3 course with braised beef pasta, leek potato soup, and orange cake. 

Thoughts on food:
Man. As someone who works at a restaurant, my expectations are normally high, and my friend who is a cook concurred that the Hall's food is absolutely amazing. 

Ambiance;
Good for a fancy date, family gathering etc. 
The interior is absolutely lovely. Charming old Church vibe with stain glass windows, old wooden architecture and also a court room feel.
Since this place is kept by the Osgoode Law society, there are many lawyers and even justices who frequent this place. Therefore the dress code of the crowd will be semi formal - business formal. If you under dress here, be warned...you may feel a bit out of place. 

Price:
The value for food was amazing. A 24$ steak, 18$ pasta and a 3 course meal for 24$?? Are thou kidding me? Those are amazing prices. And everything was on the ball for me. 

Conclusion: 
Will deeeefinitely frequent this place again.
The interior of the Osgood's Hall building itself is reminiscent of a casual Museum. Its quite beautiful. The people working in the building are friendly too!
