THE HIGHLIGHTS
They were super flexible in adapting the 5 course tasting menu to my pescatarian diet and made sure we didn't have any other dietary restrictions.

The wine pairing went perfectly with the meal; we ended up getting three glasses of white wine, about 8 oz each.

The service was seriously impeccable. Our server was super friendly and warm, knowledgable about the menu, and incredibly attentive. They made sure we enjoyed every dish and slowed down the pace of our meal so we could enjoy our wine (which there was a lot of). I can't overstate how good the service is.

The quality of ingredients, the attention to detail, the presentation, and the flavors are all reasons that make the food amazing.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Out of everything, my favorite appetizer was the octopus carpaccio. My favorite entree was the red snapper with zucchini and red pepper purée, and my favorite dessert was the raspberry macaron with lemon cream.

OVERALL
The food was deliciously amazing. The wine pairings went perfectly with our meal, and the service only elevated the experience. I definitely, definitely, recommend this place, and I can't want to come back!

TIP: definitely don't skip out on dessert here. The dessert was seriously so good, after trying two, we ordered another to go!
