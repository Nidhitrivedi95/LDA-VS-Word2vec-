UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q Off & on, whenever I visit Toronto,I have usually ended up "here" ok, their other 2 locations, which are both different now.

We had a server that has been around 4ever.  He seemed a tad tired, slightly  annoyed, and uninterested with his serving & job overall.  VERY bored.

But it was with good company, the bottle of wine was nice (albeit we had to usually pour it ourselves - I hate that - you pay more than double in a restaurant for the courtesy, the ambiance, and the of course, the service.  The bartender was completely lacking in any suggestions of wine, or the questions I had about any of them.  That really bugs me - especially since all the wines Lists in Canada are completely different than what I am used to in US.

That said, the décor is a bit like being in an old brick factory/printer/warehouse from the 1920's, but was a good change from the norm.  The famous French Onion Soup was really good (but here's a secret: Costco now sells individual frozen French Onion Soups and seriously?  They are just as good!  I know, hard to believe, but that's just my opinion).

Overall, there was nothing exactly 'wrong' nor 'bad', and it was not really a let-down or ruined our evening, I was just disappointed at a restaurant, who has been around about 30 years, to not excel on all levels.
