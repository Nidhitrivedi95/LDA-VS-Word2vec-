Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng I had a choc chip with walnut cookie today and it was AMAZING! 
It was huge, which i'm always suspicious of (usually, only nasty cookies are that huge) but it was soft and moist on the inside and crumbly and hard on the outside. there were ample choc chip chunks and walnuts. MmMMm

Oddly, i got the cookie from our company flu shot clinic. 
Take a shot, get a cookie. 
The cookie was so good, i wanted to take another flu shot to get another cookie. 

I'll definitely venture to the cafe to check out their other goodies. Can't wait!
