4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Last year,I went to Vegas  for a week due to my hubby's conference there; after i checked at Yelp ,(before we left), we tried Mon Ami Gibi for brunch....wow! Their waffle was so....yummy! So last week( June ,2012), I went with my hubby to Vegas again ( the same reason there), we put on our schedule to have a brunch there again....still, we both loved their waffle. So far, I haven't found any better place for waffle in San Francisco than Mon Ami Gibi.

went to Mon Ami Gibi for breakfast last
