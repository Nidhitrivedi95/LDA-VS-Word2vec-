9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw Having enjoyed the original location so much, our party of three went - sans reservation - on a recent weekend evening. We do that from time to time. We know going in there may be no room, or a very long wait. We were fine with rolling the dice, hoping we could nab a table at the new location.

Like most others, we like the new location. It's a bistro of sorts, so yeah the tables are close together, just like most other bistros. The patio looks great and with cooler weather coming will no doubt be crowded.

Once we entered and stood at the reception table there was no one there to greet us. Staff running around (the place was fairly busy although the bar was completely empty) but no one acknowledging us. After a few minutes a harried hostess greeted us and we told her we knew that without a reservation we might have to wait a while, or maybe the place was fully booked. She told us to wait and she would see what she could do. 

After 20 minutes and no sight of the hostess we figured we wouldn't get in. Hey, no problem, that happens from time to time (but what about the empty tables in the bar?). Here's what got us: when the hostess came back after those 20 minutes she told us that "even with a reservation it is sketchy getting a table." Pardon me? Are you telling me it is troublesome getting a table even with a reservation? If that's the case what's the point of reserving a table? For that matter, what's the point of coming back?

So, in fairness, my review isn't for the food (I have no idea if the food is any good), but for the  amateur behavior of the hostess. Should we elect to go back perhaps we'll do so after making one of those "sketchy" reservations.
