vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q This was my final meal after a 8 month project in Las Vegas.  I had some amazing meals while working in Vegas, but Twist may have been my favorite.  If not the best, def. in the top 3.

We did the 5 course tasting menu, but elected not to do the wine pairing.  Instead of the full pairing, we had our waitress recommend wines for us that would pair well with whatever course we were on.

Each dish was delicious.  The items on the menu were Uni, Foie Gras, waygu steak, a lobster dish, and a quad of desserts.  I continued to be happy with each plate.  The presentation, taste, and service was fantastic.  After the Uni dish was serviced, Mr. Riches response was "This is one of the best things I have ever tasted." I am really glad that I had the opportunity to experience Twist, and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the meal!
