mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Sadly, not amazing as I expected. =( Plating was good but the flavors weren't as intense as I wanted. 

We tried the items below but none were impressive to me. 

foie gras amuse bouche
yellowtail tuna tartare
beef cheeks
fresh cod flakes 
french style hangar steak (with buttery mashed potatoes)
caramel choc mousse with poppy seeds crumble, sicilian pistachio dome
strawberry compote with lime tequila sorbet
