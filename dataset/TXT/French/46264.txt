MZ4EEf4VtkeSJURIGgp2AQ very tasty food. Been here for the past 3 years since I discovered it. Best restaurant in Markham. I always order the beef tenderloin with a seasonal appetizer. The sea scallops (if offered) are some of the best. Pricey however, but I roll straight up balla so it's no problem. Good service + good food = happy dyna.
