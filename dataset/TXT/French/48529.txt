ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig The view and patio environment were great and the signature cocktails were very well made. I wish I could say the food matched the scene but it didn't live up to what you might expect.  The suggested corn and shrimp arancini were much closer to deep fried creamed corn balls than they should be.  Over-sweet and lacking any flavor or accompaniment to brighten them up. The French onion soup was just over warm despite the bowl being hot to the touch. The fig/blue salad was nice but could've used more lettuce and less prosciutto chips which seemed to be deep fried and rendered bland.  The squash was great, a bit charred and well prepared.  Kudos to the warm hospitality from the server who mentioned she is from the other side of Black mountain. I'll be back but will stick with drinks and an app instead.
