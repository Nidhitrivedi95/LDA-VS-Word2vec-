WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Must try: In the eggs section, the crepe with chocolate, strawberry shortcake, and bananas
IT IS AMAZING!!!
Their menu is an all day thing... So u can have the same thing for different meals if u really like it
WE ENJOYED IT SO MUCH WE WENT THERE TWICE IN THREE DAYS!!!
Tip: if u get a crepe with chocolate get the chocolate in the side because they put a LOT on
Also the chocolate is really Nutella
