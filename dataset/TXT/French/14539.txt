The restaurant was ok. Service was lacking. Waitress acted bored. Our wine glasses sat empty after our cheese sampler was served. Chester came by and fixed the situation. Waitress gave us our check without asking if we wanted coffee or dessert. The manager, after complains, was very nice and gracious. Food was pretty good. Only because of Chester and the manager would I come back and give this restaurant another try
