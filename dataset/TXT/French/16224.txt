7MltaA4C_wYJ72JHCOS4zQ Situation: dinner with my husband

Background: I had dinner here with my husband in 2/2017. We had never been to the sewickley area and thought we would try a restaurant there. btw the houses in this neighborhood are gorgeous. We didn't think we were very hungry and thought we would keep the ordering to a minimum, but as soon as we saw the menu, we decided to go for the 3 course instead of the 2 course meal.  We loved everything (from dishes that we ordered to the standard additions: bread, amuse-bouche). I thought the veal was slightly oversalted but my husband thought it was the best veal he has had.  We are both fans of Altius but this restaurant (although does not have the view of altius) has more creative dishes and better execution.  The decor/setting was intimate and romantic, modern and not frilly.  Also, service was excellent. 

Assessment: This is a great french-american restaurant with solid execution of an delicious-sounding menu.  and we would definitely come back again.

Recommendations: Josephine's desire (cocktail), beef tartar, pork belly, veal, pappardelle, gnocchi
