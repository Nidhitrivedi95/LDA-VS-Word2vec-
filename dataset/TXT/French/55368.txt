rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We had  lunch/breakfast  here and the food was great.  The croissant was one of the best I ever had and I've had plenty.  The brioche bread with the egg dishes were delicious as well as the corn beef hash and frites.  The only complaint was the hamburger being a little overcooked.  I would definitely eat here again.
