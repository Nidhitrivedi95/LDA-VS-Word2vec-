SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Went with a group for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday mid-February. Bar was the site of some Onion Beer Tasting event that night and was incredibly crowded, loud and pretty young. The dining room was much better (calmer). Of the 6 of us - 4 loved our food. Most curious was that 3 got the steak frites and 2 were thrilled. The 3rd ended up with a steak that, while cooked medium rare, tasted as though it has been marinated in liquid smoke. For days. When we notified our server of the issue she was unfazed and didn't really offer any remedy but to cook it more (???). This was neither the first, nor the last, time that night that our server seemed indifferent to us / her job / her tip (???). 

Service and craziness in the bar certainly left something to be desired but otherwise, nice drink / wine menu, very good food for most of our group (the other person who wasn't thrilled ordered the skate wing and found perhaps that it just isn't to his taste), tasty desserts and a simple but upscale atmosphere (in the dining room).
