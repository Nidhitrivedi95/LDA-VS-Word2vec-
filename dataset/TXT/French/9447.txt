4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw A go to of mine whenever we head to Vegas. The food is always decent. Service is usually pretty good but this time we got a lukewarm experience. When the waiter realized we didn't want to order an appetizer he just disappeared the rest of our time there. 

I had the steak frites au poivre which was good. The portion size was pretty big and I was quite full afterwards. My boyfriend had the steak with the bordelaise sauce and he loved it. We will definitely come back.
