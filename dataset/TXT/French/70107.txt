wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ We came by to check this place out for our weekly date night. We had high hopes for it as it's very close to our house and seems nice inside. We sat in the bar; which was fine except for the service was very poor and the food left much to be desired. While the staff was friendly, they lacked professionalism or a sense of awareness when it came to things going on in the restaurant. While this may be understandable when a restaurant is packed, it is unacceptable when there are 6 people eating.

The menu was limited and not what we saw online. The food that we did order was bland and oily.

Needless to say, we won't be returning.
