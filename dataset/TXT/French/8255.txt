My friends had the vegetable tagine (which they didn't like) and the french onion soup, which was good. We had some expensive cocktails, which were all nice. Our waitress was really great, which saved the rating of this place.

Portions were decent too, and the location is right on the strip in front of the Paris hotel.

I knocked off one star for price (I paid $50 for an entree and 2 cocktails. I think you can get a better value at the buffet, personally) and one star for food quality -- it wasn't terrible, but you can find better in Vegas, especially at that price point.
