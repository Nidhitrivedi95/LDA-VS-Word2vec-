ggIWkJtgXHKnhdxRu338AQ Came here for the Summerlicious menu on a Saturday night.  It's in a quaint little location just tucked away in a condo courtyard, and sitting down on the patio you get the outdoor feel, but it's not as hot and you get more privacy than in other patios.

The patio was quiet around 7 but by 9 it was comfortably full, and the service was attentive, albeit a bit disorganized as they had different staff doing different duties over the course of the service, as well as trainees on the job.

I had the gazpacho with goats milk yogurt to start which was delicious and refreshing with a bit of kick in the chili, while others had the watermelon salad which was also delicious.  The mains were the weakest part of the service, as the flank steak was quite tough and came cooked in strips as well as being full of connective tissue making it hard to cut.  The curry lemon chicken was tasty and tender, but it did not seem to go well with the curry sauce.  The side slaw was the highlight of that dish.  Dessert was the Irish crème mousse and a banana split dish.  The mousse was quite delicious, and the banana split looked good as well.
