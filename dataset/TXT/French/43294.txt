LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw Edwins is a newcomer to a great spot for fine dining, a very cozy, beautiful dining space with a fireplace, just across from the Shaker Square rapid station on the Green and Blue lines.

The decor and theme is in the "relaxed fine dining" pattern, a good blend of classic and informal touches.  There were a few bumps in the service, but nothing that marred the experience, and nothing that seemed out of place less than a month after opening.  The staff are all friendly, attentive, and focused.  They serve very good bread from On The Rise bakery, and refilled the bread plate with such enthusiasm that it was hard to avoid exhausting my appetite before the actual meal.  (Better to request that they remove the plate than to simply decline another piece, if you've had enough bread.)

I didn't examine their beer or wine lists in detail, but their cocktail list focuses on classic cocktails that fit well with the French cuisine.  I had the "Automne En Champagne", a variant on the Champagne Cocktail with walnut bitters.  A delicious choice on a cold autumn night.

I had a salmon dish with cucumber and horseradish, very rich and delicious, though perhaps a bit too heavy on the salt.  My wife had the Portabella Napoleon, a delicious layered vegetable dish with a very striking presentation.

We didn't order from their selection of cheeses, but observed that being served at another table.  The cheese display, wheeled into the dining room on a large cart, is quite a sight.  It seems that element has received a lot of attention.

We were too full for dessert, but the coffee was excellent.

It seems that they seek contributions to the nonprofit institution in lieu of tips.  (At least, a line for contributions replaces the usual line for tips on the bill.) 

I approve of the Edwins Institute mission, and the restaurant is a welcome and excellent addition to the Shaker Square fine dining scene.
