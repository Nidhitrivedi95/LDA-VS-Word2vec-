MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Sometimes we need a little French... Whether it's the culture or the kiss. Colette, located in the Thompson hotel is a relatively new spot. They opened October of 2014. The decor is exceptionally authentic with marble and wood shipped from France... Actually, that might make it more authentic than a restaurant in Paris. But I digress.

The restaurant reminds me of a romantic painting, of sunny afternoons gone by. It is a great spot for brunch or a nice luncheon with the matriarch of the family or a place to break bad or celebratory news.

The food is expensive, but no more than your standard fare at any decent French restaurant... So why 3 stars you ask, it was the food. It tried but for me, I wasn't en amour (in love). I had their mushroom soup, which I found too acidic. It should have come with a nice crostini but was fairly naked. I tried their mozzarella pear salad... More cheese than salad but the almost baked pears made that dish. I also ordered the Brussels sprout sides with beef tongue. The beef tongue reminded me more of spam than anything else but the lightly fried potatoes were a winner.

Finally, the macarons... Not macaroons... Macarons. They are professed to be the best in Toronto... I'm not sure. It is true they aren't overly sweet but they tend to be denser and I like my macaron to be light and airy with the right crumbliness as I bite into those colourful cookies.

Ah. To be at la Durée!
