I haven't explored the savory, but the sweet is on par. Just by visual, the savory options are authentic and quality. The sweet tarts here are very tasty. I enjoyed  almondine, pear, and raspberry tarts while also being awarded with a cannelle and macaroon. The lack of one extra star is for service. They definitely need to up their attention to customer service and how they approach. Their is a lack but its simply finesse-related. This will not deter me from revisiting them many times to try everything they offer!
