4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ We stumbled upon this restaurant and found it to be the best overall dining experience of our trip. Simon, our server, was amazing! I had the pork cheeks....oh, my....so tender and flavorful. I had no idea that pork could be so good! My daughter had the mussel soup. While I have never heard of that, it was incredible. We will definitely visit here again. And if you do, listen to Simon's recommendations. He knows what he is talking about!
