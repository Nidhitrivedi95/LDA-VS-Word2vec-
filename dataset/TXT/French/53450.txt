QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g Streets is a great place to go if you're looking for a diverse menu. I love all of the different styles of food and there seems to be something on the menu for everyone. 

The prices for their dishes are very fair, the sandwiches are huge. I had the duck confit tapioca and it was delicious. The portion size was perfect for me and I shared some with my boyfriend as well. The special drinks were great, we had the gin basil smash and the Doberman, I would recommend both. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful when explaining the menu items, I will definitely go back!
