mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q This was hands down one of the meals I have ever had, and one of the most expensive.  : )  Wow, wow, wow.  Starting with the steamed-foie gras-and-port amuse bouche, my tastebuds were in writhing delight. I also had an incredible lobster bisque, (God knows how sea food is so fresh in Vegas), plenty of French bread, a caramelized quail with foie gras including some lovely wine and beer...topped off  with the finest selection of Tartes for dessert and some delectable decaf coffee.... My soul is recharged and replenished..  : )  I have now decided that seeking out Michelin Starred restaurants is a wonderful new passion of mine.. If you are a foodie, this place is for you.  It reminds me of the world-class French food I enjoyed with my ex while we in France together last summer.

The service is top notch. Excellent sommelier who recommended to me other places in Vegas a well. The servers were very attentive...Making sure that the pacing of my meal was just right.

Now, granted, I have quite a penchant for nice ambiance, and in my perfect world the aesthetic of this restaurant would include more natural light.  (It is completely dark.....underground next to the casino of MGM grand.)  

The decor is a little cheesy --- lots of reds and whites...a bit garish for my taste...But really, with food this good, I can deal...

Highly recommend...xo
