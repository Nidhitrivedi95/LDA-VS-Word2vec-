IUtjbbqQ6jUSi4t2jjgYRA Do you feel that bacon and eggs are too simple and you can do bit better than burnt coffee? Good!
My visit went like so... sat down and a double cup of steeping french press coffee for the table and ordered the duck eggs Benedict. As I sat there, with my fresh as can be coffee, I felt the oodles of biscotti and sweets staring at me from counter. I resisted as not to ruin myself for the decadence that awaited only 10 minutes away. Having fought off my sugary daemons, my breakfast arrived. Thick enveloping sauce over  perfectly cooked eggs sitting on top flavor full supple duck with an entourage of crispy seasoned potato wedges. Breakfast was sorted. Yum!!
Only downside though is that the place has limited seating so unless you luck out or go during weekdays you may be waiting a bit for a table. No bid deal though since they have a couple small tables outside in front of this quaint little bistro where you can enjoy your coffee and ponder what culinary glory will await you.
