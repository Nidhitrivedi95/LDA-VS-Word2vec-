36pB0QVVNZuOLV_UxosbAQ Nice lil caché and just few minutes walk from St-Henri metro station... they actually have stands at the Atwater and Jean-Talon markets.

I had their porc dumplings (bouchons) and their coconut cakes (bonbon) and they were delicious.

I plan on trying other items from their menu... cannot wait
