3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw The decor at Mimi's is decidedly French but, unfortunately, so is the service. Although the wait staff wasn't maître d' snooty, we certainly didn't feel welcome. There was no one there to greet us, and we stood at the front desk for nearly five minutes before we were acknowledged. Our waiter was friendly but slow, and he barely interacted with us. We also had to ask for the check, which eventually was brought out by another server, and then we had to wait again for the bill to be picked up.

That said, our food was fine; nothing to rave about, but not the worst I've eaten. I had the roasted chicken crepes and my husband had the bacon & egg cheeseburger. We had a buy-one-get-one coupon, and they had a $5 wine promotion, so we got out of there for under $40 (with tip).

One other note: There were about 20 customers in the restaurant, and my husband and I were the youngest by at least 20 years -- and we're no spring chickens. I've been to Mimi's for brunch before, and I had a much better time. The brunch clientele also seemed to be a mix of older folks and younger families. So maybe we were just here on an off night. Nonetheless, if I return to Mimi's, I think I'll stick with the early birds.
