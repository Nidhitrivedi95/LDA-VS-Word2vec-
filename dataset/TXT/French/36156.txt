hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw I am writing the same review for Cafe Moulin and Crepes Parisiennes.  To me, they both have excellent crepes and coffee. And I have happy to go into either of them any day. The only difference is where I am at the time, and how big a party I have. 

Crepes Parisiennes is on S Craig St. Street parking if you are driving and good luck finding a space on Craig. The shops have ~10 tables, and its customer base is Pitt + CMU + UPMC.  Small shop means it is likely packed.  Go in, line-up, order, find a table, and they bring the food to you when ready.  Definitely should try this out if you are a student nearby.

Cafe Moulin is in Shadyside, Walnut Street area, next to a parking lot. About ~25 tables I guess.  At least I never have to wait in the line.  Go in, they will find you a table, and the waiter will take your order and bring the food over.  If you are driving, or with a big party (6+), I would prefer Cafe Moulin.

Foodwise, cappuccino, Latte, chocolate strawberry crepe, smoked salmon crepe... I am going to say Cafe Moulin's smoked salmon crepe (Alaskan) has more salmon than Crepes Parisiennes... but it is also more expensive ($11 vs $10)... and it might be just that day.  So don't take my words for it.
