rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here on a Friday night with the whole fam. We were seated promptly. Impeccable service. Our needs were always met by the staff. We didnt have to ask for water refills as the water goblets were filled at one half full. 

The interiors is very classy and old world Europe. The waiters had a suit on which added to its ambiance. The clientele, however, was a bit too casual for my taste on that particular evening. I was expecting dressy and stuffy. But I got shirts and shorts. But as it is Vegas and summer, I guess I was expecting too much. Some people were dressy so it balanced out my expectation for that evening. 

With Zin in our hands, it was time to finally order. They have a limited but good
menu. Not a lot of variety, but I prefer quality over quantity so I was perfectly fine with the menu. After putting on our order, we had to wait for a long while to get our actual orders.  

Being a French restaurant and as with everything in France, it took "forever" to get our meal. Although after the first bite, we were all convinced that the food was really good and that it was the right restaurant for the whole family to enjoy on a Friday night on a Vegas weekend getaway.

Our bill for a family of 8 was $$$ and nearing $$$$. No one paid attention and were all in agreement that it was worth it. 

So I would recommend this restaurant for casual yet elegant dining.
