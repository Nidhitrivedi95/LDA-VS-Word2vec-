dDKhRQlw_OVsPLQAGAeNyA We enjoyed a romantic dinner with excellent service from the owner at this charming restaurant in Old Montreal. We felt like we were dining in France! We chose the cheese plate for starters along with the dry red house wine. We chose fixed price meals--spinach soup and a salad preceded  baked turbot and grilled salmon both served with rice and perfectly cooked zucchini and a broiled tomato. Dessert was coconut cake and carrot cake  ( a tad dry) served with decaf espresso coffee. We would highly recommend to others and would gladly return ourselves to this gem.
