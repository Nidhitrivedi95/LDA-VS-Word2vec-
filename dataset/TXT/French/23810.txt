cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).
I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.
The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.
What an experience
Service was great too!!
