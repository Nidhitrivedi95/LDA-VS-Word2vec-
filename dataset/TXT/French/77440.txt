The restaurant manager was kind enough to print it out for us so that we can use it for our dinner. The food was unforgettable. My favorites were the onion soup and the Grand Marnier souffle. The steak was so perfectly cooked that it just melts in your mouth. We will definitely go back to Fleur de Lys again.
