mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I knew when we were going to Vegas and tried to get reservations at both Joel Robuchon's restaurants and they were all booked. We went to MGM to see the KA, which was wonderful! and we were able to make reservations at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon for 9pm, just by walking up. We were seated at the bar, which had a prefect view of the kitchen. Which was awesome to watch the staff all work skillfully with Chef Steve Benjamin. 

Our main server was Eric, who was wonderful! He fully explained the menu and made a wonderful suggestion for wine, which was $70 for the bottle. We were not rushed and felt very special. We decided to go with the $78 menu, which includes amuse bouche, appetizer, soup, fish or meat, dessert! First the bread was served, which was fantastic and butter was yummy! The amuse bouche, was outstanding and set the bar for the whole meal. My appetizer was Yellow tail Tuna Hamachi, which came with a delicious yellow tail atop a mountain of guacamole and herbs!  The soup was Lobster bisque with asparagus - So delicious!! My meal was Con fit Duck, which was terrific! Dessert was Pecans and coffee sorbet, which was a great ending to the whole dining experience. 

The staff treated us very professionally and answered all of our questions, I would not hesitate to go back!!
