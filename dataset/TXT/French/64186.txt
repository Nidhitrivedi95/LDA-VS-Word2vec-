tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg This is more of a 3.5star review as I will return but can't definitely say I'm a fan (right now).  Disclaimer: I had to bump up the staring  for Yelper readers but still say this is more of a 3.5 for my own quality control purposes. 

We dined during Spring Break and had
I, the Risotto
kid chicken dinner (they served white meat - IMPRESSIVE) 
sorority sister - braised beef (pot roast) THIS WAS BETTER THE NEXT DAY. THE FLAVORS CONGILED AND MWAH :* EVERYTHING WORKED. 

The dine in isn't stuffy. Pretty relaxed. Didn't sit outdoors but on another occassion I might just. The risotto wasn't anything to write home about. The broiled chicken was seasoned well and juicy. The side dish wasn't memorable but no complaints from the kid. I tasted the Beef with the petitite carrots and mashed potatoes. Took pictures of the dishes as they were presented well. 

The next day that beef dish was off the chain as the seasons really burst in your mouth. 

Service - ok, 3 stars. Solid nothing spectacular. 
Ambiance - ok. More like a cafe which precludes the best name for them and it's nice to have so many French options in CLT. It doesn't take me to France but it does remind me of WestBank Gretna/New Orleans. So it's French-esque.  Enough to get your fill. 
Location - VERY SMART. This is the crowd/side of town to cater to. 

I consider this place to be smart dining. Nicely appointed. Would feel comfortable having business lunch or dinner or a family gathering. 
They get 4 stars for offering a GroupOn then graciously accepting it and not having a funky attitude like some places do when you redeem a GroupOn. 

End Result: I will return.
