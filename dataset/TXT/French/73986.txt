The cold foie gras torchon was recommended over the sautéed New York State foie gras which would have been our initial choice, and we were not disappointed. The fig compote was a perfect complement to the foie gras. 

The wine list is heavily tilted towards wines that run from the cost of a decent dinner to the list price of a used Honda Accord. It is not an inexpensive place. We did a drink each and a glass of wine. 

The bone-in rib eye was magnificent as was the recommended green peppercorn sauce. My wife enjoyed her steak and my daughter loved her chicken dish. 

For me, wife, and daughter, it was about $500+. I would think that this could have been pulled off in Chicago with a more egalitarian wine list and the same quality for $300-$350 (maybe), even with a bottle of wine, so don't come looking for a moderate price point. 

Good service, great view, great food, but a bit expensive for what it is. If the cost works for you, give it a try.
