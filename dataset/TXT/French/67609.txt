UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I had lunch here a few weeks ago (winterlicious menu).  The food was very average.  The desert was the best part - I had a macaron and my friend had the delicious hazelnut profiteroles.  My friend had dinner there and also agreed that the food was very bland.  I would not recommend dining here but maybe going for coffee and dessert.
