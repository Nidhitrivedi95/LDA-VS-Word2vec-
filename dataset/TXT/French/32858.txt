H3gLUOAYxnYL6Rzgvq28Jg Okay, let's be real, a restaurants review is based on a lot more than the food - for some places this is a good thing, but unfortunately not for Lustucru

Food : amazing. Big thumbs up to the chef. We had a tasting platter which consists of 8 choices. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the food. **the food and wine is the only reason I'm not giving this place a 0 (if that's even possible)**

Service : a big flat zero. Barely checked up on us, seemed annoyed to be there, no knowledge (ex.: asked her a question and she basically just read me the menu..)

Decor : it's okay, but would amp it up to distract people from the lousy staff. 

No I wouldn't bring friends here but I would recommend this place ONLY FOR THE FOOD - meaning that it's only for people who don't mind bad service.
