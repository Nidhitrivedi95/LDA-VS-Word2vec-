4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is my favorite stop in Vegas for breakfast/brunch. Sitting on the patio on a beautiful day with an order their delicious egg Florentine is simply wonderful. Another favorite of mine is the chicken, apple & Brie Crepe, it is so delicious!!  Fantastic food and stellar service, what more can you ask for in a restaurant? If you haven't been there yet then you better get going.
