OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA I came here based on the recommendation of the concierge at my hotel and had an absolutely fantastic time.  He sold us on the choice when he mentioned the signature "swing seats". I was worried that it would be unsettled by the constant rocking back and forth of the seat, but I loved it.  The atmosphere is a nice mix of classy with fun and this translated to the food as well.  I had a fantastic foie gras that was extremely rich and flavorful...exactly how I like it! The arugula and beet salad was fantastic as was everything else we had that night.  I was really excited to see that the Spanish tapas concept was being applied to French cuisine.  It makes it easy to try a wide variety of different things and experiment.  Definitely recommend heading here the next time you're in Montreal.
