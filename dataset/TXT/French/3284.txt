1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA Crepes Parisiennes gives off a charming tiny European cafe feel, complete with winding railings and outside seating (one table - but still) and its interior decor. My favorite of their dishes is the salmon crepe with creme fraiche. All their savory crepes come with a salad, which has clementines and is topped with the most refreshing dressing I've ever had. It's a great place to have lunch or a coffee, but I wouldn't come here if you were in a rush. The service, in my experience, is nice but pretty slow. This, that they're cash only, and the fact that they close very early and stop serving savory crepes an hour before closing are the reasons that I don't come here as often as I might and why it loses a star for me.
