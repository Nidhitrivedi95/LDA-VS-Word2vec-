4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Everything I ate here was to die for.  Sooooo delicious.

For my entree I had the sea scallops.  They were amazing.  The sweet potato puree that accompanied them was unbelievable.  I practically licked my plate.

As a side to the entree I had the macaroni and cheese.  Also amazing.  You'd be surprised how many people somehow seem to ruin macaroni and cheese!  But they definitely don't.  It is oober cheesy and baked to perfection :).

Overall it was a great experience.  We didn't have any issues with service our our reservation so it was really a just a great night out!
