vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q I seldom find myself being truly impressed by a place in Vegas now that every place is upping the ante and bringing out the big guns. However, my latest visit to Twist was absolutely perfection! Given that I visited while I had an eye infection, could hardly see, was tearing the whole time, they definitely made a huge impression that still lasted throughout the meal.

We had the tasting menu and the views from the 23rd floor are spectacular. The creativity of the dishes do not disappoint although you are going to be paying up a hefty dollar for this meal. 

The Foie Gras .. is a must! Although I understand French enjoy it prepared more of a pate / cold style versus seared. I do wish I could find more places that are willing to sear! Definitely top notch and extremely well fitted for a date!
