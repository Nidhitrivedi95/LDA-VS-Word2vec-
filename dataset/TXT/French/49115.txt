OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA Had my 'special' birthday dinner with about 10 friends at Confusion.  They have a wonderful big 'banket' on the lower floor where we could all be seated and actually face each other unlike most places where large parties are seated at long tables  and you can't see or hear your entire party.  This was already a bonus even before we started eating.  Drinks were great, especially the dirty martini.  We tasted several of the different tapas and everything was delicious but what really stood out was the slider with fois gras and the tartar.....OMG!  I am not a tartar sort of person and had to be convinced to try it, but I wiped up the plate with the bread, which as also delicious.
This is a very hip place...the decor, the menu and the neighborhood but very welcoming even for 'regular' folks like my friends and me.  We will definitely go back.
