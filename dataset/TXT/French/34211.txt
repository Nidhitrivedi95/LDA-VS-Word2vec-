hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Olivier is the owner, front counter man...he is amazing! His mom and dad cook...delicious, however that said, they are very slow for service...set aside 45 minutes for a meal here. Salads are not their strong suit, but croissants and pain de chocolat are superb...a little pricey, but worth it. Will I be back? Try and stop me...or the long line of customers here
