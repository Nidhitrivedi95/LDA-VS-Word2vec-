wV5IYyqc35F1g3fSZjt41A We had a reservation for a Monday evening. We arrived and said the name which the reservation was under. We waited 45 minutes for the rest of the group only to realised they had place them at the other end of the restaurant claiming no one else had arrived yet. (It was a work thing so we didnt have their personnal phone numbers).
The food was mediocre. The prices are as usual in those types of restaurants. Calamary appetizers were good. Seafood pasta was disgusting, chewy seafood and sandy clams. Yuck! I thought i would get lucky with the desert....red velvet coconut cake. Sounds yummy no? .....omg too sweet. And I LOVE SWEET. But this was not good. Very dissapointed! :(
