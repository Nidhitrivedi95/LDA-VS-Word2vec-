HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw We had a great time here!  We visited while staying at the Cosmo for our wedding anniversary and has a Groupon to use.  We ended up upgrading just about everything about the meal and it was WONDERFUL!  We had a reservation and were seated immediately.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Our drinks and appetizer came out very quickly and were quite good.  We ordered the rainbow trout and ribeye for our entrees and were very pleasantly surprised.  Steak doesnt usually do much for us when eating out since we can make it really well at home.  The ribeye here however, was cooked perfectly, coated in their special pepper crust and arrived with their AMAZING in house steak sauce.  We highly recommend it!  After all that food, we didn't have much room for dessert but asked for a simple scoop of vanilla ice cream.  They didn't have vanilla ice cream so the chef personally whipped us up some vanilla with marzipan and served it with crunch toffee on a beautiful plate with "Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate sauce.  The ice cream was super good and we thought it was so great the chef could whip something like that together as a last minute request for it.  

Overall, great experience at Comme Ca!  We'll be back for sure!
