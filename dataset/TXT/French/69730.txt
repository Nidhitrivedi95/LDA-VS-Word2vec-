WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w We had a lovely brunch here. Being Sunday late morning, they were crazy busy. With that said, they got us in right away and hustled to get everyone served quickly. We sat in an outdoor area which was covered, so it was warm. The food was good and serving size was massive. I ordered eggs Benedict and held the cheese, but added mushrooms. Yum!! It was served with some delicious breakfast fries and a huge bowl of fruit. The one downfall was the eggs were cooked all the way through, so there was no runny yolk. I'm not a local, so maybe that's how this dish would be served throughout the region?!? Regardless, you should check this place out!
