sMAgnsqi-eY9LlywVC85Hg Americans stay far far away from this place!! I have lived in Paris and visited Montreal numerous times. I speak French adequately.  However this restaurant made me feel insulted for being an American. The food is very expensive for the quality, even at half the price I would never again visit this restaurant. The lobster bisque which was the soup of the day tasted worse than a canned soup. It also contained NO lobster. If you get the Table d'hôte make sure to confirm what dessert is available. They only had raspberry sorbet when it came time for dessert. The steak was a poor cut and the fish was over cooked. This is not a place I would return to and I suggest you don't go there either, but especially if you are from the US.
