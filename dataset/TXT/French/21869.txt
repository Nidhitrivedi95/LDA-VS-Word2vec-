bMiyGPaMqF0svjseW1UR_g What a great find!  Vallier is very well priced for the quality of the food and the service and was just a few blocks away from my hotel without being too tourist-y.  Before visiting, I was picturing a true diner-type atmosphere but was pleasantly surprised at  the chic interior - a little retro in keeping with the theme, but very sleek and elegant with tall windows and warm fixtures.

The menu has been very thoughtfully compiled and though it is relatively small, there is something for everyone - fantastic comfort food like steak tartare, duck shepherd's pie, macaroni and cheese with bacon - I had a difficult time choosing, but our server was very helpful in pointing us toward his favorite items and he was absolutely right!  I had scallops over parsnips and fennel with bacon and maple topped with asparagus - they were cooked just perfectly; I couldn't have asked for anything better.  I also tried the wild game meatloaf with porto foie gras... wow.  I'm also a fan of the fries with homemade mayo - OK, mostly the homemade mayo!

Along with a nice wine list, there are several good microbrews available and though I didn't make it all the way to dessert, there were some delicious offerings - I was very tempted by the chocolate maple pie (among several other things).  Vallier was really an excellent experience, and a much better value than many other restaurants in Old Montreal.
