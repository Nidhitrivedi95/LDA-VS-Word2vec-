rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w What a wonderful, special, romantic experience our dinner was here. We each chose the 3 course dinner option: me choosing the Japanese fish stater and the scallop entree. Daniel got the lobster risotto and the rabbit entree. As expected, everything was outstanding. Even down to their table bread and butter - so delicious. 
I got the chocolate soufflé for dessert - I haven't had a soufflé executed so perfectly in years. Bravo. 


What's fascinating to me is how many people (especially women) were sitting around here eating their food looking completely bored and uninterested. A waiter places a stunning work of art of front of you that a chef has worked so passionately creating, and it doesn't even warrant a reaction (let alone a smile). It truly doesn't matter how many times they've been here: Shame on them for not having the capacity to recognize or appreciate such a special experience that so much work and effort was put into creating.
