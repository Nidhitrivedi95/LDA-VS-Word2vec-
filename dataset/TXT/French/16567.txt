8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ First and Foremost GO THERE NOW!!!! Can I give it 6 stars?

Every bite was PERFECTLY cooked and the flavor was Amazing! 

Went with 2 friends, we had the pork tenderloin (moist, the cheese added flavor and a perfect combination of textures), Alaskan Halibut (Flakey, not fishy had shrimp and a relish on top that make it truly unique and wonderful) and Lamb Shank (favorable, not gamey well seasoned).

We started with the Brie plate, so good, couldn't stop eating it.

We ended with a chocolate tarte, usually the desert is always my favorite. Desert was good but couldn't out do the amazing meal we had.

The service was PERFECT, we went on a Friday night.  The owner was there and charmed the pants off of every guest. I can't think of a time I had better food or better service. I'm in love with this place!  I love risotto, the waitress brought out a side with our meal to try it. The risotto was so good and so well cooked and seasoned. How do they get everything so perfect?

Cost was 52.00 a person with tip included. I have spent way more per person and not had the food be this perfect.   Go go go go go!!!!
