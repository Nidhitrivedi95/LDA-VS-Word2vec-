rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A what can I say, the food is superb. in addition to the food, the attention the staff shows to each course is surreal. every dish, every drink, new silverware and glasses were brought out. we ordered almost every appetizer on the menu plus main courses. never was dissapointed. the only reason I didnt give 5 stars was because the waiter didnt have the ability to split a check and needed management to do it. bravo to the food
