aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I am a big fan of Bouchon, Bouchon Bakery, and Thomas Keller. So I make it a point to try to hit up these places when I am nearby. This location is inside the Venetian hotel and it is kind of hidden nearby the restrooms and behind the escalators inside the casino.

I've had Bouchon Bakery at Yountville, in Beverly Hills, and at this location a number of times so I can compare the quality and taste a bit. For some reason though, the pastries in Yountville still is the best to me. I'm not sure if it has to do with the environment and the setting, but that's just how I feel.

They always have a splendid deal of: Buy 5, get 1 free Macarons. I especially like their salted caramel, coffee, and pistachio flavors. However, their other flavors do not disappoint either. Their macarons are one of my favorites and cannot be beat - the inside is nice and creamy while the outside has a nice crunch without all the flakiness. I also have had their cookies and pastries and have not been disappointed yet. However, they aren't particularly amazing.. just all in all good.
