rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Wow!  The decor alone is 5 star - and I was full after the bread selection.  (All homemade breads.)

Very, very RICH meal - and had I not gotten SICK as a dog afterward, I woulda given this place 5 stars.

Classic French Desserts were the best part.

Yes, it's expensive.  Yes, you're in Vegas.  Yes, it's over the top.
We were treated like royalty and had a grand time.  My poor system just can't handle all that butter and cream.  Even the haricot verts salad was covered in a rich creamy dressing.  Lamb chops were EXPERTLY prepared and not over-salted.

Ah well, you only live once. - and you gotta come here at least once in your life.
