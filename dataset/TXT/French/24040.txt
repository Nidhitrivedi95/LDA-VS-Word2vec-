The consistency was like no other mashed potatoes I've ever had and they were exquisite.  The rest of the menu was good, but nothing else stood out.  If you like meat, you should be happy with the plethora of choices at this place.

The server was very patient and helped navigate the menu.

Definitely need a reservation!
