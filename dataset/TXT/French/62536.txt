SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ So great! Beautiful shady patio. Very busy, but tucked away in a corner, you would never know the place was hopping. Superb wine list, about the best I've seen in AZ. The Ahi Tuna was THE BEST. Spouse's tenderloin was so flavorful too. Highly recommend! Only negative....We had to ask for bread. Some tables had bread basket presented, some didn't.
