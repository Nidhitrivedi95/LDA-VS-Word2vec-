rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I am very shocked that the food fell short of what I would typically call amazing. I am wondering if we just went on an off day. Whatever the case, I wasn't impressed with what we ordered. 

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. They said the wait would possibly be 45 minutes but to keep checking back. We checked back by 10 minutes and they were already ready to seat us, that's quick! 

The menu wasn't expansive. Seems like a few items but done well and at a high price point - this place isn't cheap. 

Let's talk about what we ordered:

Croque Madame - the brioche bread was so dry and almost burnt, the egg was over cooked - or too small, either way there wasn't a good amount of yolk. The béchamel was bland and lifeless also they didn't give enough to offset the dry bread. I was having a hard time cutting it and swallowing. It's unfortunate that I've had better. 1/5

Plate of bacon - there were probably 8 slices of bacon. Of the 8, only 2 were crispy - The rest were soggy. We didn't even finish them. 1/5

Side of Brioche - the brioche was definitely burnt. I wanted to send them back, but decided not to because I was too lazy. 1/5

The complimentary fresh baked baguette was good and tasted great with blackberry jam and butter. The homemade blackberry jam was wonderful. Not too sweet and had a great blackberry flavor. 5/5

Orange juice - it wasn't fresh. Bottled OJ at a price that they charged is so wrong. 1/5

I am still pretty shocked that I was expecting a better meal but I ended up with a bland and dry one. I am hoping the next time I shell out that much cash, I will speak up and get something else that I may be able to appreciate.
