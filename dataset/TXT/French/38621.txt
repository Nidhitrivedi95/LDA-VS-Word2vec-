jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Have been here twice in last month. There are about 8 tables inside and 4 tables with umbrellas outside. First visit I ordered to stay-sat inside. There was a couple of ladies working, using the free wifi, talking pretty loudly-collaborating on work. In order to drown them out, I started talking on my phone till my food came. I think between them and I, it may have distracted one lady who went to eat outside.

My first visit ($14), I tried the 3 bean chili, crepe with chicken, spinach and a white cheese (can't remember if it was brie or swiss or something else) - the cheese was more of a sauce then melted in the crepe. Not sure that was preferred-it was a bit too much of the sauce. On my way out, I thought the chocolate chip pecan cookie looked good -- and it was delicious. Besides the cookie, the chili was yummy. The crepe was big (took half home) but, Crepe Expectations on Eastern is better for crepes.

My second visit ($15), I ordered the 3 bean chili, the turkey sandwich with brie (extra .30 for brie vs, any other cheese offered), and 2 chocolate cookies to go. The chili and sandwich were yummy. The cookies looked different than my first visit -- I should have clued in that they would taste different. Oh, they did. I ate the first one, and threw the second one out. They just tasted so different than my first visit. I think that is so weird, why not consistent??

This place is pricey for counter service - the cup of chili is like $3.50+, the sandwich and crepe were in the $7-7.50 range and the cookies ($1.10) were less expensive than the pastries (2.75+) but are small.

The location is great -- pretty central and is good for a quick lunch when out and about.
