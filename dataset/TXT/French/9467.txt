4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This restaurant is, THE PLACE, to bring people if your in need of a great strip restaurant with a view!  Perfect to take friends or family when they come to visit you in Vegas.

The food is great & the atmosphere is incredible...  The prices are extremely  moderate for the value & all of the food is very well prepared, escargot were delicious as was my favorite steak & fries with blue cheese sauce, fantastic!  

I recently took family from Maryland there for lunch & was extremely well taken care of by the staff & especially the manager Ryan. He gave us premier seating on the patio area outside & the view of the fountains across the street was perfect. Thanks Ryan!!!

My family is still talking about how good the food was & such a great time they had... Kudos to the Mgmt & The Staff!

Will be sure to visit again very soon...
