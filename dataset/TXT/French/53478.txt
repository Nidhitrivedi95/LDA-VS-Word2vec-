QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g Streets on Carson has an interesting and ambitious menu of small plates, sandwiches and desserts. Our table of five started with a varied selection of starters. Overall the prices are somewhat less than might be paid at a more formal restaurant. My top vote goes to the cheese plate with interesting accompaniments. The raspberries & blackberries were very sweet, the Pinot Grigio gel yummy, the candied walnuts welcome. The seeded crackers were perfect. While the honey was a good choice, the menu mentioned honeycomb and a small piece on the plate would have been nice. The bone marrow for $7 is a steal. The wings were fall-off-the-bone tender but a little heavy on the lime juie. Other dishes we had were the steamed buns, the rice balls (small plate of 3 which looks small but gave each of us a couple fork fills), and the pork egg roll. The pork with broccoli rabe sandwich was right on. The fries that accompanied were home made. My daughter enjoyed the Cuban. The only disappointment was the pastrami sandwich which was ordered by both of the gentlemen in our party. For $13, it was a far cry from a real deli sandwich. The soft rye was flavorless, and while the pastrami was smoky & tasty, it was a teeny layer of meat that didn't evencover the whole piece of bread. The mustard dressing was good. This one should be re- thought. We were so stuffed we couldn't indulge in dessert. If your Fido likes bones, be sure to ask for a container to take your marrow bone home.
A nice touch was chilled waters placed on table in pretty wine and alcohol bottles, to serve yourself. 
A good place to go if you have a group with varied tastes.
