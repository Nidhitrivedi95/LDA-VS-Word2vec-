P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ 2 Michelin Stars???!!!! I don't know how that happened but by far the most disappointing dinner we have ever had in vegas. I guess we are just used to Joel Robuchon and how fantastic every experience is. The bread to the service and above all the decor of guy savoy doesn't make any sense. The food was so average that my wife and I had to ask each other if someone was playing a joke on us. Now we know that if you want the best high end meal in vegas that there is on Robuchon.
