Upon arrival, there was already a small line forming. I figure that must be a good sign, especially for about 10:30am in Vegas which is like 7am everywhere else in the country.

I realized that the line was long partially because only one person was working. That person not only took orders and payment but also made the crepes themselves. I must have waited 15 minutes for a light breakfast snack.

I ordered the Nutella crepe and honestly was not disappointed at all. It was sweet but not too sweet. The crepe resembled almost like a dumpling in that most of the filling was towards the back and the front was mostly just the crepe layer itself. Not a terrible thing but I would have liked it more even.

There is a decent size sitting area right next to this place to enjoy the crepe.

Overall, pretty good crepe in a thematic casino here. Pricing not ridiculously expensive, about $11-12 for mine but not cheap either. But it's dessert and who wouldn't want to splurge on dessert, especially after a long night where night blend into morning.
