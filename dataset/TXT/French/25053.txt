The view from the bar is outstanding and the drink selection is great. I think the food is delicious, but the price is a bit much for the overall quality. The best thing on the Menu has to be the Buffalo steak seasoned with black pepper. It's an great spot if you want to impress a client who's already tried all the fine restaurants in Las Vegas. The view is amazing from the bar and dining are, but most people are very impressed by the look and feel of place. The dining room is all white with a few hints of red or black with hundreds of glass balls hanging from the ceiling. 

I noticed a small dance floor and a DJ booth so I'm sure it's an amazing place to spend the evening dancing.
