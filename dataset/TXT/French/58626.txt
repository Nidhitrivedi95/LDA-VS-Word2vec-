RhIjAPdxZYnzqWLs7P-YTA I've returned to Accords and nothing has changed...and I mean this in a very yummy and delicious way.    The seasonal menu changes look amazing.  I had the octopus (again), but this time dressed up with a potato purée and chunks.  Very delicious.  The orange wine!  The orange wine!  Must try.   Finally, the service staff - Shaun Audrey and Serge - are amazing.  Overall, a wonderful third experience. Til next time.
