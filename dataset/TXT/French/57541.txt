rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We went to Bouchon for dinner. It is on the 10th floor of the Venetian so away from the casino and the crowds which was a big plus for me. It has a patio which was very nice. We were seated immediately without a reservation on a Thursday night.  Our waiter was nice and the service was excellent overall.

My wife had the duck special ($43) which was duck breast with crispy skin, bread pudding, sweet sauce and mushrooms - it was absolutely delicious and also very filling so she had no room for desert. We got 500cc carafe of wine ($25) which was pretty good and there was also delicious bread and butter. I had the steak frites ($36), which was an ample size steak covered with a buttery sauce and with french fries.  The steak was cooked medium as I requested and was delicious, and the fries were some of the tastiest I've had.

Overall, the food was great, the prices were better than many of the other French themed restaurants in Vegas, and the service was good.  Other restaurants may have food network names but this one really delivered. I think this restaurant is a hidden gem that does not disappoint.
