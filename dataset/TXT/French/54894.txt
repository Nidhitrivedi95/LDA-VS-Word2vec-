rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I have been before and it was average I decided to try it again. I had no such luck the front desk reception at the restaurant stated we could eat from 2-5 but only the bar menu. I was ok with that however once I planned my day around it and showed up they would not let me sit at a table. The bar was full all table empty and they would no sit my party. The manager would not honor the front desk offer and I left. Not the best way to do business.
