mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I expected more from a Michelin star and ~$200/person. 

I had the tasting menu and everything was okay. That's the problem... it was just okay. For that price, I expect more than just okay.

The amuse and dessert were EXCEPTIONAL. However, the okay-ness of the rest of the meal really averaged out the equation.

Amuse = foie gras parfait with port reduction and parmesan foam = delight in my mouth

Dessert = layers... hazelnut sponge, crisp choco tuile, frozen meringue, crisp choco tuile, chocolate/hazelnut gelato, hazelnut crisp = heaven  

We also had some cured ham slices which were also QUITE GOOD. 

If it were not so expensive, I would have given it 4 stars... it's just I'd rather spend that money somewhere else, like Providence in LA.
