0Xr0kte9ADAfZ-GBO-wimg I have eaten here twice now (once with family, and once with a friend I hadn't seen in 18 years.) In both cases the food was wonderful (if you've ever been to Provence, you will recognize much of the fare on offer; pastas, grilled meats, fish - not all the sauces that people often associate with French cuisine.) 

Last night it was a delicious cold peach soup and succulent grilled lamb. My friend had a salad and a perfectly grilled salmon.  The manager helped us choose a perfect red wine, and the meal-ending cappuccino was flavourful with no bitterness. The ambiance is "classy-rustic", with a fantastic terrace at the back.

As much as I like all this, I am also a real fan of the service. The manager was quite happy to answer all our wine questions, and the servers have always been more than cheerful and accommodating.  Last night's "reunion dinner" meant we sat for a long time after we finished eating. Our server was gracious about checking in from time to time, but in no way making us feel like we needed to get out of there. Another server was happy to take the obligatory photo for us.

So I am nothing but a fan. Our dinner for 2 with appetizers, wine and cappuccinos came to about $120. Not bad at all for such excellently prepared food and accommodating service. The only draw-back is that it makes me long for a few weeks in  the south of France. At least this is a great substitute.
