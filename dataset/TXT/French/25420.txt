Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I'm not sure how my girlfriends and I decided upon 'Fix', but we were staying at the Mandalay Bay and wanted to go to a nice trendy restaurant. BAD BAD DECISION!!  

Well it sure was trendy with it's completely white interior and all white plush booths but there was nothing nice about the service.  It started off fairly well; we made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  

I ordered the sea scallops and I remember there were only four.  Eh, not unexpected so I decided to take my sweet time with them.  If I'm paying $30+ for four scallops I'm going to relish every bite!  Well I only finished two of them when my plate was whisked away from me.   Just scooped away with my fork in hand looking in disbelief at the direction the guy took it. Uh hello? He didn't even ask me if I was finished.  Something like that should never happen, at least not at a 'nicer' place such at this.  Fine. Whatever,  I let it slip bc I don't like making a scene.

But that wasn't the end of it.  Sometime during the meal (pre-scallop taking incident) our waiter came by, set down a bowl of Mac and Cheese and said it was complimentary.  We received the bill and noticed the $20 Mac and Cheese charge.  So despite protests from the rest of my friends to let it go, I called the waiter over and asked him about the "complimentary" Mac and Cheese.  Instead of saying sorry, the below was said:

Waiter (smirking): Did you enjoy it? 
Me (seething at this point): Um.  Yes, it was really good 
Waiter: Good.  I'll get this taken off
Me: Thanks.

I will never understand the point to his question.  If I had said no, would he had taken it off the bill?
