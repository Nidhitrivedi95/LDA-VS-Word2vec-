SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ After reading the high rating in the online information it seemed like a place to try - I had high expectations but a bad feeling when I walked in.  I am very intuitive about restaurants and hoped for the best.  The bread was old and the butter strange.  Not a good start

The setting is an old residence and garden and that is nice.  The menu is eclectic and has a variety of choices for dinner, heavy on the meat side.  Each of the four people at my table ordered something difference, Osso Buco, the vegetarian bean dish, steak and chicken. 

No one enjoyed their meal - there was no flavor at all in the vegetarian dish.  My guests didn't like anything.  The salad was lacking is variety with a little arugla on the place.  Not going back, and expensive
