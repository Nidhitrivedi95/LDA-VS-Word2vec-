4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've been to MAG three times now, twice for lunch and once for dinner. All three times have been awesome. If you can, try to get the outside seating -- it's awesome both day and nighttime. 

For lunch, I really liked the warm chicken and brie sandwich. They have some green apple in it to cut the cheese (lol); I've gotten it twice now and loved it both times. 

For the most recent dinner visit, they added some sort of shredded carrot/olive oil/champagne vinegar side that came with the complimentary bread. I don't know if it was for dinner only, but my family also enjoyed that! The carrots also paired well with the chicken liver mousse pate. I do wish they gave more toasted bread with the dish itself, but it's okay--we made do with the complimentary bread. Get the seared scallops as well! I could've done without the walnut heavy salad that came with, but I'm also not really a fan of walnuts. My sister, like a lot of the other patrons, got the steak frites. It was good but not amazing.

For the price you are paying, MAG is awesome. You are dining in a relatively upscale restaurant without the pretentiousness/heavy price tag.
