rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Every bit as good as the original In Yountville. Living in the San Francisco Bay Area I have frequented The on the location many times and can say with certainty that the menu here is spot on. Truffle fries are a must and you pretty much can't go wrong with anything in the menu. My wife was 8 months pregnant when we went and the service was exceptional with a great deal of knowledge of the ingredients of the menu as well as making accommodations as necessary. Highly recommended to make reservations and go to for a nice night out or before a performance.
