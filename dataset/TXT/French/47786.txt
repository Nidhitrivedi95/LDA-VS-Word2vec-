O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Came in before 12am and the wait times were so dragged out, couldn't get out until 2am. Took nearly 30mins before we got our drinks (water/soda) and another 10 to order! Nearly 1hr just to start eating. The server was great but definitely spread thin. 

Food was good although some wouldn't be worth trying if it wasn't happy hour. Desserts were even better. The local community seems to enjoy the work of the chef but that same chef pays no attention to newcomers, we were last out and no apologies for out of stock items and no bye or thank you. Must need to provide a consistent profit before you're on good terms.
