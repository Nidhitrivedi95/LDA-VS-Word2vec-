htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ This was my very first time having chicken and waffle. I had always wanted to try it because everyone made it sound like it was a match in heaven, and people were not wrong about it. It was really good together, the salty chicken and the sweet syrup with the soft waffle actual went very well together. I am still searching for other chicken and waffle places to compare to this restaurant. I forgot to mention that I added a fried egg on top, which improve increased the texture and flavour even more.

One more thing, for those who like spicy food, do not forget to ask for their homemade hot sauce, because it was really good with the chicken. And, for those who have a second stomach for dessert do not skip out on it because it was really delicious. Overall, my experience here was great, the restaurant is not big so it would not be able to hold big parties, and always make sure to make a reservation if you have 6+ people.
