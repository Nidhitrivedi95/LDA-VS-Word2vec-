YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Me and my daughter came here in 2007 for her 21st bday and it was fabulous. The tasting menu was out of this world. I remember the mushroom soup for starter was so good I licked the bowl. We also got to tour the kitchen because Hubert keller was in the kitchen and letting some guests  come back and meet him. His sous chef talked my daughter out of wanting to go to culinary school though! Just telling her she would have no life but the restaurant scared her! We went back every yearly trip to vegas.
Then we came back last year to find they had changed the entire concept to a tapas place which was ok but could not compare to before. Please change back!
