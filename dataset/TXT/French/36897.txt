The atmosphere is like a charming French bistro! The server Brittany was Superb! Helpful, patient and suggestions from the menu!! The meals were amazing! We had quiche and we order two different ones to share! You're given generous portions....but here is the Kicker!! 
Free croissants while you wait for your entrees....wait for it....And a little baby dessert as well!!! What!!! Free Yummy Stuff...it's True!! Don't be a fool and miss out on this darling place for brunch with the girls or a romantic moment with your man!! Vincent...I'm in Love!!!
