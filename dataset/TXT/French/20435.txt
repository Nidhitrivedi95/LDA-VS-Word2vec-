AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I had brunch on Saturday morning. As a party of 3, me and my sisters only had to wait 30 minutes, where we took the time to hit the slot machines. I ordered the Classic Croque Madame which was DELICIOUS!!! my sister had the Ham and Swiss Cheese quiche which was also amazing, and my other sister had the Lobster Eggs Benedict on a Potato Waffle which I would say tasted like a piece of heaven. 0=) It was my favorite meal I had in Vegas, and I also visited some pretty nice restaurants. It was quite a lovely experience. I  also went back a couple of time for their pastries. I LOVE THE ALMOND CROISSANTS! I brought my mom some meringues back home, and she ate half the box that night. totally recommend this place.
