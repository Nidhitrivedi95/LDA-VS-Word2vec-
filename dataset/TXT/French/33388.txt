hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I felt the need to update my review. I recently had a baby who happens to be dairy/soy intolerant, and caffeine seems to make her super fussy. Needless to say my coffee consumption as of late has been less than satisfying. I met a friend here the other day, more for her benefit and asked Olivier if they had any non-dairy or soy options, expecting him to say no. He advised that he could make any of their drinks with almond milk. I almost did a dance right there in the shop! I ordered a decaf caramel macchiato and it was oh so devine. They can be a little slow, so I wouldn't go there if I was in a hurry, but it's well worth the wait.
