4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I can't afford to come here more than once a year, but it is my favorite special occasion restaurant in Vegas.  Gorgeous view, the food is delicious and they have a very solid gluten-free (and an extensive regular) menu, wine list and dessert options!  Even better, they are VERY flexible and happy to assist you in creating a gluten-free dish of your own if you see something on the regular menu that might be manipulated into a GF meal.  My go-to dinner (even though it's an appetizer, it's very generous) is the chicken liver mousse on gluten-free toast, but you really can't go wrong with almost everything on the menu.  The chocolate mousse is to die for, too!

Also, if you're VERY careful, you can get out of there for less than $30...
