lNB-yJoVi-sk6X0uoWOh-g Location: On the main, in the Mile End area. Street parking is available [metered] and the closest subway is likely Laurier. You'll need to walk from there. 

The place: I feel like I've been saying this in all my reviews lately, but what can I say? The place is small but well laid out. Love the wood floors and just the overall feel and look of the place. It's comfortable and relaxed. 

The goods: I ordered the scallops, served with creamy polenta, asparagus and a hardboiled egg. OK, so first, I'm not sure if this dish was meant to be served hot or cold.... but my dish was cold - from the egg to the polenta, to the asparagus. That being said, the flavours of this dish meshed really well together, and I loved the polenta and could eat it by the spoonful. Maybe they should package it and serve it like pudding! Anyway, my only comment is that they served me two scallops - thus, the portion did seem a bit small to me. That being said, I was satiated when I left - so for me, the portion was just right. I would've liked to have maybe 1-2 more scallops on the plate. The waitress asked if we wanted bread (home-made) and I said yes. I'm not 100% sure if I'm correct in this assumption, but it tasted like cinnamon/raisin brad (sans raisins) - it was amazing! Don't skip the bread.  My friend ordered the sausage salad, which she enjoyed, but she felt that it was very filling for a brunch dish. I have to say that the portion was quite large and looked more like a stew than a salad. Great dish but if you're not starving, you might want to opt for something lighter. I tasted the sausage and it was delicious. 

Service: Good! Our water glasses were always full and staff checked in on us throughout the meal. We had one minor 'issue' that was resolved immediately, and in a professional manner. 

Price point: My dish was $17 + taxes and tip. 

I'm definitely planning to check these guys out during their dinner service, in the future.
