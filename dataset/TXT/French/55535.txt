rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I brought my parents here for dinner during my Dad's 50th bday trip to Vegas last year. I love love love the location. It's in a huge Vegas hotel (the Venetian), but it's tucked away in a separate tower and you have to take the elevator to get there. It's a gorgeous space with huge windows, very chic and very bistro.

Of course the service was impeccable and our server was very knowledgable. They also make a VERY stiff drink. I forgot what the name was, but I had the signature drink. I swear I was tipsy after 2 sips. It was definitely worth whatever it cost. 

The food was very good, but I didn't wasn't really blown away by anything. The baguettes were great and so was the polenta that came as a side to my mom's entree. We had a special braised rabbit appetizer that was interesting. The bf and I both had croque madams which was surprisingly a little bland, but the fries...OMG the fries were soooo good, I wish I had room for all of them. For dessert we shared the waffles. I believe it was also a special. It was fun and interactive. Even if you don't order dessert they bring out a plate of cookies and candy for you.

Don't forget to check out the stamp/embosser thing on the way out!

Now that I've moved to SF, I'm hoping a trip to the French Laundry will be coming up soon!
