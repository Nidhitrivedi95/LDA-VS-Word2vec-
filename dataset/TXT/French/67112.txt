This is a special occasion restaurant for sure and you will not be disappointed when you dine here. My wife and I came here for our anniversary. We had the scallops to start and they were delicious. Even the garden salad was top notch. I highly recommend the veal chops, with shrimp and potatoes. The set up for this meal was perfect. My wife had the swordfish which was the special for the night and she thought it was divine. This is a beautiful restaurant in Charlotte and a must dine for anyone looking for a wonderful night out
