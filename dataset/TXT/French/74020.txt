xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We dined here on our wedding night. We had a lovely table by the window. It was absolutely stunning. 
The food was amazing. I loved everything about it. 
From the Shirley Temple I ordered to the dessert  we devoured we were in awe the whole time. 

I kept saying i can't believe this is happening. 
They go above and beyond. 
The staff were amazing. So nice and professional. They made it seem like we were the only ones there. I will always remember this place. 
 
Highly recommend.
