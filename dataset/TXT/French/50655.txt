OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA Went here for the first time the other day.


Pretty cozy little joint.

Deserts up the ying yang..

Macaroons as well as mini bundt cakes and normal size ones.. 


They also have gelato that looked pretty good too.


I ordered the bri Mac n cheese, and avocado burger..


Just a normal burger and avocado.. Nothing special.. Especially when it was served to me with shit brown lettuce... They don't spice the meat at all it seems..

The Mac and cheese was beyond tasteless...  We were going to get desert after our meal but I didn't wanna take anymore chances..

I don't think I'll be returning here.. 


The customer service was great and the people were very lovely. But maybe the head chef needs to keep an eye on their cooks... Because everyone can taste lazy ness..



Just saying..
