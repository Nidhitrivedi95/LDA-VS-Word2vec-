4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Amazing views, very French and cute, quality service and mediocre food. If the food was better, I might be able to understand the hype, but as it stands, I think most of the high reviews are due to the actual experience of being there, ignoring the mediocrity of the food. 

A wonderful brunch place that provides you with some of the best views on the strip, across from the Bellagio where we stayed. The place definitely has that French feel, as much as a Vegas place could anyway. One could come dressed up or with sweats and it will be ok either way (like I said, as much as a Vegas place could lol). The servers were on top of things. We actually came with a group of 10+ and we were seated surprisingly fast. 

Again, the one weakness, and it's a big one, is the food! Sadly, everything else, as good as it is, cannot make up for the bland, unseasoned taste of most of our dishes. I did not take many pictures but given that there were more than 10 of us, we tried most things on the menu. They leave much to be desired in that department.

I guess if you are not spoiled by the amazing food of the Bay Area and NYC, Vegas food in general might not seem as lacking but, imho, I have yet to be wowed there.
