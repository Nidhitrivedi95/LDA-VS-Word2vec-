nk9lP-iXi7xklwN3VYf6Ew I stayed at a corporate apartment across the street for a month and decided to try this place after trying Cora few times. $21 for all you can eat fancy style brunch is what they advertised. Ok. The place felt fancy. Large, comfy seats. Oversized tables. Went super early so got good service which eventually went down dramatically when it started filling up. For the food. It was very skimpy. Had tiny bowls with fruit, condiment bowls. Yogurt. Large sausages which were good. Potatoes which were ok. Bacon tray always just had few slices of bacon. Made to order omelet station that produced very bland and pathetic looking omelets. And toast. No French toast. No pancakes (they said you can order for extra and they'll put the order in upstairs. Come on.) Coffee was absolutely great however. I drank enough to fly out of there. All in all very plain (not fancy) brunch that lacked key brunch items for me, like French toast, pancakes, waffles, or eggs benedict. Go there if you want to pay $21 for egg and sausage breakfast with no frills except for table settings.
