XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I think Zinc Brasserie will get better and better. I visited the restaurant only 6 days after they opened. 

The good:  The food is amazing.  I had a sandwich and dessert.  I can't remember what the sandwich was called but it was a pork sandwich. It was cooked to perfection.  Dessert was great too!  (Creme brûlée). 

The atmosphere is lovely!  Much more comfortable and elegant than other airport restaurants.  

The bad:  I noticed some issues with cleanliness (staff practices, dirty dish ware, dirty tables).  The staff also was somewhat unfriendly and borderline rude.   


Love love love Matt Carter concepts. The Mission, Zinc and House Brasserie are among some of my favorite restaurants.  I can't wait o try this location again and see how staff (and cleanliness) is settling in and improving.
