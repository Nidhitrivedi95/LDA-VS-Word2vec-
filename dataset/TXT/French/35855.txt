hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg My wife and I got lucky during a short visit and did snag two seats at the bar and it was wonderful.  Julie the bar tender was a great hostess/server, starting us off with her own creation, the honey lavender martini, AVIATOR.  Delicious...careful though, they'll sneak up on you.  The ambiance is just what we like; smallish , unique ... No corporate model here!  Great music keeping you company without requiring you yell to be heard, and last but not least, absolutely incredible food.  We shared the duck confit with foie gras on a buckwheat waffle as a starter, delicious.    I chose the risotto with veal cheeks, WOW!  Best risotto I've ever had.  My wife got the foie gras stuffed guinea hen and roasted vegetables, and it was moist and just as delicious.  A nice, moderately bottle of Cote de Rhone to help it along Perfect meal in a truly wonderful setting.  Warning: guinea hen is for TWO...pay attention when ordering.  Other than a desire for slightly lower prices, I don't have any negatives for this wonderful restaurant.
