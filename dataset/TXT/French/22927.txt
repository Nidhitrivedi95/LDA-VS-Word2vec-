bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I love brunch nom nom nom! I'm ALWAYS on the hunt for a good brunch spot so I'm glad we decided on this place. I have passed the area that it's in a few times but never really thought to venture in . It's tucked away right near the parking garage, which is kinda convenient and a short walk. We went on a Sunday around 12pm maybe and we waited around 30 mins for a table of 3. I tried a Mimosa which was good, more champagne than I expected so that was a plus along with the chocolate chip malted Belgian waffle with a side of grits and hash browns. The waffle came with one side but I'm southern so it's only right that I have grits with my meal 
Overall my food was good presentation wide could have been a bit better for the waffle - looks like they literally threw some chocolate chips on there and sent it out the door. I definitely would go back to try an omelet or the French toast! The only annoying part is that they don't' have much waiting room inside so either you stand out in the cold or cram inside.
