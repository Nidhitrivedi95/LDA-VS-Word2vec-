XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w This place gets three stars for service! Terry was great and checked on me often :) some of the other employees were  dressed very unprofessionally... I work in restaurants so maybe I'm being too harsh but it was a strange experience.  I ordered the short rib baguette... Wish it had a delicious sauce or something !! Lacking flavor.  The fries were pretty good !
