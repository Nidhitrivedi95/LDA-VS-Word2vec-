bVuPp6xuI4UPXlAEkEd2bA On a recent lazy Sunday afternoon, I stopped in at Narcisse for a drink on their rooftop terrace (5th floor of the auberge).

The Good: Great view of the Old Port!

The So-So: Considering they're a wine bar, I was hoping for a bit more from their wine list, in terms of the available selection (fairly small) and the originality of said selection.

The Bad: A loud air conditioning unit detracted from the atmosphere. I'm not sure if it's like that all the time.

That said, I'd still like to give Narcisse another chance and try the less casual dining room on the first floor for a full meal.
