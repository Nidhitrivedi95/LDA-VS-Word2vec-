4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Yum! Definitely order the chicken & brie sandwich...rich but so delicious with the brie & apple combo (they do this a lot for appetizers, so I was pleasantly surprised for this combination on an entree)

Also the trout is yums, fries are a bit oily/thin and I personally didn't like it that much. Overall really good place to eat, not too expensive either!
