5Bp8rQlvD44_W2lkcCc2vw My husband & I had checked in late in the evening to the Sofitel after a full day of travel.  Le Renoir was the first place we dined at in Montreal and our experience was outstanding. The food was amazing. I had the rabbit dish and he had the lamb. Both meals were cooked to perfection. For dessert, we enjoyed a banana pudding encased  a rich dark chocolate shell. The staff was attentive and warm. The help to make our stay in Montreal a truly memorable one.
