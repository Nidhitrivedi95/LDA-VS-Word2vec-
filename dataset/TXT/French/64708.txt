teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w I like Mimi's mainly for 2 things - their breakfasts, which are a good value and feature several items they do well that Brak likes - eggs benny, with nice thick ham slices, and good bacon.  Too many restaurants serve crummy bacon, and that can ruin an otherwise good breakfast.  I also really like the turkey dinner they serve, and occasionally the Asian chicken salad.  For a chain operation, it's pretty decent stuff, and the quality is very consistent, even across locations.  They fall short of 5 stars for inconsistent service.  Occasionally it's great, most of the time it's ok, and occasionally it's really bad.  But the food always meets expectations.
