It's a well-established and well-loved spot. 

ATMOSPHERE: Very warm and inviting. It has a cosy atmosphere, almost like a homey french cafe. There's lots of paintings on the wall and the wall themselves are in lovely earthy tones. It's quite a large restaurant with a dining room and an enclosed patio at the back of the restaurant. This is a great place for business lunches, dates, or casual meet-ups.

SERVICE: Good. Pretty standard. Servers are polite and not disruptive during the meal.

PRICE: Very affordable. And due to large portion sizes, I think it is worth every penny, and easily beats out any competition on the street. 

FOOD: They have a VERY extensive menu. Even their Daily Specials menu is a full page long with many, many options. So anyone can find something right for them. I haven't tried anything I did not enjoy. Ranging from soup to salad; pastas to grilled chicken; fish to sandwiches - nothing leaves you wanting.

I have a soft spot for pasta - so that's my usual. It comes with a large helping of pasta, plus a side salad.

Their portions are also quite generous. So bring an empty stomach - or be prepared to pack away half of your entree to save for another meal!

Their brunch and breakfasts are also delectable! So if you're in the area on the weekend, it's a great spot for a hearty brunch.

I highly recommend it: Yes, 5 stars!
