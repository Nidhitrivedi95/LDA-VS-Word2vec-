rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Visited for breakfast and had sourdough waffles with candied bananas and vanilla creme, wow, fantastic. The service team was equally fantastic, prompt to refill water, remove empty plates. Alonzo was our primary server. Although it was 100 the patio was much cooler and out of the sun at 10am. Best meal and service yet on Vegas.
