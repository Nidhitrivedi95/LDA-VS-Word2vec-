QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Nice restaurant, very promising, just a few complaints. They were busy and service took for ever, plus they screwed up our order of mussels. What a shame, they were fresh, good quality mussels, but, maybe because they were rushed they did not take the time to let the mussels filter out the mud and the sand, so easy to do. As a result, I ate a few that were full of sandy thick grey mud. Sadly that wasn't the only problem, they weren't cooked properly, half of them were unopened, a few of the ones I ate, tasted like uncooked oysters. We had to turn back the mussels and ordered the trout that was ok, slightly on the overcooked side. A positive note, our waiter was probably the best waiter I have had in a very long time and made the substandard experience liveable
