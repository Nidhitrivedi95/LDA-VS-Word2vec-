WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w I don't really see what the fuss is all about for this place.

We asked for a table for 8 people, on a sunday at 12, so of course you can expect to wait for a table, but what I really REALLY don't like is when the waitress tells you :
" - It's going to be a 10mn wait
 Comes back 25mn later
 - 5 more minutes guys
 50mn after we entered the place, we have our table"

From 10 to 50 minutes, excuse me but ... Fuck off.

Food wise ...Well it's not bad and the plate is full for a reasonable price, my breakfast Burrito was ok, but that's the thing : I had way better in places not so packed. 
It's big, noisy, absolutely no atmosphere whatsoever so.... Yeah I just don't get it.
