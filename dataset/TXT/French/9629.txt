4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I always pass by this restaurant when I am at the Paris Hotel and Casino and it is always super busy. So, we finally made a reservation and had dinner here one night. 

Hangar steak with pommes frites - AWESOME! 
That's the only thing that I ordered.

The service was very good.
The price was ok around $20-$30 per entree.
I'm still thinking about the fries.

Great place to pregame before you hit the club's and casino.
