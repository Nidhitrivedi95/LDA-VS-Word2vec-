rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A When you can't see much inside a restaurant because of its very dim lighting, then you know you're in for some upscale dining among fine individuals with night vision (read: Predator).
Tucked away in what seemed to be another time zone in the behemoth of a casino, Bouchon indulged me with French fare in an intimate, classy setting.
My party of 3 were seated promptly and we started off with escargot (perfectly buttery and chewy).  
The house bread and PISTACHIOS are bomb diggity.  I love anything bread and butter so I was in heaven. The pistachios were a bonus ;) C'mon, where else can you get pistachios?!  Indeed, I am a sucker for novelty. 
I ordered an iced tea and our server brought it out in a carafe, which I thought was and refreshingly...refreshing.  My only gripe with it was that the carafe was not large enough, as I am a bottomless pit for tea.

I have had their lamb so I tried their steak frites, prepared medium rare.  I forget the cut of the steak but I will say that it was one of the best cooked steaks I've ever had!  The center was pink and juicy (no innuendos here!) and every bite of it left me wanting more!  I didn't care too much for the fries; I wish I had substituted it for  something else. What a waste of fries...

My only gripe with the establishment would be the cramped seating between tables.  It can get extremely awkward taking my seat, wiggling my rotund derriere in between tables to get to my destination.  Most of the time, the company directly next to me are not within earshot; but, when they are, then I'd find myself biting my tongue, trying not to spew out my vernacular of special four-letter words. 

Our server was superbly nice and accommodating and our waters were always filled to the brim.  I've always had a great experience here.  The wait staff had greeted us on the way in, which set a precedent for great service and food.
Oh, Bouchon, I will be back.
