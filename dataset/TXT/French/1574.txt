I had the Croque Madame, and it was delicious.  The chocolate croissant was also really good... but it was also small for the price.  My friend had the vichysoisse, and it was excellent.

The service was definitely more attentive this time-- at least in terms of there being a better ratio of servers to patrons.  However, of the 3 servers who provided various things to us while we were there, 2 of them were great, and one of them was not.  While the third server did perform her duties, she was not warm in any way.  

More importantly, one thing that happened REALLY put us off.... and I was going to write the details here, but I have decided not to get into it, in the interest of discretion.  I will just say that one server was VERY rude to 2 elderly ladies at the table next to us.  VERY, VERY rude.

In the interest of fairness, I will add that my 9-month-old daughter did knock over and shatter a glass, which was completely our fault, and the "rude server" did clean it up and tell us not to worry about it. 

All in all, I would say to go here for the pastries for sure and if you are going to get actual food, carry-out might be the better way to go.
