4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Brunch here is pretty good.  The weather was gorgeous and we got seated in the "indoor patio" area, where we're indoors but have wonderful views of the strip and the Bellagio watershow (my favorite!).  

Yayyyyy!  I wanted to be healthy and recover from the night before so I went for the Butter Lettuce and Honey Crisp Apple Salad.  I saw people from two other tables order it around us and figured it would be good.  It was actually pretty good.  The aged goat cheese was the perfect compliment to the beets and light dressing on the lettuce.  Although the serving was on the smaller side, I was still full with that and the bread.  

We shared pitchers of the sangria, which was pretty stiff, but had a lot of good fruity flavors.  The server was interesting (he pretty much shared his whole life story to us in 3 minutes), but it definitely didn't bother us.
