2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Maggie is wonderful, and her crepes and gallettes are too! Fresh ingredients, with love and warmth - something one does not find as readily anymore. There is simply something magical about eating here. I am so very glad I finally had time and place match up to allow me a little slice of heaven. 
Note: location can be a bit tricky to find, but trust me- you will be happy you found these crepes and the uber sweet Maggie!
