teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w A friend and I visited on April 4/4/17 for lunch. Service was really slow. I ordered a French dip with a cup of onion soup. My friend ordered the croissant with turkey and brie and onion soup. I bit into my sandwich and came close to spitting the bite out. It was not only cold it was refrigerator cold. My friend was completely finished with her meal by the time I was given a new sandwich. I couldn't tell you if it was hot or not I asked for a box and a container for the au jus, paid my bill and left. The manager came over as we were leaving and said he had been told about the sandwich. At no point was I offered a discount on my decidedly disappointing meal. In the future I'll get my French dip at our tiny local cafe much better food at less than half the price. I decided to have the sandwich for dinner tonight, sharing it with my husband. There is barely an ounce of au jus, maybe enough for a dry dip sandwich.
