d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q The food here is good but I can't say the same for the service. I've celebrated a birthday here as well as somebody else's birthday.

I recommend the Duck Confit and Frenchie Burger. The steaks are alright. For dessert, get Le President and a Rocky Road Macaron. I love the popovers which is part of their bread service. 

However, the service is borderline rude. My friend called to confirm our reservation and that they were aware we were celebrating a birthday so we'd like something simple yet special like "Happy Birthday" written on the plate with chocolate and a candle. The response she got was "we already know it's her birthday." Wow! On behalf of my friend, I'd like to apologize for bothering whoever answered the phone as I'm sure she had more important and intellectual things to do than deal with customers. When we got to the restaurant, our server seemed like she was having a bad day. A friend had ordered her second glass of wine but she only got 1.5 glasses because the bottle ran out but the server said she'll get a new bottle to fill her glass - that didn't quite happen without grief. And when the dessert came, there was nothing "Happy birthday" about it - no chocolate writing, no candle.

I think when you have to deal with customers, you should be allowed to "call in bitchy" that way you can get your act right and not piss off paying customers.
