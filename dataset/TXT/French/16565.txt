8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ If you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy a romantic meal, this is a great place. This is not a kid-friendly place to eat , nor a place you want to bring a loud friend, as everyone in the room will be involved in the conversation. (We all have one of those loud friends - you know what I'm talking about!)

I love the attentive personal service - the owner was our server, and he was so nice! I gave it three stars because most of the food sounded better on the menu than it tasted,  but the cozy environment makes up for that a bit. If I were going to just sit there and not eat, I would have given the place four stars.

I was one of the friends that had lunch with Camille H. She covered the food well, so just read thru her review for food details.
