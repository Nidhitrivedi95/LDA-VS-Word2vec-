H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A When I'm back in Montreal, you'll definitely find me at Gus. Risa D took us there after dinner for a night cap and dessert... if there was any space at the bar. Just our luck, a few folks were on their way out and we grabbed some highly coveted seats at the bar. It was pretty but with Risa in tow, Dave welcomed us with open arms... literally. We told Dave we'd love to try a dessert or two and maybe a drink. Our waitress was a self proclaimed old fashioned expert so we accepted her challenge with a round of those. Next thing we know, one of every dessert comes out and placed in front of us to share. Dave wasn't a fan of us sharing just one or two and insisted we eat them all. Each one was phenomenal, but one was a variation on a creme brulee and was life changing. We ended up sticking around and getting to know Dave a little better while he heavy-handedly made sure our wine glasses were never empty. A great guy running a great place. I only wish we would have had a chance to do dinner there as well.
