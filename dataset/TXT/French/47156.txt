O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I have mixed feelings about this place. The truffled macaroni and cheese was delicious. Our steaks were good but for $46 per 8 ounces (and steakhouse in your name), meat needs to be excellent. I'd expect a little more flavor, and the steak knives were dull! The waiter even apologized and said, "I think the steak sharper should come twice a month versus just once." Patio dining was nice. Good people watching. (The cheese list looked impressive but we took a pass.) Our waiter also didn't have solid knowledge of the wines by the glass. Is Vegas fine dining slipping across the board?
