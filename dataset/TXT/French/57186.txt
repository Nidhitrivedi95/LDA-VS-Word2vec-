rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Took mom here for her b-day brunch - I was on a mission to order as much food as possible because every time I come to visit she tries to take me to TGI Friday's or some BS so this was my attempt to change that.

The beignets covered in cinnamon and sugar served w/ nutella and jam were so friggen good. Those and some coffee would make a nice snack. I got the shrimp and grits special and it was delicious. Mom got steak frites - very good, the fries are not of the crunchy variety but they had a really good flavor. The french 77 cocktail went VERY well with all the food. We shared a chocolate mouse and it's hands down one of the best chocolate desserts I've ever had.
