COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw what a cute little place.  service was good, the food was ok.  we enjoyed our veggie basket & the bread was really good & my daughter loved the tapenade but I thought it too fishy for me.  she ordered the lamb shank which she really liked, I has some skirt steak medallions which was gamey & way too red.  we both hardly touched our mashed potatoes... for how much they charge and what we got, I don't think it was worth it but my daughter loves the name of the restaurant so for her bday I thought it be a cute surprise.  Not a huge fan of French food either so the pricing really hurt!  we had a mixed group, one couple trying to be romantic in the corner, us & a very loud group of 4 who seemed to be regulars.  don't think the couple appreciated the loud outbursts of laughter but we didn't care. so I guess just depends on who's there at the time.
