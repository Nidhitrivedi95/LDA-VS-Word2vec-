iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg Very Disappointed.  We made reservation for a party of 4 on a tues. night.  We arrived and stood in the lobby/bar area for 10min.  No employee to be seen, my husband walked back into the kitchen to see a young male employee sitting on the line having a conversation with another employee.  We were sat at a table w/ stained table cloth, and 2 broken chairs that we exchanged out from another table.  We than opened up dirty menus with prices being on the high side, due to lack of A/C and poor conditions of the restaurant we got up and left.  The young staff did not seem to be bothered at all.  This restaurant seems to get good reviews,  but the 4 of us local residents will not return.
