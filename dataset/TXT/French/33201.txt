HiMb8cwGsnFVwYxt1h0RCg This spot is pretty awesome. The food is very descent and cheap. I had the chance to try so many items from the menu, one of my favorite things is Focaccia goat cheese. I do mostly brunches at this spots but been here for lunch and dinner couple times. Table d'hôte is pretty filling, you are going to have a doggy bag leaving this place.
