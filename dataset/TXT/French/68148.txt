vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ My wife brought me here to celebrate my birthday.  Hostess sat us near two loud tables and gladly resat us.
The menu really talked to me.  It was easy for me to decide on an appetizer of Pate and a main course of Lamb Shank.  What makes Legume SOOOOOO good is the get both the big and small things right.  The Pate was flavorful with seasoned bread and mustard.  But I was really blown away by the pickled green beans on the side!
The grade of Lamb Shank was very good.  It was slow cooked and braised, loaded with fall-off-the-bone flavor.  The carrots were unbelievable!!!  Sweet and tender.  Fingerling potatoes were a nice balance.
I'm not sure what I had for dessert, as my wife ordered it, but it was sweet and a good mix of flavors.  Chocolate, pears and meringue.  What a way to end a meal!
I am completely honest when I say this is one of the best, if not THE BEST, meal I've ever tasted.  Portion size was perfect.  Food is out-of-this-world!!!
Decor is tasteful...very nice.
I can't believe you would ever be disappointed here.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
