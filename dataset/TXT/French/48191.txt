O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I was in Toronto in time for Summerlicious.  Arranged a date with my sisters for lunch here and luckily I was with good company because food was just meh.  

Now why am I compelled to write a review about it?  Because if this is one of the better establishments in Toronto's restaurant industry, then I'm worried. I hear about Sassafraz all the time, with all the celebrities checking in, but I don't think it's the best representation of Toronto's dining scene.  It's got a cool vibe (+1 star), the location is great (+1 star), and the staff was friendly and accommodating (+1 star... at least they were to us that day -- it was the first day of Summerlicious and the restaurant wasn't busy)...  But the food just didn't blow me away.  I know it's the Summerlicious menu, but if you want people to come back, then present them with your best meal -- discounted price or not.
