xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Can't wait to go there again.  Was my first time here but definitely not my last.  Not only was the food amazing, but the staff and owner was a pleasure.  Food is fresh. Everything is made right in front of you.  A lot of thought and care have been put into this menu.  My kid loved it as well. I have also told about 3 people already on how great this place is.
