m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q NOT the best cocktails
We were warned, went anyway*
It was a mistake

*literally in our Airbnb there was a note that said, "Le Lab- avoid-overpriced" but with all these stellar reviews and a love of cocktails, we went and, wow it was not good. The service was terrible, considering we were dropping $20 on a drink.
