3FyoKvUGfKSIun6ZvrEhWQ I really like the food at Tournesol - it's very nice, basic French food done well.

It is fairly expensive, though, so if you're the kind of person that needs to have an OMG experience at a certain price point then you're at risk here because this place is more simple excellent, rather than "life changing experience".
