63hkYvXXcZsHeCeZBQbfew I was drunk.  My husband ordered me a wrap of some sort with chicken and veggies.  It was delicious.  Don't get it twisted though...just because I was drunk doesn't mean I don't know what taste good.  The food was delicious!  Fresh, fresh, fresh vegetables! MMMM....Just thinking about it makes me want more.  The sauce was amazing!!  The place is VERY clean especially for a late night/24 hour place.  I wish we had one of these places near me.
