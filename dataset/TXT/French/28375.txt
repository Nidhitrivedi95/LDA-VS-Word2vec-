EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g I really wanted to try Alo but didn't have a reservation so I decided to go to their bar area for apps and drinks instead as a reservation is not required.

Finding the restaurant is a bit of a challenge as there are no signs and you enter through a tiny non-descript lobby next to a nail salon where a waitress greets you and presses a button to a very tiny and quirky old elevator which feels like it could break down at any moment. It's a rather slow and clausterphobic ride up to the restaurant -- it's more charming than it sounds.
The bar area is rather cozy with about 10 seats at the bar and another 10 seats with tables. The menu consisted of apps/small plates which are different from their tasting menu. There is also an extensive cocktail menu, organized by drink styles, which had recipes next to it if you want to make the same drink at home which I thought was fun.
The service was excellent, very friendly and helpful, though I thought the waiter was a bit too eager to take or plates or glasses away before we were finished. The food was great -- I had the Hamachi tartare and pork belly which were outstanding. Excellent layering of flavours.
I thought the presentation was a bit lacking as both dishes looked similar in terms of plating and garnishing, and didn't look as clean and artful as their tasting menu plates.

Because the seated tables in the bar area are very snug, you are almost sitting with the people next to you, which is not bad but I had a couple douchey guys in overly-trendy suits sitting next to me who had a couple drinks and were talking obnoxiously loud and dropping f-bombs which was really rude and annoying and was a black spot in my otherwise nice relaxing evening.

I'm sure to return to eat in their dining room and experience their tasting menu with wine pairing as everyone has been raving about.
