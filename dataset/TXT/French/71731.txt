xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw Went here today and was incredibly disappointed by the lack of service. The food was good but unless you're the more mature retired clientele they will completely ignore you. We sat down for 8 minutes before we got fed up and had to ask for a menu. Figured out what we wanted and closed our menu and then had to wait for the waitress to pass by us three times before she realized we wanted to order something. Once we did order I noticed that all the other tables had bread baskets and water but they didn't bother even offering it and we had already put in our coffee order. Waitress dropped off our meal and we never saw her again. A different server was the one who brought us our cheque. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone since if I'm paying $14 for a crepe and then pay for coffee refills I would expect some sort of minimal service
