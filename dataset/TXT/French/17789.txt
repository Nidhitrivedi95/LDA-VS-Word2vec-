I had the Halibut gratin for apps, it was really yummy, I must say. I was never a huge fan of fish, but after having halibut in this format and having the Roasted Seabass for my main, I'm starting to really like fish. The roasted seabass was my favourite. It was very tender and juicy, not over or undercooked, it was just right, and it was served with pomme fourchette which was AMAZING. So delicious. Pretty presentation too :)

For dessert I got the chocolate fudge with sorbet, which I forgot what it's called on the menu, but it was very refreshing.

The whole ambiance was pleasant. It's great for romantic dinner or taking clients. Definitely a grown-ups place. Very proper.

Bathrooms are downstairs and they were decent. There's coat check as well, which is great during winter.

Overall, I would give this place 5/5. I fully recommend.
