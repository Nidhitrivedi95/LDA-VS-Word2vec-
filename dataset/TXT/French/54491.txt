rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw First time at Bardot this past week. Intimate setting, dark and deep, but with light and friendly staff to balance it all. 
Hubby had the lamb and I had the king crab crepe. We shared the mac gratin and truffle fries. Everything was rich and full of flavor. Although the restaurant was quite busy, we did not wait long for our food. They provide you with your own baguette with salted butter, which they continue to replenish throughout the dinner (which I loved!)
Great place and will definitely come back!
