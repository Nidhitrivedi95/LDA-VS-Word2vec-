jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ I have heard great things about this place for years, and I finally had to opportunity to learn what the hype was about!  The back patio is so quaint and cute, and a great romantic spot.  We ordered several small plates, and the food was incredible!  The server was excellent- very professional, yet fun and friendly.  One of the great perks is that it is byob, so you can have a high quality meal for such a reasonable price, since you aren't overpaying for alcohol.  I cannot wait to return next time I am in town!  Heads up that is it cash only- but worth the trip to the ATM (which I have never said before!)
