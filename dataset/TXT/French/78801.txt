ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We were lucky to snag a table before the lunch rush came in just a little after noon last Saturday.  Le Parisien - Baguette, Ham, Cheese, and mustard.  Simple, no?  No.  

The baguette's texture was hard and too thick for its own sake.  Paris, France (as in the city-comma-country that I visited last Summer) on the other hand, had a tough texture too and I could chew it and not be afraid of damaging my teeth.  As for the flavors, Le Cafe Ile St Louis was definitely Americanized since it was loaded with meat.  Good value for my meal, but for about the same price in Euro, the smaller ham and cheese baguette sandwiches I got in Paris, France (from several gas stations no less!) had less meat and more flavors in it that burst out allowing me to taste all the ingredients combined in all its glorious simplicity as if I were to eat it for the first time.  Value schmalue.  Good taste always trumps price in my book.  Like Pepe Le Pew feens for the white paint striped lady cat, I'm feenin' for a real ham and cheese baguette sammich.

Le French fries were thin, crispy and oh so tasty.  

Don't even get me started on le service.  They weren't attentive but seemed glad to serve us.  My water was filled but once.  Our server went missing and it took maybe 5 minutes longer than usual to get our food.  She forgot my French Chicken Noodle Soup.  She even wrote it down!!!  At least le service is French-like.
