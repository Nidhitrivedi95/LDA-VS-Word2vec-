ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Decent breakfast joint located at the back of Paris. This place is often confused with Mon Ami Gabi located at the front of Paris. 

Get the savory crepes, they are delicious! I tried everyone else's food and it didn't compare. Service was really really slow. I mean snails pace. 

We ended up just putting our room number and charging it to the room on our check because the waiter would not come back to let us pay. 

The ambiance is that of a little cafe in Paris. If you can, request to sit "outside" amongst the casino. It's really cool how it has an outdoorsy feel and even has patio furniture. 

Super over priced for breakfast food if you ask me... Especially for the only so-so quality and service.
