0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g We went there for dinner for my birthday and it was one of the best dinners of my life. I wanted to sit inside and enjoy all Picasso art they have there but beautiful warm evening with the view on Bellagio fountains totally won me over. Menu consisted of several dishes paired with some good wine. Everything was nicely served and the service was discrete. Absolutely enjoyed every bite and minute!
