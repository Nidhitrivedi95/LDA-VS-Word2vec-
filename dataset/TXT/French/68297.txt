vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I've walked past Legume hundreds of times but have never gone in.  From the outside it looks quite small, but when you enter, the floor is quite large.  My girlfriend and I were seated in a comfortable area that was not crowded at all.

We started with wine and an appetizer.  We got the smoked bluefish paté.  It was a very well blended mix of flavors.  The fish was present with a nice smoked flavor perfect for the crispy bread for spreading.

As an entree, I got the beef cooked medium-rare.  It was cooked perfectly with many compliments.  It came with glazed carrots that were softened but still crunchy, radiccio that was crunchy and tender, and potatoes.  The meat was seasoned well and went well with everything on the dish.  One thing I noticed was the potatoes were not well seasoned but I figured this was by design, as they were not meant to be mashed potatoes, but authentic and rustic smushed potatoes.

My girlfriend had the bass.  It was tender and flaky with rice and a pureé.  She absolutely enjoyed it.

For dessert, we got the chocolate truffle cake with whipped cream.  It was rich and delicious and the perfect ending to our meal.

The thing we enjoyed most about the meal was the fact that the wait staff was attentive, but not annoying.  We would definitely recommend Legume and the plant to plate philosophy it conveys.
