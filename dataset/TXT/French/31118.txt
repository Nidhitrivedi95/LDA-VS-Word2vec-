gf46U12A1oIIpq2sNt_PGg Winterlicious 2013: One of the best experiences, period.

Exceptional Food (everything we ordered was delectable): 
Entree - Salade Havanese & Terrine de Campagne 
Main - Braised Beef Crecy & Confit de Canard
Dessert - Valrhona Chocolate Surprise & Poire Confit et son Sabayon 
(dessert was especially heavenly - both are fantastic choices!)

Have to second Mochi's review (12/30/2012). 

We were prolly the youngest, most casually-dressed (oops) patrons for the evening and despite that... service was courteous and on-point! 

If you want to have French food done right at a reasonable price point, Didier is it. This is one of the few restos I'd return to (maybe for their year-round prix fixe?) after having sampled them at Winterlicious. 

Definitely worth it!
