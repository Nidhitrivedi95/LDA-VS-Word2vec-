6tlbZydPbL0Q3_eolg2OJA Lovely little chic French Creperie in Bronte oakville near the port. We were welcomed by the friendly manager who seated us near the window. We ordered the famous onion soup which came to the table hot ands full of herbs! The soup was one of the best tasting french onion soups I've had. For dessert we ordered the banana chocolate crepe Royale. The crepe itself was absolutely delicious. Well definitely be back to try the savory crepes! There is a vast menu of flavors for both sweet and savory crepes!
