Xw50tINqzrI_BM_x7_IcZA This is a little restaurant that has the feeling as if you were actually in a little town in France. Crepes are just plain delicious! All ingredients are top notch and they just melt in your palate. This is the traditional way to serve crepes, right in your hand (instead of in a plate with knife and fork). We had dessert crepes, and the personal attention of the owner. 
She does her own lemonade, which can also been served warm for those winter days. A must try. 

Enjoy!
