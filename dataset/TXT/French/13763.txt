4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ We had one of the best meals in years here. The restaurant is intimate and cozy. The staff are professional and provide top notch service. It was difficult to choose from the many tempting dishes on the menu. The pan crusted goat cheese with greens and strawberries was a perfect blend of crunchy, creamy, fresh and green and sweet. The vegetarian pasta was full of flavor with tender penne tossed with a sauce of tomatoes, red peppers, edamame, baby zucchini, mushrooms, garlic and more. The serving was 4 times what I could eat and I was starving.  The shrimp and chorizo risotto was divine!  So creamy and full of flavor, another large portion. The child's pasta with tomato sauce was wonderful as well. Fresh French bread, many wines (from a very nice wine list) by the glass, a perfect place for a wonderful meal.  Our only regret was not having room for dessert.
