gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Fantastic food, great atmosphere, quick service. My biggest criticism is it's a bit crowded, but it's pretty justified, the place was full enough that it warranted the seating, but we still got in and had a seat pretty quickly. The food was top notch. I had bruschetta and chicken. It was awesome. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it felt amazing, and coming here with good company makes for an awesome night.
