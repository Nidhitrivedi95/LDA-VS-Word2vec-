kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ the place looks great, and i would go there again to have drinks. But i would never eat there food again!!!!!!! no flavor, my wife had the filet it was over cooked and the sauce taste like it came from a powder form. our server had no clue what she was doing and the chef came over to talk to us and it was clear he was drunk or on something. But they had good drinks!!
