4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Steak, steak, and more steak in a very desired strip front location across from the dancing waters of the Bellagio.  The predominant offering is steak with about 10 different sauces you can have.  But all the actual meat is the same - new york strip at $25 - with the exception of the rib eye which costs $35.  They have some other stuff, pork loin and chicken.  I got the chicken and he got the rib eye.  The chicken was flavorless and dull, the rib eye while tastily charred on the outside, had a lot of gristle.  One star taken away due to hopelessly clueless servers.  I said "I need my order to be dairy free, can you check with the chef?" and she said "oh well I think there's eggs in the chicken"  ??huh?? on two accounts there. And we heard another server at the table next to us saying that she didn't know what kind of steak it was but that "it's kinda like a tube steak"....they must hire for the youth and looks.....
