4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I don't know how authentic is the French cuisine is here. It is Las Vegas after all but I had a nice dinner here. I had the Caramelized Scallops and it was delicious. We also shared the Warm Chocolate Cake and it was really good.  You can taste the chocolate flavor and the warm chocolate sauce in the middle of the cake. I highly recommend that you should have your meal outside unless it is raining.  You will have  a great view of the fountains from the Bellagio Hotel across the street. The place offers great food and good service.
