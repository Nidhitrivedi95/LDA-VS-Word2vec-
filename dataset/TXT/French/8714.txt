We wanted breakfast  and didn't feel like walking around to find the perfect place.  Well, we got lucky and found a perfect place without even trying.  We were sad to find out brunch is only on weekends but our server was great and let us order breakfast even though they were on the lunch menu.  I had poached eggs with corned beef hash and it was really tasty.  Sitting on the patio is totally worth it, the people viewing, being across from Belagio fountains and the Paris atmosphere was better than expected.  I hate waiting for a check and I hate waiting for my change after I pay.  None of that going on here, the staff is so attentive walking back and forth that it was such a quick process.  The cool thing is you never feel rushed, I really appreciated the entire process of paying.
