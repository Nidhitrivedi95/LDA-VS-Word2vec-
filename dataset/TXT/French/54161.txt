RAEY1h0WidFtpTm8eGhVHA In 2016 when the restaurant just opened I had no idea who the chef was. Back then his restaurant website made me think he was a big shot, with his various TV shows and books. What a let down to realize there was nothing worthy of such media attention. 

The waitress had us sit next to the entrance, where a hole in the wall let a ice cold air flow was cooling all the plates that we were served. When I checked in the 2nd room in the back there was plenty of room left. 

Salmon tartare was served mixed with a basic mayo (what the?...). Their version of shakshouka is topped with mayo AND sriracha (I'm not one of those anti-cultural appropriation extremist but this is a crime against good taste). Bread was stale and we had to ask for it, despite having ordered a terrine appetizer. 

All in all, service was underwhelming and the food dissuaded from ever setting foot in that spot again - no matter how many books this "chef" writes.
