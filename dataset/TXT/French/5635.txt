3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA This is such a cute bistro on a cute street.  We stopped here for lunch and were surprised we were only one of three tables here, but they must attract a night/dinner crowd instead.

Our waiter was very nice and attentive and spoke enough English to help us out.  My mom ordered a beer that she did not like and he was very willing to get her something else.

Here's what we had:
- White fish baked in foil - I forgot the exact name, but with the veggies and sauce, this was amazing.  The fish was moist and the sauce complimented the fish and veggies very well.
- Veal liver - served with potatoes.  This was a beautiful dish with nicely cooked liver and tasty potatoes - mashed but still with the texture of potato chunks.   Our party actually ordered two of these specials, and our waiter came with one and told us one burned so the kitchen was making a replacement for my husband.  It was worth the wait and we appreciated the honesty.
- Salmon tartar - my brother ordered this and I had a taste.  Overall well seasoned and the entree portion was a good size
- apple tar tatin - I was a bit disappointed in this.  Although what came tasted good, it was more of a cold apple pie than the hot caramelized apple puff pastry that I expected.

Next time we visit Montreal, I'll come back here for dinner!
