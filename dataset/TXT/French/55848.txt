rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A While we were in Vegas, our friends recommended coming to Bouchon. It was actually already on my list, so we agreed to meet up with them at 12:30 on Sunday for Brunch. They said they'd get there early to get in line for a table as they don't take Brunch reservations. At 11:40 we get a phone call as they already got a table, so we rushed to get there as soon as possible. Luckily, even though we got there at 12:30, they weren't rushing our friends out the door, so bonus points for that.

I had the chicken and waffles. I've never really eaten chicken and waffles. So far I've only had posh versions, and the one at Bouchon did not disappoint. The chicken was nicely cooked with delicious gravy. The vanilla butter was great and the syrup on top was nice. Everything went so well together, and I just ate the whole thing. The other half ordered the croque madame and it was delicious. Unfortunately he wasn't feeling the best due to a bit of overindulgence the day before, so he didn't enjoy it as much as he probably would have liked.

I also had a Bloody Mary and a hibiscus bubbly drink. Both of which were really great. The coffee was delicious too. So no complaints on anything really. Great service and great food, and everything I could expect from a Bouchon restaurant.
