COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw This place is okay. I wasn't blown away by the food, the atmosphere, or the service. 

My husband and I visited this restaurant during an anniversary weekend in Vegas. We drove by this place and thought it looked interesting. Since we love good food and that's hard to find on the trendy, overpriced Strip, we decided to venture beyond it for our anniversary dinner. 

I was really excited to eat here and was pretty happy with my food until the entrees arrived. We both ordered the Prix Fare ($38 each) and the crudite, olives, bread, and appetizers were decadent. I am not an expert on French cuisine but it tasted fabulous to me. The entree was mediocre and not a strong point, so possibly the Prix Fare menu is not the best choice. I would have to order from the specials in order to make my final conclusion. 

I would've given this place another star (or two) despite the average food if it wasn't for the wait staff. Unfortunately, our server (the only waiter) was chatty (to an extreme), slow, forgetful, and downright frightening. My husband found him entertaining (to be polite), but I feel like he ruined our experience. I don't want to write too many negative comments about this poor man, as most people find him humorous and engaging based on the reviews. You will have to witness his behavior for yourself. 

I don't think I'll go back. The total was $105 plus tip. Not an outrageous amount for a special occasion, but far too much for a mediocre evening.
