hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Been here a few times and it's a nice little cafe.  A few tables inside and an outdoor area with umbrellas.  Definitely in a place you would never think it'd be, surrounded by business buildings.  Lucky for all those who work in the offices who can get their breakfast, brunch, lunch and coffee on.

I always try to get something different when I go, and honestly I enjoyed it all. 

I'm that customer that looks at the menu and order and I forget what I ordered until it comes to me. So next time I'll make it a point to take a photo and post it for you yelpers.
