O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q For lack of better words, Japaneiro is a hidden gem. 

I've been here 4 times since they've opened and have never had a bad experience. From the food to the staff, you're time here will be memorable to say the least. 

The eclectic cuisine is beautifully complimented by fast and friendly service. The Chef is social and has no problem stepping out of the kitchen to recommend dishes and such.

I recommend checking out the specials on the black board upon entry, currently the Salmon Ceviche is my go to alone with BOTH Butter Lettuce Wraps. (Black cod & Chillean Seabass)
For the munchkins, my 3 and 4 year old had no issues finding something to enjoy... Note that I consider them adventurous eaters! Like mama!
