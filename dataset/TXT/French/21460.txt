The food is cooked to perfection, the dogfish which was simply wonderful left me wanting more the instant I had finished. The decore is perhaps a little overstated however it makes this petit space look rather inviting. The instant you walk in you feel you have left Edinburgh and entered some nook in Paris.
The desserts are well made and the wine selection is great.
The interesting thing about this place is that they allowed dogs and even gave the customer a doggie bag for the dog.
Overall, this is a lovely place to go for a beautiful meal with friends or partner.
