We recently had our private event here with the Knights of Columbus' Fourth Degree Anniversary celebration and had at least an attendance of 27 guests.
The food served was a three course gourmet meal- starting with a soup or salad. 
A choice of one of three entrees- chicken, beef medallion, or a fish dish. 
Dessert capped the last portion of the meal all created by the CSN culinary students.
Not only it was scrumptious and delicious but it was appealingly plated  and served like an Iron Chef dish.
The service of the CSN team under -
Eileen Metcalfe the Dean/ instructress of Food and Beverage Management Department was unparalleled and more personalized.
We were served with our drinks and made sure our water cups were always filled up.
We were taken cared of every step of the way and even took our group photo.
This was by the way our second function in two years and we shall definitely come back and recommend this establishment to our friends and family!
We were impressed with the service oriented  individuals who are the promising future of what hospitality service is meant to be!
Congratulations to the CSN Culinary and Hospitality Service Students and keep up the good work!

You guys rock!!!
