m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Super yummy! This was my first time here,  it was very cute and quaint inside, they also had a patio.  I originally went here for the crepes, but ended up getting French Toast and the Brassiere Omelet. The French Toast was to die for! The service was excellent as well. I can't wait to go back!
