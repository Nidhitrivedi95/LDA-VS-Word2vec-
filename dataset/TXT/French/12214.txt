4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I really liked this place. They are quite affordable for lunch and have great sandwiches. I had the lobster roll which was really authentic like Boston. I also tried the steak sandwich which was excellent. The meat was so juicy and flavorful and went very well with the creamy horseradish and au jus. I highly recommend this place
