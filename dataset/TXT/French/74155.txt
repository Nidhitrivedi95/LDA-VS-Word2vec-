xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g People giving this restaurant lower than a three star need to realize that a 3 star restaurant is McDonalds or any other fast food restaurant.  I've been to the restaurant several times and they continue to impress.  Food was excellent as always and service was great as well.  People need to save three star ratings for the correct restaurants.  Or better yet provide an example of a restaurant you believe is worthy of your 5 star rating because I'm interested.
