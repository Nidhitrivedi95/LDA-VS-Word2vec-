I have gotten take out 3 times now in the past few weeks and 2/3 times they have forgotten items of the order. The time before was a baguette for my soup which they charged me for. Called to inform and they apologized and would take care of it next time along with coaching the staff. Well today I went in explaining what happened and they took care of the bread but then when I got home I didn't have my Cesar dressing to my salad ... called back for something has got to give - their food is so good. I was speaking to a mgr explaining the situation and the call either dropped (what I'm hoping for) but the timing was like he just hung up on me. Now I'm sitting here with a salad and no dressing. Very disappointed!
