   The food is out of this world, every bite as good as the next and presentations are spectacular. Remember you eat with your eyes FIRST!!!!!!
    Our cocktails all superb, mine a whiskey Sour and my girlfriend ordered a speciality gin cocktail with a rose petal that they raved about the other drink were more typical martinis & scotch & water, no complaints anywhere.
     My starter was a Alaskan King  crab & Avocado layered upon layer and a VERY generous portion too! They do not skimp at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant ~
   My main was the Queen Steak, cooked perfectly and melted like butter in my mouth  ~
   I did order the chocolate soufflé for dessert  and well worth the antisapation.
      This is a special occasion restaurant for sure as the view in unbelievable, the service impeccable!!!! Our maitre 'd was Constantin~ and set the pace for our dinner as we did have Show tix later, offered a quicker route how to walk there all without being stuffy! I will request his station upon our next visit, Just perfection in his over 6ft frame a true professional~
