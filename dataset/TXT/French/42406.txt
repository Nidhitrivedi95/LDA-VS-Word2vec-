lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA I will start by saying I had the steak and it was very good, but it does not make up for the very poor service. Only two other tables of customers in the entire restaurant and yet service was incredibly slow. Cold bread, disappeared for a long time after we arrived so we didn't order for a while, and very inattentive. At the end, I was charged for 3 cokes because I had gotten two refills. Was not told refills were not free, and I find it very unusual to have to pay for refills unless explicitly told (soda prices are not even listed on menu). When I asked the waiter about it he was VERY rude--said refills might be free somewhere like McDonalds, but they are not so at nice restaurants. I have never once been charged for a refill at a very nice restaurant without being told, and having to pay is an anomaly. I certainly didn't appreciate the rude way he told me, especially after such a slow and unhelpful service. Will not be returning.
