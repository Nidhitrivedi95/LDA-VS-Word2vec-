SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I wish I could give a higher rating, but our waitress almost never checked in on us and left us waiting forever for the bill, long after the buser had cleared our plates. 
The food was excellent, so a solid 3 stars and hopefully next time the service is better.The outdoor patio is also lovely.
