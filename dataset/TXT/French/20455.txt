AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Came here for a quick breakfast before checking out at ceasar's. It's located right across Mr. Chow and Bacchanal buffet. We ordered the cheese danish and egg and salmon breakfast sandwich. The cheese Danish was very light and flaky, which I really liked. However, I would probably come back again for the salmon and egg breakfast sandwich! Although it was $14, it was so buttery and the salmon with creamy cheese made for a delicious breakfast.
