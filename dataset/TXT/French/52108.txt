pmrHuQiy25xKB86tbOLBlA Went here for my fiancee's birthday dinner recently!  I was so excited to give this place a try.  Locally owned, right down the street and somewhere we had never been before!  When we got there, the waitress seated us at a table near a window.  There were only about 10-12 tables in the whole restaurant and I was actually surprised at how many people there were.  It happened to be 1/2 off bottles of wine night so we ordered one of those.  There were two servers both of whom were very sweet and accommodating. 

We started with a featured watermelon and arugula salad, which was really good.  For dinner, I had the steak and my fiancee had the featured dish (a grouper with a saffron couscous i believe).  The first time my steak was over cooked, but they fixed it and sent back out a better medium rare.  Everything had a good flavor, but what was the most disappointing was the prices for this type of food.  We spent 100 dollars on a bottle of wine, a featured fish dish, one salad, and a steak.  If it had been a filet or some other cut of beef, it would have been a little more reasonable to ask people to pay 24 dollars, but this was an 8 ounce skirt steak.  I just don't see the value in that.  If this were a little more reasonably priced, this would be somewhere we would frequent a lot.  I think they also get most of their vegetables from the farmers market across the street, which is nice.  

It was just a bit disappointing.  For the price, there are plenty more locally owned places with the similar feel to them.
