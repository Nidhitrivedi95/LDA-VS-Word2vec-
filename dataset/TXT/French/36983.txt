in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ My family and I had just landed from the East Coast and were looking for a delicious bite in Phoenix. We saw Vincent's was listed as a good brunch spot so we headed over. We were overwhelmed with how amazing the food and service were. It was a meal that no one in my family will forget! Our waiter was fantastic and so gracious. The croissants are to die for! They were warm, buttery, and served with a scrumptious fresh strawberry jam. We had the homemade pesto pasta with chicken, eggs florentine, crab cakes, and the ratatouille omelette. Each dish was made to perfection and clearly made fresh for us. To top it all off to celebrate the new year we received 5 complimentary desserts, each one different and better than the next. I wish I lived in Phoenix just so I could visit this establishment regularly! Definitely worth going back to!
