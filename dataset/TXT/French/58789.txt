rSiSZlTzHi4Ox_rFHe9CdA If you quiero tacos around the Yonge and Bloor area, stop in at the Taqueria!

I have to say, I don't miss the Spring Rolls Express that used to be at this location at all!  

The space is newly renovated with faux wood and cork board.  It's bright and comfortable with lots and lots of seating.  The specials are scrawled on a chalkboard with the catch of the day.  There are old school tunes playing in the background.  It's like a takeout version of a fancy taco eatery without the hype and line up.

They had a lot of options!
Chicken, steak, carnitas, barbacoa, fish, shrimp, and vegetarian.
And served up as a taco, burrito, taco bowl, salad, or nacho platter... whatever your Mexican fast-food craving desires.

I thought about getting tacos, but I was starving.
I ordered a burrito and as usual, I was very particular about the toppings.
They were friendly and told me it was fresh to order (no eye rolling or anything!)

I ordered the halibut with sauteed veggies, lettuce, and guacamole for a bit more.  Then I asked for a whole wheat tortilla, no rice, no beans, no sauce, and no sour cream, but cheese is okay ($11).  I liked that they have corn salsa. Corn salsa is underrated.

I glanced around and the nacho platters looked freaking delicious.
The soft tacos were popular as well.
An order of tacos is $9 and you get three of them.

I took my burrito home and it was just the way I asked.
The fish was moist and lightly battered and fried.
Lots of veggies. Everything was fresh and very enjoyable.
I'll be back, maybe to try some soft tacos!
