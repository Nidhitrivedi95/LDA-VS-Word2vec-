4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Been here twice; one for dinner and one for Brunch.  The dinner was ok, nothing memorable but the brunch was a bomb.  

Came there on a Saturday around 1:30pm.  The patio seats were full.  Since I don't like the sun, indoor seating was totally fine for me.

I had Fresh Toast with Whipped Cream and it was so good........amazing!

My friend had the corned beef hash and poached egg.  The portion was great and tasted very good too.  

We also got the Orange Chocolate Chips Muffin.  Again it was perfect.  Not overly sweet.

The (free) french bread was very good!  Fresh and warm.  My friend and I finished the whole bread in 5 minutes..............

The service was excellent too.  Everyone was friendly, attentive and polite.  

I can't wait to go back again!!!!!!!
