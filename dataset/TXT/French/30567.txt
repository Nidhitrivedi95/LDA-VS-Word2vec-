I love curry, so I ordered the kedgeree - it is a decent-portioned, richly flavoured curry rice with chunks of soft boiled egg, fish, and cherry tomatoes. This thoughtful combination worked like a charm.
My friend who started off with their infamous scone swore it was the best she ever had. Others at my table ordered the French toast, and scrambled eggs with charred salmon. We all enjoyed our food, will definitely visit again!
