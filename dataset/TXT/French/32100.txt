gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I had my birthday celebration here with my girl friends. Alize has been on my yelp bookmark for long time. Since I am big fan of Andre. I had high expectation on Andre's sister restaurant, Alize. 

View from Alize was spectacular! (better than mix) Our group pictures came out awesome because of this great view. I sampled all dishes my girls ordered. Everything was pretty good especially pan seared foie gras, roasted pork belly and lamb chop. (I have to say I think seared foie gras at Andre is slightly better)

I am not going to details about our dishes. I want to talk about service here.  My girls got me a custom fondant cake with big pink bow on top. Alize charged $8 per piece as slicing fee. They also decorated each piece of cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I thought that was wonderful. There are some places on strip charge same price but don't give you anything extra! We split our bill to 6 bills at end. Our waiter didn't give us any problems. It was such a great group dinning experience at a fancy restaurant.
