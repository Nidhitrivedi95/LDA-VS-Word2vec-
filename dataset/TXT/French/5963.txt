3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ This is one of my favorite spots to eat, I actually ate here for lunch and dinner yesterday! Lunch was great, I got the Chicken mac and cheese. It wasn't as creamy as usual but it was still delicious. Then for dinner, me and a couple friends ordered for take out. We called, picked it up and by the time we got back home (two minutes away from the store) the food was all completely cold. Kinda a bummer since it is usually so good. We called and the manager comped us the meal, which was really nice. I'll be back of course, maybe just more so to dine in!
