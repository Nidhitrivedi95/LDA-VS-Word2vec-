d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q OMG... it's a clean place with an outstanding menu and amazing food!

Their beef wellington was perfect - totally perfect. flakey crust, tender tenderloin, I had to force myself to NOT eat so fast so I could enjoy it. One of the best dishes I've had in Vegas, they also have a delicious scallops and lobster risotto. Yes this menu sounds more of what you would find on the menu of Hell's Kitchen, but here you're guaranteed to get served. 

The servers are very attentive and were patient as I drooled on the menu while deciding where to start.

I'll be making this my "fancy" dinner night more often when I'm working in Vegas!

Enjoy!
