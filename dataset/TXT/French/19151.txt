aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg I like Chez L'Epicier and it is a nice place to go for tasty food. Cute presentation of food on the dish too. Nice atmosphere. 

Great place to order lots of dishes and eat. Portions are small so order a lot if you are hungry. It is best if you sample just about everything on the menu to get a sense of the full range of flavors here. Oh yes, once they had a Peach Mojito that was very tasty.
