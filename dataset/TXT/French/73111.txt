xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag I'm a vegetarian and normally prefer hole-in-the-wall ethnic restaurants, but I was in Montreal, so wanted to eat French. But I know French food is not generally vegetarian friendly, so searched for one that was and chose this one for that reason and because folks seem to love it. But I didn't. 

I started with a tomato salad, the only non-meat appetizer of any sort. It was pretty good, especially the herbs sprinkled throughout, but they served it on a small cutting board for some reason, which was just plain stupid. I had to try extra hard not to have it fall into my lap or get balsamic vinegar everywhere.

There were three vegetarian entrees -- a pasta, a vegetable plate, and a tomato tart. The tart sounded most interesting and French, so I ordered that. It took forever to come and when it did it looked like some poorly executed "artisinal" pizza you'd get at a mall Italian restaurant trying to go uptown. It tasted better than that, but not by much. It wasn't a tart as I'd define one. It was a piece of poorly done crust, with some tomatoes and cheese, and a few greens, thrown on top, and probably put in the broiler for a minute.

Shortly before my tart came, the restaurant sat another couple right beside me with only about a foot separating our tables even though the restaurant was mostly empty. It made the rest of the night uncomfortable for me as a solo diner. I doubt the couple liked it either. When I finished my meal, I asked for my check, waited forever, read about 20 pages of a book without anyone paying any attention to me, and then had to flag someone down to ask again.

The music -- early Stones and T-Rex -- was the best part of the restaurant, which is pretty sad.
