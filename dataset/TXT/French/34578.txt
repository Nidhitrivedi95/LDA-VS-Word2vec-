HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ If you are looking for an amazing view while having dinner, than this is the best place. Make sure to taco early with request for patio. The food was good, nothing to brag about, but the view is what sets this place apart. In addition, they have a great wine selection. Go early and hang out at skyfalll lounge adjacent to the restaurant.
