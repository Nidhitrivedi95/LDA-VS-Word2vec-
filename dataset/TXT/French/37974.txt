We tried the lamb meatballs and calamari, which were both great! I also had the pancetta maple salad, which sounds amazing but was disappointing. I had the filet au poivre for dinner, which was good but served with some sweet potato casserole thingy that I could have done without. Dessert was chocolate cheesecake, which was rich and delicious. 

I loved the esthetic of the place, and can see myself coming back for drinks. 

Tip: We went on a Tuesday and were that it was ok told to park in the valet zone on Random Road since they didn't have valet service that night.
