or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I used to love this place, but it has really gone downhill. We went here tonight to celebrate our anniversary and birthday, which we made reservations for earlier. I ordered the salmon, which was overcooked (I had to use a knife to cut it) and smelled extremely fishy. My husband ordered the scallops, which were okay. He ordered an iced tea and never received one refill, even after asking 3 different staff members. We made reservations and you would think they would even mention happy birthday or happy anniversary, but not one comment. When we left no one said have a good night or anything. Not a friendly environment and the food was less than mediocre. Not that it mattered to them, they didn't even come by our table to ask how it was. Our server took our order and that's it, he was gone the entire time. Just a total lack of common courtesy and is sad that this establishment lost its charm.
