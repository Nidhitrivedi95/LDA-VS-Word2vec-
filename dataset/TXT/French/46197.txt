myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ I've been twice and the food has been consistently excellent. The sweet potato fries, the burgers (and no fuss if you order it without a bun!). The chocolate-peanut butter milkshake (whoohoo!). Wine list is meh, but that is not why you go here. 

This is a "hidden gem" - it should be packed for the quality of food and great service it offers.

"I'll be back!" :D

p.s.
They do take-out and you can order online!
