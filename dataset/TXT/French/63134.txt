SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA My favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I've been here 5 or 6 times and have never been disappointed. 

Best dishes:
Escargot - So rich and buttery
Cassoulet - Get this for sure. It's basically a sampler dish of several of the entrees: Lamb Shoulder, Rabbit Sausage, Duck Confit and Pork Belly all in one dish!!
