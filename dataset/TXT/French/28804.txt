eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw One of the nicer dining experiences of my life.  The food is excellent, the decor (and location) is unbeatable, and my waiter was both knowledgeable and an absolute gentleman.

I think locals will tell you this place is, um, touristy, and there is better French cuisine elsewhere in the city (probably true), but I think it's impossible to leave this place feeling disappointed.  To me, that's worthy of five stars.
