bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog What started out as a torrential downpour Friday evening, it thankfully cleared up by 7pm just in time for our 8pm reservation.  In the heart of small Baldwin Village Bodega was a first time for all of us!  Dim, intimate, and classy Bodega is a hidden gem in this victorian style house.  The beautiful decor, crystal white table clothes, comfy seating, and ambience is the perfect setting for a beautiful evening.  Summerlicious menu had some great choices and here's my review!!

escargot and sweetbreads 5/5
fusilli, pommery mustard, brandy, tomato, and cream!!
Ive always wanted to try Escargot! and I'm glad I ordered it.  Perfect melody of flavors from the pommery mustard, cream, and brandy made this dish! and added some added flavor to the escargot! The fusilli was a nice addition to the dish, much like a mini pasta salad!

grilled alberta flat iron steak  4.5/5
shallot butter and frites: Cooked to perfection....MEDIUM!.  Tender, and full of flavor! and as always a little butter goes a long way.  The homemade frites were so delish! a plate alone would have been yum....actually... an extra side order!

strawberry rhubarb tart with whipped cream 5/5
Wish I could have ordered a second serving!!! sort melt-in-your-mouth!....simply yum. 

The service at first was a bit slow, but later on picked up his slack!! nonetheless a gem that I will definitely be visiting soon!
