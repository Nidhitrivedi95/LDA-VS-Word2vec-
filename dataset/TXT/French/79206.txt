ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw We came for the Monday half-off wine special, and stayed for everything else. Excellent service and excellent food, from the lip-puckeringly spicy Caesars (the Canadian cousin to the Bloody Mary), served with an optional oyster, to the locally-smoked trout and creamy risotto, and all of it topped off with a satisfying local coffee and a slice of pumpkin cheesecake. 

We were impressed to learn that the chef brings in stuff from his own farm, upping the freshness factor, but perhaps equally impressive is his curation of other local goods, like the locally-caught fish and Scotch Mountain Meats. As out-of-towners, it was a treat to be able to sample all that Toronto's food-growing region has to offer during the fall season, in such a lovely, comfortable setting.
