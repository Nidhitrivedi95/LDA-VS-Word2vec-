v50-nvBCZNf7nCNbyUlQLw These guys are not trying to reinvent the proverbial wheel- they serve up solid crepes and a darn good latte. They serve it quickly, at a moderate price, and the staff are friendly and will remember you the next time you come. The last time I was there was with a friend with a baby- without asking, a staff person came over and brought a high seat when she saw my friend struggling. that's kind service.
