There is a one page menu featuring the standard French fare. There was an effort to use unique ingredients such as fiddleheads (in the middle of May?) and sea urchin, as well as cheese and beef from PEI. Bring your own bottles of wine.

Food: The food is above average. I ordered the octopus appetizer. It was grilled perfectly and presented beautifully on the plate. The entre I ordered was bison ribs. I had to send it back to the kitchen. The brick-heavy lump I was presented with was a tough hunk of meat. Like chewing a baseball. I complained that it was overcooked but the waitress corrected me to say it was actually not cooked long enough. Either way, it was inedible so they graciously replaced it with the duck which was perfect. For dessert I tried both the chocolate torte and creme brule. The chocolate was not too sweet and I would recommend this dish.
Service: Our waitress frequently rolled her eyes at customers within our view when other tables asked questions about the menu, or made requests. My dinner companion reminded her of a forgotten order which resulted in more eye rolling. I felt this disdain of customer requests and questions was not acceptable or appropriate.
Pricing: Generally a good value. The menu items are priced well at approx $15 for appetizers, $29 for entres. I tipped 15% but as we were leaving, the waitress pulled me aside from my group and implored me to give her a higher tip. I interpreted this to mean she wanted me to include the undercooked entre returned to the kitchen. Being flustered and non confrontational, I paid for both entres.
Ambiance: One of the best things about this restaurant is the openness of the space. It is clean, modern, and simple with plenty of natural light.
