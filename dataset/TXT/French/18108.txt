A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I must be a snob when it comes to bakeries, because I wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be. They had a beautiful selection of cakes, pastries and macaroons but unfortunately not much caught my eye. I did however love the plain and chocolate croissants and my boyfriend loved the two pieces of chocolate cake. I would have loved a bigger selection though. There was almost an entire cold case filled with macaroons, and for someone who doesn't much like them, I wish there had been more pastries and cookies.
