UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ Really enjoyed this place, waiter was very nice and knowledgable. I had the smoked elk carpaccio, very good. For desert I tried the semifreddo, wow and the presentation was amazing. My first impression of Woods was very positive, I would go back for another meal and explore the menu.
