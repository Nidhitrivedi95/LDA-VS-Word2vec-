Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Have you ever watched No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain? Do you remember how he talks about eating in amazing restaurants where the chef is stressing over the quality of the meat cut, the heat of the pan, and the placement of the sides? You know how he talks with respect about food? MIX is what he is talking about.

The food was amazing. Well planned prix fixe menu. Trust the chef, try something new. Drink wine, avoid coke.

Also, expect to drop about $100 per person.

Enough about the food, lets talk about the view - breath-taking. 64 stories up and looking up the Las Vegas Strip. It does not get any better than this.

Overall, it's an impressive restaurant in an impressive location, that will leave you...impressed.
