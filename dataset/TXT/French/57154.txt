rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came for a celebration dinner with my fiance.  Many previous reviews have covered the details. We enjoyed the dozen oysters (sooo silky smooth),roasted leg of lamb and salmon along with a half bottle of chardonnay.  yum!!!!  

I liked the laid back atmosphere and the service was good.  Looking forward to trying another Thomas Keller restaurant next time we are back in town.
