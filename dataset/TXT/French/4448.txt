We wanted to eat characteristically canadian french on our visit and were looking for a delicious lunch. A casual, but elegant restaurant, this place fit the bill. With your meal, you get complimentary cornichons, tart and crunchy, along with warm, well-made french bread. 

Here is what we ate:

Soupe Poisson (fish soup) - thick & flavorful, with a creamy tomato base that complements the seafood flavors, it comes with a side of cheese crusted toast; photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluepupae/3139323889/in/set-72157611620272667/

Brandade - a salty fish & potato puree dip that is great with bread; photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluepupae/3139324637/in/set-72157611620272667/

Country Soup - a hearty vegetable soup with clear broth with lots of flavor, warmth and is good for you too; photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluepupae/3139324939/in/set-72157611620272667/

Crème Caramel à L'orange -  a flan-like custard in a sweet, light caramel with hints of citrus

Chocolate Tart - rich, dark chocolate; like eating a tart made of truffles

The waitstaff was friendly and not annoyed we spoke english. Then standard menu offers translations in six different languages, and our waitress helped with the specials, which are on an insert.
