QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg First I would say it's my fault for not seeing that it was a "bistro" which is a upscale (in pricing only) bar.  There was a TV blaring and tons of kids running around.  I wouldn't mind but the manager was moving (screeching) tables/chairs as he was setting  up for jazz singer (why does it take one hour to do this?).  I was more mad when my drink came and it was tiny AND water down!  Yeah that's right!  Serious accusation but I take my first drink neat for this very reason (see photo).  Feeling cheated and after a cursory glance around I quickly canceled my food order.  We didn't get bread until after the third patron who sat down asked (and then the waitress realized that she forgot all of us).  My hubby got the steak which admittedly was perfectly cooked but was absolutely nothing special.  The other positive note is that the waitress was very pleasant.  I would never recommend this place for the value of food, drinks and experience - it's all geared to cheat tourists.
