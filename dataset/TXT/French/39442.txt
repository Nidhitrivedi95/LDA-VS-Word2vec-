jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw Stumbled into this place with the intention of grabbing some coffee. But was surprised to see that this isn't just a cafe; it's a restaurant and pastry shop all in one! After all, they do call themselves French Mediterranean fusion, can't expect anything less! 

Decided to try the shrimp and lobster pita, and boy was it good! The salads also looked amazing, and were pleasantly unusual for a cafe. They have seat trout salad, tuna Niçoise salad, among others. All of them looked amazing and I can't wait to try them.

A gem in the area! 5 stars. Great food, good service, and oh..... Did I mention the washrooms are super clean and classy?
