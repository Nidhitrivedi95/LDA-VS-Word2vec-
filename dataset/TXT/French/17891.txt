A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I come here frequently for macarons.  The shells are not the type that you're used to, but it still tastes awesome.  My favorite are the salted caramel macarons, but every single macaron flavor I've tried were awesome.  

The prices for macarons are reasonable: $1.10.  If you go to Whole Foods, they're $1.50 (and Whole Foods macarons suck).  Other bakeries will charge you atleast $2.00 or more.  

I had their mini baguette as well for a $1.00  Tastes freshly made that day.  Better than other french bakeries I've been to.

If you venture further in the back, you can get sandwiches and coffees and teas.  Probably good for breakfast and lunch.  I haven't tried anything there yet, but I will next time. I've only tried the pastries and desserts. 

You can't go wrong with Patisserie Manon.
