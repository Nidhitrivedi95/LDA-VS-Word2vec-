V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ We stopped here for breakfast today, ordered 3 different savory items (the croque Monsieur, the ham and cheese croissant with a delicious bechamel sauce and the ham and cheese quiche which was a hit with my 2 toddlers) and 4 sweet ones (French donuts, almond croissant and the pastry of the day) and every single one was absolutely delicious. We also ordered 2 cappuccinos that were really good The customer service was great, the lady behind the counter was very knowledgeable on all the pastries and she was super nice.
