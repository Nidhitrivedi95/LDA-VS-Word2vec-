rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had some family in town visiting, so we decided to do a weekend staycation on the Strip.  The only request for specialty food was something French.  We settled on Bouchon as it was an easy walk from where we were staying.  

First of all, the atmosphere is great.  Quiet enough to have a private conversation at the table but not so quiet that you feel like you're in a library.  The service was excellent.  I had a hard time deciding what to order (everything sounded so good!), and our waiter made great recommendations (he also picked out some cheeses for us for appetizers).  I ended up getting the trout amandine; it was fabulous.  So soft and buttery, it melted in my mouth.  Other dishes ordered were the mussels and fries (mussels were amazing!), and one of the specials; pork chop-- everything was so tastey!

We had a great dining experience and everyone in the restaurant seemed to be having a good time!
