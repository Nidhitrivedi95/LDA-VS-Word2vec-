rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My wife and I came bouchon for a quick bite to eat. We ordered the petite seafood platter with lobster 4 different types of oysters mussels strip and clam. Everything was great except for the clams...they hadn't been pried open, and the server brought crab leg crackers to aide in cracking them open. It was a big failure...if you order anything with clams make sure you have them opened prior to arriving at your table.
