SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Food is good, but the menu rarely changes. It hasn't progressed as well as other restaurants in the area. Although they have added more side options to lunch which is great. The service is extremely slow. Expect to be there for a long time so it's not a great place for a quick lunch. Hostesses were extremely rude and unpleasant. They seemed to be put out that we had an extra person in our dining party. The service was also horrible for a large party we had one night. Very slow in refilling waters etc and flank steaks were all over cooked. This place needs better management.
