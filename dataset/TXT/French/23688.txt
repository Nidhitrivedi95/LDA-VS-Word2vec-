cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Just not worth it. There are so many better restaurants in Montreal.
Nothing went well. 
We were told that No table available at reserved time, even though there were several obviously empty.  We were offer seats at the bar. I suspect that we were given these as we were from out of town. The hostess thought that I could not understand French.
The waiter ignored us for 15 minutes before taking our order. She delayed entering the order so our food was further delayed. The head chef who was working the line directly in front of us apologized for the delay.
Then there is the food.  Read the other reviews carefully. Heavy flavors that are totally unbalanced.
1-star is awarded for the excellent wine list.
Go elsewhere.
