1j9BbuiaVYQWyXyUjb3rHg So I decided to give this West end Bistro try.. I was very surprised.  The food was fantastic and I just happened to drop in on their buck a shuck night(Fridays after 8pm). Had the Steak frites .. they use a Bavette cut that is more flavourful that the typical top Serling that others use. Also the portions are generous  and the service is fantastic. Will repeat because I want to try everything on the menu. It's so far a hidden gem but it will sure be on everyone's to try list soon.
