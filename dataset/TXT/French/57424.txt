rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I'm a Thomas Keller fan. I've been to Bouchon in Beverly Hills and thought it was great.  However, my party and I had an eminently forgettable experience at the Venetian location.

The food was sub-par.  I ordered the rib-eye and it came out dry and overcooked.  Everyone else poked at their food as well.

Worst of all though, was the service.  The waiter was rude and literally talked back to the guy paying the bill for the rest of us.  His tip was representative of his behavior.

Both Thomas Keller and the Venetian are better than this restaurant.  Many other more memorable places to eat in Las Vegas.  Try any one of them but leave Bouchon off the list.
