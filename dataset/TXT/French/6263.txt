4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg Am I the only one who doesn't get it?  I thought it was kinda weird...First of all, the service and atmosphere were great.  And the meal itself was a lot of fun.  I liked the cheese ok, but I got tired of it pretty quick.  How many items do you want to try covered in melted cheese?  The salad was good.  But the main dish was a big disappointment.  I got the meat selection.  You basically end up with boiled steak and chicken.  It wasn't good at all.  The dipping sauces were good, but if you're dipping boiled steak in it, it doesn't matter that much.  And the potatoes weren't good - you ended up with a chunk of boiled potato.  Who wants to eat that?   Dessert was good.  I just dipped the strawberries and bananas, and they were great.  But I am not a big sweets person and didn't want all that sweet stuff.  For the price, I won't go back.
