O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Getting better and better.  During the last downturn, noticed a change in quality and service.  But their current service staff and kitchen staff are producing some of the best consistent quality of food and beverage in Vegas.  Brunch is a must.  Have had dinner only twice, and very good.  Brunch rules, maybe better than Bouchon, which I'm sure is one of the best in Las Vegas.  Vast cheese selection, numerous brunch and lunch selections.  Food the last three times have been exceptional.  Service is wonderful, staff is warm and friendly which add to the whole experience.  Not rushed, so if your in a rush, tell them your timeline.
