4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We've been here a few times and are never disappointed. This time, we went for breakfast. The service is usually pretty good, but this time, it was exceptional, and our server was very nice and energetic (understatement).

The food was very good. I had the corned beef hash and poached eggs. Depending on how much you eat though, the portions may be somewhat small. In addition to our main dishes, my wife and i shared an apple cinnamon waffle, or was it carmelized apple waffle, i dont remember. What i do remember is the apples tasted great and the waffle itself was so good. 

For our other meals here, we've always had lunch or dinner, and always opt for the steak frites. Food was very good and at a reasonable price, especially for vegas. Add that you even get an amazing view.
