zra20XPGVL9P3i5hMoKjig I came here with a friend for lunch and was really excited to see that it was $5 bubbles Friday! We were alone with the exception of another party of two. We were welcomed when we walked in the door but it took quite a while after we sat down to get a drink order. We ordered the cheeseboard to start and each of us had a bubbly. The drinks took a really long time. I would have been overjoyed to have water until the champagne could arrive. The cheese board had some really good cheese on it but aside from the long bread sticks there was one graham cracker, split in half. We ended up asking for some more of the bread and olive oil so we could have something to eat it with. It wasn't all cheese that could be eaten as a slice, some was crumbly and some creamy so it felt slightly awkward to eat with an almond or a blueberry but they were all good. After our cheese board came out, we didn't see the waitress again until I was annoyed enough to ask for the check. I wanted to order one of the homemade pasta dishes. When she did come over she asked if we would like more to drink and in my head I thought...20 minutes ago. I asked for the check and we had lunch elsewhere. Too bad because the ambiance was great and I bet the pasta would have been really good.
