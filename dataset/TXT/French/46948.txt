nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA Just had a wonderful meal at the black pig. Our waitress was knowledgeable and helpful, all of her recommendations were wonderful. We had the full charcuturie board, the duck confit appetizer, the bon mi, and the house sausage. All of these things were great. Additionally, they have some great cocktails.
