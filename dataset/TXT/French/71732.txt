xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw Decided to choose this spot to host a brunch with some friends as it was local and listed as a brunch spot. 

Place is okay looking in its decor, nothing fancy.. Menu was very small in its selection. Waitresses seemed lost and or lost in trying to make small talk. They were very polite though, just didn't seem like they knew how to make small talk. 

They were not attentive at all.. we had to wait for everything... drinks, our food and our bill. They never checked in on us while we were eating. This was a group of twelve so we definitely needed checking in on..

Let's get to the food, I did not enjoy my food at all. I ordered a apricot salad with a chicken breast., my chicken breast was one third of an average chicken breast. The salad was lacking in flavour and I only received one piece of tomato. It was terrible.

The other girls seemed to like their food but they said that their was nothing special about it. The salmon that my friend ordered that's in the picture only ate the top of it and left the rest.

I ordered a cranberry juice and asked for it with ice but received no ice. I'm really easygoing so I didn't complain. For me the two stars was because of the lack of attentiveness and lack of flavour in the food.

Food needs and facelift as the dishes are very dead in their presentation and flavour.


I would not come back here again..
