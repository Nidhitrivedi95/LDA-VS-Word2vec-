SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Service was exceptional. Our hostess Caroline was a delight. The sommeliers did a great job of suggesting pairings. 

The charcuterie platter was awesome. it came with housemade chicken sausage, chicken liver pate, pork pate, paper thin proscuitto, garlic toast points.

The goat cheese tart was okay. the french toast was okay (i felt it was over hyped).

The servers kept replenishing the breads. 

ended with a chocolate neapolitan, creme caramel.

the restaurant has a super nice feel to it. parking is available in front.
