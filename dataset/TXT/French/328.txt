-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Always a stress eliminator going to The House.  I've been to The House a couple times now, for dinner and brunch.  It's now my favorite restaurant in Old Town.  One just feels taken care of there.  The ambiance is comfortable and classicly elegant, every one of the staff act like they just genuinely want you to enjoy your time there.  The menu isn't intimidating but is still elegant and fun at the same time, and the food and wine are all excellent.  

We still haven't tried the patio, but I'm looking forward to that as soon as the weather allows.

It is fairly expensive for dinner, but their brunch is a great value.  Brunch entrees are roughly $15 a plate, they have $15 bottomless mimosas and HALF OFF all bottles of wine.
