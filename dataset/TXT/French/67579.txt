UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Pretty floors, displays don't make up for a hot chocolate that even McDonald's can do better. This review is for their take out bakery section. For $5.50 maybe I'm insane for buying it but I expected it to be good. It was too milky with not enough chocolate and it was warm. It was like Lukewarm milk dusted with coco. Ummm NO! It was definitely not 'hot chocolate'. So not worth $5.50.

I've had hot chocolate from cheap and expensive places (mainly in Europe)and places which use real melted chocolate with nice warm milk.  We purchased 4 hot chocolates and they were all the same--- not good.  While this gave the familiarity of European patisseries, the service and hot chocolate was incredibly underwhelming. 

More over a rude cashier with horrible customer service. I was very displeased I was ready to complain but didn't want to create a scene during the holiday season about my experience. I don't care how busy you are the quality of the product must be good if it's pricey.
