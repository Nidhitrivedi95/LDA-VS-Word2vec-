O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Really disappointed.  I came to Morels to have a great steak and was sadly disappointed.  Although the fondue appetizer was excellent, the steak I ordered (a $67 filet minion) came out cold.  Ice cold. Like it was in a refrigerator..... cold.  Weird. When I reordered the steak, it came rare (instead of medium as ordered) 20 minutes later. I just don't understand it.  After two swings and two misses I decided to call it quits and asked for my check rather than wait another 20 minutes for another steak.  To make matters worse, the manager didn't come out to say anything, he left the waiter (from another table) explaining and apologizing to me (my waiter had disappeared). Then, when I specifically requested the manager, I waited almost 15 minutes for him to appear.  I think I have a good idea where the problem is here.  Great product, great servers, but really crappy management.  I'm not sure what to say here because I really wanted to like Morels, but there are two things you must do when charging almost $70 for a steak. It must be hot and it must be the right temperature. Also, in a place like this, if a customer has a problem, the manager should be out immediately solving the issue. Morels misses on both of these points. It's clear to me that this manager was not interested in his customers or his team's performance. Very sadly, I give Morels 1 star and advise them to find new management.  I am sincerely disappointed.
