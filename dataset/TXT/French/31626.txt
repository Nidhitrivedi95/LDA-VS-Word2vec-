gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g I did a search on Yelp last night looking for a new place to eat. The first dozen or more places that came up were Mexican, Chinese, pizza, or greasy American cuisine.  I was looking for something healthy and interesting.  Just when I was about to give up on my search and head out to get a salad at Sweet Tomato, I hit "browse more" one more time and finally the perfect place appeared --- Eatt Healthy!!! I read a few reviews, grabbed my husband and we were off.  The food was awesome!  I had scallops and my husband had angus beef. The  scallops were served with a tender & flavorful ravioli and the the steak came with their signature ratatouille rolls. The presentation was colorful and interesting.  The service was a bit slow but it gave me time to visit with my husband and unwind from a stressful week.  I highly recommend "Eatt Healthy".  The portion sizes are adequate and you will have room for dessert -- which are delightful!!
