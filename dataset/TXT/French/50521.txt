I had the Honey Burger and the different flavors exploded in my mouth!!! My friend dish was equally delicious. He ordered the fish burger. The menu is extensive and you can order breakfast all day. What a hidden Las Vegas treat. Will return to show off to our of town guest. Clean place with friendly staff.
