Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Brasserie V is very small and does not take reservations, so expect to wait for a table.  It's more of a bar than a bistro.  Food is fresh and good.  Had an excellent fresh salad, followed by the mussels and fries.  Portions are large.  We shared a salad, and after that, I was unable to finish the mussels.  The fries are great and abundant, and the two of us couldn't finish them.  (My husband chose to share my fries which he liked better,than the boiled potatoes served with his fish.). Earlier in the week, I had the mussels at Graze, and much preferred their interesting broth.  I wanted to like Brasserie V more than I did, because I'm a real fan of locally grown produce.  If they took reservations, I'd give it another try.
