B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA My friend Nancy and I decided to try a place neither one of us had been to, and she recommended Petit Maison.  It is a lovely place, just east of Scottsdale Rd. on Shoeman.
We arrived at 1 p.m., so we missed the lunch crowd and opted to sit outside in the shade to enjoy our 70's degree weather.
Instead of ordering wine by the glass, we decided to order a bottle of a nice French Pinot Noir (reasonable for $40).  Nancy ordered the daily fish special, which was a pan seared dover sole, while the waiter recommended I combine the smoked salmon with the vegetarian sandwich.  Both were delicious.
However, the most pleasant surprise was dessert (which I hardly ordered).  We ordered the beignets (sp?) with chocolate sauce: WOW.  They were freshly prepared and the chocolate sauce was fantastic.  I'll definitely be back.
NOTE:  Parking is available on the street and next door lot, but there is not clear sign.
