XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q The best restaurant experience I've ever had.

The service is perfection, the setting and decor is excellent. But nothing is as important as the amazing food. 

Robuchon is not just about perfection in cooking, or in combining amazing flavors in a harmonious ways. It's about discovering new flavors, by combining ingredients in previously unthought ways, producing tastes which although unprecedented, can be related to previous experiences that diners may have had, thus evoking the "comfort" factor which sometimes can be missed in fine-dining establishments.

Robuchon is about the new, about the perfection in everything that he does, about the rediscovery and the full, complete and total satisfaction of his customers.

This is trully the best.
