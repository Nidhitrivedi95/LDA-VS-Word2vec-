I enjoyed the juicy turkey and my friend ordered chicken, which was perfectly tender and so tasty. The cocktails are super yummy (I had the Zouk) and the server was really helpful. I felt like I escaped Toronto's cold for a few hours and sailed off to the Caribbean. Can't wait to go back, I heard the fish is a must!
