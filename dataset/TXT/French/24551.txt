cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Drool*!

Came here with some girls for one of our bachelorette night dinners out and had such a fun time! Wine, fois gras poutine (omg drool*), duck in a can, special crab salad, carpacciothe tartare, hand rolls and more that i can't even remember now..

The food was so yummy! I cannot pick a favorite! Though actually my least favorite was duck in a can, but i'm glad we tried it! Was a cool experience :) The waitstaff was so nice and helpful, very patient and knowledgeable of the dishes and wines. The place get super busy and packed, but why wouldn't they?

I would definitely come back when i'm in Montreal again!
