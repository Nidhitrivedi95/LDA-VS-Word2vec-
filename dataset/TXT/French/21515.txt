Bc3V5_JEgIDV6ONo2Hcwmg Decided that we were hungry after a movie and went down to Ontario street to have a look around. Looked on Yelp to see what was open and this place came up just as we were passing it, gave it a go by calling and reserving 2 seats.

Service wasn't very fast to get drinks or to get a refill of bread or even our food in that matter. The place was pretty empty for a Friday night but it was nearing the end of the night so maybe that's why.

Appetizers were okay the chèvre for 16 bucks was lacking flavour and salt but the presentation skills was beautiful. The small
Charcuterie platter was okay no mouth watering cold cuts or amazing pate. The beet was the best part. The burger was
Veal and beef very delicious and tender. Homemade fries very good with their own mayo as well. Old fashion 8.90, that's what I like to hear great prices for drinks.
