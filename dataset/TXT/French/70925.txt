xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w Supposedly from Chef Normand Laprise, a big name in mtl cuisine, chef owner of Toqué, and mentor of Martin Picard of Au pied de cochon fame...

pedigree aside, this place was disapointing, i live nearby and have been wanting to go for a while but they are always full...

went there a few weeks ago for brunch, was disapointed. we had duck rillette, potato au gratin, bavette de boeuf and some egg special with cauliflower mash... 

maybe i don't like rillette, because i didn't like this one, the only good thing was the briochy toast that came with it. and i liked the pickles. 

the bavette was a bit overcooked, and dry, it got a little tough to cut through, i asked for medium not well done...

and it's quite pricey too, more style than substance here...

the people are pretty, and nice though :) always nice to be served by beautiful people.
