SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Perfect date place, particularly in summer, on arguably the best patio in town. Every meal here has been best-in-class or very close. Coq au Vin and Pork Osso Buco daily specials are particular favorites; most recently opted for the Root Vegetable Cassoulet, which was also outstanding. Prices are extremely reasonable relative to downtown counterparts. Very few places get absolutely everything right. This is one of them.
