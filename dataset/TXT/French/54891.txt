rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Some great examples of bistro fare, but there were some misses as well. Of course, Bouchon is a bit pricey, but this is Vegas, after all. The seating was nice outdoors, but almost didn't feel like outdoors high on the 10th floor, surrounded by the towers of the Venetian. Nothing like the fabulous vibe and street scene at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris Las Vegas that we experienced the night before. On the other hand, our server Julie was totally charming and professional. Even though the poor girl was working on her birthday (she didn't tell us this, but her coworker did spill). 

We started with fabulous cocktails. A special salad with duck breast and grapefruit was a light and tasty start, but the french onion soup that my partner ordered really wasn't all that impressive, to be honest. We both ordered fish for our main course. I loved the monkfish, though the lobster spaetzle it came with was a bit more chewy than I expected. Also, my partner's salmon was perfectly cooked and delicious, though he didn't care for the lemon couscous on the side. I like it though. He also didn't care that much for the lemon tart, which is made according to chef Thomas Keller's grandma's recipe. I thought it was okay, but I think my own lemon curd tart is more flavorful. I know - I'm biased. On the other hand, I got to experience the ile flottante for dessert. OMG! That was just about the most spectacular dessert I've ever eaten. A delicate meringue cloud floating over a vanilla creme anglaise, drizzled with caramel and almond. It is because of this heavenly dessert that I am more than willing to give Bouchon another chance, despite the inconsistencies mentioned above. Maybe we'll opt for the steak frites next time.
