USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Oh man, this place lives up to its reputation no doubt. My boodle took me to Fig Tree for my birthday. Upon walking in and checking in for our reservation, the hostess immediately wished me a happy birthday, I felt really special... and who doesn't love feeling special?! 

We were seated immediately in a romantic corner of the restaurant. Their homemade focaccia bread is to die for. I ordered the empanadas for dinner. They were crenberry and mushroom empanadas in a pumpkin cream sauce with brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious. The pumpkin sauce added unique fall flavors to the dish. Our service was phenomenal during our dinner.  Although we didn't order dessert, our server brought us a plate with Happy Birthday written in a delicious chocolate sauce (homemade, probably) with two chocolate truffles. 

Overall, everything about Fig Tree is fabulous -- the service, the food, the personal touches. It is pricey, but worth it!
