or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I really am a fan of this place. In a city full of restaurants and relatively high turnover, Zinc has proven its staying power. It can get crazy around lunch time (and the evening for that matter) but if you don't mind getting there soon after they open at 11 you won't need a reservation. 

I've never had anything bad there but I can definitely recommend the grilled basil chicken sandwich. This thing is heaven on earth. Their burgers are also good with a really thick patty of beef and the tuna salad sandwich actually comes out as four miniature open-face sandwiches. Points for presentation and taste. Get an order of fries for the table. They are definitely worth the splurge. 

If you have time to hang out, grab a stool at the big center table. Order some charcuterie and fromage, accompany it with some wine and enjoy the people watching.
