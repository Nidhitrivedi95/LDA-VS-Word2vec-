ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ Excellent food and beautifully redone. Service was very good and we enjoyed the creative menu. Homemade pasta was tender and full of flavor, my date thought the duck was one of the best dishes he's had lately. We are looking forward to eating outside again once the weather improves.
