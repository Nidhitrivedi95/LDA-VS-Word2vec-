YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Expensive, enjoyable meal, where the only positive was the food.  The staff was not particularly well trained, and the ambiance was similar to dining in the middle of a crowded mall.  From my experience, Chef Keller (who was there when I dined) does not attempt wildly creative dishes but attempts to provide the best of simple dishes.  Here, all the dishes are small.  

Fleurtini: red grapefruit vodka cocktail served in a martini glass rimmed with sugar.  Very tasty, I couldn't resist getting 2 for the low price of $30, about what I spent total at Keller's Burger Bar the night before.

Tarte Falmbee: long crispy appetizer cracker with asparagus, onion, bacon, and herbs.  Slight truffle flavor.  Absolutely delicious.  

Salmon: served with horseradish dill sauce.  simple but flavorful.  

Duck Confit: contained a truffle sauce infusion, served in 4 tiny crispy pieces.  Very nice duck flavor, but nothing like the decadence I've had in France.

Wild Mushroom Ragout: not a ragout at all but a pile of a few varying mushrooms covered with black pepper.  As a mushroom fan, I quite liked it.   

fingerling potato puree: very smooth, with a slight truffle flavor and fresh herbs.  Combined well with the mushrooms.  

Affogato: The best affogato I ever had was at Ferrara in Little Italy, NYC.  This may have been better.  They brought out fresh vanilla Bailey's flavored fresh cream and froze it at the table with liquid nitrogen.  Very cool!

I was extremely satisfied with the meal, my last on my Vegas trip, but the price was too much, at about $150 per person, without ordering wine.
