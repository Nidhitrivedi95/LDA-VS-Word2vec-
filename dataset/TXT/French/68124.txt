vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I love Legume and the adjoining Butterjoint (which will also serve Legume's menu).  Ingredients are fresh and creatively combined, the service is good and the drinks are delicious.  The menu is ever changing but some notable items were great salmon, and cauliflower root veg dish. The burger is always delicious and reliable; sometimes I order that when at the bar side after work for happy hour.
