c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA I went here when I was traveling for work. The food quality exceeded expectations and was the best meal I had during my weeklong trip. From the presentation to the food quality - all was meticulously prepared. Further, the atmosphere felt so French! Felt like I was back in France. Highly recommend if you're in the area. The filet was the best choice of the meals we ordered.
