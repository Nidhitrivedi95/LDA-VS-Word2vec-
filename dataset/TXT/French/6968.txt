Had fantastic Escargots here - it's an appetizer but can eat as a meal. They were very fresh and just popped in your mouth. Compared to the Eiffel Tower restaurant above it, this is a very casual place where you can just wander in and grab a table. Of course, during the dinner rush, you'll have to take a number and wait a bit.
