4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw While the Chesnutt Brothers are in town for their Semi-Annual visit, we met up with some friends for dinner at Mon Ami Gabi in Paris Hotel & Casino.   I recommend sitting outside because you'll get a stunning view of the Bellagio Fountain Show and Eiffel Tower hovering over you!  I ordered the fish and it was good but definitely it isn't excellent.  However, the view and people watching experience made up for it.
