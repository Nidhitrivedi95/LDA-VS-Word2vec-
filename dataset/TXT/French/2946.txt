1_3nOM7s9WqnJWTNu2-i8Q Had a wonderful time here, wife and l on vacation for the F1 race, so the city was abuzz with activity and closed down streets for the many festivals nearby.
So because of that, service was a bit slow understandably, our server apologized for that, so no knock there. Prices weren't too overly expensive, as we ordered up a bottle of Moet & Chandon Imperial to go with our fantastic French Onion soup and a cheese plate, salad and a veggie platter. Salad was good as well. Great atmosphere, (we dined al fresco) friendly staff, l recommend this place.
