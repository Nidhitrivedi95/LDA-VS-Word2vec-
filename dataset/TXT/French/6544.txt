4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Wow, what a gem in Vegas! If you're into European cuisine like me, Mon Ami Gabi is a breath of fresh air and a taste of heaven. The moment you walk in, you will smell their amazing baked fresh daily French bread which they bring to you in bread loaf bags. Yes, it's delicious ... their homemade whipped butter and special apple topping will put this bread over the top.

I would highly recommend the Salmon appetizer with creme fraiche as well as the red wine filet mignon. By the time you're done eating many loafs of bread, fish, and steak you will be stuffed and feel like a king. Don't take my word for it though, because you have to try this place for yourself at least once in your life!
