We ordered a nice bottle of red wine and asked the waiter for some recommendations. He suggested the onglet and the chestnut salad as a starter. Both things I probably wouldn't have ordered.

I absolutely loved the chestnut salad. Fantastic! My friend was obsessed with the onglet.

I would love to come back and try a few other things on the menu.
