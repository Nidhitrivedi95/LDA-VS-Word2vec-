jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Andre's Bistro & Bar is a winner!  Count me in as a regular and I have only been there once.  Everything about this restaurant is excellent, from the greeting by Patrick and John  (they are genuinely happy you are there), to the ambience, to the service, and last but not least to  the incredibly delicious and exquisitely prepared food.  We dined there last night which was the first day!  You would never have guessed that because everything was seamless.   The mood is casual with soft lighting.  You can dress up or be casual, it is comfortable either way.  Service is top notch.  Our server, Mike, really knew the menu and made outstanding wine pairings.  The evening started with perfect crunchy French bread and sweet butter.  After that, we enjoyed a Caesar salad that was the real thing...beautiful Romaine leaves, homemade croutons, and dressing with anchovies.  The next course was a stunning preparation of foie gras with thinly sliced cooked apples and a vanilla sauce, which paired beautifully with my champagne.  Our entrees were the salmon with lentils and the hangar steak with green peppercorn sauce and Duck fat fries.  Everything was flavorful and perfectly prepared.  We finished with the lemon tart, something that I have been dreaming of since the days of Andre's on 6th Street.  My dream came true...just as delicious as I remembered.   Andre's is, quite simply, Fabulous!
