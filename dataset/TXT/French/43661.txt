I can see getting cocktails of this quality in NYC for twice the price and without the super welcoming attitude, but I've still never had cocktails this good anywhere else. Our bartender was so friendly and treated us like we were old friends visiting Montreal. She asked for flavors that we liked and would make something outstanding based on our preferences. The bartenders here truly are artists!
