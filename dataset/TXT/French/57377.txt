I had breakfast here a few times. I would highly recommend eating outside for breakfast, before 10am when it's not too hot. They provide an extremely relaxing café style seating area around a fountain adjacent to a small swimming pool. 

As for the food... poached eggs... lox... over a crispy English muffin...  seriously how could you go wrong.  Add some great coffee and fresh from the oven beignets, accompanied with raspberry and Nutella dipping sauce, it makes a perfect way to recharge and get ready for the day.
