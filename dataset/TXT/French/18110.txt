A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Went here for the first time today - and what a surprise.  Loved it!  And, really enjoyed the laid back relaxing setting.  The paintings on the walls made us feel like we were in France.  I had the chocolat croissant and my husband had the chocolat eclair, and 2 coffees.  All I can say is I wanted to continue on and taste the entire pastry case.  And, the coffee was delicious.  Personnel were so polite and very nice.  Next time I am getting the escargot and a quiche!
