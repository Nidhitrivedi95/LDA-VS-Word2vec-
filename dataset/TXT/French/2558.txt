0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I would have given this place 4 stars after my first visit but the past few times that I've been there, the food just doesn't taste the same. My favorite dish was the poached oysters, which was absolutely delicious when I tried it on my fist visit to Picasso. Even that didn't  taste the same, it's was not  poached completely and it had a weird taste to it. We were there with 8 people l, the service was outstanding but the food is just not good for the amour we paid. The stars I gave are for the service, decore(Picasso artwork) and the atmosphere. I don't think I'll ever go back there.
