xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. My boyfriend and I came to celebrate our anniversary. Just as we were finishing our bread at our beautiful window table, we see a cockroach on the window. We immediately flag down our waiter, who fumbles around to find something to kill it but the cockroach runs off. Our waiter then pats me on the back and says, "Don't worry. It won't kill you." Then the restaurant lost power while I was in the bathroom. So when I tried to wash my soapy hands, I couldn't because the faucet sensors weren't working. I asked the bar staff for water to rinse the soap off and after waiting for 15 mins, I just used the water we were drinking. We couldn't order soda or dessert because there was no power. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
