SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Went for brunch on Sunday. Pretty reasonably priced, compared to the dinner menu. 

The restaurant is nice inside. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they wouldn't push together two tables together by the window to accommodate our party. So, we squeezed five settings onto a four-top. The view is just lovely, and the ambiance is nice. I have to say, I was impressed with our waitress. Either she's a veteran, or Sardine just hires excellent staff in general. She was right on top of everything, including topping off our beverages, and making sure that everything was going well, without being overbearing. The only thing more annoying than a server who never comes around is a server who is at the table between every bite!

I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich(which came with radish, cucumber, egg and watercress) and was very pleased. The salmon was very good, and there was a decent portion(in fact, I didn't even finish it). 

*in case you didn't read my man's review...his sister found a bug in her greens. Gross. The waitress was really nice, and swiftly replaced her meal, and of course took it off the tab!

I will definitely go back on a Sunday morning, maybe next time I'll get one of their fruit pastries, which sounded delish!
