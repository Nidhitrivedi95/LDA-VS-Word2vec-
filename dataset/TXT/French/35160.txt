          We frequented here a little while ago with the BYOW crowd(which if you are not a part of, what is your problem?) for an onslaught of all the 'staples'. General Tao, Hunan dumplings, crispy beef, fried spinach, summer rolls, we had a bit of everything and for the most part it was all pretty good and you can't beat the price...except the pad thai...don't get the pad thai. 

       Add the BYO concept and you have the makings for a solid night out with friends tat won't break the bank.
