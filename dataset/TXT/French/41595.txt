After more than a year, here we are, to have a romantic dinner but most important good food (or at least we hoped for that). Seating is available and the atmosphere still pleasant but the pleasure ceased to exist right there. 

Appetizers are still good (especially the tuna tartar). But this time we wanted to have a real dinner and after brief appetizer experience went for the mains. The fresh bread is still there, as is the two-sips tasty soup in a little glass. However:

18$ Bolognese pasta is disastrous, tastes like it's from a can or something. And it's over-spiced on top of that. Bolognese sauce is never very spicy, this is obviously some "fusion". And on top of that the server tried to charge it 25$, explaining that "the version in the menu is a small one". Pure fraud, so he had to go back and put in the correct value. They probably think they can get over it since the clientele is "rich, so they will not care to pay 7$ more".

32$ fish is *extremely* small portion, on a bead of corn (did you just say corn??? Yes, no other vegetables, just the good ol' lousy corn from a can). There were 2 tiny little pieces of scallop as well. It's both half-tasty and laughable at the same time... for 32$ you certainly expect more. At least a hint of a real vegetable.

Ah well... I guess this is the new trend in town - small menus, small portions, and high prices. Gotta pay for the rent, so let's rip off people. Thank you, but I'm going to spend hard earned money somewhere else.
