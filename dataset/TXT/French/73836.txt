xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g You must go like 11:30ish to get a good spot fast... I think we got there like 12:45ish ended up waiting 45 minutes. 

Wait was kind of worth it since I liked our view. 

Food was nothing overly special being that I've had really good foods in NYC...  

Service was great, everything was out promptly. Good place to try.
