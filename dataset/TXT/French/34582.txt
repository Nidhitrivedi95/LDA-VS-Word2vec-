HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ No gimmicks at this approachable French-Italian restaurant with views of the Vegas skyline and thats a good thing. The food is straight forward dont expect molecular gastronomy on the menu or a crazy mixology menu, service is attentive without pretense and prices are reasonable when you realize what exactly youre ordering. 

If youre seeing a show let the server know at the beginning of your dining experience so they can pace your courses appropriately.  If doing the Tasting Menu, which i suggest, give yourself 3 hours and bring someone you can have a conversation with. 

Although the food is great it wasnt anything that raised the bar. It was all perfectly executed and the plates, from the chantrelle risotto to the lemoncello baba dessert were well balanced.  Strong flavor forward dishes that you may get with other cuisines were hard to find here. 

Id be back to try the other side of the menu- the pastas and pizzas to get a more well rounded taste of the menu.
