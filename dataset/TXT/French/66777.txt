UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q We had high hopes based on the simple bistro menu, the lovely ambience and the friendly service. But the food quality is mediocre and overpriced.

We ordered mussels and escargots to start and both were good, not remarkable.

The duck was ok, not very tender, flavour was a bit off. My steak frites had a charred flavour I couldn't shake, not melt in your mouth like the best examples of this dish.

The crepes dessert was the nail in the coffin for me. Crepes should be soft and a little spongey. This was crispy and tough. Really poorly executed.

We got the feeling that they have become lazy from a steady business of visiting tourists and its proximity to local attractions. As locals, we were hoping we would find a regular bistro we could visit regularly. This isn't the place.
