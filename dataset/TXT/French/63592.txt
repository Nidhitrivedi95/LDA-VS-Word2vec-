It feels like you've entered Morocco. As you walk into the restaurant, you're greeted by a staff member and they'll take you into the restaurant. There is soft music playing, dim lighting and Moroccan tents on the sides for the larger groups. Since we were just two people, we were seated on the sides of the large walkway beside the large tents. 

Being my first time trying Moroccan food, I was already in love with the atmosphere. We ordered the Royal Brochette for our appetizer, which includes lamb, chicken, shrimp skewers, Moroccan salsa, and fresh lemon. As for entrees, we ordered the Braised Lamb Shank and the Hargma Beef Cheek. The Braised Lamb Shank consisted of slow cooked lamb, cashews, green zucchini, tomatoes, and saffron rice. The Hargma Beef Cheek consisted of beef cheeks, chickpea ragu, carmelized onions, raisins, and almonds. Everything was very flavourful and the meat was cooked until they were tender.

They make their own hot sauce in house. We asked for hot sauce and they told us it will take a while because they make it on the spot. The hot sauce was very spicy, it is not your typical hot sauce as it was more of a hot pepper flavour in a paste form.

Another thing to note is that there is also a belly dancing performance near 8-9 PM for about 30 minutes. The bellydancer would dance around each table and see if guests would like to dance with her. Many people did and it was a fun time to see. It was very cool to experience as you get another feel into the culture. 

I recommend this restaurant for large parties or dates with your special someone. There were 4-5 birthday celebrations when I went and also a bachelorette party when I was there. This is a great place with a great atmosphere and delicious food. Especially if it's something that is a first experience for both!
