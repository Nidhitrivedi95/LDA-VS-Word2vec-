4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I wanted to love this place but I couldn't. Hoping to start the day with a good breakfast ended up with disappointment. Went with a group of four, ordered the egg Benedict, mushrooms omelet, savory crepe, and  another dish with poached eggs which I forgot the name. All eggs were overcooked, coffee dripped all over the table. With the high rating and beautiful setting, it's sad the basic didn't tackled right.
