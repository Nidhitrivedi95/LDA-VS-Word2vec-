Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA AMAZING! I went to Mix Restaurant and Lounge in June for my sister's bachelorette party. On a crazy whim, I ordered the Pork Chops (I'm not usually a fan of Pork) but it really was the amazing meal ever! The view on top of Mandalay's The Hotel was breath taking, spanning entirely across downtown LV and through the mountainous range!  Check out the view from the lounge's bathroom, it was an unexpected surprise.

The restaurants decor is also very nice; I tend to like simple and artistic aesthetics so this place was definitely easy on the eyes.
