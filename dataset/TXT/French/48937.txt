OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Tartine is fantastic! My husband and I have been here a few times and have always had a great experience and wonderful dishes. The ambiance is perfect for long conversations, and lots of wine:) The place is small, so smaller parties work the best. 

Starting with drinks - even though I typically order wine (they are a wine bar!), the last time I went, I ordered their French Margarita. One of the best margarita's I've had. It's a play on a French Martini with chambord. Their wine list is nice and allows you to order many by the glass. I love whatever French Pinot Noir they have on their menu, nice and light for the summer. 

As for their hors d'oeuvres - all that I've tried have been great - dates, stuffed peppers, tuna crudo. All the salads I've had are nice, and  of a nice size. My husband loves the frisee salad. And of course, their cheese display is delicious. I believe they offer 5 different cheeses, all nice sized portions. 

I'd recommend ordering an appetizer or salad to start and then an entree if you are really hungry. 

Entrees: 
I've never had a tartine (french, open-faced sandwich) but have tried the brisket version and it was definitely tasty! My favorite dish is their chicken - I know it sounds boring, but it was recommended to me over their filet. That's saying something! I believe they only have it during the fall and winter though. The last time I was there, I had the pork tenderloin with blood orange sauce over risotto. Cooked perfectly and really filling! Their scallops, whatever seasonal preparation, are always delicious. 

I typically go for wine for dessert, but I've heard good things about their dessert menu. 

Go on a Tuesday for their half price bottles of wine. But you won't regret going any day of the week!
