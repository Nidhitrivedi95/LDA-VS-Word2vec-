6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q We were recommended to try the Crepe's out here by my hun's parents who raved about it. 

We ordered their Seafood Crepe and the Berries Crepe. Both were nice but not anything to "die for" IMHO. I think I've had better or at least "just as good". The line is long but then again, it seems everywhere you go in Vegas has long lines and so it's worth trying.
