H9pG0BNhqID2MTj8KnY3jQ Places like this are a rarity in Toronto. Absolutely delicious Japanese comfort food, fresh, quality ingredients, prepared in an open kitchen, clean, friendly staff, and all at a very reasonable price. Almost everything is made in house. The desserts we tried were soooo good. Better than most at high end restaurants in my opinion. And again, at a great price. The only downside is that it's a little slow but the food is made with care and it's well worth the wait.
