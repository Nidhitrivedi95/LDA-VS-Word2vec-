B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I've been to Petite Maison four or five times now for lunch, and so far each time the food has been excellent -- EXCELLENT. My only complaint is that I wish there were more of it! No, not the portions -- I mean, I wish their lunch menu could be expanded by just two or three main entrees, so I could have more than just six options to choose from. (Two or three of which are usually salads, and the others are usually sandwiches).

Out of everything I've tried, the Pain Poulet is my favorite (a gourmet chicken salad sandwich). There are so many flavors in it, and the sliced almonds and grapes in the mix provide a satisfying crunch and texture. The Burger Maison is a close second. I don't know _what_ kind of sauce they put on it, but it's heaven.

Ask for a French soda while you're there! They come in fun flavors -- Mandarin Orange, Meyer Lemon, Peppermint, Passion Fruit, Pomegranate -- and are deliciously different from the norm.
