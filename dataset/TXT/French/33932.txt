hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Moved here recently from Austin Texas, and very happy to have visited this wonderful cafe. If you enjoy travel, and like places with an "international vibe," you will probably enjoy this place! Pictures of Paris, French speaking customers, eclectic music tracks ranging from rustic guitar rifts, Spanish vocals, to funky electronic, will bring a smile to your face. It was a bit of journey to find it, as it is tucked away, but well worth the effort. The owner/manager/barista (lol, busy guy!), "Oliver," makes you feel welcome right from the start. The coffee is top-notch, I usually get just plain drip with some cream. On the day I went, they were serving beans roasted by Anchois coffee Co FYI. They serve it in big, warm cups, served to your table. Lastly, the food selection is also fantastic. Great breakfast and lunch options. I had an Egg baguette Panini. Delicioso!

I had to update from five to four after coming here a few more times. The reason is wi-fi. Sadly, the wi-fi here seems particular slow compared to the many coffee shops I've visited. Enough that I have literally been on my way there some mornings and then remembered "oh yeah, I won't be able to work there," and went somewhere else. Usually, I would just switch to my phone's hotspot connection, but that is probably worse! Hopefully, they spring for a better wi-fi.
