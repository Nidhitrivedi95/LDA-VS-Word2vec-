ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug During my current get-away visit to Las Vegas, I dined here 2 days in a row.  This has become my #1 favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The Salad Nicoise is absolutely delicous! It is consistently perfect with the seared tuna and long green beans. The Pinot Noir was an excellent match. Excellent service and delicious meals.  I highly recommend Le Cafe in the Paris Las Vegas!
