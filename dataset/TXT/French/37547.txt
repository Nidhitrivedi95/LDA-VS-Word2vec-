jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ I love this place. I have never had any bad food, and everything new I try typically surpasses my expectations. Dinner is great with something for everyone. The burger is awesome and affordable; their pastas are homemade and spot on; and you can find larger and smaller plates to fit your needs. Brunch is equally satisfying, if not better. The bananas foster is bananas (duh)--not too sweet. The fingerling "home fries" are potatoes toasted in angel tears, so basically I am going to end with that. Do yourself a favor and go.
