Came here to try out their lattes and cappuccinos. It was creamy and delicious. 
+ stars for the decor which reminds me of Parisian cafés.
(Especially the bunny decors :D!!)

They have a salad bar available which I plan on trying later on - also try the Lavender Hot Chocolate, which I've heard good reviews for.
