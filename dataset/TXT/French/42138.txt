KxUczoGoAwkX9mSHwWlUAw Wow.....I am not sure what happened to me......I am a fan of fine dining....but globe just did not impress me...........and it certainly impressed LOTS of people (including George Cloony who fell in love with a waitress there back in 01)............

I had dinner there, both mine and my friend's entries were too salty.........and the restaurant on a Tuesday (I think) night is half empty........so much abt the global recession............didn't hear much music........maybe because we were chatting...........the bar was almost empty...........the light is dim.........I felt guilty there because I felt every one's refraining from spending (hence this hot spot wasn't full) and I was having expensive food while I was abt to be broke too............

I will have to go there again just to make sure I am not fooled by first impression ;-)
