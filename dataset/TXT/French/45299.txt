You definitely get what you pay for, and let me tell you... the BEST mashed potatoes I've ever had were hidden in this colorful gem of a restaurant. 

My 8hr shopping excursion in Vegas was topped with a delicious meal at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. This is another place if you don't know someone (important) you can't get a table here on a Saturday night without reservations. 

Great wine selection from all over the world, decor was fun and romantic at the same time, and service impeccable (again, knowing someone helps) I ordered the tasting menu that started with foie gras and parmesan foam and ended with an array of sorbet. Everything was delicious.

I'm definitely going to be thinking about those mashed potatoes this Thanksgiving.... yum!
