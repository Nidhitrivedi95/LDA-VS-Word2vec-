50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw biff's bistro---come on, i mean calling a place like this biff's.  it sounds more like a name for a greasy spoon diner down the street behind a buillding and maybe some shady characters lurking around

but i digress.

my wife and i are in toronto looking for a place to go to eat.  i haven't had steak tartare for a long time--thats what happens when you live in the states, i guess.  That, and you don't find smelts in new mexico.  so i was an extremely happy camper when we had dinner tonight.  thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  The mushroom soup didnt taste like old musty mushrooms--it was light and tasty.  She had the beef bourguignon and enjoyed that as well.  the chicken liver parfait was light and fluffy, not heavy.  was impressed--and would have made a hell of a sandwich.  

now i have to make sure i get back to toronto sometime so i can get the same old tired dinner--smelts and steak tartare---my version of surf and turf.

but geez,  who in hell names a french bistro biff's??
