4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw When the weather permits, meaning no rain, gusty winds, or over bearing dry desert heat, the patio is the spot to be. We had reservations for noon but because we wanted to sit on the patio, it took an extra 15 minutes or so for a table. I highly suggest waiting for it though. It's a perfect place to rock them loccs or douche bag sunglasses while people watching and enjoying the water show across the way at Bellagio.

I had the French Toast ($11) which was topped with whipped cream and blueberries. Man was this entree' dank! The French Toast was made to perfection and the blueberries definitely complimented it. I may have to go out on a limb here and say it's one of the best French Toasts I have ever grubbed on.

I also sampled the Jumbo Crab Cakes ($15) which I thought was very rich but still very well made. It's not an over whelming dish. Perhaps sharing it as an appetizer would be a good idea.

I didn't sample my other table mate's dishes but I can say that everyone in my party had positive reviews. All of us agreed that everything we ordered was awesome. No complaints on that day.

With all the many years I have been coming to Sin City, I can't believe I have barely experienced Mon Ami Gabi for the first time. I feel somewhat shameful. I've seriously been missing out on some great and affordable French food. I can't comment on their dinner yet but perhaps next time under them city lights. 

Au Revoir!
