0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I loved the art! The food was good, but not Michelin star worthy. 

We settled on the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Each course was good but unfortunately nothing was very memorable. What will be most memorable to me is my trip to the bathroom and no its not what you think! 

While walking to the bathroom I had the opportunity to take the long way around stopping and admiring all the amazing art. Unfortunately, I did get that, "why are staring at us" look while peering through a couple of guests, however they quickly figured out I was either looking at the art, or maybe had an incredibly lazy eye. Oh well.

Also, from just about every seat in the restaurant you could see the water show in the front of Billagio. This was a plus the first and second time, then it became a bit tiresome.
