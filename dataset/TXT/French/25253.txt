Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This whole restaurant is an experience not to be missed. Everything from the ride up to the top of THEhotel to the breathtaking decor to the food. Jaw-droppingly perfect. The hundreds of jumbo blown glass spheres make you feel like you're in a bubbly champagne flute. Clean and gorgeous. My favorite feature of Mandalay Bay, by far.

We really couldn't have spent our last night in Vegas any better way. Service at Mix was impeccable and the food was inarguably divine. Between our table we had the pork belly, ahi tuna, tender tortellini, elbow pasta with guyère and ham, and plump shrimp cocktail. We were even treated to warm vanilla madelines straight from the baking pan along with homemade nutella, all on the house.

Really awesome experience.
