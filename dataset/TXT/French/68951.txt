VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ I do not know how anyone could give them anything other than 5 stars....if I were to take a star away it could be location...everything about the place deserved a better location but after 5 minutes inside my disappointment of venue had totally disappeared.  Also, it says it is French, well it may lean towards French or elegant country French but not your saucy, skimpy and tres expensive French.  As for cost it is just a bit above $$ and worth every cent!!
