Jbl6p9CVkfCB8fWYFd2-Qw Very nice lunches on the patio. Over the course of two visits we had the tagliatelle, the fish tacos, the croque monsieur, the moules frites, the shrimp, clam & mussel pizza and the banh mi. The dishes were well presented but there were a few missteps.  

The fish tacos were weird in that the fish was breaded so it was a bit like eating fish and chips on a tortilla. The pizza was okay but not spectacular. The croque Monsieur a bit greasy and the bread for the banh mi overwhelmed the sandwich. A traditional banh mi is on baguette, not a huge roll.

The service is good and the desserts (at least the ice cream) tasty. 

We suspect the kinks in the dishes can be ironed out as the kitchen gets more experience.
