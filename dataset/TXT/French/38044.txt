JEXasd9XUHFbt_fIdmdK8g Came here for my birthday and it was a nice meal. First off, the cocktails were great - I loved the Pimm's cup. The starters were the stars here. The raw scallop appetizer was by far my favourite dish. We also had the tuna appetizer, described by our server as bomb, and it was incredible. The foie was delicious and accompanied by some jammy fruit and lovely buttery bread. We also had the crab dish, eurobass baked in salted dough and pommes Aligot side. Mains seemed overwhelmingly salty across the board. Finished off with the Ziggy Stardust egg and it was a real treat. Beautiful to look at, fun to break open and delicious to eat! Definitely on the pricier side, but a nice place for a special occasion.
