ByFBnl90Nr2T7UUwoDQ42g My friend recommended this restaurant since she thought it was good...I am a little surprised at that. My boyfriend and I ordered escargot, steak and chicken. Everytime I tried to pick up an escargot, I ended up getting mushroom...it was also in some sort of beef brisket sauce...so the taste of the escargot was beef-y. My steak, I ordered medium...it looked a bit more cooked than I wanted..and for some reason, it tasted of beef sauce again..my boyfriends chicken dish was decent though...but we were looking forward to the other two dishes. 

The decor is classy, no lineup either. And this place allows you to bring your own wine. However, the food hasn't really made an impact on me.
