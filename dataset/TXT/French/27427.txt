dGnjfY3KyeLg-nBQaT3Xqw The Auberge du Dragon Rouge is a very unique place in Montreal. Upon entering the restaurant, I was surprised to noticed that even the clients (for most part) where dressed in medieval clothing and behaving erratic. 

There were people playing great medieval songs and shanties. And every time someone would order a large meal they would screen and bring all the attention to the table. Some of the songs were also drinking games. For example, whenever the bard would sing the month of your birthday, you would be invited to drink whatever you were drinking.

The food is delicious, and almost everything contains boar meat. They have a large selection of beverages, including Mead and alcoholic coffee. 

Those who were willing to drink the "Dragon's Blood" (a mix of alcohol and tabasco) were invited to stand on the table and swear an oath (both English and French) before drinking it. There was also a dance with people that had birthday's that month. 

The only two downsides: People really do get excited and can get pretty loud. This is absolutely not the place for those seeking a calm bar to talk to friends or significant other. Also it can get a little bit expensive. Me and my friends spent around 65 dollars each for the meal and a few drinks. 

The decor of the place is very well done and does look like something out of a museum. In my opinion it is well worthy it. Probably the closest to a medieval tavern experience that you will have in Montreal. 

Note: Oh, by the way. Be sure to reserve ahead of time. It fill up pretty fast and the first time I went there, had to find some other place to eat.
