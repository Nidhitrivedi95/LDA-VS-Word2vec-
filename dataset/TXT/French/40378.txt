KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Excellent place. Nice ambiance once you enter the restaurant. Nice outdoor setting by the lake. Food was terrific. Great selection. Best part from my perspective was the wine selection. Very comprehensive and priced closer to market price rather than outrageous restaurant prices. Allowed us to enjoy our fabulous food with a better than usual wine! I recommend this restaurant highly.
