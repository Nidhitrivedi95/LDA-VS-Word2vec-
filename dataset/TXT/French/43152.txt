lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ + foie gras was awesome.
+ wagyu beef dishes were awesome.
+ decor and service are nice.
+ sommellier was very friendly and helpful on our search for inexpensive wines with dinner.

 - fish was terribly overcooked.  both kinds had the texture of chicken.
 - breads were boring.
 - a bit overpriced compared to similar french meals in sf or nyc.
 - they advised me (non-vegetarian) against their vegetarian menu -- i was hoping they would be proud of it.  it seems like delicious vegetables are currently kind of the hip thing in the food world.

Anyway, i would go again if i could get a taste-of-wynn menu or something and have a foie gras appetizer and beef main course for less than $90.  Otherwise i'll probably spend future vegas dining dollars at bartolotta a-la-carte , wing lei a-la-carte, and any new orleans-type dishes or menus at the country club i can find.

if you are a food nerd who has tried lots of michelin-starred french meals, it is just so-so.

On the other hand, it is a very nice restaurant, in an incredible resort, and good for a rare splurge if you're staying at the Wynn and want to celebrate a very special occasion.
