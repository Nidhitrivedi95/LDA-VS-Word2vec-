u8_7zI8VPgAaoGDdXq--oQ This was the worst service I have ever received at a club. We bought VIP tickets New Year's Eve that were suppose to include our alcohol. We had to wait in line for over 30 minutes when the door people let people buy their way in. Then when we finally get in the bar tenders would not serve anyone who wasn't tipping enough. Bartenders weren't serving us and we were throwing $20 bills on the bar. It is a nice building but it was absolutely disgusting inside and looks nothing like the pictures on the website. I would never go back to this club.
