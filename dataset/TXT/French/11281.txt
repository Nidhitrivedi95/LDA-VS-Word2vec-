4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went here for lunch and the place was packed. I finally found a seat at the bar which I was glad to have. The bartender was wonderful and put up with my obnoxious "surprise me" request for a good drink and did not disappoint! I had the French onion soup and it was one of the best I've ever had. They had it down to a t. If you're looking for a great place to have a meal in Vegas I'd say this is in my top 3 recommendations!
