This used to be an awesome restaurant that had wonderful food. My last experience here was way below par. I ordered a croque Monsieur--A dish I've had several times from them in the past. It was completely dried out and gross. Limp even. 

We waited in line for a long time and then were immediately ignored when it was our turn to order. The people behind the counter were running around in a frantic hurry and it was very chaotic. They are not very friendly either. 

I understand that they hired a new pastry chef. This bakery used to have the best pecan and chocolate chip cookies in the valley. Whoever changed the recipe has completely ruined them. The cookies are covered in grease, can't stick together, and fall apart. Obviously they need a lesson in how to cream proper amounts of butter and sugar. 

I am disappointed about the changes. This place has gone way downhill. It has gone from being our favorite Saturday morning place, to a restaurant that we will no longer visit. We have  no reason to spend money on bad food and service. Sadly, the cookies are now really just a tragedy.
