My continued mission to find the best French macarons in Las Vegas!
This place has better macarons then Payard in the Ceasa'r's palace and they are only $1.00 a piece!  Better than the $30 my boyfriend had to pay for a box of 12 at Payard! Ha!

One star = For not just being a bakery.  They have a a wide variety of desserts, cakes, macarons, pastries, quiches, breads, and even chocolate.  They have FIFTEEN French macaron flavors; FIFTEEN!

2 stars = They also have a large eating area inside, and a small one outside.  So it is definitely a place to hang out, have some french dessert, and talk with friends over a nice cup of coffee.

3 stars = For their vanilla macarons.

4 stars= For their peanut butter macarons.

The 2 flavors listed above are my favorite.  My friends like the Rasberry one; which I like too, but not my fave.  Do NOT eat the chocolate mint!  It tastes like chocolate and toothpaste put together.  Yuck!  The chocolate pistachio one is pretty good.  The coffee one is too sweet, not enought bitter sweet to it like I would prefer.  The blueberry one is pretty cakey.  I'm all about texture when it comes to macarons.  I like the chewy, fudgy, light crisp, and brownie type textures.

Lacks the 5th star due to the wierd smell when you walk in.  It doesn't smell nice in there like a regular bakery.  Makes you wonder if anything tastes good.  Luckily it does!  If you love French macarons, you MUST go this bakery!  It's awesome!
