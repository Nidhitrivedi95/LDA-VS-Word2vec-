UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw The place itself is gorgeous, very Parisian!!! Love everything about it! The service was also very friendly and good. The drinks are on a pricey side for sure! A mimosa is $15! As for food, it's good. I had a French toast with ricotta and fruit compote (was very good and lots of it). We also ordered eggs with spinach (eggs were a bit undercooked) and a basket of pastries. Overall, a very pleasant experience and I will come back for dinner for sure! Would love to sit at an oyster bar first. It's a nice place to go just for drinks as well as the bar area is very cozy.
