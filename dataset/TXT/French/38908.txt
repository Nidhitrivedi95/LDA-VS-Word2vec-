jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Had breakfast here over the weekend for the first time. I tried the Croche' Mademoiselle style with fried egg. Everything was delicious; however, I didn't care for their mustard. It made my sandwhich tangy. But you don't know until you try right? The bread is amazing! You can definitely tell everything is fresh and made from scratch. I also had the white chocolate mocha latte. That was very good too! I'd definitely like to come back and try some of their other menu items. Overall, I had a good experience.
