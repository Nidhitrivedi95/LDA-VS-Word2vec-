kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I really enjoyed my first time at Central Bistro. The restaurant itself is very spacious and clean and is located in the Biltmore area. One of signs that tips me off to good restaurants is when there are regulars that come in (with smiles) and the staff immediately welcomes them by name. I felt like there was family all around me. They have a killer happy hour with some good deals - $1 oysters and half off pizzas were a couple that stood out to me. All the staff members were very friendly but my bartender (Katie) rocked it tonight. She was quick, friendly, informative and was training someone at the same time and didn't miss a beat. It was clear that the people there appreciate her. I have 10 years in the restaurant business and was quite impressed.The drunk bread was super delicious as was the risotto. Highest praises to this place and I will be stopping in again
