SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Nice secluded location. Comfortable seating with great outdoor option. Service was prompt. Menu items are all good Bistro style selections. Only complaint is that the menu is unchanging with a lack of seasonal variability. There is also a nominal charge for the associated front parking lot though street parking is usually available.
