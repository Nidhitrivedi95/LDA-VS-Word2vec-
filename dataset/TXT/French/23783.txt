cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We saw this place on No Reservations and decided that it was to be our last meal of 2009.  We had the duck in a can.  It was the best $37 I've ever spent on a can.  The Carpaccio de Canard melts in your mouth and the Foie gras was simply the best I've had anywhere.  Tough getting a reservation though and You will have to wait past your reservation to be seated.  The sinks in the bathrooms are uber cool.
