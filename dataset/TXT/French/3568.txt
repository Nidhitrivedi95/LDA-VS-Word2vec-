1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g A new one on Ossington wihch is just across from Foxley. Billed as French-Cuban but mostly a French menu. A bare interior but with a warm atmosphere. Limited seating and ask for a booth when making a reservation for 4. The menu is limited but has several few gems. 

The charcuterie was smaller portions but marked by a tasty duck breast/ foie gras terrine. A celery root soup was flavorful. The much raved Cubano lived up to billing. Just the right mix of meaty crunchiness.

A braised short rib was very soft and hearty. Steak frites consisted of a flat-iron steak, smoky and tender. The fries in this place are a perfect balance of starch and crunch.

The one thing you MUST have and definitely earns a star on its own is the warm homemade chocolate chip cookies. Beautifully moist and crumble soft. Order with a steamed milk. YUM. 

Overall, definitely worth another visit.
