kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ Easily one of the best meals I've had in months. I'm a little surprised how empty it was on a Saturday night - maybe all the local construction is driving people away - but don't let it stop you from visiting and having an epic meal.

Everything we had to start was delicious and nicely presented. A few other yelpers have mentioned the beet salad (with truffle oil and goat cheese, panko breaded egg, and bacon). Yes, yes, yes. You need to get it. Just opening up the egg and seeing everything mix together is beautiful, but then when you put it in your mouth, it's just magical. 

The main dishes were even more impressive. The salmon and duck confit were the biggest winners at the table. Dare I say that the duck confit was the best I ever had?

Service was top notch. I love the industrial chic feel of the restaurant, and it's great to know they work with sustainable and local fisheries when possible. 

Wines by the glass were a bit of a bummer. The cocktails, on the other hand, really delivered in their uniqueness and punch.

Co-ed bathrooms on the second floor. Say what?
