ey9c-TjWXgTJ5OlD0HPd_A Totally get the European vibe at this cafe, although it's small and quaint, it has a lot to offer, I had my usual craving for a plain waffle and it did not disappoint portion size is normal and filling, I had the 2nd brunch choice on their menu, btw which was well explained by our kind and friendly waiter. Will add some pics too!!! Yum, if I'm ever in town, will make a visit!!!!
