K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw I made a recent trip to Montreal and tried L'academie with a group of McGill law students. The restaurant is three floors and very clean and spacious. The menu is alright, it's extensive and offers everything from veal to pasta to seafood. I ordered the grilled chicken with pink peppercorn cream sauce and it came with veggies and potatoes. Honestly, I didn't find the food to be great- the grilled chicken tasted like it was bought from the grocery store and the veggies didn't seem that fresh. The main selling point for this place is its BYOB policy, which is good because patrons can save money on drinks. A group of 5 finished 3 bottles of wine, hah. There are a lot of good restaurants in Montreal and since the food here is nothing to write home about, I won't be coming back.
