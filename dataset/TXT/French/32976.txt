H4N3wGaSJsy8hrNDtADmug We have just returned from Montreal, celebrating the Divers Cite. Had several meals at Le Resto Du Village and it was fantastic. Small, cozy, comfortable, inexpensive, friendly, and great food. Can't say enough good thiings about the place. Just off St. Catherine on Wolfe, so a bit off the beaten track, more locals than tourists. If you want a small diner experience, with the French ambience, and amazing poutine you must check out this gem!!!
