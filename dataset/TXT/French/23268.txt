C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Kalendar is a cute and affordable date spot on College. It joyfully lives on another planet than the rest of 905 ridden Little Italy, and I've been a fan for (gulp) 10 years. 

Their Nanettes are essentially flat bread pizzas, and are decent. They aren't my favourite because they remind me of a time when I made "pizza" on Sobey's-bought stale naan during my undergrad days. This is my issue, though, not yours. I usually go for their scrolls, which are basically rotis stuffed with bistro fare. So tasty! My go to is number six, which is stuffed with roast beef, asiago and horseradish. A true swaddled delight. 

Inside is dark wooded and lovely at night with candlelight. It's a bit cold temperature-wise in the winter, but hell, this is Toronto and they have a lot of old windows to fight with. Their patio is pure people-watching pleasure in the summer. 

PEPPER POINTS for their loose teas. I had a really nice London Fog here. Who'd have thunk it.
