hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Stopped in here recently for some coffee and a quick breakfast and immediately understood how this place has garnered such positive reviews here on Yelp.

The owner is incredibly sweet and greets all customers with the same warm welcome. It's also clear the menu is thoughtfully curated and all items are made with care and quality ingredients. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere, lots of nice natural light and an overall cozy vibe. Certainly a place I could see myself revisiting time and time again if it were closer to my home.
