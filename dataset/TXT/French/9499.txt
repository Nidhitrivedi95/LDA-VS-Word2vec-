4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw As expected was very busy as most places in Vegas are. Came with a party of 7 and had a reservation; wait staff handled it well.

Good location on the strip; I would sit outside or on the patio if possible.

I tried the onion soup, steak bordelaise and the salmon.

First thing I noticed was water stains on the steak knife, after conferring with my party turns out one side of the knife always has water marks.

The onion soup itself was a bit runny with a heavy hand on the cheese; the bread in the soup seemed to be in there for days. The steak bordelaise was a bit bland and the cut a bit thin for my taste; the steak merlot on the other hand seemed overly sweet. The fries that came with the steak were oddly not bad. The salmon was pretty bland as well; nothing too special, not terrible either; typical flavoring of pepper salt and lemon.

For the price it's a nice ambience in Vegas, but in terms of the food, there are many other options available.
