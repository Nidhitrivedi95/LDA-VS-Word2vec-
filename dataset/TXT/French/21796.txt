Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Blue Dust features a large selection of decent beers, an appealing and clean atmosphere, pleasant service, and good food. They have a large draft list written on the blackboard which changes frequently, as well as coolers for you to mix and match your own sixpack for a reasonable price. The waiters have always been extremely friendly, and the bar has a laid-back dark cool relaxing atmosphere. PS: Non-smoking!

The fish tacos were amongst the best I've had in Pittsburgh and the China Doll appetizer was superb. They also have decent chips and salsa, a great Portabella mushroom wrap and ginger carrot soup. On my last visit I had a delicious beer called the "Duck Rabbit Milk."
