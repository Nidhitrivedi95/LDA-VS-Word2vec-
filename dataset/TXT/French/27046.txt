Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA We were outrunning a derecho in my 2004 Saturn Ion, coming from Iowa County in the west.  Madison, home to a phenomenal restaurant scene, was where we stopped for lunch.

Brasserie V was open a little later in the afternoon on a Monday in June.  It had a super deep beer list, featuring not only Wisconsin's finest, but also many rare Belgian beers.  The frites were calling.

The frites here are perfect vehicles (unlike Saturn Ions) for the herby mayo and aoili that accompany them.  I also had a rich pastrami reuben with acidic apple salad.  Then we had to get back in the car to race the storm.

Brasserie V is one of Madison's great neighborhood restaurants.
