kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Pistachio creme brûlée is to die for!! I went and ordered off the winterlicious menu. Food and service were both great, we even got our own private area. Oysters as appetizers were excellent. We were told their Thursday buck a shuck oysters are the same size (they were big!), which is a great deal. Would recommend the steak as the main course, garlic aioli with the fries was absolutely addicting!!
