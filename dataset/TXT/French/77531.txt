YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g It was our next to last night in Vegas during a short gastronomic trip and as my wife and I were walking over to Strip Steak, we passed by Fleur de Lys.  Earlier in the day, I had seen some people on the patio having some amazing looking desserts, so I asked the host if he would mind if we stopped by for dessert after dinner.  We were pleasantly surprised at how welcoming he was of us stopping in for just dessert on a busy Saturday night.   

After a terrific dinner at StripSteak (Roasted Beet Salad is a fantastic starter), we strolled over to Fleur de Lys at about 10:30P.  Most of the dinner crowd was thinning and the host welcomed us back for dessert.  We sat in the intimate lounge that sits behind the large velvety curtains that lead to the main dining room.

Service was prompt and gracious.  We ordered three desserts to share (I know, we like our sweets): The Coconut Tapioca Soup; the Madeleines with chocolate ganache; and the assorted ice creams.  Of the three, the Coconut Tapioca Soup was the most memorable.  The tapioca and coconut soup had just the right amount of sweetness and rich cocounut flavor that blended perfectly with the passion fruit sorbet that brought traditional south east Asian flavors to new heights.  The assorted ice creams were respectable, but nothing special, while the Madeleines were delicate and light as air.

Our biggest disappointment was that Fleur de Lys was dark on Sunday, so we couldn't come back to experience dinner the next night.  Smaller disappointment was the coffee.  For a restaurant of its calibre, Fleur de Lys needs to do better than thin tasteless coffee from the presse.

4.5 Stars for food and service
half Star off for disappointing drinks.
