4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is by far the best brunch place I've ever eaten in Vegas! Awesome food, reasonable price and most importantly, great service are the reasons that I will visit here again! We ordered Croque monsieur, which comes with handmade fries, and blueberry waffle and they are all recommended!
