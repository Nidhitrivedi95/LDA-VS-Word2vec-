O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q This is the second time I've been to Morel's the first time was a long time ago in LA. The Morel's in Vegas is very good for a lunch on the patio. I was really craving a steak so we got a skirt steak with a salad that was very delicious. Lastly, we also had the fried prawns. The downside to ordering all this food is that they give you CHUNKS of friends! We ended up taking a whole box full of fries home that were mediocre.
I honestly enjoyed the salad most. IT was light and pleasantly dressed. The steak was very flavorful and provided a distinct flavor. My least favorite was the prawns. It tasted like it was dunked in oil and were left to sit without trying to damp the oil out of the prawn.
