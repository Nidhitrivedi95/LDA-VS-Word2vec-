cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Appetizer: 
duck carpaccio - very good
foie gras 'tout nu' which is pan seared fois gras with a balsamic reduction - the foie gras was good (can't really go wrong with pan seared foise gras) but it was drowning in the balsamic sauce and the 2 pieces of bread that accompanied it was drenched.

Main Course:
duck magret with mushroom sauce - the mushroom sauce is like an au jus, wish it was thicker.  the portion is plently for one person or can share, but i found the duck not very flavourful.
