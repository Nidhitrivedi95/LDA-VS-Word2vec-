Upon my friend's suggestion, we ordered the beef tataki, takoyaki (deep fried octopus), miso beef tongue, sea bass, and the dome salad, of course, with two sake bombs.  

The sea bass was simply buttery melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  Definitely the best fish I had ever had in my life (and I'm Asian and eat fish regularly!).  The next best dish was the cow tongue, which looks nothing like the organ and is grilled to perfection with a delicate yet generous sprinkling of deep fried sweet potato.  The combination made my head explode!  The takoyaki was exceptionally good and is a definite must-try.  The dishes that were less memorable were the tataki, which was over-seasoned and made my mouth pucker (apparently it was better last time according to my friend), and the dome salad was just "okay".  The dessert was less impressive, as the cheesecake tasted like a giant square of philly cream cheese mixed with green tea.  Not bad, but definitely not something to write home about.

The sake bombs were definitely fun.  I'm not one for sake or shots, and my friend isn't one for beer, but we both LOVED them, and at 5 bucks a pop, it's worth it, if not only for the EXPERIENCE!  Yes!  I won't ruin the surprise so just ORDER it and see what happens...

Finally, for all those who like to compare Imadake with Kazu, I have to say that these two are complete worlds apart.  Imadake stands out on its own as a really fun hangout.  I'm already planning on bringing a group of friends here for a fun and tasty night out!
