xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We have just recently celebrated our Anniversary here for the 2nd time. This place is nothing short of Perfection. We have dined in so many places previous to finding this absolute GEM. I couldn't possibly cover all the superlatives this Restaurant deserves! We enjoyed a reasonably priced bottle of Wine. I had the Bone Marrow Steak & hubby had the Filet. A wonderful Lobster Salad & potato side dish and great Bread/Rolls selection. Next: The View of the Fountains and piano playing softly in the backround in a dimly lit room all comes together with the attentive service of the staff. Sommelier is spot on with wine suggestions. Next time I'd also like to try one of their specialty cocktails. Anything to stay longer and take in the whole experience! Ask for a table at the window for an exceptional view of the strip and fountains. Lyle was so helpful and our server Michael was terrific ! Some mini appetizers, a palette of asst. sorbets and a chocolate mousse were sent over compliments of ET! Wonderful !
Treat yourself to this experience of a lifetime. You only live once.
And I cannot wait until next year. We could not even consider another place that could top ET for a wonderful meal/experience all the way around. A big Thank You to everyone there for our special memories !!!
