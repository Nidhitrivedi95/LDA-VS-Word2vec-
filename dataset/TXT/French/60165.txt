sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ We had a very special birthday dinner at e by Jose Andres. From start to finish the service, food and atmosphere was fantastic. We opted to order wine by the glass over the pairings (which ranged from $150 to $500!) and enjoyed our selections. Would definitely recommend for a special celebration or just a nice night out on the town.
