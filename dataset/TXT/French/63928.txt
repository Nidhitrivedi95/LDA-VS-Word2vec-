T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA Butthole Surfers on the sound system and Playful new French cuisine?! In love... The prix fix lunch was only $22 and included the most amazing sorrel "Chip" with raspberry dust, this small starter plate was a total mouth-gasm and it got better from there: a beet sorrel salad of some sort was light and delicious, I was served bread and butter on the side and couldn't help myself, enjoyed an amazing Arctic chard small plate and was pretty full from there only to go onto my main tortellini mushroom muscle entrée, (rich but Oh so good). I would have opted for the dessert but I couldn't eat another bite. Cocktails were pricey.
