Starting with the décor, simple with a nice black and white theme. It really paired well with the modern look of the restaurant. 

The staff was pretty good and was able to deal with a small crowd well. We got our food in a quick and efficient manner (although we did have to ask our waiter for the free bread). 
The food (mac and cheese and spaghetti carbonara) was delicious. The spaghetti carbonara  had the egg yolk on top which I then mixed in myself, which I thought was a cool unique spin on the meal. The meals were both visually appetizing and tasteful. 

The restaurant was surprisingly affordable too. We paid about 110 but keep in mind we ordered 4 drinks total, which added to almost half the bill, which is what you would expect when ordering drinks in most larger cities.
 
The drinks were also pretty good. Definitely strong, they didn't hold back on the booze, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone goes for the views, which are without a doubt incomparable, but the food really brings it to the next level to give it the fifth star. Will be back next time I'm in Montreal.
