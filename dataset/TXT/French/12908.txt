4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great patio seating!! You have the people walking the Strip, the Bellagio's Fountains right across the street, and the Sun shinning on your partied out face...haha. The staff here are dressed in white shirts, black ties, and black vests that give it a Euro/Paris Café feel.

The food is great too, Everything tastes and feels fresh. From the simple salad to the New England style lobster roll that comes with crispy wedge cut potato chips. Another great dish here is the quiche with asparagus. Nice crusty texture on the outside and creamy on the inside.

The inside of the restaurant is very nice too, especially the bar. It make you forget that you are in a Vegas Casino restaurant.

This is my must stop every time I am going to hit the road back home because the food is not greasy or heavy that it doesn't get me sleepy for the drive.
