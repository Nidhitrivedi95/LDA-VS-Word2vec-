mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q My husband and I ate here a couple months ago, and since it was our first time- we ordered the tasting menu... and it was heaven.

The ambience is nice- we sat at the bar with a full view of the chefs working hard, perfecting their craft.  And the waiter was friendly, not overly attentive. 

The amuse-bouche was a fois gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam.  OMG... I had to restrain myself from licking the plate, it is probably the best thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. That alone is why this review is 5 stars.  It would probably be too rich and too much flavor for anything but an amuse-bouche, but it was the perfect way to begin this gastronomical adventure.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS: king crab on turnip disc
Sea scallop with chive oil
Duck fois gras with confit quince and yuzu

DELICIOUS: onion tart with smoked bacon and grilled mushroom
Dover sole filet
Fois gras stuffed free range quail with truffled mashed potatoes. 

The dessert was okay and it might just be because I was already stuffed from the 7 dishes prior... Grapefrut infused with prosecco, lychee sorbet,  chocolate cake with espresso ice cream.
