Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Get there early or make a reservation. It's busy, and for good reason. The food is very good. 

Recommendation: the white chocolate, orange zest french toast. I don't usually care for french toast but allow me to say that you would be more than simply remiss to not order this dish. Allow me to present an analogy: french toast from Denny's is to a Toyota Avalon as french toast from Tableau is a Brabus S Class*.

*if you're not familiar with a Brabus S Class, then you need to step your game up, player.
