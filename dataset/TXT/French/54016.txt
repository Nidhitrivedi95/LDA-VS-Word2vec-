qrSsS0pk7SL67MP5nN8tlg I ran into this restaurant while I was looking for a French restaurant nearby. After having checked that on Dine.To and Yelp, I decided to give a try. 

It's a neat and cozy place. It's romantic and it does not overwhelm you with unnecessary decoration. The candles and flowers are real. 

Food was great but a little bit expensive and prices were different from those posted on the restaurant's web site. 

A nice lady greeted us warmly when we arrived and when we left. She  was smiling at all times; pretty sincere; hard to get that feeling in Tdot nowadays.

I'd definitely recommend this restaurant.
