SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ While in Tempe for some spring training games, my husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner.  We arrived a bit early for our reserved time so we found a nice spot at the bar for a cocktail.  I ordered a house specialty called a "Crunchy Squirrel."  Weird name, strange taste.  Shoulda known better.  The atmosphere is pretty nice on the candle-lit patio, but they have to provide flashlights so you can read the menu. Good thing we showered and changed after the game because it wasn't what I would classify as "casual" attire. Most people were dressed in nice date-night attire like us.

By the time I finished my squirrelly drink, the sweet little hostess had tracked us down to seat us. (She was the friendliest staff person we encountered all  evening.) She gave us what seemed to be a pretty nice, intimate little table, but as the evening grew cooler and a little breezy, it became clear that we were too far from the heaters. 

Our server was very professional but not overly friendly. He had to read the specials from a cheat sheet which didn't seem very knowledgeable or enthusiastic. Our food came out relatively quick but to my disappointment, it was only luke warm and I am a stickler about eating my food HOT. Nevertheless, we both enjoyed our small, expensive portions of grilled salmon and lobster.  Presentation was very nice, but as for taste, the entrees were "okay." Not bad, but not mouth-wateringly yummy, either.  Especially for the prices. Since we were still hungry, we ordered some delish decadent desserts. They were much tastier than the dinner.

Overall, I'd say this is a nice place to come for drinks and/or dessert, but the dinner was a bit disappointing.
