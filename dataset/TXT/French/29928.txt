fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA Best steak frites!  I've been here three times. Am blown away every time. All they have is steak and fries. But the place has been packed for three generations. Whatever is in that gravy they put on everything, I could live on!  It is sooooo delicious!  They recommend the steak medium. It's a thin cut  and man it's tender and flavorful.
