O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I work in the area so have been here numerous times for business meetings... I must admit that I absolutely love the ambiance of this restaurant. Further, Yorkville is such a great area to spend your time in during the afternoon. As another reviewer mentioned, the vaulted ceilings and the two-storey waterfalls really helps you relax in the middle of a busy day.

In terms of the food I have always found everything extremely fresh - typically have eaten either pork or scallops when there and both are always done amazingly... Highly recommended if you need to book a lunch in the area.
