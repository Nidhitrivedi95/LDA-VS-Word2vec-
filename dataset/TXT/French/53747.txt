The food was beautifully presented and everything was very tasty.  We spent the rest of the evening above the restaurant on a patio overlooking the waterfall.  Every 30 minutes there's a different show on and around the water.  It was a hoot.  Friendly professional service up there as well.  It was, by far, the highlight of our long weekend in Vegas.
