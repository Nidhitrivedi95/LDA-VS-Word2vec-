Cozy seating areas upstairs and down, along with outdoor seating. The menu is amazing, and the wine list is one of the better lists I have seen in Charlotte.The escargot was a major winner. The Gorgonzola sauce was out of this world. We used every bit of extra bread to make sure to leave no sauce uneaten.
For main course, I had the tuna and my boyfriend had the Elk Chop. Both were prepared perfectly to temperature. 
The wait staff is very knowledgeable, and friendly. They make you feel welcome, and can speak intelligently to the menu. Overall, a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend.
