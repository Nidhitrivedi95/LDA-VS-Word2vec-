rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I was so wishing I could give this place 5 stars...a t least 4. Unfortunately I was disappointed. This was my first Thomas Keller experience and I really wanted it to be special :(

The restaurant is very classy and the service was what you'd expect from a place of this caliber. It's the food that left me disappointed. They started me off with some french bread (too hard) and warm pistachios. I had the crispy frog legs (didn't care for them too much), grilled sturgeon (a lot of flavors that didn't necessarily go together well) and profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce (ok).

The setting was nice -- outdoor by the pool. All in all, won't be back given the options here :(
