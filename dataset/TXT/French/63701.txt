t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA This place is good. I can never get myself to love it - but if you're in a large group and need a decent place for a solid pre-fixe menu that also turns into a venue - this is your spot. It's great for birthdays, wedding, parties, staff events, showers, whatever. The staff are excellent and very accommodating. It's a high value establishment - that's for sure. 

+ points for belly dancing and showmanship of coffee pouring.
