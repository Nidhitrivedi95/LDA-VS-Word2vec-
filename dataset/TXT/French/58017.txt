rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A On our way out of Vegas we stopped in for breakfast at Bouchon.  I had the french toast, it was truly the best I have ever had.  It was as beautiful as the picture in the cookbook I have been drooling over for months.  It lived up to all of my expectations.

The hubby had the daily steak and egg omelet special.  It was delish, the meat was tender, and the side of bacon was plentiful and yummy.  It was served with brioche with house-made jam which was wonderful.  I wish I had some to take home.

I can't wait to go back!
