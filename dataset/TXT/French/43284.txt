LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw What a terrific experience! My mothers birthday was on a Tuesday and can you believe the place was packed to capacity. Well upon being seated I soon understood why. The service was undoubtedly the best I've ever had, from the attentive waiting staff all the way to meeting the owner, we had a magical experience, one we'll never forget. The scallops were cooked to perfection, the delicious sweet breads alongside the bananas foster were all mouth watering creations prepared by a very talented chef. Thank you again for such a magnificent experience. You can feel the love that goes into each and every dish. You can also feel the pride in the staff members that seem to have dedicated themselves to providing wonderful service. Thanks again everyone for making my mothers birthday one she'll remember forever!!!!
