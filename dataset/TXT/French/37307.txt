IYreMhkT6e02tsbw-Dex5Q My family enjoyed their meals so much they wouldn't stop talking about it! We all ordered the filet. My mom, who doesn't even like steak, raved about it. My dad said it was the best steak he'd ever had! They butcher the meat themselves, so it's high quality meat for an affordable price. There was a wait, so we ate at the bar. We had fantastic service and great drinks. Order a side of the Lobster Mac & Cheese; you'll thank me.
