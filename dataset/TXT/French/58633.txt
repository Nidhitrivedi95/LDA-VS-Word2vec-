RhIjAPdxZYnzqWLs7P-YTA Highly impressed! Would definitely recommend, would definitely return! 

Came here for a McGill Alumni Wine Tasting and Pairing event with my dad on a warm and rainy Wednesday evening. 

The Bistro's two Sommeliers were spectacular and endearing. Both down to earth, friendly, passionate and knowledgeable about every one of the 5 Austrian wines they presented and paired thoughtfully with perfectly conceived bouchées. 

This event was geared at the seasoned wine connoisseurs and the amateurs, such as myself, alike. I was enthralled in a panoply of information and sensations and I would gladly repeat the occasion a million times over.

In particular the duck confit croquettes were to die for, my favorite taste of the night! Also of particular note, would be the dessert wine, which was out of this world; and we were among the last people to get to savour it here in Québec, as we had the last 3 bottles only available via import. 

The service was impeccable and unwaivering. The price was definitely on the higher scales but worth every penny. I can't wait to go back for a tasty treat and a very good well sought glass of wine!
