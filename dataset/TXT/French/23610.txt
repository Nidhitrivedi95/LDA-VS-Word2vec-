cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg You definitely need a reservation in advance as they get fully booked, which also means not needing to line up!  Duck in a can was as delicious as expected and it comes with foie gras so you can technically skip on ordering a separate foie gras dish. Foie gras poutine was not as good in comparison, the foie we got there was less fatty and fragrant, so I wouldn't recommend that one.
