X8lYvkI2Yv7f96cz4uE9LQ Wonderful service & amazing food. What else could you ask for? It lives up to the hype.... The food was beyond amazing and our waiter was the ultimate professional! It is a very small place so I would suggest reservations. The menu is provided in both French & English and our waiter was bilingual. The menu is very limited with just four choices for appetizers and four choices for entrees but we knew that before we reserved. I would suggest checking out their menu online to ensure everyone in your party can find something they like. This was easily one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in.
