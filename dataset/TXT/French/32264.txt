gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA What a disappointment.
Took the chef menu which should have been stellar, and was far from it.
- the caviar was unremarkable and served surrounded by an awkwardly sweet jelly err "panacotta" and palate killing cinnamon blini
- the smoked salmon was delicious but served in pinky nail servings - so the little there was that was good was... very little
- the lobster thermidor was drowned in tarragon - it could've been $2 shrimp in there you could not have figured out the difference
- the short ribs were decent but nothing to write home about
- the grand marnier soufflé was great

So - save yourself $175 and skip this hot mess. I can't fathom how this restaurant will keep its Michelin star, it's giving the institution a bad name
