rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon is the vision of world-renowned chef Thomas Keller of French Laundry (etc.) fame. I particularly enjoyed his influence on the Pixar Movie Ratatouille. However, after my early evening Bar meal at Bouchon, I was reminded of a Ronald Reagan quote when dealing with restaurant (or any other) hype - Trust, But Verify.

I was looking for something classy and far away from the hordes of the Venetian's Grand Canal. So I happily made my way up the Venezia Tower to this very handsomely appointed Bouchon French Bistro. Bistro of course is in the eye of beholder, but to me this place had a smart City feel. Contrast that to La Ferme in Genoa NV, that puts you in the French Countryside and with a Basque twist and a Servant's heart.

My service experience at Bouchon also reminded me of Paris in that it was at times distant, aloof, and even snarly. That's on top of my initial seating choice at one of the round tables behind the bar. I was simply ignored, until I figured that service only came at the Bar. Silly me, this simple peasant should have known!

I figured that Bouchon was not the kind of place that you paid big money to be insulted, so I hung in there. I ordered and thoroughly enjoyed a Croque Madame (grilled ham & cheese sandwich on brioche with fried egg & mornay sauce served with frites). The beer selection matched the food and once I settled in and surveyed the clientele, I made myself at home within my own dining and people watching experience. I left full, satisfied, and relaxed, but wondering why I would ever want to come back.
