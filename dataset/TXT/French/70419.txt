xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Really enjoyed the food here. I ordered the BigBird and my girlfriend ordered the phillycheese steak. Price was good for the quality of food you receive. The mustard in my crepe however allowed me to envision what it must have been to fight in the first world war. 
Definitely would recommend
