SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Great place to grab a crepe in Old Montreal. The hot chocolate was amazing and I really enjoyed my crepe. Nothing like a strawberry, banana and chocolate crepe for breakfast (La Sonia Crepe). I think the best thing about the restaurant is the ability to sit outside at a bistro table and people watch.
