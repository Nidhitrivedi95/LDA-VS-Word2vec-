We came in on a Friday afternoon around 2pm, and the store was empty and quiet. The weather outside was rainy and cold, so that was probably a big reason why people weren't out and about. I looked at their dessert case, which was on the barren side (only 3-4 sliced cake/small dessert options). They also had a long list of macaron flavors, but only 2 flavors were actually available, so I ended up purchasing both:

-Pistachio Macaron ($3.75, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scratch-pastries-and-bistro-scottsdale?select=yJurZAST_i7-o5iYs0leLQ#yJurZAST_i7-o5iYs0leLQ): Eh.. so-so. This macaron was jumbo sized, and had good almond flavor. It's not an authentic Parisian style macaron, but I liked the chewier texture. However, the pistachio tasted very fake-y, and I wouldn't get this flavor again.
-Almond Macaron ($3.75, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scratch-pastries-and-bistro-scottsdale?select=yJurZAST_i7-o5iYs0leLQ#bp7kHaIrMIG5IKSUerNPaw): Yum! I loved the almond flavor, and also that it didn't have a ton of food coloring like the green pistachio macaron. You really got to appreciate the chewy texture of the macaron, and the contrast against the slight crispy exterior.

However, at $3.75 these macarons were pricey!! I would be interested in coming back to try their other baked goods, but since there was so little selection (and the items didn't look particularly fresh), I'm not sure if I would be back. It would be great if they cleaned out that dessert case or spruced it up, because it just looked really drab and didn't inspire you to want to try the desserts. Also, they should put up some signage for the macaron flavors they have available, so that customers don't get excited about flavors that aren't available. Parking here was easy, and the staff was nice but not the most attentive.
