ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg This review is only for the brunch. I ordered the Paris 66 brunch formule ($18, whipped-cream filled crepe with berry puree, croissant, eggs provençales) and was unimpressed. The crepe was rubbery and cold, the croissant much too dry for a place with "Paris" in the name, the eggs were tasty but nothing special. My girlfriend's eggs came undercooked and cold. I definitely don't think its worth the price tag. I have been to France more times than I can count, and Paris 66 to me exudes the vibe of a parisian tourist trap, down to cliches like Edith Piaf on the radio. 
To be fair, their dinner menu sounds better but I probably won't come back.
