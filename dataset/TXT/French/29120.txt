epvLkQNL6MOvk3s6JlTntA My husband and I really enjoyed the food here. The menu of crepes makes it a unique and fun place to go for dinner. I got the pulled pork crepe and my husband got the ham, apples, and gouda crepe. Both were excellent, although, mine was more packed with ingredients. We were too full to try dessert, but they looked amazing. I think we met the owner and he was the sweetest guy. Welcomed us to the city (since we recently moved here) and told us that we're family now.

The food did take a bit longer than expected, but we like to think that was because it takes a while to make good, fresh food.
