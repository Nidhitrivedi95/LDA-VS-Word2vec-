XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw I found my way here from the Rennaissance, just 10 min walk. Great wine list, I just missed happy hour which ends at 7 but I had a lovely Tartine of grilled shrimp and a wonderful white Cote de Rhone. The bar staff were friendly and attentiveness. Atmosphere was welcoming and comfortable.
