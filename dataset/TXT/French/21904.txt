bMiyGPaMqF0svjseW1UR_g Came for a late meal on a Sunday night.  Sat inside, it was a beautiful night so the windows were open and it was a very comfortable atmosphere with the open air feel of a bistro.  

Looking over the menu I noticed there was a lot of stuff I would have liked to try.

However, after much deliberation decided to get the albacore tuna with quinoa and it was delicious.  Perfect meal for after a nice workout, which coincidentally I had just finished.  

Only complaint was I thought the tuna could have been slightly warmer.  

Service was fine, and I found the prices to be reasonable for what you get.
