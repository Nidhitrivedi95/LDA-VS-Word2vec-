The canopies are swarmed with bugs that will occasionally find their way down onto you or your table. 

The service can be a hit or miss but if you have a civilized talk with the manager in the plaid jacket, he will make amends.

Our first visit meal was wonderful. Artichoke ravioli in a light cream sauce that was so good it might temp you to lick your plate...luckily I'm in a relationship stage where I wouldn't judge her ;P
My order of melt-in-your-mouth veal tenderloin was transcendent. I wish they kept it on a regular menu.

Last night's dinner started off with a Crab & Ricotta "Beignet" possibly with andouille sausage...anyway, the description sounded delicious.
What we got was a large plate topped with one crab Empanada atop tomato sauce & some kind of minced vege...$18...NOT a "Beignet"! MB, ever hear of a place called New Orleans?
We thought the rest of our meal was doomed and regret started to loom.
But MB pulled it out of the 8th and delivered delicious entrees. Lobster Pappardelle with lobster poached in butter and served with a lobster cream sauce. The portions of succulent lobster was more than I expected :) the lobster cream sauce was good but needed a good shower of Parmesan to finish.
Pumpkin ricotta gnocchi...light, fluffy and probably made by angels. The cream sauce was another home run.

Service was good last night that it made up for missing the complimentary anniversary dessert we would have gotten at our other favorite restaurant. It's ok (sniff sniff) we forgive you ;)

We won't be marching Bacchus too soon (insert groan) but may return if I can find that old fly swatter.
