SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This was our 5th visit over the pat few years. Love the food and ambience overall. Our server was just very slow this visit, and it took away a bit from our experience. No bread was offered - we had to ask, which has never happened before, and she was slow to bring our wine. We had finished the first bottle between the 4 of us, and ordered a second, which didn't arrive until our entrees were on the table and being eaten before they got cold. Water glasses weren't refilled often enough. She did not mention the dessert special, I happened to overhear another server telling her table about it - she had just dropped off the dessert menus and run off. Food was fabulous as always, but at this fine restaurant, we've learned to expect better service. We'll be back, though, as we know how wonderful this gem really is.
