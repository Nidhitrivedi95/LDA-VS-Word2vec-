cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg After looking at all the great reviews. Decided to check this place out. We ordered the foie gras lobe that costed $120. It was either 500g or 600g of foie gras. It takes an hour to make this dish. It consisted of foie gras, ham, bread and berries. I did not like this dish. It was not to my liking. I did not expect this dish to come sweet and fruity. When the waiter said that there was a dessert that came with it. I didn't think that it was going to mixed inside with the foie gras. It was odd, different from the foie gras served at other restaurants. 

They had delicious bread too. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  

Presentation wise. The food was not appeal. 

On the good side, their service was great! The server came by really often to fill water. 

I may consider coming back to try their other foie gras dishes as they have a wide selection. But the foie gras lobe is totally not worth it. It just didn't taste good to me.
