rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A very good french food. menu caters to the foodie crowd, so be prepared for a slightly pretentious clientele. the waitstaff, however, are very helpful.

food is good, drinks are strong, and desserts are worth the price.

note: with california's recent foie gras ban, this is one of best, most accessible options for californians looking for fatty duck liver (it's very good here)
