O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Came here for dinner with my buddies from work during our weekend at Sin City.  We were staying at the Palazzo already and my buddy really wanted to try it.  I had a great experience here.  The steaks here were very well executed (on par with any good steak house u would expect, but also not the best steak I ever tasted).  The thing that really makes this place very worth the visit is the amazing wine selection they have.  From bottles to wines by the glass, they have a great amount of choice for any type of wine preference.  The side dishes were also all cooked very well.  I highly recommend coming here if you are in the area or staying at the hotel and in the mood for a french steak dinner with some awesome wine.
