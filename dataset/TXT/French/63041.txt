SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Almost like you're in NY...definitely get the cheese plate. They have the widest selection in CLE and also do an excellent job of describing everything. Also, get the french toast! It sounded weird but upon recommendation, it blew my mind. Of course, it's not really regular french toast but the cream sauce with mushrooms makes it mindblowing.
