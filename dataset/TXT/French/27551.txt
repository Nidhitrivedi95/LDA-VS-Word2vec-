DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA This is the second time we come to this place. Sadly we had a very bad experience today. We decided to enjoy our Saturday here since it happened to be a rainy cold day in phoenix which anyone who's ever visited or lived in phoenix knows a day like this is rare! So we went today with a big crowd of friends a total of 10 of us. When we are seating down a cockroach starts walking on the wall behind one of my friends. We freaked out a little bit and a girl named Sarah which later on we found out it happened to be the manager said "is an old building guys" VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. Is almost like she said "suck it up is not a big deal" like we're her kids. We decided to stay because it was such a nice day we didn't want his to ruin it which happened to be a bad idea because 10 min after another cockroach starts walking on the wall again. So we decided to complain and the manager again just said "is an old building & we can't just shut down for a day to take care of this" SO EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL I totally do not want to recommend this place! I hope she gets fired for being sooooo rude and soooo unprofessional. The least she could have done is apologize instead of excusing herself! I hope this helps someone else to decide NOT to come here unless you appreciate and enjoy cockroaches as your friend and a rude manager giving you attitude
