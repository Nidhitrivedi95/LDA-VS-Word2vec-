A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g My husband loves french patisseries. I've never been fortunate enough to go to Paris but he studied abroad in Spain for a semester and has fond memories of a trip to Paris where he enjoyed the "best pastries ever".  

Patissserie Manon brought back those memories with their delectable treats! We stopped by on a Saturday morning for a sweet treat and coffee. I enjoyed an eclair and a salted caramel butter macaroon while my husband devoured a chocolate croissant and a pistachio macaroon (we love us some macaroons). The front half of the restaurant is all the sweets while the back serves up hot sandwiches, pizzas, quiches and more.  We look forward to a return visit where we plan to try some of the savory treats.
