Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I'm impressed!  This place is beautiful.  We arrived to The Mix Restaurant in style and were seated immediately.  The Mix has such a beautiful view of Las Vegas.. 
The Good: 

**Two thumbs up for service -- Immediately after being seated, the waitress asked us if we had any time constraints and we said we had about 45 minutes to eat.  There were a total of 5 in our party and she got all of our orders out in 10 minutes and we had more than enough time to savor our meals! 

*OMG - The View is georgeous.  Even if you don't have reservations for dinner, stop by for a drink.  It's absolutely worth it. 

The so-so:  

*Food:  OK - the Food was not the absolute best I've ever had but it was still good.  

The bad:  

*Price:  Granted this is Las Vegas and you're sure to drop a few bucks for      EVERYTHING but the prices here are just too much.  I think they pad the prices an extra 10 to 20 dollars for the beautiful ambiance and view you're getting.
