A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g My plans to rampage the strip in Vegas were dashed when the wedding party reserved rooms about 20 mins away. The silver lining was that I was pushed out of my comfort zone and forced to find new things. One of those things was Patisserie Manon, a French bakery close to SunCoast. 

I wasn't sure what to expect but we were greeted by giant display cases jammed with every kind of pastry known to man. Rainbows of macarons, custard filled eclairs, fruit tarts, lemon cremes, pies, cakes, cookies. It's a sugar addict's dream in there. 

The bistro is in back, an order counter where they'll pile a plate with a giant croque madame or some goat cheese quiche or a big salad. The soups need some help but then, when it's 115 degrees outside, soups aren't a big priority. Our service there was great (it's order window) and they've got a cute kids table for your little ones. Definitely a find if you're in that area or are looking for a little (or a lotta) sugar.
