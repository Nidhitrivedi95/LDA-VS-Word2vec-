qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw Just had dinner at Daniel Boulud before the Le Reve show.  Good prix fixe menu at $42 for three-course before 7pm, but we were expecting more from a one michelin star restaurant.  We started with parsnip soup with spicy bread, it was good but not amazing.  The main entree, we had steak frites and their house burger, both cooked well, but blend in taste.  I couldn't taste the truffle in the burger, and I consider myself a truffle hunter!  The setting is relaxing with a big window looking out to the lighted pool pond, not the most romantic place to take a date, but  comfortable enough to be yourself.  Service is very slow here, we had to call for our waiter a few times.
