ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I could have eaten that bread all day. I'm glad I didn't, though. My salmon and potatoes were delicious! I wasn't expecting it to be as fantastic as it was, given that it looked like just another themed casino restaurant. So glad that I was wrong on that, and I would definitely go again.
