rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w My husband and I ate at Le Cirque for my birthday on April 8 and enjoyed the meal so much that we ate there again on April 9.  The Muscovy duck for two, the foie gras and the lobster and avocado salad were so delicious.  Everything we ate was wonderful and the staff could not have been nicer, making us feel special.  

Bellagio is a beautiful hotel and Le Cirque is elegant, yet inviting, with lovely views of the Bellagio fountains.  I love everything about this restaurant and look forward to dining here on our next visit to Las Vegas.
