htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Oh finally and awesome brunch place in Markham!  Everything here is uniquely made and has a fusion/creative touch to it!  The service is very friendly the two times I've been here and food is excellent. 

The pulled pork frites are a must try and the chicken and waffles are a must as well!  Everything else that I've had there has been very tasty as well.  Their INSP burger was a bit on the oily side but I'm very picky about how my bun is after the meat touches it and I personally found it a bit too oily and soggy for my liking.  However, everything has been absolutely delicious.  

I definitely want to come back here to try dinner at some point.
