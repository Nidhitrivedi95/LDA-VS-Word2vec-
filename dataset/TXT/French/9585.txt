4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was a fun spot for a meal with a couple of colleagues when we were out in Las Vegas. we had reservations and were seated right as we arrived. It was a cool evening, so I was thankful that we had a table indoors, but it looked like the patio had lovely views of the Bellagio fountain {it was heated}. 

We all started with a glass of wine or a cocktail & I opted for some sort of peach martini... It was delish, albeit a bit stout :-) Next, the bread - not nearly as tasty as the French loaf at Bouchon, but fine - pretty standard. 

A number of us ordered the Steak Frite, although two of us opted for filets, over the flat steak that comes with the dish. They're are a number of amazing-sounding topping options... anything from a shallot butter to a holaindase sauce and blu cheese topping, but I went for the Dijon sauce = a sure winner!

One thing I wasn't totally crazy about were the frites. The first few were yummy, but overall they were more like thick potato chips, as opposed to French fried potatoes... I think my tastebuds were wishing for something softer, fluffier; if we went back, I'd sub the frites for the whipped potatoes, always a favorite of mine! 

A few of our dining partners ordered the fish of the day & simply raved about it! I think we all left after a fun, rich meal very full & happy :-)
