LHwzyN5cllTfLuZ8v2k_Bg I've known this place for 20+ years, and it once was OK, perhaps even good... but that was in the 1990s. I went back while visiting Toronto (having returned 12 years ago to QC). Total disappointment. Banal, dreary, tacky. Food just altogether mediocre... overall ambience was that of a tourist trap such as one finds in provincial cities  ... tho perhaps that was due to the abundance of boring, obnoxious Toronto people who obviously tolerate the lousy food here. The staff are lovely and the service is OK, but unless you want to have the sort of restaurant experience one might have expected in obscure parts of Britain decades ago (think Fawlty Towers--especially in terms of the quality of the cuisine!), just steer clear. It boggles my kind, because Toronto has so many good restaurants.... !
