rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Seated right next to the tall french windows in a classy airy restaurant that gives plenty of natural light, the whole place is filled with the fragrant smells of breakfast, pleasant clinking of utensils and happy chatter of customers. What a great start to a brunch.  We ordered a carafe of iced coffee, Oeuf Benedict, and Croque Madame. 

Croque Madame is perfectly done. Soft brioche grilled, yummy ham and cheese topped with an egg whose yolk oozed seductively over the brioche.  Perfect balance of softness and crisp & of taste. 

My companion got the Oeuf Benedict that has similar ingredients as Croque Madame- eggs, ham, cheese. But its taste is surprisingly different from Croque Madame. Personal preference is the latter. It has a more balanced in taste while I find Oeuf Benedict too salty for my liking. 

Iced coffee from drip works well for a hot day in Las Vegas.  

A very good meal to a good start of a day. 

Will definitely come back.
