37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg I went to Edulis last night with friends having heard good things about this restaurant.

I arrived at about 7 and the restaurant was quite empty but it quickly filled up. It is a small restaurant and basically only seats 2 to 4 people per table. I asked and they will go up to a party of 6.

I now understand what some of the reviews meant by saying this place is "good, not great".  This place is no Alo.

We had the 7 course tasting menu. The tasting menu is primarily fish based with one meat dish.  The food is very good and so is the the pace the dishes are served. However, there is no "wow" factor with the food.

The service was good. Our server was friendly and answered our questions. 

I found the price of the 7 course tasting menu ($85) to be very reasonable. Also, they had a reasonable wine selection in terms of both price and selection.

In the end, I am happy I tried it.
