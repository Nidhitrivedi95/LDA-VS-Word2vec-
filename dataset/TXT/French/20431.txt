AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Was good but expensive. 

Crepe was ok nothing spectacular.  
Got the meatball sandwich and at first a a little irked that it was premade untill I took a bite. Wow.  Really good meatball. 

The smoothie was pretty good too.  

Chocolate yum 

The only other big thing was them using plastic containers.  The sandwich warped the container.   Hmmm.
