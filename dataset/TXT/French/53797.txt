qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw Back in Vegas.  This time for pleasure.  A large group of friends/business associates stopped by at this place for dinner.

The ambiance is good.  Nothing spectacular or memorable.

We were seated promptly, fairly uneventful.

bunch of us at the table got the steak, we also heard about the $32 burger, but no one had the stones to spend $32 on a burger...

I ordered the new york strip and it was good.  Like its ambiance, nothing spectacular or memorable.  

The folks at my table also shared the similar sentiment.  At $150 per person (including booze), we expected more, but we weren't necessarily disappointed either.  Again, nothing memorable.

Would I recommend this place?  It depends.  If one is interested in impressing someone, this could do it since it does have some great views.  For the purists, I would not recommend it since there are much better places in LV.
