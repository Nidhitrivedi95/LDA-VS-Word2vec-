3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA I was pleasantly surprised by this French bistro. Most of the restaurants on Prince-Arthur are overpriced tourist traps. However, Les Deux Gamins was fairly reasonably priced. Keep in mind tho that it is not a BYOW place like a lot of the other restaurants nearby.

As for the food, fairly standard French fares: steak tartare, steak frite, lamb shank etc. No surprises or modern twists but this is sometimes what I'm looking for.

The kitchen lost our ticket for our appetizers. However they made it up with a full bottle of house wine. In all, there are better French Restaurants in Montreal. However, you could do a whole lot worse than eat here
