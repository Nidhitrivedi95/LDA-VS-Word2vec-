3OCooCzHgsS2xHdN-dNVXg This is certainly one of the most attractive places to dine in Toronto but that's where it ends. The service was bad, the food ok but way over priced, and I've never seen a more over priced wine list in my life. I know most restaurants mark up bottled by 100% but to pay $55 for a bottle of Sterling Chard. that you can get at the LCBO for $12.95 is robbery
