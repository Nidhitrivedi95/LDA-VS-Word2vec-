BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Really loved it! The atmosphere was nice, the service was exceptional and attentive. We all loved our food and it was well presented with generous portions. Can't wait to go back and bring more friends. The best new place I've been to in Scottsdale in a looong time. Bold to open a new place in this economy, but think this one will be a winner.
