A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g We love this bakery! Every cake flavor we have tried so far has been yummy! The flan and fruit tarts are really good as well.  I'm not a fan of the macroons, but I have never had them before so I don't have any basis of comparison. 

The shop is set up a little different as if the baking was the primary function, and the cafe area was an after thought. It doesn't bother me because I usually pick up my treats to go.  It is hard to drive by when you have an afternoon sweet tooth acting up!
