UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q When you're visiting from the states, you don't want all the foods you can try back home.     This place is hard core french canadian quebecian.  

Had this meat pie thingie (never had something like this before.   Had this caramel like pie (tarte au sucre... another item I've never had before).   All in all, I wish I had more time to try out the rest of the quebecian food.
