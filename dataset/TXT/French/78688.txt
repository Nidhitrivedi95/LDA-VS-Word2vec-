ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We waited on a Sunday morning (almost 11am) for seating. It actually took a long time for us to get seated for 5. By that time, it was pretty much the lunch menu (breakfast is served till 11am on Sundays). 

The service here was actually pretty awesome. The waiter was cool, the bus-boy was cool and even the keno lady Letty (who wore a Steelers jersey) was pretty nice. 

The food though was just ok. I expect a bigger breakfast menu when I open up the menu. Their lunch meny consisted of a lot of sandwiches. 

I like their Caprese sandwich. Their pancakes weren't IHOP standards and their coffee is pretty good (just don't drink too much when you're headed home on the I-15). That'll make for frequent bathroom stops from Vegas to L.A.!  =)
