COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw This place is just OK. Nothing special, nothing too memorable or delicious that I have to come back. 
I like that it's an old school Vegas restaurant from 1976, but it doesn't look like one thing has changed since then...a little old and dirty looking. 
Pâté du jour looked like a slice of canned lunch meat, similar to spam, no nice presentations..
I got the scampi as the main course, which is 7 sautéed shrimp in an OK sauce for $30. 
A little overpriced for the lack of visual appeal, what you get on the plate and how it tastes. Most entrées are served with a side of tasteless wild rice. Bordeaux (by the glass) was good. 
Service wasn't too bad, but nothing outstanding.
