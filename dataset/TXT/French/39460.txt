The slight difference is that they give you a number to take to your seats and the server brings you your food.

The food seems to be towards the healthier side - wraps, sandwiches, salads, middle eastern style pizza.  There is also a bakery section with delicious looking cakes, tarts, macarons, and croissants.  A tea/coffee menu that serves Sloane tea is my kinda joint!

Sleek white table and chairs, funky lighting make this a great place for brunch!

Today I tried the salmon sandwich on this rustic yummy bread that had sesame seeds and I think pumpkin seeds on it.  Highly recommend it!  With my tea, croissant and broccoli salad it came out to about $17 with tax.  Not bad at all.

You can also buy the flat bread (baked in store!) They have zataar, half cheese/half zataar, half tomato/cheese and one with beef.  It's about $10 for the pack (you get quite a lot of bread)

I will definitely be back since this place isn't too far from - I think I found my neighborhood brunch spot!
