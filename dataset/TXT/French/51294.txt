P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ I had an amazing meal here.  They have an amazing wine list.  Good decor, comfortable tables, good service (all French).  Even the breads, which come on a cart with ~15 varieties, are amazing.  The son of Guy Savoy runs this show and he comes out and meets every table.  

The food is very good if you are thinking about this or something else, besides the cost (~$500 w/o wine for two), I'm not sure you'll find a better place.
