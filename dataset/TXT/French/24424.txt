cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg you gotta love a place where you can walk by and not know what you could be missing out.. there are no signs that point to you this place.. just a packed house of hungry patrons.. 

we came here and engorged ourselves with food.. we started off with the pickled tongue and the roast piglet.. the tongue was refreshingly light for a pork dish and a great way to start the meal.. the roast piglet was really tender but could have been seasoned a bit better or have a better dipping sauce.. nevertheless it was delicious.. 

for our entress.. we shared the stuff pied de cochon with foie gras as well as an order of blood sausage.. the pig's feet were really really heavy and hearty.. we used the gravy and slathered it over the duck fat fries and it was heavenly fattiness.. 

as for the blood sausage.. it was rich as well and velvety smooth.. and if i dare say.. better than the pig's feet.. it was well seasoned and paired nicely with the apples.. 

for dessert... we got the poached pear.. which was good.. 

oh yeah.. i just found out anthony bourdain featured this place on his show no reservations.. i guess i shouldn't be surprised
