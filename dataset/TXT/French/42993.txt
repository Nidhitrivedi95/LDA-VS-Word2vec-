LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Wow.  That's all I can say. This place is so quaint and amazing. Such a beautiful spot tucked behind all the madness that old town scottsdale entails. The fried chicken was amazing, but the Chinese ribs are to die for. Service was excellent, not to overbearing, but just the right amount of attention. I loved that they have oshi bori hand wipes for you when you are done eating all of your finger foods.  By far, the best patio on town. Keep it up UPTON, loved every second of it.
