KZKbv0vLfW2al37QSu5ZwQ Le Sauvagine was only OK.  We were there for a special occasion while traveling. It had a very nice setting in old Montreal.  Quaint inside.  Service was spotty and the menu was OK.  Our main course was very good.  The soups were not as good.  Neither the Bisque nor French Onion had a great deal of taste.  This was quite surprising for a French Restaurant.  I'm sure there are better restaurant selections in old town.
