XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q A lot of people I talk to call this place overrated. That was not my experience at all. The multi course dinner my wife and I had here was excellent, with everything prepared as meticulously and technically perfect as a French restaurant of this calibre should. Having visited Paris on a few occasions and eaten at some of the great restaurants there, and with French food being our favorite, this place still sits at the top in my mind.
