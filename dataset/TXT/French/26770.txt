Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Oh my gosh. Just the absolute best. Went here for an anniversary celebration. It was perfect. Romantic low lit spot, with perfect seating and a casual feel. Great menu! We got an assortment of meats and cheeses with our waiters help. Nice wine and good cocktails (perfect Manhattan).
