3OCooCzHgsS2xHdN-dNVXg Very disapointed. The food was fine, but that's just it...at $40 a plate, do you really want a 'fine' meal?

Ordered the seafood risotto and it had hardly any seafood in it. It was also cooked in some sort of creamy bechamel sauce. Risotto in a creamy white sauce? That's news to me.

Service was fine. It's nice sitting outside I guess. Inside it lovely but a bit stuffy.

I asked for my meal to go and the waitress brought out a plastic container for me to scrape my leftovers into...myself. Didn't really appreciate that!
