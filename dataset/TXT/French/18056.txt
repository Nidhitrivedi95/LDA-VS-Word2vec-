A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g My updated review is from when I visited this place on 2/3 with my sister. Unfortunately this wasn't a pleasant one. Who I am assuming was the manager (older light haired woman) was yelling at the woman at the register who had difficulty finding the right item to ring it up under. Then she barked at this older gentleman who asked her what was in a dessert,  she impatiently and angrily replied "it's basically the same thing as the other dessert I just told you about!"
