50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Came here for the summerlicious menu!

Got the Poached Salmon, Pork Croquette and Camembert en croute.

Fancy place! From the way the waiters dress to the table setting with double cutlery and fabric napkins, this is great for a date to dress up for!

I sat inside as my last visit I sat on the patio. They have nice leather & marble décor (the bill tray was real leather!)

Appetizer: Poached salmon, the salmon was tender and flaky. It was covered with a tangy tomato sauce with corn

Entrée: Pork croquette, one medium sized on top of bed of diced potato on a tangy sauce. Didn't like the tang to the potatoes personally. I'm impressed that the cut of meat is one piece and that it's so tender and flaky, it's like eating tuna, and pulls off like pulled pork. My only complaint is that it was incredibly salty-- the meat, the crust, the sauce. I only ate half. 

Dessert: Camembert en croûte, I was surprised that the pastry was soaked in sauce. I'm not sure if the pastry is supposed to be crispy, but the texture is exactly like eating a microwaved croissant with cheese inside. It was very gooey, and I think I would prefer the pastry dry and crispy without the syrup.

My partner had a whipped cheese salad, burger and chocolate cake,  to which they all tasted alright,  except for the chocolate cake, it was dense and sweet to me as if it was made with shortening. 

All in all,  great for a fancy meal! They just lost a star because my entree was way salty.
