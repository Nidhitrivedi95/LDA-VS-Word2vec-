3s46-PMxoEIa7kUj0VrlXg Honestly, everything about Zibo effervesces douchebaggery. From the nauseating clientele to the utterly mediocre "Italian" food, this restaurant is l for yuppies and gross old Quebecers that dress like and think that they're in their twenties.

Zibo really turned me off, I find it profoundly off-putting, I had dinner there with a yuppie friend of mine that has very little common sense and absolutely no taste, he's a monkey and this place is stupid.

If you're in the Dix 30 area, I feel for you. It really is a veritable breeding ground for douchebags. That said, I would instead go to l'Aurochs, which is a pretty good dinner place, or Texas steakhouse, which is excellent.
