ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Decided our last morning at Paris Hotel,  to hit one of their sit down breakfast restaurants.   Initally very worried, since one of the coffee cups clearly had lipstick stains from a prior customer.   Inital cup of coffe wasn't hot.  Same with the refill canister left at our table.

Two dishes ordered were  

(1)   FRENCH TOASTS.   You get 3 slices.  came with cane sugar syrup or house syrup specialty.   Though syrups very nice, dish is nothing to write home about.

(2)  Plate with 2 eggs,  french style potatoes,  thick sliced bacon,, and toast.   bacon & potatoes are worth trying.

total cost for two about $ 36 , before tip.

If you ask me,  stay with the coffee/pastry shops for breakfast.
