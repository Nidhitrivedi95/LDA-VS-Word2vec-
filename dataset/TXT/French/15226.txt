I'll take a side of poutine with my burger, s'il vous plaît! I split a L'Hambourgeois outfitted with a ciabatta bun, subbed the salad/fries option with a side of classic gravy-curds poutine. While I'm no stranger to poutine, my stateside experience has always been some elevated gastropub reinterpretation. It was nice to go classic. The fries were deliciously crisped and held up well against the gravy. As for the burgers-- move aside ketchup-- they're dressed from their lengthy sauce list. I also got a separate salad order and was impressed by the freshness. Who raves about a salad at a fries place? This girl.      

While Saint-Denis is lined with eateries aplenty, Frite Alors was a great choice.
