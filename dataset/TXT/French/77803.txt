YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I ate here New Years Day (yeah, that was a while ago and I totally forgot to write a review!) with my best friend and (now ex) significant other to kick the new year off right. And wow, we made the right choice. We decided to go with their prix fixe menu and order different plates, that way we could all get a little taste of every dish. There were a couple dishes that absolutely wowed me. First, they started us off with a delectable amuse-bouche. It was the right way to start off the meal because from that very first bite, I can tell that this will be one of the best meals I'll ever have. To start off, I ordered their onion soup, which was amazing. Best soup I've ever had. It was creamy and yet light enough so that it won't weigh you down for the rest of your meal. Their filet mignon was so tender that they didn't bother giving me an actual steak knife to cut through it. Hahaha, they gave me an un-serrated butter knife. At first I was like "WTF, how do they expect me to cut into my meat with this thing?" Well, let me tell you, I was able to slice through that chunk of meat with minimal effort. =P Oh, and yes, it was just as deliciously flavorful as it was tender. I opted to pay the extra money to get the creme brulee for dessert. I remember it cracking ever so nicely when I first dug my spoon into the creamy goodness. After remembering that great meal I had at the Las Vegas location, I'm thinking about making a stop over at the San Francisco location. Thank goodness I'm in the bay area! =P
