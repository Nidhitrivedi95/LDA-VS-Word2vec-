ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Exceptional!  Profiteroles, house fries, pulled motz., pulled pork (4th of July special)... delicious!  We were very impressed with the wait staff- friendly, knowledgable, and attentive.  Loved the ambiance too!  This is a bistro-style restaurant with a nice bar, cozy and busy, not chaotic though.  Reserve a table!  Highly recommended!
