ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q So it came down to a choice between McDonalds and this place with a french ass name and pictures of croissants everywhere. 

Since ive eliminated fast food from my life completely after graduating from college I figure i'd take a risk and try some breakfast here. 

The menu is pretty extensive but I decided upon an omelet- with ham cheese and spinach wary that it would be the cheap eggs that terrible restaurants use. 

I however was pleasantly surprised when I got my meal- it came with a rather large croissant and a huge 3 egg omelet that had great flavor and hit the spot.

The service here was good and attentive and also kept the french façade going when the told me to bon apetit. 

The only 2 knocks on this place is the lack of refills on soda (1 dollar refills) and lack of hash brown or other side with an omelet. 

Ill be back should I have some downtime at Sky Harbor
