MxHZ5XwIQWnJFTw9gZxAIg We went to Maison Bleue for my husband's birthday. We were seated upstairs, by a window, which I enjoyed. Being 8 months pregnant, the tables were a little too close together. When I tried to get up and go to the toilet I was bumping into everyone with my belly!


 The food was great. Everything that my husband and I wanted ended up being on the preset 25 pound 3 course menu, so we both went with that and saved a few pounds. The staff were very attentive and always filled up our drink glasses, which doesn't happen that often in Scotland!


 This is definitely the place to go for a nice romantic meal with some good food.
