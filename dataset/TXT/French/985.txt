_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Le Select is probably my absolute favourite Toronto restaurant--I've gone dozens of times, at various hours of the day and it has never failed. 

Nestled on a quieter downtown street, this authentic, casual yet elegant French Bistro features a gorgeous patio and a lovely interior, complete with an old fashioned zinc bar. The atmosphere is gorgeous--such a wonderful blend of comfort and style. 

 The service is prompt, friendly but a tad formal, and very professional--the servers are always knowledgeable and very much treat the patron like a guest! 

In the winter especially, I like to request a booth at the back for a little more space as the one drawback to Le Select is that the tables are very closely spaced--this can feel a little uncomfortable when the bistro is busy. 

The wine list is great, and servers are happy to recommend an excellent wine for whatever meal your'e having. 

All of the menu offerings are delicious and are very consistently prepared and presented. Some of the items may not be for the average North American however--Although delectable, Beef Cheek, Braised Cocks Combs, etc. may turn up a few unsuspecting noses--it's best to check with guests before deciding to make a reservation based on this. I love the Fois Gras and Scallops for Brunch! The French Fries, served with the Tartare and Steak Frites are excellent.  

I really enjoy having brunch at Le Select, but it can be quite busy--I would suggest reservations. I also love a late lunch here when the bistro is a little quieter and the aforementioned booths are usually open....

As a strange bonus, the washrooms are quite beautiful :)
