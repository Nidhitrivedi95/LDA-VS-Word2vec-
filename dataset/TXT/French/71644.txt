XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w The bartender was a complete sweetheart and recommended the best food I have ever eaten before in an airport. It was nice, they had charger plug-ins under the bar, which was extremely convenient. 
The chicken with the mushrooms and green beans was to die for, and the pink lemonade champagne with vodka was amazing, as well. I definitely recommend this location!!
