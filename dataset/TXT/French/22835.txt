bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I came here with my wife and friends for a birthday brunch, which I thought would be amazing. Firstly, this place is extremely crowded. If we weren't happy to sit at the bar area, we would have had to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated.  When you get to your table, you will notice that all the silverware and bowls/plates are not pieces you can find in your local Macy's.  All the cutlery and bowls are designed to be very curved and give the feeling that you're about to eat in a fancy restaurant. The menu is fairly large and everything is pretty expensive but I ignored the prices and ordered the "Shrimp and Grits"

My Shrimp and Grits were spicy, mixed in with what I think were bacon bits, and had a few okras laid out on the top. While it was very unique in its flavors, the combination of spicy, okra-ey, shrimpy, bacon-et, and creamy left me oh-so-slightly nauseous.  I don't want to say it was bad in any way, but I did think it was made to "wow" guests rather than to actually be a delicious breakfast.  The past week I had just gone to a place in Davidson called Restaurant X which I thought was spectacular without trying too hard to be "unique" so I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed to pay more, and get a less pleasant experience. 

On a side tangent, this is the only restaurant I have ever been to that has mouth-wash in its bathrooms.

I felt that the Terrace Cafe is trying too hard to be different, and not trying hard enough to make a delicious meal. It's crowded, a bit pricey, and too experimental to be delicious, and thus I can sadly only give Terrace Cafe only 3-stars for now.
