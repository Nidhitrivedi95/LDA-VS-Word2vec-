_O12nlv3sISPfiNAQVLM4Q Food was mediocre and over priced .  This is a tourist trap.  The wait staff was inexperienced and not professional.  One of the items ordered was french onion soup, the price was 3 times higher than a bowl I had the day before at a nearby location and the soup at Alexandre's was inferior to the less expensive version.  Try Beaver Hall, professional wait staff, attentive and efficient, the food was very good and the price comparable.
