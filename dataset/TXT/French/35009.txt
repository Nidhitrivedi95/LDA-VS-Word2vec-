HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw The view is great. The food is pretty good.. We had a groupon and got the french onion soup and steak frites. The soup was far too sweet, I didn't like it at all. The fries were amazing!! And their garlic dip they served with it was awesome too. The steak however tasted like a cheap cut to me, and it was slightly over cooked because I ordered it medium rare. The waitress noticed and asked if I wanted them to throw on a new one without me even asking - but I didn't feel like waiting or doing that to the kitchen so I just dealt with it. So the service is good!! The cocktails were pretty good but very pricey. Ouch!! Strip pricing of course. The bread and butter was awesome but I don't think I would go back. With our groupon we still spent $130 - ouch!! It probably would have cost the same price without it.
