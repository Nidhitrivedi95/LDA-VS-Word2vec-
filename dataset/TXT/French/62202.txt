SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Just returned from a pleasant dinner; the service was attentive but not overly so, and overall we had a good time. The Short Rib was immaculate, and the Duck Breast (get it Med Rare) was done perfectly. The one downside was the Seared Ahi - it came in a bowl just piled on top of noodles drenched in salty soy sauce (the "broth") which overwhelmed the dish. 

They have a good and eclectic wine list with pretty good prices. We ate inside due to the chilly night and were taken care of, even offered dessert on the house to make up for the Ahi dish.

I look forward to our next visit!
