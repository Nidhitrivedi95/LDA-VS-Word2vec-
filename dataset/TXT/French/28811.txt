eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Went here with my girlfriend on Dec 30th. It was excellent. One of the best restaurants I have ever been to. 

Interior of the restaurant was nice, clean, new. 
I ordered the salmon and it was cooked perfectly. The vegetables were also cooked perfect and everything tasted great. I was expecting the portion sizes to be smaller but they actually were decent. 

I also ordered a dessert which was essentially samples of multiple desserts. All were great! The chocolate fudge cake and cheesecake might've been the top 2 but even the sorbets were very tasty. 

My only critique was that the beer menu was very small and that some of the workers seemed a bit smug. But enjoyed Bonaparte very much. Would absolutely recommend and return if visiting Montreal.
