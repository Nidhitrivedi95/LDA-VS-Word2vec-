The quality of the food is good and I always trust the wait staff to guide our choices for menu items.  I have dined in the main room a few times and had all out feasts, which were expensive but not over the top, and my guests were always very happy with the evening.  I have also gone there to have a few drinks at the bar and ordered some apps, and that too was always well received.
