oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Excellent service, valet parking, good start!!! Had the tasting menu with 12 courses. Every dish is prepared with attention, delicate and wonderful presentation. The taste is very good too;)
The only reason this restaurant did not get its 5 stars is because on the ambiance, a bit stuffy and boring for me...however perfect for business dinner or a very romantic quiet evening..its worth trying it out!!! The food and service are excellent!
