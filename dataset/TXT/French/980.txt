I had the goat cheese and beat salad, looking for a healthier, cleaner option, and what I actually got was a pile of beets, shredded leaves, and salt. The goat cheese was in a tiny pile on top of the lettuce, and then, melted on top of my salad was the saltiest cheese I have ever tasted (& this was not listed on the menu). As cheese is one of my favourite indulgences, I am very saddened to say that it completely ruined the salad for me. All I could taste was salt.

Dessert, on the other hand, was the opposite yet same experience: my lemon tart tasted like pure sugar. It was so disgustingly sweet, topped with some kind of caramelized sugar (also not listed on the menu), and the crust honestly tasted as though it had been frozen- so dense and kind of chewy.

The only thing that saved my evening was our server; she offered great service and made sure that my water glass was constantly refilled as I drank many glasses to counteract my salt salad.
