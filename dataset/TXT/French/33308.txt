hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA This place is AWESOME! Recommended to me by a regular at my work. I am a VERY picky eater. I can only eat certain things. I have a very low tolerance to preservatives and so my diet is tailored to that. Because of this I rarely eat out. I finally found a place I can go to! Thanks Olivier! 

Their soups (made from scratch daily) are out of this world. Their salads might not look like much but by the time you're finished with one you're stuffed. Their sandwiches and paninis are to die for. All in all if you can appreciate simple, fresh food that isn't over seasoned and over processed, check this place out!
