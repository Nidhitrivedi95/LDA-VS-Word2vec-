xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w i came to this cute, upscale cafe for early lunch on a friday, and loved everything about it. the environment, service, and of course, the food! my date and i ordered the roasted tomato and spinach dip to start, and then a pound of mussels (each...) with the brugge frites.

i probably could've been full and finished eating just after the dip, but the mussels... the mussels were just sooo good. we finished them alllll, along with the frites. and of course, frites are always delicious (but i would say that the pomme frites i've gotten back in new york were better).

i'd imagine this place gets pretty busy, but i had no trouble on a friday afternoon!
