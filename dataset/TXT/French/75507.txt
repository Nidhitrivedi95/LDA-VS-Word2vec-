Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng What to try??

Their famous chocolate chip cookies!! 

Comes in two choices: the chocolate chip or the chocolate chip and walnut. I usually get walnut one because I like the extra crunch but the chocolate chip one is just as good. Mmmmm...especially when it's freshly out of the oven and the chocolate chip is still oozing out, the cookie has a crunch but soft inside and it comes in a good chunky size. 

Their other baked goods are good too like the devils mini chocolate cake but le Gourmand, they are well known for their chocolate chip cookies. Everyone who is a fan of this cafe is well aware of that. :)

Last tip?

It can be easy to Miss this place because it's next to a convenience store but don't forget about remembering this might be a good choice to come for breakfast or a weekend brunch!
