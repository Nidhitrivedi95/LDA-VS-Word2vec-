rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A First off this place is hard to find - bit of a maze within Venetian hotel.   Having said that I liked the place and the service.  All good so far.  I ordered the daily special Rack of Lamb and wife ordered a steak.  Although I am not normally a big Lamb eater, but few good place where I lamb (mostly in UK) it was fantastic, so I was expecting a similar experience.  Once it was served, the gamey smell was so strong I actually didn't even feel like putting my folk into it.  The taste was much more gamey than the smell.  They took it back and cooked it more, but not much help.    I gave three stars because my wife's steak was fantastic and all other items were good.  May go back there again, but NEVER will i try the Lamb there again.
