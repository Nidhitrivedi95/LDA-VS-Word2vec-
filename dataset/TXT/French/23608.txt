cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg The service blows -- it took a full 10 minutes before anyone so much as acknowledged me at the hostess stand (and they New Yorkers are rude). The waiter gave us a very inaccurate description of a special dish for two -- which ended up being four chunks of lobster and what was supposed to be 200 grams of fois gras -- but instead it was a mess of over-salted pasta covered in cheese for $70. It looked like cat food. And they made us wait 20 minutes in between courses. 

The poutine with fois gets smaller every year. Way over-hyped and over-priced.  Check out L'Express for really well-prepared food for that kind of money. Dinner for two with wine came to $200 and we took barely took two bites out of our main, but no one asked how it was and then the waiter did nothing about it, charged us anyway. Certainly won't be going back.
