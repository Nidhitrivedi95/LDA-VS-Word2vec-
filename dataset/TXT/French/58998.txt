rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Absolutely fantastic, one of the best (and priciest) meals i have ever had. 
We had 2 tasting menus and shared everything so we got a taste of almost all the options, besides maybe the seabass dish which was just good, everything was amazing. Service is great and attentive, they have a choice of 5 bread rolls that are all superb. If you want a special meal and an amazing atmosphere  I cannot recommend this place enough.
