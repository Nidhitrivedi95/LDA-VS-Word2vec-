SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ The food is unique and inventive but in an approachable way. The prices are on the higher end but the portions are good, the service is absolutely amazing (not in an overly "I want to be your best friend and sit at your table and join the conversation way" or a stuffy "I'm a waiter but I have a doctorate in steak and wine way" either...it is the perfect blend of attentiveness and candor. I will go again and again...especially if someone else is footing the bill.
