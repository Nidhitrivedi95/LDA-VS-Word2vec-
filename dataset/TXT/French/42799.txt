ljv3iah4xC1mVZMrOStOYQ Lux lounge opened 7 months ago at the time of writing, and they are one of the freshest, best Shisha lounges in Montreal. From the futuristic lighting to the beautiful landscape of the Montreal skyline, this place is everything I've ever wanted out of a shisha joint.

If you're serious about your Shisha, you know starbuzz. They carry starbuzz flavors, so knock yourself out. Their Shisha pipes are excellent quality, many are imported from Turkey and Egypt for your smoking pleasure.

Note that you'll get the herbal crap by default. Go for the starbuzz if you want to avoid a buzz kill.

Lux lounge has really friendly staff, too. They get your Shisha lit and started and check up on it from time to time.

Excellent tea, by the way, we all enjoyed it.

They also have a full bar, which is a bit of a rarity at Shisha lounges, so another plus point.

The music is straight gangster and very chill.

Last but not least they have something called "bitches night". We find it awesome that their staff has the balls to call it bitches night, and that's what put them over the edge to five star status.

I love the vibe here, for me there is no other shisha place in Montreal, the others are all dead to me now.

Try it out, and have a great time!
