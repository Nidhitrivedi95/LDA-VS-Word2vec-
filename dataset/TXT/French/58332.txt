rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon Bistro, in the Venetian, is Thomas Keller's Las Vegas presence. Judging from the google results and "Bouchon Las Vegas dress code" being a popular suggested search, there's some confusion about this bistro. It's relatively casual, but chic. It's decorated like an old French bistro, and the menu reflects its casual but traditional nature.

His plate: Steak Frites - pan-seared prime flat iron served with maître d'hôtel butter and frites

Her plate: Sourdough Waffles - sourdough waffles with bananas, toasted walnuts, maple syrup, & Tahitian vanilla bean butter; cappuccino; mimosa

To share:  Beignets with chocolate and fruit dipping sauces; side of bacon

The bread for the table was beautiful and fresh, nice mini leaves of thoroughly authentic and crusty French bread. Our beignets came out hot and fresh, very dense and covered in cinnamon sugar. The dipping sauces were chocolate (that may have had a hint of hazelnut) and strawberry/raspberry.

D's steak was good, though he was disappointed that the fries weren't house-made or more special. My waffles were fantastic - and the combination of the vanilla bean butter and the walnuts were really delicious. The syrup was not really needed at all, but I did appreciate that it was served warm.
