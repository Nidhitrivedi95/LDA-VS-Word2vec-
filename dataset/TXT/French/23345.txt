C6hljmEZYZw4pA0OJaFOjQ I've been here probably around 10 times, and it's still one of my favorite cafes in Edinburgh.

When it's sunny, you can sit outside (they've got quite a lot of seating outdoors), and when it's raining, you can move indoors (they've got loads of seating indoors too!).  I don't think I've ever been when I couldn't find a seat!  And they've got a variety of different seats from comfy sofas to small tables.

They serve a huge selection of teas (many of them herbal), plus coffee, brunch food, sandwiches, and desserts.  (There are 2 gluten free desserts - one is a brownie, which is really tasty, and the other is a polenta cake.)

The staff is friendly, and they bring the food and drinks to you wherever you're sitting so you can relax the whole time you're in there.  

Best of all, there's free wifi (something that few good cafes in Edinburgh has unfortunately).
