The old spot, at the outskirts of Kensington felt strange for a place which boasts such a traditional french menu. The open concept kitchen is great, and gives the place an exciting and intimate feel. The tables and chairs seem kind of cheap, as if they were going for rustic but ended up ghetto instead. But the reason you go is for the food.

We had the pheasant to start which was succulent and full flavored. We then both had steak frites, and this is where the place shines. I'm not sure if it's grilled or pan seared in cast iron (the more traditional method) but it's damn fine and the shoestring fries are delish. 

It was a fun night, and apart from some gentleman who seemed to want to play romantic guitar (read: my absolute nightmare) it was perfectly pleasant experience. The only 'but' to all this is that for the price - it could be better.
