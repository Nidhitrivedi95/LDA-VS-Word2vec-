nhl7ZnypDgDESAedF2O6ZQ It was such a lovely Saturday dinner. We were a bit earlier than most other people: right at the opening for dinner (5:30). Most patrons started coming after 7, so we were in almost  empty space. And we liked the space all right. When I've called to reserve the table I was offered a choice of Outside, Bistro, or Dining-room seating. I took the last one.

I won't talk about the details of our meals, but that was French cooking the way it is supposed to be. Very intricate but not overwhelmingly so. Excellent mix of textures and  tastes. Exquisite presentation and temperature (for example the plate with my foie gras appetizer was in the shape of a goose and was properly heated). And the service was there to match, too. 

All 5 items we had ordered and the dessert thereafter were simply superb. So if you are looking for a special French dinner and are prepared to pay certain price for it (like $200+ for three people, which is not cheap but fair) then don't hesitate to call a table over there.

Live music didn't hurt either :)  But I just noticed that online they have only a half of the menu. The whole "Chef's special" page is missing, and it had the most amazing dishes we had tried. 

UPD: And one more thing: even if you sit in the dining room you can still order from bistro's menu (we did that with excellent lobster souffle, highly recommended).
