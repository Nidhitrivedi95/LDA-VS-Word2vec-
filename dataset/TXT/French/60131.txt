sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Catnip for the Food-as-Theatre crowd. We curled up in delight at the feet of these talented chefs as they took us on a colorful, tasty, most satisfying journey through the mind of José Andrés. If you're at all socially awkward the opening act is a little unnerving. Out in the main dining room before you are spirited back into the small private é dining space, you are sitting there staring at 6 strangers, but once the drinks start flowing, you quickly feel at ease, especially at the hand of the attentive, expert & friendly service. The chefs are all introduced and as you watch the sausage made, so to speak, you are encouraged to engage, guess, ask questions.  Our favorite courses were the iberico ham/ pan con tomate surprise, the tiny pizza-inspired cheese taste, the braised wagyu beef cheek, the inspired Uni con lardo, and the clam escabeche. We both loved the flan-based dessert with bonus points for the After 8/Fresh Mint bouquet presentation. For me, the only small quibbles would be the very large orange slice in the House Gin & Tonic (rendered the entire drink as Orange Soda, though it was visually arresting) & the 1st deconstructed sangria (icy/puckering/hard on the mouth).  We were blown away by the quality of ingredient on display-- yes you're paying top dollar here, but it's not just caviar, it's sturgeon caviar. Not just truffles, French Burgundy truffles. Not just beef cheeks, wagyu beef cheeks. Not just jamon, but Iberico de Bellota . Add to that the incredibly welcoming engaged staff & it's just an unforgettable evening worth every penny.
