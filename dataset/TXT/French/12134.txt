4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Not sure what all the fuss is about, absolutely great location, however, the food was eh, the service hit and miss. We had happy hour cocktails, nice house rose champagne, beer selection was on the short side. The appetizer plate was sparse, actually served us dried bread on our cheese plate, it was less than enthusiastic. The warm olives were nice, served in a deep bowl very generous, really added a nice touch. Like I said great location. That's about all, not a huge fan.
