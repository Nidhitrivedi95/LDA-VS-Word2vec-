cNkm08qu--yjIY_NPxrS2g AMAZING views, food is pretty good, very modern decor.

Place was pretty packed, very cool atmosphere, with a little observation deck you can take pictures out of. The tall glass walls have little slots you can shove your phone in to take pictures of your surroundings.

Had the escargo, pretty rich and good. 

Moscow mule here was really good.
