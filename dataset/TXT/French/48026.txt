O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q We went here for happy hour on a Friday night. Their happy hour is from 12am to 2am and includes discounted appetizers and drink specials. One of their specials was receive a complimentary bone marrow dish with the purchase of a bottle of wine. Great deal! Their chicken skewers were about $2 per skewer and were so tender and flavorful. The foie gras was about $20 and the presentation was lovely. It was served with tiny fruit that was meant to intensify the flavor of the foie gras. Its a great nearby spot to go to if you live in the southwest area.
