rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here with a co-worker while we had time to kill before we had to head to the airport. We were in town for a work conference. The service wasn't very good to be honest for being such a fancy brunch location. We ordered a side of beignets which were just ok, I had an eggs Benedict and my co-worker had a scramble. Would I come here again? Probably not.
