0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g This is my "100th" review on yelp ,and I would like to write about Picasso! Because it's a such special restaurant which truly wins 5 stars on my yelp book. I came here with my husband to celebrate my birthday. As soon as I walked in, I fell in love with romance and beauty of flower decoration and view of Bellagio fountain. Our waiter told me Picasso spent $40k every month on these fresh elegant flowers! Picasso only offers prefixed menu. ( no a la carte) I had winter truffle tasting menu ($250), and my husband had tasting menu ($135). Omg! I was really blew away how awesome our food was. Every single bite of my truffle dishes wowed me. My mouth was full of truffle aroma after each bite. I've never had so much truffle in one meal before. Lamb chop and seared foie gras from my husband's tasting menu were cooked "perfectly"! (in flavor n presentation) However, desserts here were kind of weak. I was expecting better from 2 star Michelin restaurant. Our waiter was really really friendly and knowledgeable. He noticed I had iphone and professional camera on my table since we seated. He asked me if I would like to get pictures with my hubby. I told him we are here to celebrate bday and it would be great. Our waiter insisted to take my profession camera and took pictures from all different angles in main dinning room for us. He also told me Picasso is very picture friendly. I can feel free to take picture with any art masterpiece of Picasso on my way out. I had such wonderful night here. Thank you Picasso for making my night so special!!!
