utYpyFOjNisHl1h7lDGSGA Oh, friggin' brilliant.

This was a complete I-just-walked-past-and-this-looks-interesting-let's-check-Yelp-which-had-good-reviews-so-I'll-book-lunch-here-tomorrow-'cause-I-wanna-try-this-place experience. And I was not disappointed.

Had snails for starters, pig cheek casserole for main, and sticky toffee pudding for pudding. 

My other friends had the fish of the day (HUGE portions) and the rabbit casserole - all were fantastic. One of them also had the mussels in a blue-cheese kind of sauce... OMG it was amazing, just simply brilliant.

OMG the food was amazing, and the service brilliant. This place could easily become one of  my favourites. Highly recommended.
