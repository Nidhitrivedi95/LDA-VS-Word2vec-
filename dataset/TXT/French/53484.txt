QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g This is an interesting and welcome addition to South Side's restaurants. It's small and casual and serves up some amazing food all around the concept of offering various street food from around the world. The best and most delicious surprise were the chicken confit wings, which were the best I've ever had. They're not Buffalo wings and they're not messy. They are big and tender, with the meat practically falling off the bone and a delicious taste that still has me craving them days later. The small plates all sound so good that we opted to share several rather than fill up on a sandwich and fries. The sandwiches sounded great as well and I'll surely be back to try some out -- as well as more small plates. I do wish that the sandwiches didn't come with fries so that more small plates could be devoured instead. We also tried the chicken samosas (delicious with their dill sauce), the lobster crepe (succulent!) and the tostada with lime chicken and avocados (the least impressive dish that we tried, but delicious nonetheless). Another standout starter was the artisan cheese, which paired three interesting cheeses that were all quite different from one another along with some other goodies including unique pinot grigio gellee cubes. The service is attentive yet appropriately casual. The decor and furnishings are somewhat minimalist yet comfortable. There is a table in each of two windows facing Carson Street, a bar on one side and tables on the other. In a bit of whimsy given the name and concept of the restaurant, the side of each table bears a street sign with the name of one of the neighborhood's streets, which have their own awesome backstory. My only gripe is that the wine and beer list could stand to be a bit more robust. I can understand keeping the wine options down with open bottles (for by-the-glass), but given the worldly nature of the food, more bottled beer options would be in order.
