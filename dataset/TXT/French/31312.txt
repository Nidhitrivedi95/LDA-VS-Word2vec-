gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw Wow!  My wife and I kept putting off going Vila Algarve to eat because of the mixed reviews, we are very sad that we put it off. We lived in the Azores for 19 months and are very familiar with Portuguese food, we were not disappointed by the experience. First of all we were greeted at the door by Luby and shown to a great table. Our server did a great job of explaining things on the menu and pointed us in the right direction. We started out with a bottle of Vinho Verde and two appetizers; halloumi cheese and grilled calamari.  What a great start!  For our entree, we shared the Bacallau Assado and the grilled scallops. The cod fish was amazing with a little drizzle of balsamic vinegar and the scallops we the best I have ever had. Seriously, the scallops were like butter they were so rich and delicate. For desert we shared the flour less walnut chocolate cake and coffees (meia de leite and espresso). Everything was fresh and delicious. The service was stellar. More people owe it to themselves to try the amazing restaurant. Do not expect fast, American style food. This is pretty authentic Portuguese/European style dining. Slow down and enjoy Vila Algarve, you will be glad you did!
