USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Great restaurant with an awesome wine list that's reasonably priced.  VERY friendly service with delicious food.  I had the Foie Gras, Caesar salad (perfect portion), Elk and a cheese plate.  Every course was awesome and was perfectly paired with a delicious bottle of Nickel & Nickel cab.  Did I mention they have an extensive wine list (not so big for Italian)?

Will definitely go back when in Charlotte and will most likely have the same exact meal (but the lamb, veal and Rib eye were on my target list too).
