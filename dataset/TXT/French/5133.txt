Essentially there are only 2 options on the menu, either the 5 course for ($65), or the 7 course tasting for ($85). 
The food was good, but i wasn't wow-ed. What I didn't like was all the dishes were very fish focused (3 of the 7), and they weren't much of my liking except for the first course, yellow tail sashimi - very refreshing and flavorful. Second course was the mushroom which was my favorite dish of the night - tiny diced king oyster mushroom mixed in with flavorful dressing. Third course were shrimps, the meat was cooked perfectly, really soft. Fourth course was salmon with asparagus, this was just okay for me - the salmon was a bit overcooked for my liking. Fifth course was a fried cod, but the cod was soggy being served in the sauce. Sixth course was a veal served with sausage and short rib. The short rib pieces were really tough. The veal was good but nothing special. Surprisingly from that dish I liked the sausage the most. Last course was dessert, some kind of sorbet like ice cream served on top of Mascarpone cheese.

One thing that bothered me slightly was our waiter didnt explain our dishes with much detail unlike the other waiters. When I asked him what the main difference between the 5 and 7 course is (in regards to the food options), he couldn't even say....but he's been serving these dishes all night right?
Regardless i enjoyed my experience here. Be prepared for a 3 hour dining if you go for the 7 course tasting.
