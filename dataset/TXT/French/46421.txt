Nij88g6JtqIHmg4-FzZSgw This is a nice establishment in a very quiet and upscale part of town.  I visit Dupont and Dupont often as its 5 minute driving distance away from where I live. 

The coffee is rich and fresh made daily. The staff are friendly, polite and professional. All of the bake goods are made fresh daily and taste great.  They have sandwiches, salads and soups - all fresh and made daily and satisfy the appetite. 

In the summer they have a patio where you can sit to enjoy your favorite beverage, meal or desert in a beautiful setting. They provide daily newspapers and magazines, in both languages, to read.

What we love about this place is that its a great go to place where you can bring a friend, a business associate or anyone else and enjoy a good meal, good beverage under a wholesome enviroment and converse in a relax setting.  

We found also that the prices are not cheap nor expensive, but are reasonable for what your buying. 

Oh, and one last thing, if you never tried their assorted breads and baguettes, you don't know what your missing, you have to try them.  Simply awesome and delicious. 

Yes, we definitely would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys the finer things of life - good food and drink.
