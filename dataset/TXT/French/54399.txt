rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw You can never go wrong with Michael Mina or Aria.  Although I had trouble deciphering the menu, the food was wonderful.  The ambience was great.  The place is beautiful. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I loved the French onion soup and would definitely return for the giant chocolate macaron.
