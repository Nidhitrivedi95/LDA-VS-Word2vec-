We went for lunch and had a wonderful meal - and one that was honestly too much food for 2 people. We got 1 savory and 1 sweet crepe and we could barely finish the sweet one (though we did it was so good).

~ Caramelized Pear $10.25 caramelized pears, raisins, maple syrup, candied hazelnuts & chantilly cream. This was wonderful- sweet, warm, and the combination of soft pears and crunchy nuts was wonderful. One needs a tea or water to cut the sweetness after a while though. I think it would have been even better with peaches- which I seem to recall they used to have (I've been here before) but I'm not 100% sure on that.
~ Ham & Cheese $11.45 parisian ham, gruyere & béchamel sauce. WOWOWOWOW!! This was AMAZING! If you only have room for 1 crepe get this one. The meat  has a wonderfully smoky flavor and the gruyere is the perfect addition to the dish. The creamy and salty flavors mix well and leave you very full. 

For roughly $20 you can be stuffed and spend the rest of your time walking it off in either the casino or the strip!
