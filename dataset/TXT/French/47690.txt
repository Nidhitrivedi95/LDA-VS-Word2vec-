O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q The food here is great!  Our server, however, could have used a refresher course on manners.  We decided to eat here on our last day of staying at Palazzo.  At check in, we received a 20% off coupon, so why not??  We noticed the Happy Hour was about to begin...double score!!  

We were told that happy hour is either on the sweltering hot deck overlooking the strip or at the bar.  We opted for the empty bar to partake of the 2 for 1 drinks.  The menu offered one selection of whiskey, vodka, gin, etc.  My BF wanted whiskey on the rocks, she informed us they had no whiskey!!!???  WHAT??  OK...no problem, he's flexible and had the gin instead.  I'm sure VEGAS runs out of alcohol all the time...!!

We ordered Kobi beef sandwich and fish and chips (off regular lunch menu, not happy Hour selection).  We LOVED it and ate every last bit.  Just as we were enjoying that feeling of finishing a delicious meal and sipping on that last little bit of drink, the waitress's Tourettes Syndrome rears its ugly head..."OMG, I've never seen 2 people finish and order of fries before.  You guys ate everything on your plate.  I've never seen that in my 6 months of working here!!:"  By now, the bar area is a bit fuller and people are starting to look over at us!  We are not overweight or overly sensitive people so, we laughed it off and joked back, but I was like WTH is wrong with this lady???

I guess maybe there was a stray dog tied up outback that was supposed to get our scraps because I have never seen someone get so excited and shocked over an empty plate before

If you want to eat in the restaurant, I suggest wearing your thickest skin, eating only half your meal, or doing take out...
