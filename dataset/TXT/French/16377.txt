7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g We originally had dinner ressies here Friday when we arrived in Montreal. But it took us a little longer to get into Montreal than anticipated so out concierge helped reschedule our ressies for Sunday evening at 9pm. This is a BYOB so came prepared with vino. The space is small but busy even in Sunday evening at 9! That's a good sign! The menu was meat heavy. But when we told them we had a vegetarian, they were more than willing to accommodate! Most good restaurants are prepared with one or two solid options for vegetarians. Two thumbs up! We started with the steak tartare. It was delicious!!! Hubs had the Nordic shrimp salad. Also very tasty and fresh. Mains were duck magret and rabbit for me. The duck Magret was done very well. My rabbit was super tender and yummy. Onto dessert! Nougat Glacé was the bomb dot com. My lemon Curd was really nice as well! Looking fwd to coming back here next time. Our waiter was super patient with all the questions we had and took the time to explain what everything was since the menu was entirely in French. He even made some recs on where we should go pick up gourmet goodies to bring home! Merci beaucoup! Will def be back!
