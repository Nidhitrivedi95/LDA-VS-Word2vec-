A Yelp tip indicated that patio seating outdoors is available on a first-come first-serve basis. So, I made a reservation for the restaurant on OpenTable, but when we arrived since there was patio seating available we sat outside. Being seated outside gives you a view of the Bellagio Fountain show which goes off every 30 or 15 minutes depending on the time of day. There are outdoor heaters available so it isn't too chilly.

The food is standard but it isn't outstanding. I ordered a Steak Frites "Hanger" Steak. The steak itself was a good cut but it was over cooked for a medium - turned out to be a very well done. The fries were like shoestring fries and crispy and were tasty. We also ordered a Duck and Pork Belly Cassoulet. Again, the meat was over cooked. 

However, I don't think you necessarily go to this restaurant for dinner to enjoy the food but rather the view. I'll have to try the brunch next time I am at Las Vegas.
