31KfCljxlb6zRS8r00lm2w I went to this place for brunch after visiting the nearby St. Joseph's Oratory while on vacation in Montreal for July 4th. The place has both indoor and outdoor seating, which I found very nice. The waiter let us order a platter with meats and cheeses of our choice - delicious! The desserts were all very, very good too - personally, I'm an eclair person, and these were great here.
Our group of 5 liked it so much we came back for breakfast the next day. This time, we tried the quiches - the Quiche Lorraine (ham) was amazing.
Also outstanding coffee!
