htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I suggest booking via phone or leaving a message. I've emailed them before to reserve and they never got back to me. Other than that, their food tastes delicious. We ordered the chicken and waffles, udon carbonara, and the pulled pork fries. I would highly recommend any of those dishes. The waitresses were nice and attentive throughout dinner. This is our second time here and we will definitely be back!
