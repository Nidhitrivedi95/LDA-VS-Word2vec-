dizdLoOk0GMaSS_qQAuklQ Went to this beautiful restaurant (first time for me, my partner had been before several times for business meetings), and it did not disappoint. Fantastic Summerlicious menu for a good value ($45 per person for three courses).

Our waiter and all others servicing the table were attentive and friendly. Loved that they asked us upon sitting, "Would you like some water? Bottled, or Toronto's finest?"

Ambience was gorgeous (we sat in the room that had the beach cottage flair, but the other all-white room also looked beautiful). The view, once we came up the quaint freight elevator, was equally gorgeous.

Would definitely come back again and recommend to others. Bravo! This is what a good dining experience should be.
