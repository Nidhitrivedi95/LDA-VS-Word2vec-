4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went to dinner here last night with my boyfriend, the wait was about roughly 40 minutes which to me wasn't long. Definitely no complaints about the food. I love the lovely romantic soothing setup in this restaurant. Definitely relaxing as well and very enjoyable, the view we had was stunning also, we sat where the Bellagio fountain was. it couldn't have been any better of a dinner. So moving on to the orders for the night I ordered the trout, by far the best cooked trout I have ever ate so far in my life time. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned just right. I went ahead and ordered a few slices of lemon on the side just cause I find fish to go good with lemon perfectly. My boyfriend on the other hand ordered a delicious custom made pizza. He's Italian so anywhere he goes out to eat. Pizza is his thing, not to mention before dinner they served us an appetizer which has some olives, fried zucchini, some delicious parmesan cheese and they all tasted amazing one from the other. Overall very clean well set place. I recommend everyone to try this place of your a fan of the food type. It's one of my favorite and will always be.
