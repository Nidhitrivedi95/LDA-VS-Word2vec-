YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Although well reviewed, I am giving Fleur 2 stars. They are over priced for the quality of food, and they are really lacking in authenticity on their ethnic plates. The ambiance is fine, but not completely isolated from the large open hallway they are located on. It was somewhat distracting. 

I started by the tarte flambée (a French inspired flatbread). Not bad but nothing to get excited about and very Americanized. So after a first base hit on the appetizer I decided to consult yelp photos/menu to help me decide what to have next. I quickly came across the angus beef sliders which looked awesome. They were piled high with cheese, bacon, pickles, and served with seasoned potato wedges. 

So I ordered that (not so healthy, I realize!) and was supposed to receive three small beef sliders with nothing but bun and bacon, and there was a tiny cup of regular cut fries - and when I say tiny cup it as TIMY... About the size of a shot glad with like 3 fries or something. 

Upon closer look at the original photo I noticed it was over four years old. I guess they are cutting costs.  I cut their stars.
