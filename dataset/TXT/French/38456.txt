Great deal to bring your own wine, but you need to remember ahead of time.  I was meeting three others and realized I needed wine so took a walk for a few blocks to Sainte-Catherine & Drummond to find an SAQ to buy my wine at...no big deal, could use the exercise!

Regarding the meal itself, I have to say I was a little disappointed.  There is nothing specifically wrong with this place, but nothing stood out either.  The food was average, the service was good.  I started with garlic escargot that was decent enough, but not distinctive in any way.  I then ate seared tuna for my main dish.  Again, mediocre.   Price is pretty good, however, compared to many restaurants in the area,
