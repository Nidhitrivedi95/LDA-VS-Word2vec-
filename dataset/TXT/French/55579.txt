rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A 3 stars: A-OK

At this price level, one can eat a very nice meal in any city on the planet. 

So it stands to reason that with the credentials this restaurant possesses, one should eat an exemplary meal.

I will posit that the food here is average for the price, the service is adequate for the price, and that your general feeling after leaving is that there has been a good deal of  mathematical number crunching and statistical grinding in developing and pricing the menu to create a pseudo-bucolic, semi-gourmand experience while generating as healthy a profit as possible for the ownership. 

For instance, the Croque Madame. 

Everyone raves about it. 

It is certainly delicious. It comes with fries that are super delicious. 

But the components? For what is essentially a $19 ham & cheese sandwich with a fried egg, not so grand. 

The brioche, not so great. A little dry and coarse, and not quite as buttery and cloud-like as you would hope or expect. 

The ham, not so great. It lacks everything that makes a great ham. It's closer to Costco than Iberico. 

A nice egg and that expertly prepared Mornay saves the day and makes you justify the sandwich to yourself and others after you've left the restaurant. 

Is it a truly great sandwich? No. 

Is it delicious? Yes. 

Therein lies the rub. 

We enjoyed were the escargot, thought the terrine was just ok, and spent a good ten minutes raving about the heavenly fries.

 Bourdain famously commented about the fries here. And he definitely hit the nail on the head with his thoughts on the $7 fries here. They are pretty spectacular. 

Are they worth a try? Yes. 

But will $7 fries complete your life? No. 

That's my feeling about this restaurant. 

It is good, it is proficient, it is efficient, it is a well-oiled machine, it is a chain, it is a profit center, it is many things, but the best meal you ever ate, it is not.
