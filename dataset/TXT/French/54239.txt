rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Excellent food and service. Went for Mother's Day brunch on the Saturday before. Our server was wonderful. We started with some of the items off the starter menu. The pastry basket was amazing. It was like you are getting pastry on Paris ! The other were great as well. The size and flavor of the bacon slices on the American in Paris breakfast was beyond expectations
Highly recommend .
