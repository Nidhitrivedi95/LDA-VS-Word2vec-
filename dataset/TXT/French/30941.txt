fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw The WORST, most incompetent people I have ever encountered. My bridesmaid and myself have tried contacting them (3) separate times each just trying to get questions answered and also to put in an actual order. The first two times I called I was told to call back closer to the wedding, this was 2 weeks before my wedding. I called back 1 week later and left 2 voicemails - never heard back. Called again and finally talked with the actual pastry chef, who they told me to talk to, and she said Im giving her really short notice of my order!!!! Talk about unorganized and incompetent. She told me to email her what I needed after I explained everything.....sooooo then I emailed her and what do you know, NO RESPONSE. My bridesmaid had the same problems!!! Im puzzled as to how this company can have such high reviews.....my guess is they pay Yelp to remove the negative reviews. AVOID FRENCH GROCERY at all cost!!! I will NEVER go to them for anything again!
