4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The only restaurant in Vegas that my husband and I are allowed to "repeat" on our visits! We have gone for brunch and dinner numerous times and we think everything we have tried is great. My husband is more of a steak guy (naturally!) and this is the only restaurant that's ever served him a chicken dish that he couldn't stop raving about. We are going to Chicago this weekend and it turns out there is a Mon Ami there too... we already have a reservation for Friday! :)
