t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA This place was just all around awful. Super gimmicky and tacky with awful food. I had the chicken tagine and it tasted like no frills quality meat boiled in cinnamon water. It was obvious that it hadn't been cooked in the tagine as the tagine was stone cold when it came out. My partner had the lamb tagine and it was no better. It tasted like it had been made a week prior and microwaved. 

The starter was their "signature maftoul" which was beyond strange. It was beef wrapped in a spring roll type wrapper smothered in a heavy chipotle mayo--nothing morrocan about it. It had no redeeming qualities. My girlfriend had the hummus which wasn't too bad and came with really tasty olives.

Dessert for me was a lemon tart that looked and tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck. My partner had a watermelon salad that was soaked in an ungodly amount rose water with pieces of melon rind in it. 

To top it all off there was awkward belly dancing through the whole meal. I'm not super keen on having someone belly dance right in front of me while I'm trying to eat but maybe I'm weird. Had I known there was a "show" I never would have came here. The only thing I'll give credit for is that our server was great. Since he never asked how the food was I assume he knows it's terrible. This is bar none the worst meal I've had in Toronto and it cost me $150.
